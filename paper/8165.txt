Introduction

        With 65 percent of U.S. households owning their own homes at a given point in time and a

higher percentage owning a house at some point during their lifetimes, the tax treatment of owner-

occupied housing is one aspect of the tax code that affects many people’s daily lives. It is not surprising

that it is well studied in many aspects. The mortgage interest and property tax deductions, in

conjunction with the non-taxation of imputed rent, reduce the cost of owner-occupied housing relative

to other investments [Hendershott and Slemrod (1983), Poterba (1984)], encourage home ownership

and higher housing consumption [Rosen (1979), King (1980), Henderson and Ioannides (1989)], and

perhaps even lead to overinvestment in the asset class [Mills (1987), Feldstein (1987)]. The subsidy

may raise house prices [Capozza, Green, and Hendershott (1996), Bruce and Holtz-Eakin (1998),

Sinai (1998)] and encourage suburbanization [Gyourko and Voith (2000)]. The tax treatment of

owner-occupied housing also favors high-income people or those who own expensive houses [Poterba

(1992)], and its potentially substantial contribution to families’ net worth has proven to be a political

sticking point to eliminating it in any flat tax proposal.

        Despite the considerable attention paid to the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing, little is

known about the geographical distribution of this subsidy. However, since housing markets are

inextricably tied to a physical location, knowing how the tax subsidy varies spatially is important to

determining the effects of a change in the tax code. At the least, it is important to consider the extent to

which some areas of the country receive a greater share of the annual flow of tax code-related benefits

to owner-occupied housing, both to see if resources are flowing from some locations to others and to

determine if some areas might be more sensitive to a policy change. In addition, the spatial distribution


                                                        1
may provide some insight into the political economy of changing that tax provision.

        In this paper, we take a first step in answering the larger question of what the economic impact

of changing the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing would be by documenting where the tax

benefits flow spatially, both within and across states and within and across metropolitan areas. We

calculate the value of the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing as the difference in taxes currently paid

by home owners and the taxes they would pay if the tax code treated them like landlords. Unlike the

current code, such tax treatment would not provide a preference for investing in one’s home relative to

other assets.

        While our focus is on how much the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing would decline in

some areas relative to others if neutral taxation of owner-occupied housing were introduced, we also

discuss the possible ranges and magnitudes of the effect on house prices or user costs of owning.

However, we do not measure the redistributive effects of other tax benefits, tax expenditures, or the

progressive income tax. While these other aspects of the tax code are certain to redistribute income

spatially in ways that may offset or augment the effects of the tax subsidy to home ownership measured

here, we believe it is most appropriate to view the effects of each feature of the tax code in isolation.

We also do not consider general equilibrium effects associated with the possibility that reducing the

subsidy to owner-occupied housing may lead to a decline in house values. This outcome would reduce

the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing further since the opportunity cost of equity would be lower.

        Using 1990 Census tract-level data, we estimate the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing for

the nation as a whole to be quite large, almost $164 billion in 1989, corresponding to $2,802 per home

owner and $1,815 per household. The bulk of the subsidy’s current benefits flow to a relatively few


                                                     2
owners. For example, the census tracts containing the top 10 percent of the country’s owners in terms

of subsidy flows receive 34 percent of the aggregate gross subsidy and the top half of owners receive

nearly 80 percent.

        The subsidy also turns out to be highly skewed spatially. In only 12 cases does a state’s share

of the aggregate subsidy exceed its share of the nation’s owner-occupied housing units. California alone

reaps $41.5 billion, or 25 percent, of the gross benefits under the program while being home to only 10

percent of the owner-occupied units in the country. The program also effectively transfers just over $18

billion from census tracts in cities to those outside cities. This aggregate result is driven by a relatively

few states, including California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, where the

suburbs reap much greater tax benefits than the state’s cities. In over half the states, the imbalance tilts

in the other direction, with city tracts having larger tax benefits than suburban tracts, although the

disparity in these states is smaller.

        Spatial variation and skewness becomes even more apparent when we analyze benefits across

metropolitan areas. Only ten percent of metropolitan areas receive more than the national average

subsidy per owner-occupier. Most of these areas lie along the California coast and Amtrak’s Northeast

Corridor running from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA. Even among this small group of areas, benefit

flows are highly concentrated. When program costs are accounted for by assuming the program is self-

financed via lump sum payments made by each household, we find that owners in just three large

Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs) – Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, New

York-Northern New Jersey, and San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose – receive just over 75 percent of all

positive net benefit flows measured at the metropolitan area level.


                                                       3
        The spatial distribution of benefits within metropolitan areas can be skewed as well, although

this varies considerably across areas. In many metropolitan areas, especially the smaller ones away

from the two coasts, benefits tend to be relatively evenly distributed across owners. In contrast, in a

number of the larger metropolitan areas, the top quarter of owners receives 70 percent or more of the

total subsidy flowing to the area. The intra-metropolitan area spatial distribution of benefits also differs

considerably across areas. In some places such as the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City CMSA,

the tracts receiving the highest benefit flows tend to be concentrated in a relatively few, almost

exclusively suburban jurisdictions. In other areas, such as the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County

CMSA, the top subsidy recipient tracts are more widely distributed across the region, with a good

number within the city of Los Angeles itself.

        The economic implications of these results for any change in the current tax code depend upon

whether or not the subsidy is capitalized into land prices. If it is fully capitalized, eliminating the subsidy

will not affect the user cost of owning, but there would be significant wealth effects for many owners.

Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the perpetuity value of the subsidy amounts to about a

fifth of property value on average in the United States. While we presume the savings associated with

eliminating the subsidy would be redistributed in lump-sum fashion, the net wealth effect still is likely to

be significant in many areas. For example, there are twenty metropolitan areas, including many densely

populated ones centered around Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San

Francisco, for which the present value of the subsidy flow is greater than 25 percent of house values.

        If the elimination of the tax subsidy is not capitalized into land prices, the user cost of ownership

must rise. Our calculations suggest that the increase would amount to between 3 and 5 percent of


                                                       4
annual household income in about three-quarters of the nation’s metropolitan areas. However, in about

10 percent of metropolitan areas, including many in California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, the rise in

user costs would amount to 10 percent of income or more. On the other hand, our analysis indicates

that returning the savings from eliminating the subsidy as a lump-sum refundable credit would more than

offset the user cost increase in most areas, even assuming households do not reduce their housing

consumption in response.

        Finally, it is noteworthy that our findings are not simply a reflection of the progressivity of the tax

code. One would expect benefits to be skewed towards high income households under a progressive

rate structure, and if these households live close to each other that could account for the spatial patterns

we identify. However, high income, high tax bracket owners tend to reside in disproportionately

valuable homes so that the tax code is interacting with housing consumption to provide an extremely

skewed subsidy distribution. Stated differently, while high income owners certainly do pay a large share

of taxes, they receive an even larger share of this program’s benefit flows.

        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In the first section, we describe the tax

subsidy to owner-occupied housing and how we measure it. Section two reports our results, beginning

with an analysis of how this tax program redistributes income across states and moving through

progressively smaller geographies before concluding with a description of the spatial distribution of the

tax benefits within some example metropolitan areas. Section three then considers the economic

implications of our findings in terms of potential capitalization and/or user cost effects. Section four

provides an analysis of the factors generating the spatial effects that we identify. Finally, there is a brief

conclusion and summary.

I. Measuring Housing-Related Tax Benefits

                              Determining the Subsidy Under the Current System

         In a perfect housing asset market, the marginal home owner will invest in owner-occupied

housing until the point where the annual cost she incurs exactly equals the rent she would have to pay as

a tenant in the same property [Hendershott and Slemrod (1983), Poterba (1984)]. That user cost is

described in equation (1) and takes into account the fact that implicit rental income is untaxed while

mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible for itemizers:

(1)      RH = (1-τded)αi + (1-τded)τp + (1-τint)(1-α)r + M + δ - Π H.

The left-hand side variable, RH, is the implicit rent per dollar of housing value the owner pays herself. In

equilibrium, it must equal the cost of owner occupancy per dollar of housing value. These costs include:

(a) the after-tax cost of mortgage interest, (1-τded)αi, where α is the loan-to-value ratio on the house, i

is the mortgage interest rate, and τded is the owner-occupier’s marginal tax rate which equals her

marginal rate (denoted τint) if she itemizes and equals zero otherwise; (b) the after-tax cost of property

tax payments, (1-τded)τp, with τp the effective property tax rate; (c) the after-tax opportunity cost of

investing equity in the house rather than in some other investment at rate of return, r; this is given by (1-

τint)(1-α)r and is a cost to all owners, whether they itemize or not;1 (d) annual maintenance costs per

unit of housing which are given by M; (e) the cost of true economic depreciation per unit of house which

is assumed to occur at rate δ; and (f) any annual appreciation in the house value, Π H, which reduces the




         1
          This notation assumes that the opportunity cost of tying up equity in a house is foregoing taxable returns.
If the home owner were to invest in a tax-exempt asset instead, we assume the return would be (1-J)r rather than r,
yielding the same after-tax return. To the extent that the home owner has a lower tax rate than the marginal investor in
municipal bonds, her opportunity cost of equity would be less than (1-J)r.

carry cost.2

          The components of the subsidy to owner-occupied housing can be highlighted by comparing the

current tax treatment to that under a different tax code which does not favor owner-occupied housing.

Treating the home owner like a landlord, for example, taxes the house like any other asset. Since the

home owner essentially rents her house to herself for RH, neutral tax treatment would require taxing the

implicit rental income on one’s home. If treated like landlords, owner occupiers also would be able to

deduct maintenance expenses and depreciation in addition to the mortgage interest and local property

taxes presently allowed. Making these adjustments (and assuming accrual taxation on capital gains for

clarity of exposition) would yield a different perfectly competitive equilibrium rent given in equation (2):

(2)       RH’= (1-τ)αi + (1-τ)τp + (1-τ)(1-α)r + τ RH’ + (1-τ)M + (1-τ)δ - (1-τ)Π H.

where τRH’ is the tax due on imputed rent. Grouping the RH’ terms and dividing both sides by (1-τ), we

obtain:

(3)       RH’ = αi + τp + (1-α)r + M + δ - Π H .

          Comparing equations (1) and (2) demonstrates that three factors determine the differences in

the user costs under the two tax systems. User costs of owning would be higher by the value of the

untaxed imputed rent if tax neutrality were imposed, but the difference would be reduced by the values

of the maintenance and depreciation deductions. More formally, the difference in user costs under the

two tax regimes, RH’- RH, represents the subsidy to owner occupancy under the current code and is



          2
           This specification treats capital gains on housing as untaxed and realized every year. Given that there now
is a $250,000 capital gains exclusion ($500,000 for married couples filing jointly) that can be applied every other year,
this is not unrealistic. Even in 1989, the assumption of no capital gains taxation on housing was valid for the vast
majority of households.

                                                            7
captured in equation (4):

    (4)       RH’-RH = τdedαi + τded(τp) + τint(1-α)r.

This equation measures the change in user costs, or implicit rent for owner-occupiers, that would result

if the current tax system were modified so that one dollar of investment in owner-occupied housing was

not favored over other assets.3 This is the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing and it can be

decomposed into three factors: (a) the tax value of home mortgage interest deductions (τded*α*i); (b)

the tax value of local property tax deductions (τded*τp); and (c) the tax that would have been paid on

the equity invested in the home had it been invested elsewhere (τint*(1-α)*r). By estimating these

components, we can determine the total subsidy to owner-occupied housing under the current tax

code.4

                                         Data and Estimation Strategy

          Census tract level information in the STF3 files of the 1990 decennial census for all fifty states

plus the District of Columbia are our primary data. We use census data rather than tax return data

because the census reports geocodes down to the tract level while we can only obtain state identifiers

with the tax data. Tract codes enable us not only to identify center city versus suburban areas, but to

identify specific communities in the suburbs. The added location detail is critical when examining finer


          3
          We have conveniently abstracted from how many housing dollars on which a home owning family receives
a subsidy. A change in the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing might affect house values. Since we measure
the subsidy on a per dollar basis, we exclude the possibility that there is a second order effect through changes in
house prices. This is done for two reasons. First, as noted in the Introduction, determining exactly how a change in
the subsidy would be capitalized into house values is beyond the scope of this paper. Second, any change in house
price would only increase the magnitudes of our estimates. For example, if the benefit to owner-occupied housing
were reduced, house prices might also fall, further decreasing the subsidy.

          4
          We do not intend to imply that the mortgage interest or local property tax deductions themselves create
subsidies to owner occupiers. The subsidy arises from the non-taxation of imputed rent in conjunction with those
deductions. However, mathematically the subsidy can be represented by the three terms in equation (4).

spatial distributions within an individual metropolitan area. And, the census data report most of the

crucial elements – including the distributions of house value and family income, along with certain

demographics – needed to compute reasonably accurate

estimates of the tax benefit.5

         We start by computing the distribution of household income among home owners at the tract

level.6 For each tract, we divide the household income distribution into deciles and assign the median

income for each decile to all the households in that category. Thus, the lowest-income one-tenth of the

households are assumed to have an income equal to that of the fifth percentile for the tract, the next

lowest-income tenth of the households are assigned an income equal to that of the 15th percentile for the

tract, and so forth.

         We then map tract-level information on the distribution of house values to incomes by assigning

to households in each decile of the income distribution the value corresponding to the same decile of the

house value distribution. For example, we assume that the household in the 5th percentile of the income

distribution for the tract also owns the home in the 5th percentile of the housing price distribution for the



         5
          Another possible data source is the American Housing Survey (AHS). Unlike the Census tract-level data,
the AHS reports income and house value for individual houses. Unfortunately, the national files of the AHS do not
contain state-level identifiers and the metropolitan area files only label central city status, making the Survey a poor
choice for our application.

         6
           All tax benefit figures reported in this paper are based on tract-level data that aggregates household income
across its various sources. Tract-level data also are available on seven components of income (wages and salary,
interest and dividends, social security, public assistance, farm and non-farm self employment income, retirement
income, and “other”). Experimentation showed that our estimates of the value of tax benefits are not sensitive to
whether aggregate or disaggregate income data are employed. In both series, capital gains information is missing.
Hence, the data almost certainly under report income at the upper end of the distribution. We do not believe this is
an especially serious problem for 1989 because the top tax bracket is reached before one gets too far up the income
distribution. Thus, we probably do not underestimate the tax bracket of most of the households for which income is
most likely under-reported.

                                                            9
same tract.7

         We begin estimating the components of equation (4) with each tract-decile’s weighted average

value of the mortgage interest deduction, computing the tax value as the difference in tax bills with and

without it. The mortgage interest deduction itself is defined as PH*α*i. Leverage ratios, α, were

allowed to vary by age based on data computed from the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).

A weighted average leverage for each tract was computed based on the tract’s age distribution. 8 The

mortgage interest rate, i, was calculated by taking an average from the 1989 SCF, and that rate was

equal to 9.84 percent.

         The tax value of the mortgage interest deduction can differ from mortgage interest paid times the

marginal tax rate for three reasons. First, only families that itemize on their tax returns receive any

benefit on the margin from the deductibility of mortgage interest. Also, only the excess of the mortgage

interest deduction plus other itemized deductions over the standard deduction has value for a taxpayer.

Therefore, we would only multiply the portion of mortgage interest in excess of the standard deduction

(after itemizing all other non-housing related deductions first) by the tax rate. Additionally, since the tax


         7
           This matching process presumes that owners and renters in a tract have identical income distributions.
Fortunately, our results are robust to alternative assumptions. For example, if we assume an extreme case in which all
the owners in a tract have a higher income than any of the renters, and houses are matched to owners so that the
highest income owner owns the highest value house, the next highest income owner occupies the next highest
valued house, and so forth, none of our spatial results at the national, state, or metropolitan levels change in a
material way. The spatial distributions are only slightly more skewed than those reported below in the text, though in
this case, the estimated aggregate subsidy is about 25 percent higher. This latter result is to be expected given that
in this matching scheme owners always have the highest tax rates in each tract since they have the highest incomes.

         8
            Loan-to-value ratios by age are as follows: 20-24 year olds – 53.6 percent; 25-29 year olds – 70.2 percent;
30-34 year olds – 66.1 percent; 35-39 year olds – 54.7 percent; 40-44 year olds – 48.9 percent; 45-49 year olds – 41.5
percent; 50-54 year olds – 31.0 percent; 55-59 year olds – 24.0 percent; 60-64 year olds – 20.4 percent; 65-69 year olds
– 10.3 percent; 70-74 year olds – 10.3 percent; and 75+ year olds – 2.4 percent. In addition, our findings are not
sensitive to assuming 35 percent leverage, the national average in 1989 according to American Housing Survey data,
for all tracts.

                                                          10
schedule is nonlinear, taking the mortgage interest deduction may lower the taxpayer’s marginal and

average tax rates.

        The actual value of the tax benefits also depends on certain demographic data that are likely to

affect the number of exemptions and the overall amount of deductions. Tract level data that are

available include the distribution of whether households are single, married, or single with children; the

percentage of households with children; and the percentage of households over 65 years of age.

        Unfortunately, the census data lack information on most non-housing categories of potential tax

deductions. We compute mortgage interest, state, and property tax deductions, but we do not observe

medical expenses, charitable giving, deductible interest (other than for a home mortgage), and several

other miscellaneous categories. Charitable giving alone accounted for $55 billion of the $432 billion of

total itemized deductions reported on tax returns in 1989, placing it behind only mortgage interest ($169

billion) and state and local taxes ($81 billion). Thus, these omissions potentially are severe.

        Two counterbalancing problems arise from underestimating possible deductions. First, we

would be more likely to incorrectly assume the family does not itemize. This error would cause us to

underestimate the tax value of the mortgage interest and property tax deductions since less would be

deducted at the margin. On the other hand, undercounting deductions for itemizers could increase the

tax value we do measure since the remaining deductions are applied against higher marginal tax rates.

        Consequently, we impute missing tax deductions to our census data based on data from the

Department of the Treasury’s Statistics of Income (SOI) public use tax micro sample. A modified

Heckman-style sample selection model is employed to correct for the selective observing of deductions




                                                     11
only by itemizers, with the details reported in the appendix.9 Following this imputation, federal and state

tax rates and implied tax benefit amounts are computed using the National Bureau of Economic

Research’s (NBER) TaxSim program.

         The second component of equation (4) involves the value of the deduction of local property

taxes. Property tax payments themselves are defined as PH*τp, where τp is the average effective

property tax rate. This is allowed to vary by state using data from the Advisory Commission on

Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR (1987)).10 The tax value of the deduction associated with these tax

payments then is computed the same way as for the mortgage interest deduction.

         The last component in equation (4) arises from the fact that the government does not tax as

income the implicit return on equity an owner invests in the home. Precisely what home owners would

have done with their money had they not purchased a home cannot be known with certainty, of course.

We assume that for most owners the alternative is a relatively safe investment with a duration similar to

mortgages. Consequently, we use the 8.71 percent yield on seven year Treasuries in 1989 to represent

the foregone interest that could have been earned on home equity.11


         9
          The imputation results indicate that underestimation of deductions and therefore underestimation of
itemizers was the biggest problem associated with sample selection. This turns out to be important because the
underestimation of itemizers was not random across space. In high house value and high income tax states such as
California, not observing non-housing deductions only infrequently caused us to miscategorize an owner family as a
non-itemizer. Home mortgage interest, local property taxes, and state income taxes generally were sufficient to make
California residents itemizers. This was not the case in many states with lower house values and lower state taxes.
Hence, the imputation has an important effect on the measured spatial distribution of program benefits.

         10 The ACIR did not report state-by-state breakdowns for 1989, so we use the 1987 data. We have also
experimented with assuming a 1 percent and 1.5 percent national average effective rate. Our findings are not
sensitive to these changes.

         11
          One extreme would be to assume that the equity portion of the house value would have been put under
the home owner’s mattress, earning a zero nominal return. In that case, user costs are lower under the current tax
code only because of the value associated with mortgage interest and local property tax deductions.

                                                         12
        The value of the non-taxation of the return on equity invested in housing is computed in two

steps. First, we calculate the opportunity cost of the equity in one’s home, or PH*(1-α)*r, where r is

the 8.71 percent Treasury yield. We then calculate the difference in tax liabilities between the cases in

which the family invested the home equity in taxable form and in which they held untaxed housing. This

approach accounts for the possibility that a family might move into a higher marginal tax bracket if the

return on its housing equity was taxed.

        The procedure for estimating equation (4) is represented graphically in Figure 1 which shows a

tax schedule with three marginal tax brackets. A home-owning family with no housing-related

deductions would have a taxable income (TI) of Y1. However, if they were not owners, they may have

invested their housing equity in a vehicle that yielded a taxable return which would raise their TI to Y2.

Thus, Y2 is the counterfactual TI for a home-owning family if it were to stop being an owner. Starting

with that TI, we can compute the tax value of each of the three aforementioned deductions. With an

taxable income of Y2, this hypothetical family would have a tax liability of T1. Assume that claiming the

home mortgage interest deduction (HMI) would lower TI to Y2-HMI (presuming for simplicity that all

of HMI was above the standard deduction) and the tax liability to T2. Therefore, the tax savings for this

family from the mortgage interest deduction is T1-T2.

        Although in this example the mortgage interest deduction does not move the family into a lower

tax bracket, the property tax deduction does. Beginning with TI equal to Y2-HMI, we can compute the

tax savings from the property tax deduction as the tax bill with only the mortgage interest deduction, T2,

minus the tax bill with both the mortgage interest and property tax deductions, T3. In this case, T2 and

T3 span a kink in the tax schedule, but still account for the fact that the average tax rate is less than the


                                                      13
marginal tax rate at Y2-HMI.

         Finally, we compute the value of the non-taxation of the return on housing equity. Because the

return on housing equity is not included in TI, taxable income is measured at Y1 instead of the greater

amount Y2. The tax value of not including that income is measured as the change in tax between T3 (the

tax bill corresponding to an TI of Y2-HMI-Tp) and T4 (the tax bill corresponding to an TI of Y1-HMI-

Tp). If there is no opportunity cost for the housing equity, Y1=Y2 and the tax savings is zero.

         It is apparent from Figure 1 that the order in which the deductions are taken matters when the

tax schedule is not linear. For example, T1-T2 > T3-T4, even though HMI < Y1-Y2. After adding back

the implicit return on housing equity, we compute the deductions in the following order: (a) tax savings

from the mortgage interest deduction; (b) the tax savings associated with the property tax deduction;

and (c) the savings from the return on housing equity being untaxed. We have repeated the estimation

using all six possible sequences in which the deductions can be taken. While the relative magnitudes of

the categories do change, the differences are minor.




II. Results

                                               Summary Statistics

         There were 90.2 million households in the nation in 1989, with over 61 million residing outside

of central cities.12 The propensity to own is high, with 58.4 million or 64 percent of all households being

owner-occupiers – 71 percent of those living outside of central cities and 50 percent of households

living inside of central cities.


         12
           This calculation is made based on central city designations of the Office of Management and Budget.

                                                        14
        Overall, those owners receive a substantial tax subsidy. Table 1 reports aggregate, per owner-

occupied housing unit, and per household values of the aggregate tax benefit for the U.S. The gross

value to owners of all housing-related tax benefits for the country in 1989 was nearly $164 billion (top

panel). Of this total, 62 percent derives from the untaxed return on home equity. Nearly $43 billion, or

26 percent of total tax benefits, is due to mortgage interest.13 This fraction is lower than the

approximately 35 percent of total house value that is debt financed because not all available mortgage

interest deductions are in excess of the standard deduction. The remaining $20 billion in housing-related

tax benefits is generated from the deduction of local property taxes.

        This subsidy is sizeable, even on a per-household basis. Gross program benefits per owner-

occupied housing unit are $2,802 (middle panel). This figure results from dividing the $163.8 billion in

aggregate benefits by the 58.4 million owned units nationally. The $1,815 in tax benefits per household

represents the cost per household needed to fund the program if it were self-financed. Under that

assumption, net benefits to owners on average are only $987 ($2,802-$1,815). Renters suffer a net

outflow in the amount of the $1,815 mean program cost since their tax treatment is the same under the

current code and one that taxes owner-occupiers like landlords.14


        13
          Our $43 billion estimate of the value of mortgage interest deductions overstates the value based on
computations using the SOI by about $6 billion. One reason is that the SOI calculation will underestimate the true
subsidy value since it does not add back foregone equity as income. In addition, we suspect that some of the
discrepancy is due to the fact that our deduction imputation procedure does not take account of the possibility that
taxpayers who itemize tend to have deductions in multiple categories. Hence, we probably underestimate the total
amount of deductions and therefore apply a higher tax rate to housing deductions than we do with the SOI, where we
observe each taxpayer’s actual deductions.

        14
            One might argue that the current code subsidizes renters because landlords are able to deduct various
expenses and competition may force them to pass along some of the tax code-related benefit to their tenants.
However, comparing the current tax system to our neutral one nets out any subsidy to renters. Since the taxation of
landlords is unchanged across the two tax systems, eliminating the subsidy for owner-occupiers will not affect
renters, other than by saving them the $1,815 mean program cost. The current code would subsidize renters if
landlords are allowed to depreciate income properties for tax purposes faster than true economic depreciation – and
                                                        15
         Figure 2 illustrates that the subsidy not only is large, but is far from uniformly distributed across

owners. This figure plots the cumulative gross aggregate subsidy against the cumulative percentage of

owners in the nation. The outward bow of the plot indicates the distribution of subsidy is skewed

towards a relatively few owners. For example, the top 10 percent of owners receive 34 percent of all

aggregate benefits, the top 25 percent of owners receive 59 percent of the total subsidy, and the top 50

percent of owners reap 80 percent of aggregate program benefit.15 While the subsidy clearly is skewed

in aggregate, the remainder of this section focuses on whether the subsidy also is spatially skewed.

                                                State-Level Results

         Table 2 presents data on gross and net program benefits at the state level. The first column

reports the value of total tax code-related benefits per owner-occupied housing unit for the fifty states

and the District of Columbia. There is wide variation around the $2,802 average value for the nation

reported in Table 1. The state means range from a low of $775 in South Dakota to $9,181 in Hawaii.

The aggregate value of gross tax benefits in each state is reported in column 2. This is the product of

the per owner number in the first column and the number of owners in the state.

         One way of characterizing the state-to-state differences in benefits is by comparing the state’s

share of the gross aggregate tax benefits to its share of the country’s owners. Column 3 of Table 2

reports this ratio. Only 11 states plus the District of Columbia have subsidy ratios greater than one.


if that were passed along to renters in the form of lower rent. However, taxing owner-occupiers like landlords would
not change the depreciation schedule and, therefore, would not affect the subsidy to renters. We would
overestimate the loss to owner-occupiers of “eliminating” their subsidy since it would be replaced by another one –
accelerated depreciation. However, while one could argue that the statutory depreciable life in 1981 (of 15 years) was
shorter than true economic depreciation, the situation post-1986 is more akin to one in which economic depreciation
is not very different from statutory depreciation.

         15
         Because our underlying data are at the tract level, we ranked tracts in order of gross subsidy flow and
summed across the number of owners in those tracts.
                                                         16
California is a prime example, having 10 percent of the country’s owned units and receiving more than

25 percent of the country’s aggregate tax code-related benefits to owners, for a subsidy ratio of 2.6.

Hawaii has the highest subsidy ratio, with a tax benefit share of 1.1 percent but only 0.3 percent of

owned units. South Dakota has the lowest subsidy ratio, as its subsidy share is only one quarter that of

its share of the nation’s home owners.

        These tax benefits have to be paid for in some way, and if we assume the program is self

funding, the lump-sum cost per household must equal the $1,815 national average benefit per

household. Columns 4 and 5 of Table 2 present net benefit figures, per owned unit and in aggregate,

respectively, with the net benefit per owned unit equaling the total tax benefit per owned unit from the

first column less $1,815. Figure 3 plots the numbers in column four, with states ordered from lowest to

highest benefit level. The negative values reported for 26 states indicate that the per household lump-

sum program cost exceeded the average tax benefit in these areas. However, there is not much

variation in the net negative benefits per owned unit among those states, and the biggest negative transfer

states do not have large populations. It also is clear from Figure 4 that the benefit to those states whose

owners are net recipients is highly skewed, with home owners in Hawaii receiving much more benefit

per household than owners in Pennsylvania, the state with the lowest positive net benefit.

        Aggregate net benefits to owners are reported in column five. The overall benefit to a state as a

whole must take into account the program costs paid by renters. Renter household costs are reported

in Column 6 and are based on the assumption that each renter household pays $1,815 to support the

home ownership subsidy program.16 Hence, each number in Column 6 is negative.


        16
          The number of rental households is computed as the difference between the total number of households
                                                      17
        Net program benefits in the state, which are the sum of net benefits to owners and renters, are

reported in Column 7. A positive number indicates the state receives a net transfer from other states

under the program, assuming it is lump-sum financed. There are only twelve states (including the District

of Columbia) who are net recipients under the program once renter costs are taken into account. Figure

4 plots this state-level net transfer series and highlights how skewed the benefits are even among these

dozen areas. California is the biggest recipient in aggregate, receiving over $22 billion from the rest of

the nation -- more than all the other net positive beneficiaries combined. Even given California’s large

population, this amounts to $2,211 per household and $3,953 per owner-occupied unit. Owners in

Hawaii receive much bigger transfers of $5,994 on average, but the smaller number of owners puts the

state’s net benefit at only $1.1 billion. To put these numbers in perspective, the mean annual benefit

paid to poor families nationwide on AFDC in 1990 was $4,468 according to the 1998 Green Book

Overview of Entitlement Programs.

        Texas clearly is the biggest loser on a statewide basis, suffering a negative net transfer of $6

billion. This amounts to $997 for each of the approximately six million households in the state. Other

large aggregate losers include the high population states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.

                                             City-Suburban Results

        We can also compute the extent to which the program allocates resources to tracts in central

cities versus those in outlying areas. For ease of exposition, we refer to any census tract not in a central

city as being in the suburbs.17 Differences in subsidy flows between city and suburban tracts are


reported in the census and the number of owned units.

        17
          We have performed the analysis restricting the data to tracts in metropolitan areas so as to cut down on
the number of truly rural observations. None of our findings are materially affected by this change in sample.
                                                        18
measured using the variable we term the Suburban-City Benefit Gap (SCGAP). This is computed as

follows for each census tract:

(5)   SCGAP = (Aggregate Suburban Tax Benefit Value-Aggregate City Tax Benefit Value) -
       ($1,815 * [Suburban Households-City Households])

This is the difference in the value of aggregate tax benefits realized in each area, adjusted for the average

program cost that each household is presumed to pay on a lump sum basis.


        Nationally there is a net transfer from central cities to suburbs, as center cities pay $18.2 billion

more in lump-sum taxes than they get back in benefits. However this aggregate result masks the fact,

shown in figure 5, that in more than half the states the gap in benefits between cities and suburbs is

reversed, with cities receiving more in benefits than their state’s suburbs. Of the states where central

cities benefit more, California accounts for well over half of the aggregate difference in net tax benefits

between center cities and suburbs, with other large gaps occurring in New Jersey, New York,

Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maryland. In many more states, there are relatively small differences

in net benefits between central cities and outlying tracts. Only in a relatively few, primarily southern,

states do city tracts benefit substantially more than non-city tracts.


                                    Between-Metropolitan Area Results

        Examining the distribution of subsidy across metropolitan areas further highlights how the spatial

skewness of the program benefits increases as we move to more disaggregated geographies. Table 3

reports data analogous to that in Table 2, this time for metropolitan areas rather than states. All 262

metropolitan areas that were considered Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) or Consolidated

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs) in 1990 are included. In addition, for each state, we


                                                     19
aggregated the census tracts that were not in government-defined MSAs or CMSAs and defined them

as their own ‘area’ so that there are 312 total areas listed in the table. For example, in Alaska these

tracts are termed the ‘Non-MSA Alaska’ area. Including the tracts in these areas allows us to see the

distribution of subsidy inside and outside of metropolitan areas.

        The information in column three on the Subsidy Ratio provides the first indication that the

subsidy distribution is even more skewed when measured at the metropolitan area level. There are only

30 metropolitan areas, or approximately 10 percent, with Subsidy Ratios in excess of one. This

compares to the 12 (or 20 percent of) states, including the District of Columbia, with ratios above one.

Of the 30 areas, eight are in California, eight are in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, or New

Hampshire and centered around the Boston area, two are in Hawaii, with the others scattered across

the country in large population centers such as New York City, Washington, Chicago, Seattle,

Philadelphia, and Atlanta. These 30 metropolitan areas are relatively populous, containing almost 30

percent of the nation’s owner-occupied units.

        Even when one scales the data to look at benefits per owned unit, there is a consistent pattern

of highly spatially skewed subsidies at the metropolitan area level. A relatively small, but not minuscule,

fraction of owners in a few areas are doing very well under the current tax code, with a host of owners

in the vast majority of metropolitan areas having benefit flow levels fairly close to the mean program

cost. Figure 6 reports the value of net tax benefits per owned unit. These data are from column four of

Table 3 and net out the mean program cost of $1,815 from gross program benefits per owner. Ninety

of the 312 areas have positive net benefit values for owners and contain roughly half of all owners

nationwide. Focusing on those with gross benefits of at least $3,600, double the mean program cost,


                                                    20
finds 19 areas that meet the criterion. There are over 12.3 million owners in these areas, which amounts

to 21 percent of all owners throughout the nation.

         Figure 7’s plot of the aggregate net transfer data from column 7 of Table 3 highlights just how

spatially concentrated are overall program benefits. After netting out renter costs, only 28 of the 312

metropolitan areas have positive aggregate net benefits. Only five of these areas receive strictly more

than $1 billion per year in net benefit (although Honolulu is very close). Three CMSAs alone – San

Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, and New York City-New

Jersey – receive $36.5 billion of the total $47.7 billion in positive net transfers nationwide. These three

CMSAs are densely populated, containing 14 percent of the nation’s owners and 16 percent of the

nation’s households. However, the figure makes clear just how tightly spatially targeted are program

benefits across metropolitan areas.18

         Finally, Figure 8 presents a national picture of mean gross benefit levels per household for all

262 government-designated metropolitan areas. In this figure, the MSAs are divided into quartiles

based on mean subsidy per household, with the top five percent of areas separately identified. The

darker the shading, the greater the subsidy per household. This national plot highlights the fact that the

largest subsidy recipients are concentrated in coastal California and along Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor

running from Washington, DC, to Boston, MA. Beyond these very high subsidy areas, there are

virtually no above average subsidy areas in the interior of the country. Nationally, the subsidy is

disproportionately targeted spatially towards select areas of the east and west coasts.

                                       Within-Metropolitan Area Results


         18 Scaling net transfers by the number of households does reduce the skewness somewhat. However, the
bulk of areas still experience small to modest net negative benefit flows and very few areas receive large positive
                                                         21
         We now ask whether one sees the same kind of spatial skewness in the value of the housing

subsidy when we focus within metropolitan areas. It turns out that in some metropolitan areas the

distribution of the housing subsidy is fairly equitable while in others, including many of the largest cities, a

small portion of the population captures the bulk of the tax benefits. Figure 9 reports plots of the

cumulative aggregate subsidy against the cumulative percentage of owners for a small sample of

metropolitan areas. Analogous to Figure 2’s plot for the nation, these charts allow one to determine

visually what share of the subsidy flow to an area is captured by any given fraction of owners in the

region. If the plot for a metropolitan area were the a straight line through the origin, then 25 percent of

the owners in the area would receive 25 percent of the subsidy flowing to the area, 50 percent of the

owners would receive half the subsidy, and so on. The more outwardly bowed the plot, the more

concentrated the region’s subsidy flow is among a relatively few owners. The 45-degree line is plotted

as a reference and the thick curved line is the actual cumulative distribution of subsidy in the MSA.

         Figure 9 shows stark differences across metropolitan areas. While no region’s plot is a straight

line, those for Appleton, WI, and Madison, WI, are closest. In communities like these, the subsidy is

not highly concentrated among a relatively few owners. The picture is quite different in other

metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and Philadelphia. In these areas,

typically 70 percent or more of all subsidies flowing to the area accrue to no more than 25 percent of

the owners in the metropolitan area. Generally, the less populous metropolitan areas off the two coasts

have the least skewed subsidy distributions. Coastal areas and the more populous metropolitan areas

tend to have more skewed distributions in the sense that a relatively few owners capture most of the



transfers.

benefits in the region.

         Although it is clear from Figure 9 that in some MSAs a small fraction of owners receive most of

the benefit flows, we also wish to see whether these households tend to live together or are scattered

throughout the metropolitan area. That is, beyond the distributional inequities apparent in Figure 9, is

there spatial skewness within MSAs? Figures 10-15 address this question by mapping the housing

subsidy per household in every tract for a small sample of six metropolitan areas. Akin to what was

done in Figure 9, in each of these plots we divide tracts into quartiles based on subsidy per household

and break out the top five percent of tracts separately. The darker shading corresponds to greater

subsidy per household, so the top five percent of tracts in the MSA have the darkest shading, the next

20 percent is the next darkest, the next quartile has the mid-level of shading, and so forth for the

remaining two quartiles. The key in the lower left-hand corner of each plot identifies the actual dollar

cutoffs for each group; note that the dollar amounts differ widely across metropolitan areas.19

         There are few generalizations one can make about the intra-metropolitan area spatial distribution

of subsidies. Typically, many of the lower-subsidy tracts in this sample of MSAs are clustered within

the boundaries of the primary city, although in Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County and Chicago-

Gary-Kenosha, that is not always the case. Conversely, most the highest subsidy tracts in this particular

sample are outside the city borders, although some cities have high-subsidy sections.

         Overall, the high-subsidy tracts are usually clumped together and there are smooth gradients

from low-subsidy to high-subsidy areas. In other words, we do not see very many ‘islands’ of


         19
          Because the tract land areas vary considerably due to differences in residential densities, the proportion of
the map that will be each color will not be 25 percent (or 20 or 5 percent for the top two categories) even though the
number of tracts is allocated properly.

                                                         23
especially high- or low-subsidy tracts. In some areas, such as Madison, the highest subsidy tracts form

one solid mass. In Philadelphia, the top five percent of tracts receive roughly the same amount of

subsidy as the bottom 60 percent and most of those high-subsidy tracts are located along the so-called

Main Line in suburban Montgomery County. Atlanta is at the other end of the spectrum and has a

fairly uniform distribution of high-subsidy tracts, although the highest subsidy tracts are concentrated

north of the city. In other areas such as New York-Northern New Jersey, the high-subsidy tracts are

fairly evenly distributed throughout the MSA, although still clumped together.

        Benefit flows tend to be much less spatially concentrated within the smaller metropolitan areas

such as Madison, although the higher-subsidy areas tend to ring the city, as they do in the Atlanta area.

In the other cities, perhaps due to their proximity to large bodies of water, the high subsidy areas appear

more distinct, such as in Chicago. This also tends to be the case in Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco

which are not reported here.


III. Implications: Capitalization and User Costs

        The impact of any change in the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing on households

depends upon the extent to which the subsidy is capitalized into prices. In this section, we discuss two

extreme cases -- the subsidy being fully capitalized into house prices and no capitalization whatsoever --

to illustrate the range of potential outcomes.

        To help gauge how large these impacts might be, we created two variables for each tract in

each metropolitan area. CAPSUB provides an upper bound on the possible size of capitalization

relative to property value and is defined as the ratio of the perpetuity value of the subsidy (PVSUB) to



                                                     24
tract average house value (AVGHV). INCSUB represents how much user costs could change relative

to income if there were no capitalization whatsoever and is computed as the ratio of the annual subsidy

for 1989 (SUBSIDY) to tract average household income (AVGINC).

         The numerator of CAPSUB represents the present value of the annual tax subsidies assuming

they are unchanged in perpetuity. The perpetuity value for any tract i in metropolitan area j is defined as

the 1989 subsidy value for the tract divided by the capitalization rate in the metropolitan area

(CAPRATEj), which is defined as the rent to price ratio.20 Since rents equal user costs in equilibrium,

we employ the user cost divided by house value for each tract as a proxy for the cap rate and take the

owner-weighted mean across all tracts in the metropolitan area.21 The denominator of CAPSUB is the

tract average house value. Thus,

(7) CAPSUBij = PVSUBij / AVGHVij = (SUBSIDYij/CAPRATEj)/AVGHVij

where all variables are as defined above.

         Figure 16 plots the mean CAPSUB for each metropolitan area, from lowest to highest value. In

the typical metropolitan area, the capitalized value of the subsidy for a house in a typical census tract is

around 20 percent of house value. However, the standard deviation is about 6 percentage points and


         20
            The capitalization rate used here is based on a real estate concept meant to reflect the ratio of the net
operating income on a property to its asset value. For those more familiar with financial multiples, it is akin to the
inverse of the price-earnings ratio on a stock.

         21
           To better understand this, it is useful to rewrite Equation (1) more simply as USER COSTS=(1-τ)SUBSIDY
+ M + δ - ΠH. The variable SUBSIDY is computed for each tract as described in equation (4). We use an average tax
rate defined as subsidy per owner in the tract divided by the mean housing deductions in the tract to proxy for τ.
Values for maintenance, economic depreciation, and housing price inflation are taken from Poterba (1992). These
three measures are the same across all tracts, so that the variance in capitalization rates across metropolitan areas is
due solely to the spatial variance in SUBSIDY values. The mean capitalization rate across metropolitan areas is 9.7
percent with a fairly tight interquartile range of 9.4-10.0 percent. Ten percent of the areas have cap rates below 9.1
percent, while another ten percent have cap rates above 10.2 percent. Our examination found the variance to be
sensible with the larger, more densely populated areas having the lower cap rates and the smaller and more rural areas
tending to have the highest cap rates.
                                                            25
the interquartile range for the metropolitan area means is from 18-25 percent. There are 20

metropolitan areas in which the mean CAPSUB value is over 25 percent. Included in this group are the

MSAs or CMSAs centered around Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San

Francisco, so the list contains some of the largest and most densely populated areas in the country.

Values for individual metropolitan areas are reported in Appendix B.

        Figure 16 suggests that if the subsidy were fully capitalized and the tax benefits suddenly taken

away, house prices in the typical area would fall by around 20 percent, with some places experiencing

much larger declines and a few areas being less affected. While this represents a decline in demand due

to the substitution effect associated with the change in relative price of housing, there will be a

countervailing income effect associated with the lump sum redistribution of the $1,815 per household

savings from eliminating the subsidy. The lump sum transfer makes it clear that renters will be better off

if the tax subsidy to home ownership is eliminated. The same will be the case for some owners,

especially those who do not experience much of a reduction in house price in exchange for the stream of

annual payments of $1,815. Whether the trade-off is worth it for these owners depends upon other

factors such as their expected investment horizons and their discount rates. For owners in relatively high

CAPSUB areas, the trade-off very likely will not be worth it.

        Because our measure incorporates no general equilibrium effects of a change in policy, precise

estimates of the ultimate impacts are not possible. However, our back-of-the-envelope measure

strongly suggests that the wealth effects of eliminating the tax subsidy to owners, if fully capitalized,

would be economically meaningful for the average area in America. Research by Tracy et al (1999)

shows that, even with the spread of stock ownership, housing wealth still constitutes virtually all of


                                                      26
household wealth for the typical owner household. And, for those owners with leverage above 80

percent, such as younger households or first-time homeowners, elimination of the subsidy could wipe

out all home equity if the subsidy is capitalized, raising the specter of increased mortgage defaults [Kau

et. al. (1992); Deng, Quigley, and Van Order (1996)].

        Our second measure, of the proportion of income saved due to the tax subsidy, is simply

(8) INCSUBij = SUBSIDYij / AVGINCij.

In this case, SUBSIDY and AVGINC values are available for each tract in each metropolitan area.

Absent any capitalization of the subsidy or changes in interest rates, elimination of the tax benefits must

lead to an increase in user costs. Mean INCSUB values by metropolitan area are plotted in Figure 17.

In a typical area, the annual costs of owning would increase by about four percent of annual income.

While three quarters of MSAs have mean INCSUB values of between 3-5 percent, in 10 MSAs the

fraction would be more than 10 percent.22

        In this case, a cash lump sum transfer is presumed to be received each year to offset the higher

cash user costs of ownership. Creating a ‘net INCSUB’ measure in which the numerator of equation

(8) is changed to equal ‘SUBSIDYij - $1,815’ finds that owners in the typical metropolitan area are

better off from eliminating the tax subsidy if there is no capitalization and there is lump sum redistribution

of the savings. The median metropolitan area has a ‘net INCSUB’ value of -0.012, indicating that the

lump sum transfer exceeds the increase in user costs by just over one percent of income each year. In

one quarter of metropolitan areas, the lump sum transfer exceeds the rise in user costs by at least 3.5


        22
          Those areas are Barnstable-Yarmouth (MA), Honolulu, Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County, New York-
Northern New Jersey, Non-MSA Hawaii, Non-MSA Massachusetts, Salinas (CA), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose,
San Luis Obispo, and Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-Lompoc.

                                                     27
percent of annual income. However, even factoring in the lump sum savings, ‘net INCSUB’ is in excess

of +0.027 for one quarter of the metropolitan areas. Owners in these areas clearly would be made

worse off if the tax subsidy were eliminated. These results simply reflect the highly spatially skewed

nature of the program’s benefit distribution in which large subsidies flow to a relatively few areas.




IV. Do the Results Reflect Spatial Variation in Income or House Value Alone?

        Our analysis shows that the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing is considerably skewed

spatially. However, it is not yet clear precisely what drives these findings. Given the progressivity of the

tax code, one would expect the subsidy to be positively correlated with income, a factor that could go a

long way toward accounting for much of what we have found so far. Hence, a natural question to ask is

whether the spatial subsidy distribution merely reflects the higher marginal tax rates associated with

higher income.

        The answer is no, as the subsidy distribution is materially more regressive than the tax code is

progressive. For example, if we rank tracts by mean household income and concentrate on the tracts

containing the top 10 percent of households by mean income in the tract, we find the following. The

households in these tracts pay 28 percent of all taxes we estimate are paid nationally, 23 yet the owners in

these tracts receive 38 percent of the nationwide subsidy. Thus, the program appears more regressive

than the tax code is progressive.24


        23
            The estimate of taxes paid is an output from the NBER’s TAXSIM program. The calculation is made at the
tract level analogously to how subsidy estimates are made. See the discussion at the beginning of the previous
section for the details .

        24
          The same conclusion is reached if one looks at the top quarter of households and so forth. That said, it
should be mentioned that we underestimate the progressivity of the income tax code. In the Statistics of Income data
                                                        28
         This suggests that house value, not just income (or marginal tax rate), plays an important role in

accounting for the spatial variance in subsidy flows. Because these variables are so strongly correlated,

it is difficult to establish the precise fraction of variance in subsidy across tracts that each accounts for.

However, the subsidy distribution is not merely a reflection of the progressivity in marginal tax rates.

High income, high tax bracket owners tend to reside in disproportionately valuable houses so that the

tax code is interacting with housing prices to generate an extremely skewed tax subsidy distribution –

both across the income scale and across locations within the country. 25




V. Conclusion

         The value of the tax subsidy to owners of homes is very large. In aggregate, the figure was

nearly $164 billion in 1989. It has long been known that these benefits are skewed towards owners

with high incomes and high house prices. This paper produced the first detailed analysis of how this


for 1989, the 10 percent of tax filers with the highest adjusted gross incomes paid 55 percent of all taxes. While there
are several possible reasons for the discrepancy, a major one almost certainly has to do with the fact that we average
across households within each tract. Our highest mean income at the tract level is $225,000. The SOI data show that
households with incomes of $250,000 or more paid 17.5% of all taxes in 1989. Effectively, by averaging across
households within a tract, we reduce the observed skewness in income. In general, the more heterogeneity in
incomes within tracts, the greater will be our underestimate of the progressivity of the tax code. A second likely
contributing factor is that the Census does not collect some income items that would contribute to the skewness of
income at the high end, such as capital gains. The census also top codes income.
          We do not think the differences in progressivity matter much for our analysis because even if by using the
tract as our unit of observation we reduce the apparent skewness in taxes paid and subsidies received, we think the
difference between the two is robust. Consequently, our statement that the regressivity of the housing subsidy is
greater than the progressivity of the tax code would still apply.

         25
            This can be shown more formally. For example, a plot of INCSUB against the fitted values from a
regression of INCSUB on the log of mean house value in the tract shows that high house value owners receive
relatively large subsidy flows under the current code even relative to income. Stated differently, those tracts with
high average house values are predicted to have greater subsidies relative to income. Moreover, if INCSUB then is
plotted against the fitted values from the regression of INCSUB on the log of mean household income in the tract, we
find that higher income tracts (which are high tax bracket tracts) have higher INSCUB ratios. The analogous
regressions and plots using CAPSUB indicate that high income tracts have high subsidies even relative to house
value and that the perpetuity value of the subsidy is an increasing function of house value as house value increases.

                                                          29
program plays out spatially, both across and within states, and across and within metropolitan areas.

Our results showed that the fact that owner-occupied housing is tax-favored relative to other assets

leads to substantial redistribution within and across states. The subsidy distribution was found to be

highly skewed across metropolitan areas, too, with the bulk of them experiencing small to modest

negative transfers on average, and a few areas receiving very large positive net transfers under the

program.

        How the subsidy is distributed within individual metropolitan areas varies widely, too. In many

smaller MSAs, especially those in the interior of the country, program benefits tend to be distributed

fairly evenly across owners. This is not the case in most larger, more populous areas, in which benefits

tend to be skewed towards a relatively small fraction of owners. The spatial pattern of how these

benefits are distributed within the metropolitan area also differs considerably across areas. Residential

segregation by income – in which those with the highest incomes, marginal tax rates, and house values –

tend to live close to one another is evident in virtually all metropolitan areas. However, benefits

generally are much more evenly spatially distributed within some metropolitan areas (e.g., Madison and

Terre Haute) than in others (e.g., Philadelphia).

        The implications of our findings are important whether or not the subsidy is capitalized into land

values. If there is substantial capitalization, eliminating the subsidy is likely to reduce house prices on the

order of 20 percent on average in the United States. However, there will be substantial variation in this

fraction across metropolitan areas. The impact is likely to be greatest – 25 percent or more – in our

largest and most populous coastal areas. If there is little or no capitalization, user costs of owning must

increase. Our calculations indicate that the increase will amount to between 3 and 5 percent of annual


                                                      30
income for the typical owner in the bulk of metropolitan areas. However, the increase will average a

much larger 10 percent of annual income for owners in twenty metropolitan areas, with the nation’s

biggest among them.

        These results may help explain why the subsidy to owner-occupied housing persists even though

most states, metropolitan areas, households, and even homeowners probably would be better off if it

were eliminated and replaced with a lump-sum refundable credit. Those that are worse off due to the

program do not lose much while those that benefit comprise the major metropolitan areas in the U.S.

and gain a substantial amount.

        Finally, the spatial distribution of this major subsidy program is not merely a reflection of a rising

marginal tax rate structure. While it certainly is true that the tax subsidy increases with household

income (and tax bracket), the program itself is more regressive than the tax code is progressive – and

possibly by a fairly wide margin, although our averaging across owners in a tract does result in an

underestimate of the progressivity of the income tax code.

             Appendix A: Correcting for Self-Selection in Determining Itemization Status

        The SOI data set we use to help deal with self-selection problems contains information from the

tax returns of a 96,000 observation, income-stratified sample of all tax filers in 1989. With ideal data,

we could assign the mean deduction for each category of taxpayer to the census data. However,

administrative data such as that in the SOI only reports deductions if the family actually itemized. If the

family had some potentially itemizable deductions, but chose to take the standard deduction instead, we

observe none of their potential deductions. Since only families with a lot of deductions itemize, it is

unlikely that the mean of the observed deductions, conditional on having any, is the same as the

unconditional mean (which is the value we wish to impute).

        There are two reasons why we might not observe any deductions in a particular category. The

first, which has already been mentioned, is that deductions are observed only if the taxpayer has enough

total deductions to make itemization worthwhile. The second is that a taxpayer may not want or have

deductions in any one category even if his total deductions across categories are sufficient to make

itemization worthwhile. Each factor generates the need for a sample selection correction of its own.

        Thus, we would like to estimate the following,

(A.1) Dij = α 0 + α 1*f(AGIi) + α 2*FSTATi + α 3*CHILDi + ε ij

where Dij are the deductions for family i in category j, f(AGIi) is a nonlinear function of adjusted gross

income (AGI),26 FSTAT represents the family’s tax filing status, and CHILD corresponds to whether

the family has children. However, we do not observe Dj. Instead, we observe D*j which equals Dj

under the following conditions:


        26
          We use a set of indicator variables for ranges of adjusted gross income.
        D*j = Dj if ΣDj > standard deduction and Dj > 0

(A.2) D*j = 0 if ΣDj > standard deduction and Dj ≠ 0

        D*j is not observed otherwise ( ΣDj ≤ standard deduction).

        Our imputation problem arises for two reasons. First, E[D*j] ≠ E[Dj]. Second, the sample of

families for whom Dj is observed may have a different responsiveness of itemization to AGI, so that we

would not be able to extrapolate our imputation out of the sample of itemizers. We, therefore, adopt

the following strategy. The first step involves using the SOI data to estimate whether a family itemizes.

For the entire U.S., this is done via a probit for the following model,

(A.3) Ik = β 0 + β 1*f(AGIk) + β 2*FSTATk + β 3*CHILDk + β 4*STATEk + ηk,

where Ik = 1 if family k itemizes and zero otherwise. The variable STATE is an indicator for the state of

residence. It is included because state residence affects the probability of itemizing due to differences in

state tax rates, but it should not independently affect the likelihood of having deductions in other

categories or the amount of those deductions.

        The second step in the imputation procedure requires constructing the inverse Mills ratio for

each family k. For future reference, this is labeled as

(A.4)   λ̂ (Ik) = ϕ(Xk β̂ )/Φ(Xk β̂ ),

where Xk is the vector of right-hand side variables from equation (A.3). The next step involves using a

probit with the SOI data to estimate equation (A.5) for the entire U.S.,

(A.5) Cjk = γ0 + γ1*f(AGIk) + γ2*FSTATk + γ3*CHILDk + γ4* λ̂ (Ik) + ςk,

where Cjk=1 if family k has positive deductions in category j and λ̂ (Ik) is included to correct for sample
selection in the pool of itemizers.

        From equation (A.5), we can then construct λ̂ (C jk)=ϕ(Zjk γˆ )/Φ(Zjk γˆ ), where Z is the vector

of right-hand side variables in (A.5). We estimate equation (A.6) via OLS,

(A.6) Djk = δ 0 + δ 1*f(AGIk) + δ 2*FSTATk + δ 3*CHILDk + δ 4* λ̂ (Ik) + δ 5* λ̂ (C jk) + ε jk.

In this specification, λ̂ (I) corrects for sample selection due to only observing itemizers and λ̂ (C)

corrects for the selection arising from the decision to itemize in a given category.27

        To impute to the census data, we apply the estimates from the SOI to the census data and

construct λIo and λCo values for each census family i. Next, the value for Cji, the probability of having a

deduction in category j is imputed, where j corresponds to deductible medical expenses, charitable

giving, deductible interest expenses, or other deductible expenses. We then pick a random number

from the uniform distribution on the interval [0,1] for each family. If that number is less than Cji, we

predict the amount Dji, the amount of deductions in category j, and impute it to the family. If the

random number is greater than Cji, we impute zero as the amount of deductions.




        27
          It bears mentioning that the SOI only reports state of residence for families with AGI under
$200,000. However, more than 98 percent of families with AGI above that level itemize, whereas only
28% of families below that threshold do. Thus, we assume that there is no sample selection problem for
families with AGI over $200,000 and estimate the last three steps only, leaving λ̂ (Ik) out of the
regression for these families.
