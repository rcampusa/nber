The Country Chronologies to Exchange Rate Arrangements into the 21st Century: ¸˛Will the
Anchor Currency Hold?

                                         ABSTRACT

Detailed country-by-country chronologies are an informative companion piece to our paper
“Exchange Arrangements Entering the 21st Century: Which Anchor Will Hold?,” which provides
a comprehensive history of anchor or reference currencies, exchange rate arrangements, and a
new measure of foreign exchange restrictions for 194 countries and territories over 1946-2016.
The individual country chronologies are also a central component of our approach to classifying
regimes. These country histories date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as to
differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto
counterparts. We think it is important to distinguish between say, de facto pegs or bands from
announced pegs or bands, because their properties are potentially different. The chronologies also
flag the dates for important turning points, such as when the exchange rate first floated, or when
the anchor currency was changed. We extend our chronologies as far back as possible, even
though we only classify regimes from 1946 onwards.

About the Chronologies and Charts

        Below we describe how to use and interpret the country chronologies.

                         1. Using the chronologies

        The individual country chronologies are also a central component of our approach to

classifying regimes. The data are constructed by culling information from annual issues of various

secondary sources, including Pick’s Currency Yearbook, Pick’s World Currency Report, Pick’s Black

Market Yearbook, International Financial Statistics, the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Rate

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, and the United Nations Yearbook. Constructing our data

set required us to sort and interpret information for every year from every publication above.

Importantly, we draw on national sources to investigate apparent data errors or inconsistencies. More

generally, we rely on the broader economics literature to include pertinent information.

        The chronologies allow us to date dual or multiple exchange rate episodes, as well as to

differentiate between pre-announced pegs, crawling pegs, and bands from their de facto counterparts.

We think it is important to distinguish between say, de facto pegs or bands from announced pegs or

bands, because their properties are potentially different. The chronologies also flag the dates for

important turning points, such as when the exchange rate first floated, or when the anchor currency

was changed.

        Note that we extend our chronologies as far back as possible (even though we can only

classify from 1946 onwards.) The second column gives the arrangement, according to our Natural

classification algorithm, which may or may not correspond to the official classification. In numerous

cases there are dual or multiple rates in some periods. In these circumstances, our classification

algorithm relies on the market-determined, rather than the official exchange rate. Over some periods

the discrepancy between the official and parallel rate proved to be small. In these instances, we leave

the notation in the second column that there are dual rates, but note in the third column that the premia

is in single digits. For periods where the twelve-month monthly inflation exceeded 40 percent, our

algorithm automatically categorizes these as freely falling exchange rate regimes—unless there is a
                                                 -3-

pre-announced peg crawling peg or narrow band that is verified. For the freely falling cases, the

second column also notes whether there was a dual market and how our algorithm would categorize

the regime absent knowledge of the inflation rate.

        The third column in our chronology gives further sundry information on the regime— e.g., the

width of the announced and de facto bands, etc. The third column also includes information about

developments in the parallel market premium and currency reform.
