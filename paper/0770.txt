                  Capital Mobility and the Scope for Sterilization:
                                 Mexico in the 1970s


                                     ABSTRACT


     This   paper is an empirical study of the Banco de Mexico's monetary

policy during the 1970s. In particular, it studies the Mexican monetary

authority's response to the liquidity effects of balance—of—payments dis—

equilibria and the extent to which capital mobility undermined monetary

control. Estimates of a Banco de Mexico reaction function suggest that

the Mexican central bank attempted to sterilize reserve flows through

offsetting movements in domestic credit, at least over the second half of

the decade. This finding suggests that estimates of the capital—account

response to domestic credit expansion should be derived from a structural

model, and we accordingly estimate an aggregative three—equation model of

Mexican financial markets. The paper distinguishes between the short—run

or one—quarter capital—account offset and a hypothetical long—run offset

that would obtain under instantaneous asset—market adjustment. The model

implies that, depending on the method of monetary expansion, between 30

and 50 percent of an expansion in domestic credit was offset by capital

outflow in the same quarter. The implied long—run offsets range from

50 to 76 percent. These offset coefficients indicate that the Banco de

Mexico's monetary control was exercised at a substantial cost in terms of

reserve volatility.

        This paper studies the interaction between Mexico's capital account

 and domestic credit policy during the decade 1970—1980. It seeks in

 particular to measure the offset to monetary policy due to

 interest—sensitive capital flows, and, in doing so, is careful to account

 for the potential estimation bias introduced by central—bank sterilization

activities. The empirical record suggests that the instantaneous

capital—account offset to monetary policy, while substantial, was less than

complete in the 1970s. The Banco de Mexico's short—run control of the

monetary base allowed it to attempt the complete sterilization of foreign

reserve movements, at least over part of the decade.

       Empirical studies of offsetting capital flows have concentrated

almost exclusiveLy on the industrialized, North Atlantic economies.' But

the impact of capital mobility on domestic monetary management is of great

importance for Mexico, which has long allowed relatively unrestricted

external asset trading, and for other industrializing economies (such as

Chile) which have recently removed impediments to capital—account

transactions. Mexican authorities fear that reserve inflows associated with

increasing oil exports will place upward pressure on domestic prices and

export sectors (see Ortiz and Solis (1979)); teri1L'ton, if fcaible,
could   reduce these inflationary pressures in the short run. Similarly,

Argentina experienced substantial capital inflows and real exchange—rate

appreciation as a result of the disinflation policy it pursued in the

late l970s. Sterilization might mitigate these problems during the transi-

tion   to lower inflation   rates in countries (such as Uruguay) following

strategies    similar to Argentina's.
         Broadly   speaking, the econometric approaches taken in the

industrialized—country studies of the capital—account offset may be

classified    either as "reduced—form" (Porter (1972),   Kouri and Porter (1974),

Girton and Roper (1977)) or "structural" (Herring and Marston (1977),

Obstfeld (l980a)).2 In this paper, we apply the structural approach to

the recent Mexican evidence. This strategy avoids the simultaneous—

equations bias that may distort reduced—form offset estimates in the presence

of a sterilization rule.

         An additional feature of our econometric technique deserves mention.

Along with the standard two—stage least squares estimates of the Mexican

structural equations, we present estimates based on the two—step two—stage

least squares procedure proposed by Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1981).

The theoretical advantages of the latter estimator are discussed in con-

text below.

         The plan of the paper is as follows.

         Section I distinguishes between offsetting capital movements and

systematic sterilization as possible causes of an empirical negative

correlation between capital inflows and increases in the domestic source
                               —3—

comnonent of the monetary base. We briefly review the redced—foni'

approach to the offset in the light of possible feedback from the balance

of payments to the central bank's domestic assets.

       Section II describes our empirical measure of domestic credit

expansion, and estimates a quarterly Banco de Mexico reaction function

relating changes in the domestic source component of the high—powered money

stock to the balance of payments and the government's borrowing requirement.

We find that reserve flows were a significant determinant of domestic

credit movements in the l970s, and are unable to reject the hypothesis that

sterilization of reserve flows was complete, at least over the second half

of the decade.

       Section III estimates the parameters of a small, aggregative model

of Mexico's money market and capital account. The underlying portfolio—

balance model of the capital account assumes that peso—denominated non—

money assets and covered foreign assets are imperfect substitutes in

portfolios, and allows for the gradual adjustment of portfolio shares to

their desired values. The empirical results imply that, depending on how

the increase in the money sunoly was effected, anywhere between 30 and 50 per

 cent of an expansion in domestic credit was offset by     capital outflow in

 the same quarter. The offset would have been higher had asset markets

 adjusted fully within one quarter.

      Section IV briefly discusses the extent to which a systematic relationship

 between domestic credit movements and the futures premium on foreign

 exchange might alter the results of Section III. The data reveal a pronounced

 relation between the futures premium and lagged deviations from purchasing—

 power parity. We argue that expectations concerning possible peso

 devaluation were the major determinant of the premium.3

         Section V contains some concluding remarks. An appendix describes

the construction of the data series employed in this study.


I. Steriliz at ion a nd theCp—AccountOf f set

        When the exchange rate is pegged and international capital movements

are sensitive to interest—rate differentials between countries, the capital—

account response to domestic monetary measures diminishes their effect on

the monetary base. An expansion of domestic credit, say, exerts downward

pressure on domestic borrowing costs, inducing a reduction in net foreign

indebtedness and a central—bank reserve loss that offsets some fraction of

the intended increase in the base.    When domestic and foreign securities

are perfectly substitutable and portfolios adjust instantaneously, this

offset is complete and immediate: the central bank possesses no control

over the domestic money stock.

        Both imperfect substitutability between interest—bearing assets

of different currency denomination and imperfect mobility of capital between

financial centers may afford a central bank some short—run monetary inde-

pendence. Neither necessarily enables the central bank to peg the price

level or money supply indefinitely (see Obstfeld (l980b)). Imperfect

substitutability can arise, for example, if various risks render stochastic

the perceived return on domestic assets. When this is so, the desired

 portfolio share of domestic bonds in domestic wealth is an increasing

 function of the home interest rate, and the central hani: can influence

 this   interest rate (and so, the demand for money) by varying the
stock of outside domestic currency debt available to private wealth
owners.5   Costs associated with rapid portfolio adjustment may allow
                                    —5—


 international   interest—rate arbitrage to occur only over time. Thus,

imperfect    capital mobility affords the monetary authority an independent

means of temporarily influencing domestic credit conditions. The model

of    Mexico estimated below allows for both possible sources of short—run
interest—rate independence in the presence of international asset trade.
         The offset to monetary policy gives rise, empirically, to a negative

correlation between the capital—account surplus and increases in the domestic

component of the base. Figure 1 plots the change in Banco de Mexico's reserves

against the seasonally—adjusted change in domestic credit, and is suggestive

of such a negative correlation in the Mexican case.6 But the absolute

magnitude of this correlation, by itself, is not evidence of a powerful

capital—account offset. Central banks frequently take advantage of any

short—run monetary control they possess to sterilize reserve flows. Their

attempts to divorce the balance of payments from the high—powered money

supply introduce an additional source of systematic negative correlation

between domestic credit expansion and capta1 inflows. A sterilization

rule increases reserve volatility, but can successfully counteract balance—

of—payments influences on the money supply in the short run when the

capital—account offset is incomplete. Under sterilization, there is a

systematic contemporaneous feedback from the balance of payments to the

domestic assets of the central bank. These two variables are jointly,

endogenously determined by the preferences or private asset holders and

the   monetary policy reaction function of the central bank.
         Attempts   to measure the offset coefficient —— the fraction of any

domestic credit increase offset by capital outflow over the relevant time

horizon —— have often failed to account for sterilization, and instead

view the domestic source component of the base as a predetermined variable

for purposes of estimation. Studies adopting this assumption produce

estimates of the offset which reflect the central bank's policy as well as

the true capital—account response to domestic credit expansion, but they

erroneously ascribe the computed correlation exclusively to the latter.

This   is true in part icular of the "reduced—form" approaches to the offset
coefficient, which use ordinary least squares to regress the capital—account
surplus   on the contemporaneous increase in domestic credit, the current

account surplus, and the exogenous determinants of changes in the external

asset position and the domestic interest rate (usually the contemporaneous

change in the foreign interest rate and home income).7 When the monetary

authority pursues a sterilization policy, the resulting least-squares

estimate of the domestic credit variable's coefficient is not a consistent

estimate of the offset coefficient, for this variable is correlated with the

capital—flow equation's disturbance term. The bias this correlation imparts

to the estimated offset is discussed by a number of authors, including Magee

(1976), Girton and Roper(1977), Murray(1979) and Ohstfeld (1980a).

        In the next section we estimate a Banco de Mexico monetary policy

reaction function. The results provide strong evidence that the Mexican

authorities pursued a systematic policy of full sterilization during at least the

second half of the 1970s. To avoid the bias this might introduce into

"reduced—form"results, we then estimate a small structural model of

Mexico's financial markets. This allows us to calculate estimates of the

offset coefficient by tracing the effect on the stock of net external claims

of increases in the monetary base. The structural model allows for gradual
                                   —7


asset—marlet adjustment, and thus allows us to distinguish empirically between

the consequences of imperfect substitutability and imperfect mobility of

capital. Accordingly, we report estimates of both the short—run or

one—quarter offset coefficient, and the long—run offset coefficient. The

former gives the fraction of a monetary expansion reversed by capital

outflow in the same quarter on the assumption that output and the price

level are predetermined; the latter is a hypothetical construct measuring

what the short—run offset would be if asset holdings could adjust

immediately to their long—run desired levels.



It. The Banco de Mexico's Reaction Function



       In this section we examine the extent to which the Banco de Mexico

systematically neutralized the monetary effects of its foreign—exchange

intervention. To begin, we describe the construction of a domestic credit

policy variable which summarizes the effects of a variety of instruments

available to the central bank, We next estimate a central—bank reaction

function relating the level of this policy variable to a number of

macroeconomic variables. The central finding is that a policy of systematic

sterilization appears to have been followed at least during the second half

of the l970s. Not surprisingly, we find also that credit policy is

influenced strongly by the need to finance the government's deficit, and

that seasonal variation in liquidity preference is accommodated by the

monetary authority.
                                     —8—

       To construct a comprehensive measure of monetary policy suited to the

recent Mexican experience, two important adjustments of the published

domestic credit series are required. The first involves the treatment of

decisions to monetize changes in the peso value of the Banco de Mexico's

international reserves. The second incorporates the effects of variations

in the reserve requirements imposed on private banks.

       The peso value of the Banco de Mexico's foreign reserves may change

for two reasons other than actual foreign—exchange intervention. The first

of these is fluctuations in the market price of gold. Since the second

quarter of 1976, the Banco de Mexico has revalued its gold holdings daily to

reflect prevailing market prices. As a result, the dollar value of gold

holdings    increased by more than 500   per cent between 1975 and 1979, while

physical    gold holdings declined by 45 per cent over the same period.8 A
second source of reserve change in the absence of balance—of—payments dis—

equilibrium is exchange—rate variation. When the peso—dollar rate was

altered abruptly jn 1976, Banco de Mexico experienced a substantial capital

gain, in peso terms, on its holdings of foreign—currency denominated assets.

Devaluation, like the gold—price increases, inflates the book value of

reserves.

       The decision to monetize such capital gains as a means of government

finance is entirely discretionary. The alternative is the creation of a

fictitious accounting liability that offsets the increase in the peso value

of central—bank foreign assets without directly increasing the high—powered

money stock. Monetization is thus completely analogous to an increase in

the domestic assets of the central bank, even though it presupposes a rise

in the peso value of the banks's foreign assets, It should be included in

any measure of domestic credit change and excluded when calculating foreign
                                                     —9—



reserve     changes.9

          Minimum reserve requirements for private banks were varied several

times during the 1970s, and these changes, too, should enter into a summary

measure of domestic credit policy. We incorporate them by assuming that

policy makers think in terms of an adjusted monetary base, that is, a base

adjusted to reflect the effect of average reserve ratio changes on the

volume    of   demand deposits it supports. (We                  abstract from currency in
circulation.) The              adjusted base at time t, BAtS is given by

          BA =
               t q0—B
where q        is       the base—period average reserve ratio,              the current reserve
ratio, and Bt the unadjusted base, measured in pesos.1° BAt is just the
base that would support a money supply equal to B/q were the average
reserve ratio at its base level q0

We take AMP to be the dependent variable in the Banco de Mexico's monetary

reaction function, and turn next to a discussion of the appropriate

independent variables.

          A central—bank reaction function should allow for response to a

number of factors in addition to the balance of payments. Monetary policy,

as defined by (2), may respond also to real output fluctuations, to changes

in Mexico's international competitiveness as measured by the real exchange

rate, and to seasonal fluctuations in money demand. Further, in the

Mexican case, the government's borrowing requirement is a major factor

influencing domestic credit creation. We therefore specified a reaction

function of the form:

          AMPt= a +
                      a1 (q0/q i)AFACB+ a2(q Iq i)GOVBOR+ a3p1

              + a42n(y1/y2) +
                                   .
                                   i=l
                                       3
                                           a4+Di + u1.        (3)



In (3), GOVBOR is the government deficit, p         n(ePUS/PNex) the log of the real

exchange rate, y the index of real industrial production, and Di a

seasonal dummy for the th quarter. PUS and PMex are the U.S. and Mexican

price levels, while e is the peso price of U.S. dollars.1'
                                  — 11 —




        When the central bank pursues a systematic sterilization policy,

a1 is negative. If a1= —1, the monetary authority seeks to neutralize

all reserve flows through offsetting movements in domestic credit:

sterilization is complete. A positive value of a1 indicates that monetary

policy is aimed at external balance.

        The role of government deficit finance is particularly important

in   Mexico.'2 In general, that part of the government deficit not fi-
nanced through external borrowing must be financed through the domestic
banking    system. (The Banco de Mexico, since 1955, has induced private

banks to hold a large portion of the central government's debt by allowing

certain debt holdings to serve as required reserves.)




Thus,       we expect the coefficient a2 in (3) to be positive and close to

1, reflecting the importance of the banking system in financing the

deficit.    Because public external borrowing also plays an important role
in financing the government deficit, we expect a2 to be less than 1.
          If the monetary authority adopts a competitiveness target, the
coefficient a3 of the lagged real exchange rate should be positive.
Thus, when domestic prices rise more quickly than exchange—rate adjusted
foreign prices, credit policy becomes more restrictive. If monetary policy
is   used to lean against cyclical activity fluctuations, a4 is negative.

          Finally, as the majorS seasonal influence on money demand is the

fourth—quarter    increase, the coefficients of the seasonal dummies should be
negative.

       The results of estimating the reaction function appear in Table I.

The endogeneity of the balance of payments makes necessary an instrumental—

variables estimation technique, and two different ones were employed. The

first of these was Fair's (1970) version of two—stage least squares (2SLS),

which incorporates a correction for first—order serial dependence in the

equation's disturbance. The second was the two—step two-stage least-squares

(2s2sLs) procedure proposed by Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1981). An

advantage   of 2S2SLS is that the asympotic distribution theory it   uses to

calculate   parameter   estimates' standard errors is valid under assumptions

less restrictive than those adopted by Fair.'3 But both estimation

methods should yield consistent parameter estimates in the present case.

       Initially, the specification (3) was used; the results are reported

as equations (A) and (C) in Table 1.      Both estimates give the

competitiveness term the expected positive sign, but they provide no

evidence that counter—cyclical considerations influence domestic credit

policy. Equations (B) and CD) present estimates of a reaction function from

which the statistically insignificant competitiveness and cyclical variables

have been excluded. The remaining coefficients exhibited relatively little

sensitivity to this exclusion restriction.

       The accommodation of seasonal money—demand shifts is apparent in all

the estimates, with a strong seasonal expansion in the fourth quarter.'4

The government borrowing requirement is highly significant in all the

regressions, indicating that roughly 70 to 80 per cent of the deficit is

financed through domestic credit creation.

        Equation (C) reports two—stage least—squares estimates that use a heteroskedasticity—consistent estimate of the
  pafameLer estimates variance—covariance matrix. These results, rather than the more efficient second—step estimates,
  are reported here because the algorithm for computing the tatter failed to converge after 200 iterations. The para-
  meter estimates obtained after 200 iterations were virtually identical to those reported in (C), however. For example,
  the sterilization coefficient was —1.158 and the government deficit's coefficient was 0.692.

          Most importantly, the balance—of—payments coefficient                           is negative

and has a marginal significance level exceeding 95 per cent in all versions

of the reaction function. Although a1 is always smaller than —1, it is more

than one standard error away from —1 only in equation (D).                        Thus, one cannot

strongly reject the hypothesis a1=—l. The data suggest that the Banco de

Mexico attempted to control the money stock through full neutralization of

reserve flows.

          To investigate the stability of the reaction function, we split our

sample into two sub—periods, 1971:3 — 1975:4 and 1976:1 — 1979:4.                           In the

first sub—period there appeared to be no significant relationship between

domestic credit policy and any of the explanatory variables (other than
                                                                                                     -

similar    to those reported in Table I:

                    (0.45)

These results suggest that sterilization was a more important factor in

monetary policy during the second half of the 1970s than during the first

half.15 The finding is consistent with the fact that the range of monetary

tools available to the Banco de Mexico broadened considerably after 1975.16
       We conclude that part of the observed negative correlation between

changes in the domestic and foreign source components of the base is likely

to be due to official sterilization policy. An implication is that domestic

credit policy responds to the balance of payments, and should not be treated

as an exogenous factor in estimating the capital—account offset coefficient.


   III. A Structural Model_of Asset Markets



        In this section we estimate a sinall, aggregative portfolio—balance

  model of Mexican financial markets. The model allows the calculation of
                                                          It consists of three
  both the short—run and long—run offset coefficients.

   equations, a demand equation for the net external liabilities of the

  Mexican private sector, a money demand equation, and a money supply equa-

   tion. All equations were estimated by two—stage least squares (with Fair's

   autoregressive correction when necessary) and by the 2S2SLS procedure. A

   list of the instruments used is provided in a note to Table 2.

        Both the money and external liability demand equations relate desired

   asset holdings to the expected return on foreign assets.   An important

   component of this return is the expected depreciation of the peso relative

   to foreign currency. The presence of a large, discrete devaluation of the

   peso in 1976:3 poses a problem, for it is unlikely that the devaluation

   was completely unanticipated, or that anticipations of exchange rate move-

   ments were a minor determinant of capital flows in 1976—77. Indeed,

   Figure 1 presents striking evidence that the devaluation of 1976 was pre-

   ceded by a sizable anticipatory outflow of capital.

        To capture the impact of exchange rate expectations, we used the

   premium on three—month peso futures as an explanatory variable in our

   empirical equations.17 This premium does reflect the anticipation of a
                                           —15--




devaluation for several quarters preceding 1976:3, but was always substan—

tially smaller than the realized devaluation.

     Each equation is now discussed in turn. At the end of the section,

the implied offset coefficients are calculated.

1.   Net foreign liabilities

     We assume that the real peso value of the desired stock of net

external liabilities, eFd/PMex, may be written as a function of domestic

and foreign interest rates, domestic real income, and domestic real

wealth:

     eFd
     PMex
            =   (r,   r* +   f,   y, W/PMex) + u2.                            (4)



In (4), r is the domestic interest rate, r* the foreign rate, f the pre—
                                                              18
mium on peso futures, and W nominal Mexican wealth. We assume that

Mexican participants comprise a sufficiently small share of the world

financial market that the foreign interest rate may be taken as exogenous.

In addition, we assume that foreign holdings of peso—denominated assets

are negligible, so that we may ignore the effects of foreign income and

wealth. To incorporate the           possibility   of imperfect capital mobility,

we suppose that agents need not adjust portfolio shares instanteneously

to their full optimum level, but instead succeed in making a fraction

 A of the adjustment each period. Thus,


     eF/PMex —
                  e_1F_1/PMex.1
                                      =   A(eFd/PMex — e_1   F_1/PMex...1),    (5)

where F is the actual stock of net foreign liabilities, measured in dollars.
                                          —16—




     Combining equations (4) and (5) and linearizing, we obtain the equa—
tion to be estimated,


     e
    P ext
            =
                b0 + b1
                          Mext_l
                                     + b2r + b3(r +ft) +b4yt +


                b5Wt/PMext ÷     2t'                                         (6)

where b1 = 1 —      and £ 2t =   X   u2t. A rise in the home interest rate induces

an inflow of capital or an increase in net external liabilities, so b2 >0.

Similarly, b3 < 0. An increase in domestic real income augments the trans—

actions demand for money and causes a decline in desired holdings of

foreign assets, so b4 > 0. Finally, an increase in domestic wealth

leads to a reduction in external liabilities. Thus, b5 < 0.

     The results of estimating (6) are reported in Table 2. 19 They provide

evidence that capital flows are quite sensitive to the domestic interest

rate even in the short run. The two techniques yield very similar para-

meter estimates, although those obtained by 2S2S2S appear to be more

precise. All interest rate coefficients have the expected sign and are

significant at the 95 per cent level. Equation (13), for example, suggests that a

100 basis point rise in the home interest rate, all else equal, induces a capital

inflow of 1.2 billion real pesos in the same quarter, while an equal in-

crease in the covered foreign rate induces a 0.25 billion real peso Out-

flow. Both estimates of the adjustment parameter           are near 0.7. Again

using equation (B), the long—run capital inflow occasioned by a 100 basis

point rise in r is 3.9 billion real pesos, while the outflow following an

equal increase in r* + f is 0.83 billion real pesos.

billion 1975 Mexican pesos. As in the regressionsreported in Tables 3 and 4,
the instruments used here are a constant, three seasonal dummies, the contem-
poraneous foreign interest rate and real income level, the lagged government
deficit,   lagged   domestic real income, the lagged futures premium and the
lagged dependent variable. This choice of instruments allows the domestic
interest rate, futures premium, real income and budget deficit to be endoge—
nous. The use of contemporaneous foreign variables as exogenous instruments
is justified if Mexico can be regarded as a small country in world markets
for goods and assets. When necessary, the instrument list was augmented to
satisfy Fair's minimum criterion.

     The wealth variable has the anticipated sign and is significant at
the 95   per       cent level in   both   equations. Equation (B) suggests that
approximately        15 per cent of an increase in wealth is allocated to net

external assets within one quarter. The long—run portfolio share is 50 per cent.

2.   Money demand

     The demand for narrowly—defined real money (Ml) balances is assumed

to depend on the domestic and foreign covered interest rates, real income,

and real wealth. Thus, long—run desired money holdings may be written as

rates is significant at the 95 Per cent level. In the unconstriid equa-

tion only the      coefficient   on the foreign interest rate is significant.

     The adjustment of real balances to long—run desired levels is esti-

mated to be approximately 20 per cent per quarter. Equation (D), for example,

suggests that a 100 basis point increase in either rate of return leads to a 0.3

billion peso decrease in real money demand in the same quarter and a 1.4

billion peso decrease in real money demand In the long run.

     As expected, an increase in real income raises real money demand.

At the    sample means of y and N/PIIex, the income elasticity of money demand
derived    from equation (D)     is     0.42 in the short run and 1.94 in the long

run. The empirical equation also contains seasonal dummies, which reveal

a marked seasonality in money demand. It is this seasonal variation that

gives rise to the significant seasonal dummies In the Banco de Mexico's

domestic credit policy function.

3.   Money supply

     The model's monetary sector includes a money supply function relat-

ing the supply of real Ml to the real monetary base. We assume that the

supply of money by the private banking system may be written as a function

of the monetary base (adjusted for reserve requirements as described in

Section II), and of the opportunity cost of holding excess reserves.            W1-ien


linearized, the money supply function takes the form,
     MS                       BA
             =
                 d0 ÷ d1 r + d2
                                        t   + u4.                         (8)

high   marginal reserve requirements on demand deposits (in place tlirough-

out    the estimation period) and banks' practice of holding sizable excess

reserves.22 The high interest sensitivity of money supply is also con-

sistent with the existence of significant excess reserves.

4.     The offset_coefficient

       The estimated coefficients of the structural equations may be used

to calculate the capital—account offset to domestic credit expansion. Two

types    of monetary expansion are considered. The first is an increase in

domestic credit accomplished through an open—market—type asset swap that

leaves private financial wealth unchanged. The second is a helicopter—

type increase in credit that is accompanied by an equal increase in pri-

vate financial wealth. Because our empirical money—demand function d3es not

include domestic wealth as an argument, we would expect the offset associated

with the latter type of operation to be the greater one. Indeed, were b5
equal to —1, the offset to a helicopter increase in domestic credit
                                                                    would

be complete, even with limited asset substitutability.
        In both cases the offset coefficient is (minus) the total derivative

of net foreign liabilities with respect to an increase in DACB. Table

5(a) contains the short—run offset coefficients for both types of credit expansion,

computed from the two sets of parameter estimates using the constrained money—

demand equations. The short—run offset coefficients imply that, while

substantial, the capital account offset to a monetary expansion was con-
                                                                         fror"
siderably less than complete. At the initial reserve ratio, anywhere

30 to 50 per cent of an increase in domestic credit by the Banco de Mexico was

 offset by capital outflow within a quarter, with the exact figure depending

 on    the method through which the domestic—credit increase was effected.

 For eampie, in order to achieve a 1 billion peso increase in
 the monetary base through outside money creation, a 1.7 to
 2   billion peso expansion of domestic credit was required. As expected,

the computed offsets to a helicopter—type expansion exceed those to an

open—market type expansion, in both cases by approximately 10   petcentage
points.   The offset coefficients derived from the Fair's method estimates

exceed those derived from the 2S2SLS estimates. This difference is due t0

the greater domestic—interest—rate sensitivity of capital flows implied

by the former set of estimates.

      It is also of interest to calculate the offset in a hypothetical

world in which portfolio adjustment occurs instanteneously. Replacing the

parameters in (9) and (10) with their corresponding long—run values, we

obtain "long—run" offset coefficients in all cases between 50 and 76 per

cent (see Table 5(b)). The computed "long—run"offsets to open—market—

type expansions are in the lower end of this range and those corresponding

to helicopter—type expansions are near 76 per cent. It should be stressed

that we are using the term "long run' in a limited sense to signify only

the complete adjustment of asset stocks to their desired values.

     The estimates indicate that the Banco de Mexico could exercise considerable

short—run control over the domestic money stock and domestic credit—market

conditions during the l970s, but only at the cost of high reserve volatility.

IV. Expectations and the Futures Premium

     The preceding anlysis, while recognizing the role of the futures

price as an indicator of exchange—rate expectations, has neglected both

the possible influence of the home interest rate on the futures premium

and the endogeneity of expectations. The offset to monetary policy has
                                 —21-




been calculated on the assumption that a one—time expansion of domestic

credit leaves the futures premium unchanged.

     flow might monetary expansion affect the futures premium? By lower-

ing the domestic interest rate, monetary expansion would induce capital

outflows and, at the initial forward rate, an excess deniand for future

pesos calling for a rise in their equilibrium price. As an appreciation

of the peso on the futures market discourages capital outflow, the offset

coefficient would be lower than calculated in the previous section if

covered interest arbitrage were incorporated into the model.

     Speculative transactions are also an important determinant of the

futures price however, and the activities of the speculators would tend

to raise the offset coefficient calculated in Section III. Monetary

expansion raises the likelihood of devaluation by reducing the central

bank's international reserves and encouraging domestic expenditure.

Speculators would respond by selling the peso forward, thus enhancing

the profitability of capital outflows.

     Theoretically, the net effect on the futures prices of these two

types of activity——interest arbitrage and speculation——is indeterminate.

But as an empirical matter, we could find no strong evidence that contem-

poraneous domestic interest rates affected the futures premium during the

1970s. Expectations regarding the future level of the exchange rate did

seem to be an important determinant of the futures premium, however. In

particular, lagged deviations from purchasing power parity exerted a

persistent and strong effect on the futures premium, with lagged real

exchange—rate appreciation leading to forward depreciation of the peso.
                                            —22—




     Letting p            n(ePUS/PMex) again denote the natural logarithm of

the real exchange rate, we estimated the following relatiorihip between

the futures premium on dollars, f, and past values of the real exchange

rate between 1974:1 and 1979:4:


        =       13.998 — 42.605   Pt—]. —    33.970 Pt-2 — 28.013 Pt—3
                (3.669) (7.344)             (10.020)      (10.681)


                                        — 10.923 Pt—4 — 21.449
                                                               Pt—5
                                          (9.987)       (7.321)


            =   0.801               SE = 3.497               R2 =    0.734
                (0.106)


(standard errors are in parentheses). The correlations between the

futures premium and lagged values of the purchasing power parity gap are

extremely high. They suggest that any decline in the com-

petitiveness of Mexican exports occasioned forward speculation against
                                                       23
the peso and a rise in the premium on forward dollars.

     This strong evidence that expectational factors influenced the

forward premium indicates that our offset estimates probably under-

state the true offset.
V. Concluso
         This paper has stud] ed   the capi tal—account   offset to monetary
policy faced by the Banco de Mexico during      the decade 1970—1980. Using

a small structural nìodel of Mexican financial markets, we found that roughly

30 to 50 per cent of a domestic—credit increase leaked away through the

capital account within a quarter, with the precise figure depending on the

method   of domestic—credit expansion adopted. This incomplete offset was
due to imperfect mobility of capital as well as to imperfect substitutability
between peso—denominated assets and assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The offset coefficient   would have been approximately 50 to 65 per cent
higher   under instantaneous portfolio adjustment.

         These findings imply that the Mexican central bank possessed some

degree of short—run control over the monetary base in spite of the fixity

of the exchange rate. While short—run monetary control implies an

ability to neutralize the liquidity effects of transitory reserve fluctua-

tions, it does not imply an ability to resist the adjustments necessary

to eliminate sustained disequilibria in the balance of payments. Con-

clusions as to the scope for long—run monetary control cannot be drawn

from our partial—equilibrium financial—sector model, which

neglects the current—account         effects of international wealth flows

and changes in home borrowing costs.

         Estimates of a Banco de Mexico reaction function provided strong

evidence of official sterilization activities during the 1970s. Although

the reaction function exhibited some instability when estimated over

sub—periods of the decade, the Banco de Mexico seems to have pursued a

policy of full neutralization of reserve movements, at least since early
                                   — /4 —




1976.   The pursuit of sterilization under conditions of sulistantial
capital—account sensitivity helped give rise to periods of considerable
reserve volatility during the decade under study.

Footnotes

1An exception is Miller and Askiri (1976), which studies Brazil and
Chile.

2The early paper of Argy and Kouri (1974) does not fall easily into
either of these categories. See note 7, below, for further discussion.

3The peso was devalued on August 31, 1976.

4See Keynes (1930, vol. 2, P. 309) and Nundell (1963). A key assumption in
deriving this result is that the central hank expands domestic credit through
an open—market operation that leaves private wealth unchanged. If domestic
credit instead represents outside money and the public's deiiand for money is
a function of its wealth, the capital—account offset will not be complete,
even under perfect capital mobility and unlimited asset substitutabilitY.
                                                     associated with both
Below, we compute the empirical offset coefficients
types of domestic credit creation.

5Even when foreign and home bonds are imperfect substitutes, the central
bank may be unable to affect the monetary base if government debt is not
outside debt; see Obstfeld (1981) and Stockman (1979). We ignore below the
problems that can arise when the public internalizes the government and
central—bank budget constraints.

6The series are adjusted for reserve requirements as described in the
next section.

7The "reduced—form" capital flow equation, as estimated by Kouri and
Porter (1974), is derived in two steps. First, one writes the change in net
external lending over a quarter as a function of the change in the foreign
and home interest rates and the change in income and other determinants of
the capital account. Second, one eliminates the change in the domestic
interest rate from this equation using the (first—differenced) money—market
equilibrium condition, which relates the quarterly change in (base) money
demand to the sum of the capital account, the current account, and the
increase in central bank domestic assets. Equations that regress changes in
reserves on changes in domestic credit, changes in income, and changes in
the home interest rate (for example, Cardoso and Dornbusch (1980)), are
clearly money—demand equations, and give no information regarding the effect
of credit expansion on the capital account. (See Frerikel, Gylfason, and
Helliwell (1980).) Balance—of—payments equations such as the one estimated
by Connolly and Dantas da Silveira (1979), which are based on the assumption
that money demand and the money supply multiplier are interest inelastic,
assume implicitly that the capital—account offset to domestic credit
expansion is complete. Indeed, when money supply and money demand are both
interest inelastic, the Kouri—Porter capital—flow equation is
under—identified. Identification is lost also when no variables other than
the balance of payments enter the monetary policy reaction function. (This
assumes that no a priori information is available concerning the degree of
correlation between the disturbances of various equations.) If domestic
credit responds systematically to variables other than the balance of
payments, these variables, if predetermined, may be used as instruments in
estimating the "reduced—form" capital—flow equation by two—stage least
squares. This approach, which in principle yields consistent parameter
estimates, was suggested by Argy and Kouri (1974). Their estimated offset
coefficients were generally much smaller than those obtained using ordinary
least squares.
8Calculations are based on year—end data published in International
Financial Statistics, lines lad and 1ad.

9The data appendix provides details on the construction of our
central—bank domestic asset series

'°Details on the calculation of the average reserve ratio series used in
this study apear in the appendix.

''All variables are defined in detail in the appendix. Financial
aggregates are measured in billions of pesos.

'2We draw on the discussions of government deficit finance in Brothers
and Solis (1966) and Ortiz and Solis (1979).

'3The standard—error estimates produced by 2S2SLS allow for a non—zero
covariarice between the estimates of the structural parameters and the
estimate of the autoregressive parameter (denoted by p in Table 1). In
addition, 2S2SLS does not require the absence of conditional
heteroskedasticity, an important problem is standard—error estimation when
lagged endogenous variables are used as instruments. Conditional
heteroskedasticity is discussed by Engle (1980) and Hansen (1979), and, in a
cross—sectional context, by White (1980a, l980bL

'4mis seasonality is reflected in the money—demand equation estimated
below.

'5Bhalla (1981) computes a positive correlation between the balance of
payments and the change in the money stock using annual data for the period
1956—1972. This evidence also suggests that sterilization was of limited
importance   before the mid—seventies.

'6Business International (1979) reports that Banco de Mexico has used
 Certificados de Tesoreria de la Federacion since 1978 and petrobonds since
1977 to conduct open—market operations. In addition, the move to market
valuation of gold reserves in 1976 allowed greater flexibility in choosing
the rate of domestic credit expansion. Prior to these innovations, the
monetary authority relied on reserve—requirement changes, special deposits,
and operations in government securities within the banking system (see
Brothers and Solrs). Only the last of these was employed with any
frequency.

17The futures premium can be interpreted as an indicator of exchange—rate
expectations or as the cost of forward cover. The two interpretations, of
course, need not conflict. We use the futures premium rather than the
forward premium used by Lizondo (this volume) because there is a longer
series of observations available for the former variable. Jacob Frenkel
has suggested that the futures premium may measure exchange—rate expecta-
tions with error. The two—step two—stage least squares estimates (but not
the Fair's method estimates) reported below yield consistent parameter
estimates even when all asset returns are measured with random, serially—
uncorrelated error. See Cumby, Huiziriga, and Obstfeld (1981) on the pro-
cedure to employ when an equation with errors in variables is corrected for
autoregressive dependence of its structural disturbance.

     aro assuming hero that domestic and covered foreign bonds are
imperfect substitutes because of political risk. See Aliber (1973) and
Dooley and Isard (1980). One example of such political risk arises when
the future tax treatment of international interest payments is uncertain.

19The domestic income variable had a small and very insignificant coef-
ficient.  It was therefore omitted from the equation reported in Table 2.

20Domestic wealth has been dropped from the equation, as its coefficient
was small and insignificant. No evidence of serial correlation was found.

21There was no evidence of a lag in the adjustment of the money supply
to its long—run level.

22Business International (1979) attributes this practice to the extremely
limited recourse of commercial banks to rediscounting at the central bank.
Generally, only certain export bills are discountable.

23The contemporaneous real exchange rate exerted no significant effect
on the futures premium. This is probably the result of lags in the report-
ing of price—level figures.
