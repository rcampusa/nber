                                           ABSTRACT

In January 2015, in the face of sustained capital inflows, the Swiss National Bank abandoned the
floor for the Swiss Franc against the Euro, a decision which led to the appreciation of the Swiss
Franc. The objective of this paper is to present a simple framework that helps to better understand
the timing of this episode, which we label a "reverse speculative attack". We model a central bank
which wishes to maintain a peg, and responds to increases in demand for domestic currency by
expanding its balance sheet. In contrast to the classic speculative attacks, which are triggered by
the depletion of foreign assets, reverse attacks are triggered by the concern of future balance sheet
losses. Our key result is that the interaction between the desire to maintain the peg and the
concern about future losses can lead the central bank to first accumulate a large amount of
reserves, and then to abandon the peg, just as we have observed in the Swiss case.

1       Introduction
In January 2015, in the face of sustained capital inflows, the Swiss National Bank (henceforth
SNB) decided to abandon the floor for the Swiss Franc against the Euro, a decision which
led to a sudden 20% appreciation of the Swiss Franc. Following Cochrane (2015) we name
such an event a “Reverse Speculative Attack”.1 This decision by the SNB had a significant
effect on financial markets, which seemed to have been surprised by the move. An article
in the January 2015 edition of the Economist Magazine suggests that “The doffing of the
cap surprised and upset the foreign exchange markets, hobbling several currency brokers,” ,
while Brunnermeier and James (2015) state that “The risks created by the SNB’s decision
– as transmitted through the financial system – have a fat tail.”
    The decision by SNB is also surprising when seen through the lenses of standard specu-
lative attack models. It is well known that a Central Bank may be forced to abandon a peg
when its foreign currency reserves get depleted, and it no longer has the ability to prevent its
currency from depreciating. That is, maintaining the peg can eventually become infeasible.2
However, the case of Switzerland in January 2015 does not fit this narrative. In principle,
it could have been feasible for SNB to increase its domestic liabilities (i.e., currency) while
acquiring the foreign currency assets necessary to maintain the peg. The SNB decided to do
otherwise.
    The goal of the present paper is to develop a simple theoretical and quantitative frame-
work, in order to better understand the timing of the Swiss peg’s abandonment, and how
changes in fundamentals, such as international interest rates, affected its likelihood.
    After reviewing some basic facts about the Swiss experience we trace out a simple theory
of the Central Bank’s problem. The starting point is the specification of the Central Bank
objective. We assume a Central Bank that would like (for reasons we do not model) to
maintain a currency peg with a foreign currency.3 Consistently with the Swiss experience,
we also assume that the Central Bank operates in an environment where the demand for its
currency is increasing. As a result, if the supply of domestic currency were not to increase
    1
     Switzerland is not the only example of this. In May 1971, the Bundesbank decided to abandon the peg
against the U.S. dollar, which also led to an appreciation of the German currency (see Brunnermeier and
James, 2015).
   2
     There exists a very large literature on standard speculative attacks, i.e. when a central bank abandons
a peg, and lets its currency depreciate, as its foreign reserves are drained. See, among others, the seminal
papers by Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984), or the very recent survey by Lorenzoni (2014).
However, to our knowledge, there is much less analysis on reverse speculative attacks, which are quite different
in nature. Exceptions are Grilli (1986) and Amador et al. (2016), which we discuss below.
   3
     Although the SNB explicitly targeted a floor on the exchange rate, for simplicity in our theoretical
analysis we will focus on the case of a peg, and throughout the rest of the paper we will use the two terms
interchangeably.



                                                       2
accordingly, the exchange rate would appreciate. Maintaining the peg involves expanding its
reserve holdings and its liabilities. We make two additional key assumptions for our results.
First, we assume that there is an exogenous probability that the exchange rate will be below
the peg level in the future. This risk is assumed to be outside the control of the Central
Bank today, and it makes the holding of reserves (which are denominated in foreign currency)
risky, relative to the monetary liabilities issued (denominated in domestic currency). Second,
we introduce balance sheet concerns in the following way: we assume that the Central Bank
keeps its potential balance sheet losses bounded by a threshold value.
    In this set-up, the fear of future losses on its balance sheet may force the Central Bank to
abandon a peg. In particular, we show that the Central Bank faces a trade-off when facing
an increase in the demand for its liabilities: it can either choose to maintain the peg and
accumulate reserves, or it can let the currency appreciate today. The first choice leads to no
losses today, but it involves possibly large losses in the future. The latter choice generates
some losses today but, by reducing the future appreciation risk, reduces the future losses.
When the balance sheet increases significantly, the second choice becomes more attractive,
and the Central Bank chooses to abandon the peg.
    After describing the model we proceed to solve it numerically, so as to assess whether the
economic mechanism we propose can explain the Swiss experience. In particular we introduce
shocks to the demand for Swiss currency, shocks to the international interest rates, and we
estimate a demand for Swiss currency that is consistent with the patterns of Swiss monetary
base and Swiss short term rates before, during and after the peg. Our key result is that
increases in money demand and/or a fall in the international interest rates can lead the
Central Bank to first accumulate a large amount of reserves and then to abandon the peg.
The model’s predicted reserve accumulation and the exchange rate appreciation following
the abandonment are quantitatively comparable to what is observed in the data.
    Our paper is closely related to the work of Grilli (1986), who analyzes speculative attacks
assuming the Central Bank has both an (exogenous) upper bound and (exogenous) lower
bound on reserves holdings. Our work is different as the bound on reserves arises endoge-
nously from the possibility of future losses to the Central Bank’s balance sheet, and as a
result, is affected by the Central Bank’s exchange rate policy today.4 This paper is also re-
lated to Amador et al. (2016), which develops a general framework to analyze the impact of
a given exchange rate policy on asset returns, the balance sheet of the central bank and do-
mestic welfare. Importantly in that paper the foreign demand for domestic currency, which
   4
    The implications of a large balance sheet is an issue that is been currently debated in monetary economics
given the large increase in the balance sheets of major Central Banks (see, among others, Del Negro and
Sims, 2015 and Hall and Reis, 2015). For early contributions on the topic also see Stella (1997,2005).

here we treat as an exogenous shock, is endogenous and depends on the exchange rate policy.
Also in the present work we do not consider the implications of a lower bound constraint
on interest rates, while Amador et al. (2016) shows that when the economy operates at that
lower bound, losses and distortions from exchange rate policies are potentially large.
   The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present some data that characterize
the Swiss experience with the peg to the Euro, section 3 presents the model and section 4
contains our main results. Section 5 discusses sensitivity analysis and section 6 concludes.


2       Evidence on the Swiss experience
In this section we briefly provide some evidence on the experience of the Swiss National Bank
with its peg and subsequent abandonment, as these events are the main motivation of our
work. The SNB, mentioning overvaluation of the Swiss franc and its negative effect on the
Swiss economy, announced in September 2011 a currency floor with the Euro, stating that:

        “With immediate effect, it will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate
        below the minimum rate of CHF 1.20. The SNB will enforce this minimum
        rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency in
        unlimited quantities.”

    In January 2015 the SNB abandoned the floor, which resulted in a substantial devaluation
of the Euro with respect to the CHF. Panel A of Figure 1 shows the path of the CHF/Euro
exchange rate in the years preceding the floor, during the peg (the shaded area) and after
the abandonment of the peg. Panel B shows instead the amount of foreign currency reserves
held by the SNB (expressed as a fraction of trend GDP).5
    Notice how in the first part of the sample (pre-floor) the CHF has appreciated quite
substantially relative to the Euro, and the SNB has at the same time accumulated foreign
reserves. During the floor the CHF has remained stable, while the SNB has continued
accumulating reserves at a rapid pace. Panel C plots 3 month LIBOR rates for Swiss Francs
and for Euros. Notice how, throughout the whole period, the CHF interest rate has been
below the Euro rate, suggesting that, even during the floor, there were expectations that the
CHF was going to appreciate against the Euro, i.e. that the floor was not going to last for
the indefinite future.6
    5
     We normalized reserves by trend GDP (as opposed to actual GDP) in order to isolate the fluctuations
in reserve holdings. We computed a linear trend using GDP data from 2007Q1 to 2015Q2.
   6
     Jermann (2015) uses option prices to back out probabilities of abandonment and found that over the
duration of the floor, the probability of abandonment averaged 20%

    Finally panel D provides some evidence on the background macroeconomic conditions in
which the SNB has been operating. Notice that the peg has been introduced at a time when
real GDP growth was slowing down markedly, while the peg has been abandoned at a time
in which Swiss growth was mildly accelerating.


3         The model
We consider a world composed of a small open economy (SOE), which uses a local currency
(Swiss Francs) and a large trading partner, which has a different currency (Euros). There
is a monetary authority in the SOE that starts the period with inherited nominal liabilities
(money, Mt−1 ) and foreign reserves denominated in foreign currency (Ft−1 ), and that exits
the period with new liabilities Mt and reserves Ft . The Central Bank would like to maintain
the exchange rate (number of Swiss Francs needed to buy a Euro), St , pegged at a fixed level
which we normalize to 1. The net worth of the Central Bank, denominated in local currency,
is the difference between the value of its assets minus its liabilities: N Wt = St Ft − Mt .
    We denote by it the domestic interest rate and let i?t denote the foreign interest rate. The
budget constraint of the Central Bank denominated in local currency is:

                               St (Ft − Ft−1 ) = i?t−1 St Ft−1 + Mt − Mt−1 − Tt

where Tt denotes the transfers from the Central Bank to the treasury.
    We define the profits (or losses, if negative) of the Central Bank, Πt , to be the sum of
the earned interest income on reserves, i?t−1 St Ft−1 , plus the changes in valuation in foreign
reserves, (St − St−1 )Ft−1 .
    We assume that the Central Bank rebates any profits (or losses) back to the treasury,
and as a result, in any equilibrium its net worth will be constant at its initial level N W0 .
We will however impose that the Central Bank is committed to avoiding losses exceeding
Π̄. The justification for this assumption is as follows. Since Central Banks are not for profit
institutions, it seems reasonable to assume that when they make positive profits those are
rebated to the treasury. When profits become losses, then they can significantly impact the
net worth of the Central Bank, and that might make it impossible for the Central Bank to
buy back (part of) its cash liabilities, and thus to conduct monetary policy. In this case, the
Treasury would need to recapitalize the Central Bank. We assume that a recapitalization
that is too large would not be politically feasible, justifying a constraint which limits the
transfers the Central Bank can receive from the Treasury.7
    7
        See Benigno and Nisticò (2015) for similar restrictions on the Central Bank transfer policy.


                                                         6
   The above discussion then implies that, in equilibrium, the Central Bank makes sure that
the following “loss constraint” is always satisfied:

                               ((1 + i?t−1 )St − St−1 )Ft−1 ≥ −Π̄

   To finalize the description of the money market, we assume that holders of the SOE’s
currency behave so to generate a standard money demand equation (in Euros) which we
denote by
                                      L(it ) = Bt l(it )                            (1)

where Bt is an exogenous stochastic shock to money demand and l(.) is a decreasing function
reflecting that as the nominal interest rate increases the real demand for cash balances falls.
    The foreign interest rate i∗t is assumed to be stochastic. We also assume that Bt and i∗t
can take values within a finite set. And finally, at any period there is a constant probability
that the exchange rate takes a value of S̄. We let At index whether the exchange rate
shock has occurred this period, taken a value of 1 if so, and zero otherwise. This shock
captures, in a reduced form way, the possibility that in some future state there is a change
in fundamentals (i.e., a large depreciation of the Euro vis-a-vis a third currency) that will
make the abandonment of the peg and an appreciation of the exchange rate necessary. As
we will show, this last shock is critical in generating risk in the balance sheet, which the
Central Bank will try to manage.
    We are now in a position of defining a competitive equilibrium which is a collection of
processes for St , Mt , it and Ft such that the following four equations are satisfied:

                                     St Ft − Mt = N W0                                      (2)
                                            Mt = St L(it )                                  (3)
                                                                           
                                                                     St+1
                                         1 + it = (1 + i?t )Et                              (4)
                                                                      St
                         ((1 + i?t )St+1 − St )Ft ≥ −Π̄                                     (5)

where St takes the value of S̄ whenever the exchange rate shock hits.
    Equation 2 guarantees that in any equilibrium the net worth of the Central Bank is
constant. Equation 3 reflects the equilibrium in the money market, i.e., money demand
equals money supply. Equation 4 is the uncovered interest rate parity condition. And
equation 5 is the loss constraint of the Central Bank, which we previously discussed.
    There are potentially many possible competitive equilibria. For example, it is immediate
to verify that there exists an equilibrium in which St = S̄ for all t. To select among different


                                               7
equilibria, we specify an objective function for the Central Bank. In addition to avoiding
losses, the Central Bank would like to keep the exchange rate as close as possible to its
preferred level of 1. In particular, the objective function of the Central Bank is given by:

                                          vt = −(St − 1)2 + βEt [vt+1 ]                     (6)

where β < 1 denotes the monetary authority discount factor.8
   We restrict attention to Markov equilibria, where the states are given by the level of
money demand, the foreign interest rate, and whether or not the exchange rate shock has
taken place:

Definition 1. A Markov equilibrium is a collection of processes for the exchange rate, St ,
the domestic interest rate, it , money demand Mt , and foreign reserves Ft measurable with
respect to the money demand shock, Bt ; the foreign interest rate shock, i?t ; and exchange
rate shock At ; such that, as long as At = 0, equations (2), (3), (4), (5) are satisfied; and St
maximizes the objective of the Central Bank, taking as given the future equilibrium process
for St+j for j ≥ 1.

    Note that it is possible to describe a competitive equilibrium by just describing the
behavior of the exchange rate. That is, given a process for the exchange rate, the domestic
interest rate, the amount of money, and the foreign reserves are determined. In a Markov
equilibrium, the Central Bank today takes as given the future choices for the exchange rate
and chooses a level of the exchange rate such that (i) the loss constraint is satisfied (given
the implied interest rate) and (ii) the level of the exchange rate is as close as possible to 1.
    In general, a Markov equilibrium will display states in which the Central Bank pegs the
exchange rate at 1 (its preferred outcome) and states where it abandons the parity and lets
the exchange rate appreciate to a value lower than 1. The dynamics of exchange rate in
these states are what we label “reverse speculative attacks.” It should be clear that in our
framework a reverse speculative attack happens if and only if the loss constraint is binding.
After specifying numerical values for the parameters, we can characterize Markov equilibria
numerically, which we proceed to do next.


4         A Numerical Analysis
In order to characterize the dynamics surrounding the reverse speculative attack, we first
impose more structure on the states of the economy and their evolution, as well as specify
    8
        As we will see below, the precise value of β will be irrelevant.


                                                          8
numerical values for the parameters of the model. We then numerically solve for Markov
equilibria and finally characterize the patterns of key variables. We would like to stress that,
given the highly stylized model we are using, the goal of this exercise is just to provide the
reader with some simple qualitative and quantitative insights on reverse speculative attacks;
we will surely not provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the issue.


4.1    States of the economy
As we discussed previously, our economy is going to be subject to three exogenous distur-
bances.
    For the exchange rate shock, we assume that the economy starts initially at A0 = 0, and
we let λ denote the probability that At = 1 next period if At = 0 today. The state At = 1
is assumed to be absorbing.
    We assume that the level of money demand (Bt in equation 1) obeys the following process.
At any t,
                                        Bt = eg×bt                                       (7)

where bt ∈ {0, 1, ..., N } and represents possible shocks to money demand. The parameter
g > 0 is fixed and determines by how much money demand increases when a money demand
shock hits. We assume that the state bt = N is absorbing, i.e. that money demand shocks
are bounded, and that once the money demand shock reaches its maximum level, it will stay
there. For all bt < N, bt+1 will stay constant at bt with probability 1 − γ > 0 or increase by 1
with probability γ > 0. In words, γ represents the probability that the economy is hit by a
shock that increases money demand by g%. This probability is assumed to be independent
from other events in the economy.
    The third and final source of uncertainty in the economy regards the foreign interest
rates. Our modeling of the foreign interest rates is loosely motivated by panel C in figure 1,
where we observe that, during the period of the Swiss peg, Euro interest rates fell initially
(in late 2011), and did not move much subsequently. As a consequence, we assume that the
foreign interest rate can take two possible states: high (ih ) or low (il ), with ih > il . The
probability of transiting from the high to the low interest rate state is denoted by θhl ; and
from the low to the high, θlh . As with the previous shocks, we assume that these transition
probabilities are independent from the realization of the other shocks.
    To sum up, figure 2 shows possible paths for the three sources of uncertainty. The value
T̂ on the x axis represents the time in which the economy switches from At = 0 to At = 1.
After T̂ our model economy is not interesting, as by assumption the exchange rate will be
constant at S̄ < 1. Before T̂ the economy faces a period of stochastically increasing demand

Central Bank behavior, and to analyze its decision whether to keep a peg (i.e. keep St = 1)
or not, when t < T̂ .


4.2    Functional forms and parameter values
Our baseline parameter values are reported in Table 2 below. We now briefly describe how
we pick those values. We start with the estimation of the money demand elasticity and
money demand shocks. In order to do so we first construct a measure of money demand.
The measure that is more consistent with our stylized model is the monetary base, which
is a measure of the monetary liabilities of the Central Bank. We construct this by adding
currency in circulation plus deposits of domestic and foreign banks at the Central Bank (as
reported in the balance sheet of the SNB) all converted into Euros.9 Panel A in figure 3
plots the log of the monetary base along with the Swiss Franc 3 month LIBOR rate. The
panel shows an overall negative correlation between the two series, but also suggests that
it is difficult to separately identify the impact of interest rate changes from the impact of
  9
    This measure is narrower than more traditional measures of money demand such as M1 or M2, but is
highly correlated with those.


                                                 10
exogenous (positive) shocks to the demand for Swiss francs, that are also correlated with
reductions in the Swiss rates (the shocks in the figure are marked by the solid vertical lines).
To see this consider the Euro crisis of 2011. Panel A of the figure shows that during the
crisis there was, at the same time, a large increase in the demand for Swiss currency and
a small reduction in the Swiss interest rates. If one estimated a money demand without
shocks, one would attribute the whole increase in money demand to the reduction in interest
rates, and would come up with a very large estimated elasticity. In reality a large fraction
of the increase in money demand came from exogenous reasons (i.e. a sharp recession in the
Euro area) that at the same time increased the demand for Swiss francs and induced the
SNB to lower its rate.
    Our (admittedly simplistic) attempt to separately identify the impact of shocks from
the impact of interest rates on money demand is to specify the log money demand as the
following linear function:

                                                        S
                                                        X
                                         log L(i) =           Dj φj − l(i)
                                                        j=1
                                                        S
                                                        X
                                                    =         Dj φj − ψi                    (8)
                                                        j=1


where S is the number of permanent shocks to money demand (to be specified below), Dj
is a dummy variable that takes the value of 0 for all the months before shock j hits, and
1 for the month in which the shock hits and for all subsequent months. There are two set
of parameters to be estimated in equation 8. The first includes the φj , which represent the
percentage increase in money demand caused by shock j, and pin down the parameter g in
equation (7). The second includes the constant ψ > 0, which pins down the elasticity of
money demand to the interest rate. Note that our specification of the functional form of the
interest elastic portion of money demand is the commonly used Cagan specification.10
    Guided by the evidence from panel A, we consider 5 possible specifications of the shocks
in equation (8).

    The first one includes no shock, the second one includes one shock (the onset of the Euro
crisis dated August 2011), the third one includes two shocks (the Euro crisis plus the Draghi
“Whatever it takes” Speech, dated July 2012), the fourth one includes three shocks (the
Euro crisis, the Draghi Speech, and the announcement of ECB QE, dated January 2015)
and the final one includes 4 shocks (the Euro crisis, the Draghi Speech, the ECB QE and
the Great Recession, dated December 2008 ). Table 1 reports the estimate of the interest
elasticity for these 5 specifications along with estimates of the impact of each shock on Swiss
money demand.
    Note that as we include more and more shocks the estimated interest elasticity φ falls,
reflecting the potential bias in the estimated interest elasticity of money demand when such
shifts in the money demand function are not included in the specification. As our baseline
specification we use the three shocks case, and the fit of that specification is visualized in
panel B of figure 3. The thick lines in the figure all have slope equal to ψ (the estimated
interest elasticity) while the difference in the intercept of the lines represents the shock. The
specification implies an interest elasticity (ψ) of 0.34 and an average shock size (g) of 51%.
Since the elasticity of money demand is an important parameter, in section 5 we analyze
how our results change when we vary it.
    In order to specify the probability of a shock to money demand we note that in our
baseline specification we observe 3 such shocks in a period of seven years, so we set the
monthly probability of such a shock equal to 3.5% which implies, on average, one shock


                                                13
every 28 months.11
    We move next to the values for the foreign interest rates. Figure 1 shows how in the early
phase of the peg, Euro rates moved from 1.5% to about 0%. For this reason we set ih = 1.5%
and il = 0%. To specify the transition probabilities for interest rates we think of transitions
from high to low as standard transitions associated with changes in monetary policy over
the business cycle, so we set the monthly transition probability θhl = 1%, which translates
into an expected duration of a high interest rate period (expansion phase) of 8 years and
the probability θlh = 1.7%, which roughly translates to a duration of the low interest rate
period of six years. The latter is consistent with the data, if we project that Euro interest
rates will stay at 0 throughout 2016.
    The next parameters are related to the appreciation risk (i.e. the A shock), which are the
value of the currency in case of appreciation S̄ and the probability of such an appreciation
λ. Note that these two parameters jointly determine the minimum expected appreciation
of the domestic currency during the peg, but are very hard to pin down as such an event is
not observed in our sample. We set the probability of appreciation to 0.4%, which implies
that this event is rare (one every 20 years), and we set the value of the currency in case
of appreciation to 0.7, which implies a minimum expected annual appreciation during the
peg of about 1%. In section 5 we explore how our results change when we change these
parameters.
  11
     Obviously we are making inferences about this probability using a short sample that might be quite
special. We experimented with alternative values for this probability, and our qualitative results were not
affected.

        N W0 and Π are expressed as ratio to monetary base at the start of the peg

    The final set of parameters concerns the balance sheet of the Central Bank. Figure 4
plots the monetary base and it shows that in September 2011 (the month in which the peg
was introduced) the difference between foreign reserves and the monetary base (which in our
model corresponds to net worth) was about 20% of the monetary base. So we set the value
of the initial net worth, N W0 , so that the model matches that ratio in the first period of
the simulation, i.e. when the peg starts. Note from the figure that net worth of the central
SNB stays fairly constant, despite large fluctuations in the monetary base and in reserves.
This pattern is consistent with our modelling of the transfer policy of the Central Bank, that
implies a constant net worth.
    Finally we set the maximum value of losses that can be sustained by the Central Bank
(Π) equal to 1.6 the value of the monetary base at the start of the peg. This value is chosen
so that the expected duration of the peg, under a constant high foreign interest rate, is
approximately 7 years. Again the exact value of the parameter is hard to pin down, as it is
hard to quantify exactly what is the maximum size of balance sheet losses a central bank is
willing to take. In section 5 we assess how our results change with different values for Π.

4.3    Results
Given these parameter values, we can numerically solve for the Markov equilibria in the
following way. We guess an initial exchange rate function, S0 (.). Given this, for every state,
we compute the exchange rate that is closest to 1 and that guarantees that the loss constraint
tomorrow is satisfied in every possible state, while assuming that S0 (.) is the equilibrium
exchange rate policy the following periods. This generates a new equilibrium conjecture
S1 (.) for every state. We keep iterating this procedure until the Si (.) converges. We found
that this procedure converges to a unique exchange rate function, for a very large set of the
initial guesses.
    Once we have a numerical solution we can characterize the periods that feature reverse
speculative attacks, i.e. abandonment of the peg. In particular, we focus on two types of
abandonments: those driven by shocks to money demand, and those driven by a reduction
in the foreign interest rates.
    Figure 5 displays the key variables of the economy in all possible states. In each panel,
the x-axis represents the increasing permanent shocks to money demand, while the different
lines represent different states for the foreign interest rates. For example, the right-most
square on the top line in panel A represents the equilibrium exchange rate that will prevail
when the money demand shock is in the fourth largest state value and the foreign interest
rate is high.


                                                                                        16
    To understand the first type of abandonment, consider an economy that moves along
the lines represented by the square markers, i.e. an economy that is facing a high foreign
interest rate and experiencing a sequence of increases in money demand. Panel A shows how,
for the first two money demand shocks, the Central Bank keeps the exchange rate at 1. In
those states the loss constraint is not binding, and thus the Central Bank can maintain the
exchange rate pegged at parity, its preferred outcome. Panel C shows that maintaining the
peg, while facing an increasing money demand, involves accumulating reserves. The jump
in money demand that takes place when shock 2 hits can possibly capture the experience
of the SNB during the second half of 2012, where the peg was maintained through a large
accumulation of foreign reserves.
    Note however that, as reserves grow, so does the size of the losses of the Central Bank
in case of an exogenous appreciation (i.e., the A shock), and that makes the loss constraint
more likely to bind. Indeed, the money demand state 2 is the largest state for which the
Central Bank can maintain the peg. Panel A shows that when the next money demand shock
(state 3) hits, the Central Bank will abandon the peg and the exchange rate will appreciate
by about 7%. When this appreciation happens, the Central Bank experiences losses, while
setting an exchange rate away from its preferred target. The benefit of doing so is that the
current appreciation prevents a larger appreciation in the future, that would have led to
much larger losses.
    Panel B plots the domestic interest rates. The top line shows that appreciation in state
3 is anticipated by investors, and that it induces a decline in the domestic interest rate
in state 2 (a result that follows directly from the UIP condition, equation 4). The fall in
interest rates causes a further increase in money demand (over and above the increase caused
directly by the shock) that forces an even larger increase in reserves just before the peg is
abandoned (see the steep increase between states 1 and 2 in the bottom line in panel C).
It is interesting that before the attack, the model displays patterns that resemble a defense
against an attack. That is, as abandonment of the parity becomes more likely (the economy
moves to state 2), reserves increase, while domestic interest rates fall.
    Note that quantitatively the increase in reserves implied by the model is too large relative
to the Swiss data: in the model, reserves during the peg increase 4 times, while in the data
(see figure 1) reserves roughly doubled. Also domestic interest rates fall to a much lower
level (-3% ) than what is observed in the data. We conjecture that these discrepancies are
due to the fact that we do not explicitly model a lower bound on interest rates, and the
patterns of money demand and capital flows around that bound.12

    See Rognlie (2016) for some recent work on the money demand when interest rates are close to their
lower bound and Amador et al. (2016) for an analysis of reverse speculative attacks with an explicit bound
on interest rates.

    Figure 5 also suggests another possible trigger of the abandonment of the parity. Suppose,
for example, that the economy is at state 2 in panel A. Consider now a change in the
foreign rate from high to low. In this situation, the Central Bank abandons the parity while
the exchange rate appreciates by about 3%. The logic behind this result is similar to the
one described above: the fall in the foreign interest rate causes (should the Central Bank
maintain the parity) a fall in the domestic rate, and this induces an increase in demand for
local currency, accompanied by a similar increase in reserves. Panel D shows the increase in
reserves that takes place when the economy moves from the high to the low foreign interest
rate. The increase in reserves might, in some state, cause the loss constraint to bind, and
hence in that state maintaining the parity is no longer feasible for the Central Bank.
    To sum up, we have highlighted two possible causes of an abandonment of the peg. In
both of them, the Central Bank abandons the peg because maintaining the exchange rate at

parity involves a large reserve accumulation, which coupled with the appreciation risk may
lead to losses in the Central Bank’s balance sheet that are large, and by assumption, not
sustainable by the Central Bank. By letting the currency appreciate early on, the Central
Bank realizes some of these losses when reserves are still low, and in this way, reduces the
size of future losses.


5    Sensitivity Analysis
The objective of this section is to illustrate how the dynamics of reverse speculative attacks
change as we change some of the fundamental parameters of the model economy. Figure 6
displays the patterns of exchange rates, while figure 7 displays the pattern of reserves for
Markov equilibria under different parameter specifications.

                                         Figure 7: Sensitivity analysis: Reserves

    Panel A in both figures shows how the patterns of speculative attack depend on the
expected size of the appreciation shock 1 − S̄. When the size of the appreciation shock is
larger (the dashed lines) the expected losses of the Central Bank, in case of appreciation,
are larger, and the Central Bank is less willing to accumulate reserves; this implies that
the peg will be abandoned earlier. Note that the higher probability of abandonment causes
a higher expected appreciation of the exchange rate in every state, and thus (through the
UIP equation) a lower interest rate. This implies an increase in reserves even in the first
state where the Central Bank can maintain the peg (see panel A in figure 7). Panel B in
both figures shows the impact of a higher probability of the appreciation shock (the dashed
lines). Notice that, because the the way we have specified the loss constraint of the Central
Bank (equation 5), a higher likelihood of the appreciation shock does not make the loss
constraint directly more binding. Yet, a higher probability of appreciation induces an earlier


                                                                        20
abandonment. The logic is again that a more likely appreciation induces a current lower
domestic interest rate, higher money demand and thus more reserves, which make the loss
constraint more likely to bind, and thus induce earlier abandonment. Going back to figure 1,
we noticed how the attack that caused the collapse of the Swiss exchange rate floor happened
after the Swiss economy experienced two quarters of positive economic growth. The positive
news about growth could be interpreted, through the lens of our set-up, as news that the
appreciation shock is more likely to happen, and thus could help explain the abandonment
of the floor, even before the shock actually happens.
    Panel C in figures 6 and 7 shows the impact of having a tighter loss constraint on the
Central Bank (a lower Π̄). Not surprisingly a tighter loss constraint leads to earlier aban-
donment. Comparing Panels A and C we notice that, in the first state, the effect of a tighter
constraint is very similar to the effect of a larger depreciation shock. However, in subsequent
states the tighter loss constraint has a milder impact on exchange rates and reserves, than
the larger appreciation shock. The reason is that the larger appreciation shock also causes a
lower interest rate (through the UIP, i.e. equation 4), higher demand for money and higher
reserves. The tighter loss constraint does not have this additional channel, as it does not
directly affect the expected exchange rate.
    Finally panel D explores the impact of a different elasticity for the demand for money.
The dashed lines in panel D in figures 6 and 7 depicts the case when the elasticity is lower
( ψ = 0.17, corresponding to the 4 shocks specification in table 1). Notice that with a lower
elasticity of money demand the Central Bank accumulates less reserves as money demand
shock become larger (the dashed line in panel D in figure 7 is below the solid line). As a
consequence, its loss constraint is less likely to bind, and the bank can keep the exchange
rate closer to the peg than in the benchmark case (see panel D in figure 6). To understand
why this is the case, recall that when money demand increases and domestic appreciation
becomes more likely, the UIP equation implies that the domestic interest rates fall. When
domestic interest rates fall, demand for domestic currency increases further, making reserves
grow faster, making the loss constraint more likely to bind and appreciation more likely.
With lower elasticity this additional increase in money demand is muted, and thus the
Central Bank accumulates less reserves, and can delay appreciation. Another consequence
of the lower elasticity is that the exchange rate is less sensitive to foreign interest rate shocks.
As we discussed earlier, a reduction in the foreign interest rate lowers domestic rates and
increases domestic money demand, which forces the Central Bank to appreciate the currency.
With a lower elasticity, the increase in money demand stemming from a reduction in the
foreign rate is lower and hence, the appreciation of the exchange rate is also lower. Indeed we
find that when the foreign interest rates falls in state 2 and the elasticity is high (ψ = 0.34,

the benchmark case) the Central Bank appreciates the exchange rate by 3% (see panel A,
figure 5). If instead the elasticity is low (ψ = 0.17) we find that the Central Bank can
maintain the parity in state 2, even when the foreign interest rate falls to its low level.


6     Conclusions
This paper has presented a stylized framework to analyze the abandonment of the peg and
subsequent appreciation experienced by the Swiss National Bank in January 2015. We
consider a framework in which maintaining a peg involves accumulation of risky foreign
reserves, and the Central Bank might abandon the peg in order to limit its exposure to
this risk. We have shown that, in this framework shocks to the demand for local currency,
and/or to the foreign interest rates can lead to dynamics of reserves and exchange rates that
resemble those observed in Switzerland.
    The framework used here is highly stylized in several dimensions. We have assumed that
the risk associated with the accumulation of foreign reserves is exogenous, that uncovered
interest rate parity holds at all states, and we have ignored the presence of a lower bound
of the nominal interest rates. In reality the risk and the inflows of foreign reserves are
affected by actions of the Central Bank, and are likely to depend on current and future
economic conditions as well as on monetary policy objectives. Moreover, in international
financial markets, we routinely observe significant deviations from uncovered interest parity.
In addition, in low interest rate environments, the presence of a lower bound on nominal
rates constrains the actions of the monetary authority.
    For all these reasons we think more work on reverse speculative attacks is useful and
relevant, not only to better understand these episodes, but also because it sheds light on
the limits of monetary policy in highly integrated economies operating at very low interest
rates.13
