                                        ABSTRACT

Historical anecdotes of new investors being drawn into a booming asset market, only to
suffer when the market turns, abound. While the role of investor contagion in asset bubbles
has been explored extensively in the theoretical literature, causal empirical evidence on the
topic is virtually non-existent. This paper studies the recent boom and bust in the U.S.
housing market, establishing that many novice investors entered the market as a direct result
of observing investing activity of multiple forms in their own neighborhoods and that these
“infected” investors performed poorly relative to other investors along several dimensions.

1       Introduction
Historical accounts of well-known financial boom and bust episodes have drawn attention
to several phenomena that appear to signify and contribute to asset bubbles. A common
observation is that market participation broadens significantly during a speculative boom,
as investors with limited experience or expertise are drawn into the market. In his famous
description of the boom and bust in the 1637 Dutch tulip market, for example, Mackay
(1841) commented that at its peak, “Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen, footmen,
maid-servants, even chimney-sweeps and old clotheswomen, dabbled in tulips.”1
    Such a “speculative fever” is widely viewed as symptomatic of bubble-like episodes and
financial crises,2 and many modern theoretical models of asset bubbles characterize both ra-
tional and irrational herd behavior capable of generating exactly the sort of investor contagion
described in these historical accounts.3 These models typically characterize a fundamental
information problem in which rational investors use the activity of others to learn about
movements in market fundamentals, but also often include a subset of naı̈ve agents (e.g.,
noise traders) that engage in herd behavior for reasons that may not be entirely motivated
by rational decision-making.4
    Despite the long-standing theoretical and practical interest in asset bubbles in general, and
investor herd behavior in particular, the existing empirical evidence on investor contagion
has been very limited, rarely moving beyond anecdotal accounts or a characterization of
the observed correlation in investor behavior.5 In this paper, we study individual investor
behavior in the recent housing boom and bust in the U.S. and, in so doing, provide some of the
first causal evidence on the causes and consequences of investor contagion. In our attempt
to move beyond anecdotal characterization of this phenomenon, we aim to achieve three
primary goals: establishing a causal effect of others’ investment activity on the likelihood
that an individual becomes an investor in the housing market; quantifying the contribution of
investor contagion to the overall amount of speculative investing in the housing market; and
comparing the performance of “infected” investors, who are drawn into the market, to that
    1
     Similarly, in his “anatomy of a typical crisis”, Kindelberger (1978) notes that financial market bubbles
are frequently characterized by “More and more firms and households that previously had been aloof from
these speculative ventures” beginning to participate in the market.

     We discuss the existing empirical literature on the topic below.

of more professional, “non-infected” investors as a way of gauging the relative sophistication
of these investors.
    Four important features of the housing market make it a compelling and particularly
well-suited setting for studying investor contagion. First, the housing market experienced a
substantial rise and fall over the 2000s, with housing prices increasing 50 percent nationally,
and upwards of 200 percent in some metropolitan areas, before tumbling back to roughly
pre-boom levels by the end of the decade. Second, there was a great deal of speculation
in the housing market during the boom. At the height of the market from 2004-2006, for
example, Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and van der Klaauw (2011) estimate that 40-50 percent
of all homes in the states that experienced the largest housing booms were purchased as
investment properties.6 Moreover, as we show in this paper, and very much in line with
the above-mentioned historical accounts of new investors entering during booms, much of
this investment was made by new investors. Third, housing transactions are a matter of
public record, as the deed for each home, along with any liens on the property, must be
recorded at the time of purchase. As a result, the universe of home purchases, including
transaction price and buyer and seller names, is available for nearly all markets in the United
States; comparatively, accessing comprehensive individual investment data for other financial
markets is typically more challenging. Fourth, the geographical nature of the housing market
provides a natural way to identify channels through which contagion may occur, as potential
investors may take cues from nearby real estate activity. By contrast, it can be difficult to
distinguish key potential channels of contagion in other asset markets, especially for a broad
population of potentially infected agents.7
    Our focus is on individuals who purchase houses for investment purposes. We aim to
identify cases where individual investors are drawn into the market because of the activity
of other investors. To provide causal evidence on this type contagion, we utilize a nearest-
neighbor research design that identifies the causal effect of nearby investment activity on a
potential investor’s behavior by estimating the impact of hyper-local investment activity (on
his or her residential block), while controlling for similar measures of activity at a slightly
larger neighborhood (on other nearby blocks). This type of research design has been used
extensively in the recent empirical literature on neighborhood effects to identify a variety
of spatial spillovers including employment referrals, foreclosures, and school choice, to name
   6
      Using a different methodology, Bayer, Geissler, Mangum, and Roberts (2014) estimates a similar jump
in purchases by novice investors in the Los Angeles metropolitan area over this same period.
    7
      Some previous studies exploit knowledge of potential channels of contagion for special subsets of the
population. For example, Duflo and Saez (2002) uses data from a large university to assess whether investor
decisions, such as whether to enroll in a Tax Deferred Account or which mutual fund vendor to choose, are
affected by other employees in the same department.



                                                    3
a few examples.8 This approach to establishing causality leverages another feature of the
housing market useful for our purposes: an individual’s ability to purchase a house on one
specific block versus the next is largely driven by the availability of homes at the time of
purchase.9 This sharply limits household sorting at the block level (a fact that we confirm in
our data below), and thus largely mitigates the concern that a positive effect of very nearby
investment activity on an individual’s likelihood of becoming an investor represents only a
spurious correlation. In the analysis below, we provide several key pieces of support for the
validity of our research design.
    Using this approach, we examine two ways that someone may be influenced by nearby real
estate investment activity: either an immediate neighbor has recently begun investing in the
housing market, or a property in the immediate neighborhood was recently “flipped.” As we
further explain below, our aim is not to identify the specific mechanism(s) through which such
contagion occurs via these channels per se (although we will have something to say about
this), but obvious candidates abound, including word-of-mouth between neighbors related
to information, optimism, or technical know-how about flipping homes and, perhaps more
directly, a direct and vivid demonstration of the potentially large returns from short-term
real estate investing in a booming market.
    We apply our research design using data on nearly five million housing transactions in
the Los Angeles metropolitan area from 1989-2012. To minimize any concern about the
validity of our research design, we take a conservative approach and focus on investment
activity within 0.10 miles of a household, roughly a city block. Our results imply sizable
contagion effects for both new investors and flipped homes. The presence of each neighbor
that begins to invest in housing within 0.10 miles of a household increases that household’s
probability of also investing in housing by 8 percent within the next year and up to 20 percent
over three years. The presence of a flipped property that has just been re-sold, the other
channel of contagion that we consider, raises the probability of that household investing by 9
percent and 19 percent over the same horizons, respectively. The magnitudes of both forms
of investor contagion change over the course of the housing boom, especially the flipped
property channel, the effect of which is greatest in the peak years, 2004-2006.
    Moreover, the sizable effects that we document likely understate the true magnitude of
investor contagion for at least three reasons. First, our research design identifies the effect
of immediate neighbors and flipped homes relative to those just a short distance away. If
    8
      See, for example, Bayer, Ross, and Topa (2008), Linden and Rockoff (2008), Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak
(2011), Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti (2011), Anenberg and Kung (2014), Currie, Davis, Greenstone, and
Walker (2015).
    9
      In our analysis we provide direct evidence in favor of this identifying assumption and also present a
number of placebo tests and alternative specifications designed to test the robustness of the main results to
different definitions of what constitutes “hyper-local.”


                                                     4
those slightly more distant neighbors and homes also have an impact on investment activity,
our estimates will understate the full extent of investment contagion. Second, our analysis
considers the impact of all local investment activity regardless of whether a homeowner is
aware of it. If, for example, homeowners only interact or learn about investment activity from
half of their neighbors, the true impact of neighbors on one another would be twice as large.
Finally, our analysis, by design, only captures this neighborhood channel of investor contagion
and, therefore, misses any impact that a homeowner’s wider circle of family, friends, and
acquaintances might have on investment behavior. Our analysis focuses on this neighborhood
channel not necessarily because we believe that it is the most critical channel of contagion,
but rather because it gives us some leverage to use a research design that credibly isolates
causal effects.
    Having established contagion in real estate investment activity, we provide an estimate
of how much neighborhood investor contagion contributed to the level of speculative in-
vesting over the course of the Los Angeles housing boom. We estimate that the impact of
neighborhood-level contagion increased over the course of the boom because (i) the average
exposure of homeowners to nearby investment activity rose sharply as real estate speculation
increased and expanded,2004-2006 and (ii) the estimated effect of exposure on homeowner
investment behavior increased over the course of the boom, peaking in the 2004-2006 period.
Our most conservative analysis implies that neighborhood contagion was responsible for 11.2
percent of the speculative real estate investments and 10.4 percent of investors at the peak
of the boom.
    We close the paper by exploring the performance of investors drawn into the market
through this channel. In particular, we muster three pieces of evidence that investors subject
to neighborhood influence at their time of entry (hereafter, “infected investors”) perform
worse than all other investors. First, infected investors earned inferior returns on proper-
ties they bought and sold, through three channels we decompose–buying at prices higher
and selling at prices lower than other investors, relative to market, and suboptimal market
timing. Moreover, we show that infected investors were more likely to hold their properties
past the peak of the boom, and hence were more subject to capital losses and a failure to
capture any market appreciation realized up to that point. Finally, we show that infected
investors were more likely to default as prices plummeted. Because they purchased invest-
ment properties with lower initial equity stakes, however, their overall exposure to downside
risk was somewhat limited relative than other investors. Overall, the results of our analysis
suggests that investors infected by activity in their immediate neighbors are substantially
less sophisticated than the more general population of investors in the market.
    Our paper is related and contributes to the empirical literature on peer effects in invest-


                                              5
ment decisions. It has long been noted that in scenarios where agents lack perfect information
about the potential costs and benefits of taking an action, like investing in the housing mar-
ket, they may take informational cues from their peer group, even if this information is not
correct (e.g., Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) or Ellison and Fudenberg (1993)).
Of course, they may also take “social” cues from this group as they attempt to “keep up with
the Joneses” by mimicking what others do (e.g. Bernheim (1994)). A number of papers have
used these possible mechanisms related to social learning and social utility to motivate the
empirical study of peer effects in investing (e.g., Duflo and Saez (2002), Hong, Kubik, and
Stein (2004), Brown, Ivkovic, Smith, and Weisbenner (2008), or Banerjee, Chandrasekhar,
Duflo, and Jackson (2013)). In connecting our paper to this literature one should be careful
in the interpretation of the phrase “peer effect.” In our paper we do not attempt to sys-
tematically measure one’s peers; rather we are interested in the effect of nearby investment
activity on one’s investment behavior. This nearby activity might be generated from one’s
peers (perhaps a neighbor buys an investment property), but it need not be (as explained
above, we also look at the effect of flipped houses in one’s neighborhood regardless of where
the flipper lives). We contribute to this literature by providing, what is to our knowledge,
the first application to real estate investing, as well as the first implementation of the type
of identification strategy utilized in this paper to study investment decisions. Additionally,
we further extend this literature by exploring the performance of those investors drawn into
the market by others’ actions, as well as quantifying the effect of this contagion on the over-
all level of speculative investment that occurred during the recent housing boom and bust.
This is especially important for studying the consequences of peer effects in investing during
“bubble-like” episodes, which is not the focus of the above-mentioned papers.
    Reflecting on our findings, a natural question one might ask is how exactly the influence
occurs. The empirical literature on peer effects in investing mentioned above usually cannot
distinguish between social learning and social utility mechanisms.10 While a precise delin-
eation of these channels is not possible in our analysis, there are several reasons to suspect
that social learning (of various kinds) plays an important role. First, the theoretical literature
on speculative bubbles often points to some sort of learning about market fundamentals from
others’ behavior.11 Second, there are so many obvious ways that learning could take place.
For example, novice investors could change their beliefs about market fundamentals or the
possible payoffs from investing, or they could learn practical “tricks of the trade” or form
professional networks (of repair services, inspectors, attorneys, etc.) from more experienced
  10
      An exception is the recent experimental paper, Bursztyn, Ederer, Ferman, and Yuchtman (2014), on peer
effects in financial decisions, which finds that both social learning and social utility channels affect behavior.
   11
      Indeed, the Bursztyn, Ederer, Ferman, and Yuchtman (2014) paper finds that the social learning channel
is strongest when agents observe the behavior of a relatively sophisticated group.


                                                        6
investors. Third, while we find significant effects of neighbors’ investing on one’s own invest-
ment decision, we also find that simply living near investment properties that are flipped also
induces investor entry. In this latter case, the infected individual can observe the investor’s
return on the flipped property from the publication of transactions prices (which were easily
available online during this period) regardless of whether they ever interacted directly. On
this point, it is further suggestive that we measure the property effect to be strongest during
the period of most rapid price appreciation in 2004-2006, when especially large returns would
have been routinely observed.12
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our source data and the
construction of the estimation sample in detail. Section 3 describes the research design, gives
evidence in support of its identifying assumptions, and presents our estimates of investor
contagion, closing with a simple and straightforward way to gauge the overall magnitude
of contagion’s effect on the housing market in general. Section 4 compares the investment
performance of influenced investors compared to all other investors in the housing market.
Section 5 concludes. The appendices contain a Monte Carlo study of our estimator, described
below, and additional figures and tables referenced throughout the paper.


2      Data
In this section we introduce the data and describe in detail how we construct our sample of
investment properties and investors (both potential and actual) in the housing market.


2.1     Overview of Sample
The primary data set that we have assembled for our analysis is based on a large database of
housing transactions compiled by Dataquick Information Services, a national real estate data
company, which acquires data from public sources like local tax assessor offices. Our sample
includes the complete universe of housing transactions in the five largest counties in the Los
Angeles metropolitan area (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura),
from 1988 to 2012. For each transaction, the data contain the names of the buyer and seller,
the transaction price, the address, the date of sale, and numerous property characteristics
including, for example, square footage, year built, number of bathrooms and bedrooms, lot
size, and, importantly for our purposes, the latitude and longitude of the parcel.
    From the original census of transactions, we drop observations if a property is a condo-
minium, was subdivided or split into several smaller properties and re-sold, the price of the
  12
     The investor neighbor effect tempers during this period, perhaps because existing investors were becoming
less sanguine about the potential for future returns.

                                                      7
house was less than $113 or flagged as not an arms-length transactions, the house sold more
than once in a single day, the price or square footage was in the top or bottom one percent
of the sample,14 or there is a potential inconsistency in the data such as the transaction year
being earlier than the year the house was built. The remaining sample consists of nearly
five million transactions spanning 94 quarters (the data end in mid 2012), with roughly 50
thousand transactions per quarter. We report summary statistics below, after describing
additional sample selections.
    Because the Dataquick data set contains information on any liens registered against the
property (i.e., mortgage information), we are also able to attach information on the income,
race and ethnicity of homebuyers by matching Dataquick records to public data from the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for a majority of transactions. As we show in
Section 3 below, this demographic information allows us to examine household sorting at
fine levels of geography, thereby providing a direct check on a key assumption underlying our
research design.15
    As our paper focuses on the entry of new investors into a “bubble-like” market, we now
describe the price dynamics of the Los Angeles housing market during our period of study.
Figure 1 shows the basic dynamics of prices and transaction volume for the Los Angeles
metropolitan area over the study period. The price index is computed using a standard
repeat sales approach.16 Following a rapid increase in prices in the late 1980s, the early
1990s were a cold market period for Los Angeles, with prices declining by roughly 30 percent
between 1992 and 1997 and transaction volume averaging only a little more than 30,000
houses per quarter during this period. Transactions prices averaged $187,000 in the 1990s.
Starting in the late 1990s and continuing until mid 2006, the Los Angeles housing market
experienced a major boom, with house prices tripling (prices averaging $511,000 in 2006)
and transaction volume nearly doubling. Just two years later almost all of the appreciation
in house prices from the previous decade had evaporated and transaction volume had fallen
  13
     A nominal or zero price suggests that the seller did not put the house on the open market and instead
transferred ownership to a family member or friend.
  14
     These may reflect coding errors.
  15
     HMDA requires mortgage companies to report information about every mortgage application and these
data are made public on an annual basis. We merge HMDA data with Dataquick by matching on the basis
of lender name, loan amount, Census tract, and year following the procedure described in Bayer, McMillen,
Murphy, and Timmins (forthcoming). The merge results in a high quality match for approximately 75 percent
of the sample. The merge fails in some instances due to the lack of a unique match (e.g., if two Bank of
America loans for $250,000 are registered in the same Census tract) and in others due to the use of alternate
lender names in the two samples (e.g., for a subsidiary) that we were not able to verify as being part of the
same company. Summary statistics for housing attributes for the matched subsample are very similar to the
full sample as shown in Bayer, McMillen, Murphy, and Timmins (forthcoming).
  16
     In particular, the index is based on the year-quarter fixed effects in a regression of the log transaction
price on house fixed effects and year-quarter fixed effects.

2.2      Designating Investors and Investment Activity
The primary goal of this paper is to study investment activity in the housing market and, in
particular, to examine whether homeowners are drawn into speculative investing by observing
investment activity in their neighborhood. In this subsection we detail how we construct the
key variables for our analysis.
    Before proceeding, we emphasize our objectives and the potentially complicating factors
involved in achieving them. First, we want to use transactional data to identify whether a
homeowner is an investor in the housing market, and if so, when he or she became one. There
is no explicit designation of “investment” in the transactions data. Thus, we will need to
construct a portfolio of properties that each individual owns over the course of our sample–a
“profile”–and this requires us to match potentially multiple transactions to particular indi-
viduals. Of course, not every property that an individual owns is for investment purposes;
some may be their primary residence (and they may have multiple primary residences during
the sample if they move).17 Thus, for each person in the data we need a method for separat-
ing out, at each point in time, the primary residence from investment properties. Since the
  17
    While many individuals view their primary residence as “an investment,” we are interested in those
taking the next step in investing: buying additional properties as investments.

                                                              9
construction of many of these variables will rely on observing transactions and individuals
over time, there is an obvious potential for sample selection bias at the beginning of the data
(e.g., how could we know whether a person that is observed to purchase a home on the first
day of our data is buying that home as an investment or a primary residence?). Thus, we will
use the first half of the data as a “burn-in” period for constructing many of our variables.
    Next, we need to identify the possible channels through which each non-investor may be
influenced to become an investor. The two channels available in these data are whether a
neighbor begins investing in the housing market and if a nearby home is bought and sold
as an investment property. Thus, we will use our designations of which individuals become
investors (and when this happens), and which properties are transacted as investments (and
when this happens) to measure a potential investor’s exposure to each channel.
    We elaborate on these, and other data construction issues below. We also highlight how
the obvious possibilities for measurement error introduced by our sample creation will, in
general, bias our analysis towards not finding any effect of nearby investment activity on a
potential investor entering the market, thus implying that our estimates of causal effects are
conservatively measured ones.
    Our measures of investment activity are derived from buyer/seller names and transaction
dates observed in the Dataquick data. We build a profile of each individual’s holdings over
time by combining all of the property holding profiles associated with a given name. In the
data, buyer and seller names are detailed and typically include middle initials and often the
names of a spouse or co-borrower. In our analysis we are interested in individuals entering
the investor market, and so we use the names associated with each transaction to exclude
purchases by businesses, nonprofits, and various government organizations (“institutions”).
We conduct an extensive name cleaning algorithm to flag institutions, separate first, middle,
spouse, and surnames, and to standardize punctuation and spacing.18
    To provide a more detailed characterization of the data, Table 1 reports counts of obser-
vations by identification of name (post cleaning). We will refer back to this table a number
of times in this section. The full data set contains 3.8 million unique names conducting
nearly 4.8 million transactions. Of these, 3.6 million names are “personal names” (e.g.
George Akerlof) and not institutional names (e.g. First Bank of California). Among per-
sonal names, 57 percent include a middle name or initial, and three-quarters have a middle
name or initial and/or a co-owner name (such as a spouse). We treat names with co-owners
as distinct–“George Akerlof” and “George Akerlof and Janet Yellen” are two separate name
profiles–which means that we likely understate the count of investors, since in some cases,
the same Akerlof may be purchasing both properties.

     Given our use of name-matching to build portfolios, some misclassification of ordinary
home-owners as investors (and vice versa) is inevitable. In general, we expect such misclas-
sification to diminish the measured differences between investors and regular homeowners,
thereby attenuating our key parameter estimates. Below we illustrate the robustness of our
results to various potential sorts of measurement error. The corresponding results support
the natural intuition that misclassification error leads to conservative estimates of the main
effects presented throughout this paper.
     Table 1 reports counts of individuals and properties flagged as investments. About one
million of the transactions could possibly be categorized as investments, but a substantial
portion (45 percent) are purchases by institutions, which we exclude. Another five percent
are overlapping holdings for very common names (e.g. John Smith, Jose Lopez). In order to
avoid classifying two individuals with a common name as one investor, we exclude any single
name for which we observe more than 40 transactions. Hence, we focus on personal names
that are not excessively common.

    We use the complete profile of property holdings over time for each individual to construct
several important measures for our analysis. We begin by designating the set of individuals
that become “investors” at some point during the sample period. In general, any individual
that simultaneously holds two or more properties is designated an investor with two excep-
tions related to the possibility that individuals may jointly hold two properties for a brief

                                                            11
period in the course of moving homes within the metropolitan area. In particular, if the
individual’s original property is sold within six months of purchasing a second property, or
the original primary residence is sold within twelve months, and the second property would
be the individual’s only investment in our sample, then the corresponding brief period of
multiple holdings does not count towards the definition of an “investor.” Our goal here is to
be conservative in characterizing multiple holdings as investments rather than the result of
ordinary search frictions in the housing market.
    Having defined the set of individuals that become investors during the sample period, we
next characterize each individual’s “primary residence” and “investment properties.” Iden-
tifying the primary residence is important because it determines the point around which
we measure how exposed a homeowner is to nearby investment activity. For individuals
that never become investors this is straightforward, as we simply classify their only prop-
erty holding as their primary residence. For individuals that are classified as investors, we
are primarily concerned with properly designating their primary residence during the period
before they acquire multiple holdings. We treat the time from their first appearance in the
sample until they simultaneously hold multiple properties (i.e., become investors) identically
to non-investors, designating their single property holding as their primary residence, with
some important exceptions when we suspect that the initial property purchased in the sample
period itself may have been an investment property. This would be the case, for example,
for a property purchased by an investor from out of state or by someone who had purchased
their primary residence in the Los Angeles area prior to the beginning of our sample in 1988.
To minimize instances of mis-designating what may actually be an investment property as a
primary residence, we define an investor’s primary residence as unassigned in the pre-entry
period if any of the following conditions hold: (i) the individual was observed to purchase
multiple properties within the first six months of entering the sample, (ii) the individual pur-
chased multiple properties from the same seller in the same year, including one that would
have been designated as the primary residence, (iii) the initial property that would have been
designated as the primary residence was held for less than two years, or (iv) the time period
of the individual’s holding of multiple properties did not overlap with a non-investment prop-
erty. In using these restrictions, our goal is to avoid classifying a primary residence in cases
where the observed behavior looks suspiciously like that of an investor rather than regular
homebuyer.
    The lower panel of Table 1 reports counts of individual buyers and transactions in in-
vestment properties. For two-thirds of buyers with personal (and not excessively common)
names, we can confidently identify their primary residence prior at the time of entry. We
refer to an active primary residence (i.e. at a point in time after purchase, but before resale)


                                              12
as a “tenure.”
     We define all of the remaining overlapping property holdings of investors (other than those
designated as primary residences) as “investment properties.” Among investment properties,
we also designate whether a property was “flipped,” i.e., sold again after a holding period
of less than two years. This distinction is motivated by the possibility that this form of
investment behavior may have been particularly visible to immediate neighbors - especially
if the property was held empty during the investor’s holding period. Importantly, our measure
of flipped homes only counts these short-tenured sales of properties that have been classified
as investment properties. This distinguishes flipped investment properties from short tenures
by neighbors who may have had to re-sell quickly due to changes in life circumstances.
     Figure 2 reports the time series for three proxies for overall investment activity in the
Los Angeles market between 1993-2012 derived from our transaction data set.19 We report
counts of investment properties and then break out two subsets that are important for our
analysis: those with an identified primary residence for the investor, and those that were
flipped (i.e., re-sold within two years). The dynamics of the three series are very similar, with
a clear peak around 2006. Afterwards, counts began to fall, although investments actually
continued as a relatively high share of transactions.20 Our overall measure of investment
activity also tracks quite well that of Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and van der Klaauw (2011),
which is based on a measure of multiple property holdings reflected on individual credit
reports as multiple mortgage payments, providing further support that our name matching
procedure is reasonable.21
     In this figure one can see a “burn-in” period in how we construct our measures. As men-
tioned above, an obvious issue with our classification of primary residences and investment
properties is that we must observe overlapping properties to flag investment properties, and
the first purchase that we observe in the data for a given individual is assigned as the primary
residence, subject to our disqualifications. In this way, our measure of investment activity is
likely to understate the true measure, especially near the beginning of the sample period.22
  19
     As noted above, identification of investors is especially noisy in the first few years of transactions data.
  20
     While not the primary focus of this paper, it is interesting to note that investors remained quite active
in the post-peak period, buying and holding properties rather than re-selling them quickly. In this way,
investors may have helped to stabilize the market during the housing bust.
  21
     Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and van der Klaauw (2011) focuses on the early/mid 2000s, characterizing
national trends and those in “bubble states,” including California. In using a sample of credit reports, it
does not face the “burn-in” issue we describe in using name matches, but shows dynamics similar to those
we find.
  22
     To get a sense of whether our measures of investment activity are reasonable in this latter portion of the
sample period, we conducted a simple analysis of investment properties as a share of all quick sales (sales
within two years of purchase) observed in the data. The overall count of quick-sales, of course, does not
depend on our classification of investment properties. As expected, the ratio of these measures is initially
quite low and rising over time, presumably as a greater percentage of investment properties are properly


                                                       13
After growing mechanically in the early years of the transaction data, the counts of active
tenures stabilize around 2000, as shown in Figure 8 in Appendix B, further supporting our
focus on the period after 2000 when the construction of these measures of investment had
stabilized.
                            Figure 2: Investor Purchasing Activity Over Time.




NOTES: The figure plots three quarterly data series that measure investment activity. Definitions are given in the main text.
For investment properties, the timing is the quarter of purchase, and for flips it is the quarter of sale.


    Also speaking to this issue, Figure 3 displays the time series of the hazard rate of investor
entry behavior. For each individual homeowner with an active tenure, entry is defined as the
date of the purchase of a first investment property. The hazard rate measures the fraction
of active tenures who become new real estate investors in the given quarter. As in Figure 2,
there is a strong upward trend in entry by new real estate investors over the course of the
housing boom from 2000-2006, with a sharp falloff thereafter. Thus, the spike in volume in
the boom shown in Figure 2 is due in part to the increased rate of entry of new investors.
    In Table 2 we report summary statistics for transactions by personal names (i.e. not
institutions or excessively common names) over the entire sample period and in our focus
period of 2000-2007. In the main sample period, transaction prices are obviously higher,
but the composition of homes (by property attributes and adjusted values) is comparable.
Homes in Los Angeles tend to be newer and more expensive than those in many other U.S.
cities. The vast majority of buyers take out a mortgage, with an average loan to value ratio
classified. Importantly, however, this ratio levels off by 1995 and, in fact, this ratio is exactly 34 percent for
the periods 1995-2000 and 2001-2006, respectively - suggesting that the classification of investment properties
is likely quite consistent from 1995 forward. Still, to be conservative, we begin most of our analysis in 2000.

of 88 percent in 2000-2007. Homebuyers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area are racially
and ethnically diverse with an average income of $107,000 over the main sample period.23
     Table 3 reports summary statistics for the set of transactions we identify as investments
in the period 2000-2007. We report statistics for all investment properties in the period, and
also the subsets of properties for which we identified the primary residences of the investors
and those which are short-tenured “flips.” The sample of investment property transactions
is, in general, representative of the overall sample, though investment properties tend to be
slightly older, smaller, and of slightly lower value. The subset of investment properties for
which we have identified the location of the investor’s primary residence is presented in the
middle columns; the statistics are quite similar. The rightmost columns report statistics for
flips. Compared to other investment properties, these are slightly older, smaller, and lower
value, and are more likely to be purchased in cash.
     Table 4 reports the distribution of investors by their number of investment purchases.
Most investors in our sample purchased only one or two investment properties, though the
distribution has a long upper tail, with a handful transacting many, in some instances dozens,
of properties.24 While this upper tail of presumably more professional investors is interesting,
  23
     Data from HMDA started becoming available in the early 1990s, so there are some years in which no
HMDA match could take place. Match rates improved from the early 1990s to the 2000s.
  24
     Recall that any name with more than 40 purchases is excluded to avoid excessively common names.
Institutions are also excluded.

investors comprising the majority of this distribution.


2.3       Exposure to Neighborhood Investment Activity
Having characterized the primary residence of all non-investors and investors (when possible),
we define any homeowner observed in a primary residence as being “at-risk” of becoming a
real estate investor. Homeowners remain at-risk until they either (i) purchase an investment
property (as defined above) or (ii) sell their primary residence and leave the sample.25 Buying
a new primary residence keeps the person in the sample as a new at-risk tenure.
    We use the location of the primary residence of at-risk homeowners to construct two mea-
sures of exposure to nearby investment activity.26 The first is a measure of whether the indi-
vidual’s neighbors are engaged in real estate investment. In particular, we construct counts
  25
     As with the initial name-matching algorithm, we expect this procedure for defining homeowners “at-risk”
of becoming first time real estate investors to introduce a small amount of misclassification error into our
main analysis, as some investment properties purchased by individuals residing outside the study area or in
an existing home purchased prior to 1988 may be characterized as primary residences. We expect the number
of such misclassified investment properties to be a small percentage of the overall stock of “at-risk” primary
residences and for this error to attenuate the findings - in this case because the homeowner does not actually
reside in the location that we have designated as their primary residence.
  26
     We use the Great Circle distance calculated using the properties’ latitude and longitude information from
the tax assessor file.

of the number of neighbors who have entered–i.e., begun purchasing investment properties–in
a given period, constructing this measure for various distance bands around the individual’s
primary residence. Our second measure of neighborhood investment activity is based on
investment properties that are flipped within the individual’s neighborhood. In particular,
we construct counts of the number of investment properties that were sold in a given period
following a holding period of less than two years, again at various distance bands.
    These measures of exposure to investment activity will form the basis of our research
design, functioning as “treatment” and “control” variables depending on the exposure radius.
Note that each of these measures varies over both space (some neighborhoods have more
investment activity than others) and time (some periods have more investment activity than
others).
    We close this section by providing summary statistics of the two measures of investment
activity matched to at-risk tenures with plausibly identified primary residences for our pri-
mary estimation sample in Table 5. After discarding property tenures unlikely to be primary
residences as described above, or with investors observed to enter before 2000 and after 2007,
we are left with 2,114,646 unique at-risk tenures active sometime during the period of 2000-
2007. The typical at-risk is observed for nearly 50 months of the available 96 (with censoring
occurring at entry for investors), making nearly 105 million at-risk tenure-month observa-
tions. There are 62,906 observed entries, for a monthly hazard rate of six hundredths of one
percent.
    To each at-risk tenure month, we have matched the two forms of investment activity
occurring within one-tenth mile distance rings and in annual lags up to four years. In the
lower panel of Table 5, we report the summary statistics for exposure within a one year lag
for the 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mile rings–the treatments and controls in our primary estimation

specification.27 The level of exposure rises mechanically with the expanding radius, and
the outer rings are inclusive of the inner ring exposure. At the innermost ring, much of
the variation occurs at the extensive margin (zero exposure versus non-zero). Most at-risk
tenures have at least some exposure to investment in their broader neighborhood (defined
here as 0.5 mile radius). This offers intuition about the research design we employ, which
asks, of the activity occurring within the wider rings, what fraction is occurring within a
hyper-local (e.g. within 0.1 mile) radius? In essence, we will compare the investing behavior
for at-risk tenures with very local exposure to those without, conditioning on the amount of
exposure in the broader neighborhood.
    Table 15 in Appendix B provides the joint distribution of two forms of investment activity
at the 0.1 mile ring. While there is some overlap, the table shows these are distinct objects.28

     This also shows that investors do not necessarily purchase investments on their own blocks, which both
instills confidence that primary residence and investment properties are in indeed separately identified, and
introduces interesting avenues for future research regarding the spatial pattern of an investor’s purchasing.

3     Estimating Contagion in Speculative Real Estate In-
      vesting
3.1    Research Design
The primary goal of our analysis is to identify the causal impact of neighborhood investment
activity on the entry of homeowners into speculative real estate investing. Specifically, we seek
to examine whether at-risk homeowners are affected by the recent entry of their neighbors
into real estate investing and/or by observing homes being bought and quickly re-sold for a
profit in their neighborhood.
    The main challenges with identifying contagion along these lines is that (i) homeowners
are not randomly assigned to neighborhoods and (ii) unobserved factors operating at the
neighborhood level may affect the investment activity of all residents. Both of these issues
might give rise to correlation in investment activity at the neighborhood level that is not
causal.
    To deal with these issues, we follow a research design that has been used extensively in the
recent literature on neighborhood effects and local spillovers. The basic idea is to examine
the influence of hyper-local investment activity (e.g., on one’s own block) while controlling
for comparable activity on other nearby blocks. In practice, we will measure the effect of
activity within a radius of one-tenth of a mile (176 yards/160 meters, about the size of a
typical city block), while conditioning on activity in wider (e.g. 0.30 or 0.50 mile) bands, as
well as dummies for standard neighborhood definitions (ZIP code).
    Formally, there are two key identifying assumptions that underlie this approach. The
first is that household sorting (or other unobserved predictors of investment activity) does
not vary in a significant way across this geographic scale, due, for example, to the fact that
search frictions may limit a household’s ability to select the exact block on which they live.
That is, while a homebuyer may be able to identify a neighborhood in which they would
like to live, their ability to pick an exact block is limited by the homes listed for sale when
they are searching. The second identifying assumption is that neighborhood interactions take
place at hyper-local geographies. The effect that we estimate, for example, will contrast the
response of homeowners to activity within 0.10 miles with that just a bit further away. If
neighborhood interactions were not stronger at hyper-local geographies, the estimated effect
would be zero. Of course economic theory does not define the scale at which such interactions
truly take place, and so to the extent that they also operate (perhaps at a lower intensity)
at a broader geographic scale, our analysis will tend to understate the full size and scope of
these neighborhood interactions.


                                               20
    It is worth noting at the outset that these identifying assumptions are unlikely to hold
perfectly in the real world. We expect that there will be some block level sorting, however
limited, and neighborhood spillovers to decay with distance in a more continuous way, even if
they are much stronger among immediate neighbors. Intuitively, this research design draws
on the sharp contrast between the two spatial processes at play. That is, we expect the
correlation between the unobserved attributes of neighbors that might affect their propensity
to become real estate investors to be only slightly stronger on the same versus nearby blocks,
and we are interested in whether investment activity reveals a pattern of much stronger
correlation at very close geographic proximity.
    The following figures illustrate the basic idea of this research design using data from our
sample. First, to examine how the degree of household sorting increases with geographic
proximity, we compare homeowner’s attribute xi with the mean of those attributes within
successive annuli (i.e., open rings or “doughnuts”) of width d drawn around the homeowner’s
residence, x̄i,(n)d,(n+1)d , for (n = 1, 2, . . . ).29 We then take the average absolute value of the
differences between xi and x̄i,(n)d,(n+1)d over the sample for 20 (n = 1, . . . , 20) bins of 0.1 mile
rings (d = 0.1 mile). Figure 4 reports the proportional differences between a homeowner’s
and neighbors’ attributes as a function of the distance between the homeowner and the
neighbors. The figure reveals that for race/ethnicity and household income at the time of
purchase, this difference increases quite gradually with distance. That is, homeowners are
only slightly less similar, in terms of race/ethnicity and income, to their neighbors 0.1-0.2
miles away relative to neighbors within 0.1 miles, and again slightly less to those 0.2-0.3 miles
away, and so on. The figure also documents that there is virtually no distinction between
immediate neighbors’ initial home equity at time of purchase from that of neighbors further
away.
    In contrast, Figure 5 illustrates the relatively sharp increase in very local neighborhood
investment activity for at-risk homeowners who entered as real estate investors in a given
period. In particular, Figure 5 plots the difference in neighborhood investment activity within
the past year for at-risk homeowners who entered as real estate investors versus those who
did not become investors, again calculating these measures for the twenty 0.1 mile-wide rings
from 0.1-2.0 miles away. The graphs correspond to our two main measures of neighborhood
investment activity, (i) entry into real estate investment by immediate neighbors and (ii)
a quick sale of an investment property (“flip”) in the neighborhood. Figure 5 reveals a
difference at 2 miles, and a pattern of a slightly increasing differences as the geographic scale
closes from 2.0 to 0.5 miles that closely resembles the pattern in Figure 4.
 29
    For example, if X is income, x̄i,(2)0.1,(2+1)0.2 is the mean income in an annulus whose inner radius is 0.2
miles and outer radius is 0.3 miles.

    Strikingly, as the geographic scale shrinks even further, the differences in exposure to
both measures of recent neighborhood investment activity rise sharply. In this way, Figure 5
implies that those at-risk homeowners who became first-time real estate investors in a given
period were much more likely to have been exposed to neighborhood investment activity
at very close proximity to their homes than those at-risk homeowners who did not become
investors. Importantly, by controlling directly for investment activity within 0.30 or 0.50
miles, all of the results that follow isolate as the causal effect only the sharp increase in entry
associated with neighborhood activity at a very fine geographic scale (0.10 miles).
    While these figures provide some initial perspective on the assumptions underlying our
analysis, in the analysis that follows we also present a number of robustness specifications
that provide additional evidence that the key assumptions underlying our research design
appear to be plausible.
    Finally, we conduct an additional Monte Carlo-style placebo test of our inner/outer ring
research design that further supports this approach as a way to identify causal effects of
neighborhood activity on an individual’s likelihood of becoming an investor. A description
and the results of this test are provided in Appendix A.


3.2     Baseline Results
We now present our main results based on estimating regression specifications that relate
entry as a real estate investor to measures of recent neighborhood investment activity, ex-
ploiting the inner/outer ring research design. The level of observation is the monthly at-risk
tenure, which is defined as any active tenure in which the homeowner has not yet engaged
in real estate investing. The primary specification is a linear probability hazard regression
that relates investor entry to recent neighborhood investing activity. We focus on the pe-
riod 2000-2007, which includes the period of house price appreciation and overall increase
investing activity, for the entire greater Los Angeles area.30
    In this hazard specification, there is both spatial and temporal variation in the level of
housing activity. Thus, we can identify an effect by comparing two at-risk tenures, one with
neighbor investors and one without, or by comparing the propensity of an at-risk individual
to enter when there has been recent investing activity to a period when there was not. As
Table 5 showed, entry is an uncommon event, especially when measured at the monthly level.
Over the entire period of 2000-2007, the average monthly entry rate was 0.06 percent.
    We begin by using a one year lag, so that the righthand side variables are counts of invest-
  30
    There may be interesting heterogeneities in the degree to which types of households or neighborhoods
are susceptible to nearby influence, but we leave these for future work.




                                                  23
ment activity occurring within the last year.31 The distance bands are defined inclusively,
so that any activity in the inner band is also measured in the outer band. Thus, coefficients
can be interpreted as the additional impact of the inner band beyond that of being included
in the outer band.
    Table 6 reports results from our main specifications. It includes results from each type
of treatment, nearby neighbor investors and nearby flipped properties, jointly in the same
regression.32 Coefficient estimates are followed by hazard ratios, the change in propensity
to enter attributable to the explanatory variable(s) relative to a baseline unexposed at-risk
tenure. The results presented in column 1 show that there is a positive and significant effect
of activity within 0.10 mile on the propensity to enter as a real estate investor in a given
month. The results are easiest to interpret when expressed relative to the baseline unexposed
hazard of becoming an investor in a given month. The coefficients imply an increased hazard
of 15 percent when a neighbor becomes an investor, and a 22 percent increase from having a
flipped property in one’s immediate neighborhood.
    Column 2 utilizes our inner/outer band research design, adding controls for activity within
0.30 miles and 0.50 miles. Controlling for these broader neighborhood measures reduces the
estimated impact of each measure of exposure by about half. Measured as a percentage
increase in the baseline hazard, each investor neighbor in one’s immediate neighborhood
increases the propensity to enter in a given month by 8 percent, while each property flip
increases it 9.3 percent. As discussed above, we take this to be a conservative estimate of
the causal impact of one additional investor neighbor or flipped property on investor entry.
    Columns 3 and 4, respectively, add year-quarter and ZIP code fixed effects, and Column
5 includes both.33 The coefficients and hazard ratios are very stable, indicating that the
outer ring research design has effectively controlled for both spatial and temporal trends in
exposure. It is interesting to note that the 0.50 mile coefficients fall with the inclusion of both
the ZIP code and quarterly dummies specification in column 5, while the 0.10 mile points
remain stable. This suggests that ZIP code fixed effects and the 0.50 mile bands function
similarly as controls. We adopt the specification reported in column 3, with 0.30 and 0.50
band controls and quarterly dummies, as our preferred specification.
    To further illuminate the spatial dimension of the effects documented in Table 6, Table 7
  31
     The count ignores investments that occurred before the at-risk tenure was active (e.g 11 months ago
when the tenure was active for only 10 months) since these would not actually be observed by the at-risk
homeowner. We include dummies for early in the at-risk tenure to account for the associated censoring. We
also exclude the first six months of the at-risk tenure from the estimation.
  32
     Results are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively larger, when using separate specifications to measure
the effects of each type of exposure.
  33
     We use the baseline hazard rate from column 2 so that hazard ratios are interpretable across specifications
with and without fixed effects.

reports the results of a set of simple specifications that consider the impact of nearby activity
for different distances in space. Table 7 shows how the effect of neighborhood activity in the
past year decays with distance. Consistent with the results presented above, the impact of
local activity falls to zero by 0.3-0.4 miles, conditional on the outer ring of 0.5.
    Because the extent of household sorting falls off so gradually (Figure 4), it is very difficult
to rationalize the pattern of results presented in Tables 6 and 7 with a sorting-based expla-
nation. Likewise, the possibility that some unobserved factor was responsible for generating
the correlation between both measures of recent neighborhood investment activity and the
at-risk homeowner’s entry to real estate investing would have to be incredibly special - having
an impact confined to only the households and/or properties on a single city block.

    To illustrate the time-dimension of the effect of neighborhood investing activity, Table
8 shows how the impact of activity within 0.10 miles decays with additional lags of time
since the activity took place. The full impact of exposure to an investor neighbor or flipped
property is realized over three years, but falls to zero thereafter. Nearby investment activity
is positively temporally correlated, so when jointly included, the year-by-year coefficients are
smaller than the single year of Table 6, but the cumulative effect is more than twice that

                                                            26
of Table 6. The cumulative effect of a nearby flip or a neighbor investor is about a 19-20
percent increase in the likelihood of entering as an investor in each case. Interestingly, the
impact of having a new neighbor investor accumulates more slowly over three years, while
the impact of a nearby flip is largely realized within two years.
    That the estimated effects fall to zero at either a distance of 0.40 miles or time greater
than three years strongly supports the notion that the geographic location of investment
activity is not correlated with the underlying propensity of homeowners to become real
estate investors. If the correlations were spurious and there was no causal effect of very
nearby and recent activity–that is, if investment activity occurred in neighborhoods that
contained homeowners especially likely to become real estate investors–we would expect to
see a fair amount of lingering positive correlation at wider distance bands and longer lags
presented in columns 4 of these tables.

    Table 9 examines how the effect size changes over time by estimating the hazard re-
gressions separately for three, three-year intervals. The hazard ratios are also computed
separately by interval, since the baseline entry rate changes over time. The effect of nearby
flipped properties (lower panel) within 0.10 is much stronger near the peak of the boom in
2004-2006, which was also when exposure was highest (Figure 2). In contrast, the impact of


                                                            27
neighbor investors (upper panel) is largest at the beginning of the time period in 1998-2000
and declines as the boom nears the peak. While the impact of neighbor investors remains
positive throughout the entire boom, the effect is roughly half the size in 2004-2006, compared
with 1998-2000.
   Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that potential novice investors
may have received very different signals from nearby flips versus investor neighbors as the
market reached its peak in 2004-2006. Essentially any property that was sold after a relatively
short holding period between 2004-2006 would have resulted in a massive return for the
investor and, thus, might have been especially attractive as a signal of potential gains for
new investors. In contrast, (at least a subset of) experienced investors may have become less
sanguine about the potential for large returns as the market reached its peak and became
more tempered in encouraging their novice neighbors to get into real estate investing. These
results are consistent with the notion that a learning mechanism is in play.

3.3      Tests of Research Design and Robustness of Main Results
Table 10 presents a number of additional robustness checks related to sample selection.
(Column 0 gives the baseline results from Table 6 above.) The first two columns check the

                                                            28
sensitivity of the baseline results to our ability to identify at-risk tenures in the data. Section 2
described how we inferred whether the purchaser of the home was at-risk (i.e. used the home
as their primary residence).34 The data contain two other sources of information, though
also imperfect, on whether the property was owner-occupied. First, the HMDA data match
includes a flag for whether the loan application was for an owner-occupied home. Second, the
assessor data match includes information on the owner’s home mailing address; matching this
to the property address gives another indicator for whether the home is considered owner-
occupied.35 The results in columns 1 and 2 imply that limiting our analysis to these tenures
that meet these more stringent definition of an at-risk homeowner does not materially affect
our results; the effect sizes are very similar to the baseline estimates reported in the first row
of the table.
    The next three columns, 3-5, consider the name matching algorithm used to infer invest-
ments. Column 3 drops any investor whose properties span an area wider than 50 miles,
under the suspicion that these may be two different individuals with the same (relatively un-
common) name. The loss of observations is small, indicating this is of low incidence, and the
effect sizes are quite similar. Column 4 uses only names with middle names/initials and/or
spouses listed, since these are less likely to be duplicated. The effect size is slightly smaller
for flips, but larger for investor neighbors, especially as measured by the hazard ratio. Col-
umn 5 drops any names that are combinations of common names, defined as both first and
last being in the top 20 percent of names observed in the data. Recall that we have already
excluded any name with more than 40 properties attached, which removed common names
like John Smith and Jose Lopez. This is an additional flag for a name like Michael Thomp-
son, where Michael and Thompson are common, but Michael Thompson was not so common
as to already be removed.36 This drops an additional 2 million monthly observations, with
virtually no effect on the results.
    Finally, we use the neighborhood similarity measures constructed to make Figure 4 to
classify at-risk tenures as more or less similar to their neighbors. We standardize the at-
tributes and add the (absolute value of) the deviations between the 0.1 and 0.1 to 0.3 mile
rings to create a “similarity index.”37 We then repeat the analysis for the 75 percent of
  34
     Note that we also must observe the investor’s primary residence to include him in the spatial match of
the investor neighbor righthand side variable. These sample selection checks refer to inclusion of the at-risk
tenures (lefthand side variable).
  35
     Note that because the assessor data is overwritten each year by Dataquick, it reflects information from
2011. As a result, this measure or owner-occupancy can only be used for tenures that persist into the 2011
assessment year, limiting the number of observations for which this flag is useful primarily to those late in
the sample.
  36
     The commonality of first (and last) names was calculated ignoring the presence of middle names/initials
or spouse names.
  37
     The results are quite similar when using 0.1-0.5 mile differences, and when weighting the index by the


                                                     29
tenures that are most similar to their neighbors. The effect on flips is negligible, and the
effect on the investor neighbors is slightly reduced,38 suggesting that even in areas where
there is the least sorting, we find very similar results to those from our baseline analysis.
    Lastly, we investigate the robustness of our analysis to alternative binary choice models
and functions of exposure to investment activity. Our main results use a linear probability
model with counts as the explanatory variables. This is for computational reasons, ease of
interpretation, and to avoid an incidental parameter problem when including large numbers
of fixed effects. We check the robustness to functional form in Table 16 in Appendix B. The
table reports results from a linear probability model with an indicator variable for the inner
ring, as well as those from alternative nonlinear binary response models (probit and logit).
The results are all quite similar to those from the baseline specification.
    While the point estimates move up and down slightly across the specifications reported
in Tables 10 and 16, taken as a whole, they strongly support the robustness of our baseline
results to a number of potential measurement and specification issues.


3.4     The Impact of Investor Contagion
The regressions above measure whether there is a statistically meaningful effect of exposure
to an investor neighbor or flipped property on entry probability. We next use these point
estimates to calculate the magnitude of the effect of the contagion mechanism on total investor
entry and purchase volume. The aggregate effect depends on (1) the effect on propensity
measured in the regressions, and (2) the degree of exposure to each of the treatments. From
Table 5 above, we see that in the years 2000-2007, typical exposure to investor neighbors was
0.28 within 0.1 miles, and 0.18 for exposure to flipped properties, although exposure rates
vary over time (Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, we calculate the additional entry propensity for
each month and report averages over several ranges of years. It is important to note that
the following is purely an accounting exercise at observed volumes and prices, and we do
not attempt to counterfactually predict real estate prices or buy/sell behavior at alternative
prices or number of investors.
    We can write the change in entry propensity as

                                       ∆rdt = ρId,T XtI + ρFd,T XtF
                                                                      
                                                                                                          (1)
attributes’ power in predicting investor entry.
  38
     The reduction appears to be the result of changing the set of neighborhoods included in the sample
rather than a violation of the identifying assumptions. When limiting the sample to ZIP codes with more
inner/outer similarity, but including the more dissimilarly situated at-risk tenures themselves, the estimates
are similar to column 6.

where XtI and XtF indicate exposure to an investor neighbor or a flipped property, respec-
tively, at time t. The increase in hazard rate as reported in the regression tables above is
represented by ρId,T (investor neighbors) and ρFd,T (flipped properties); these are indexed by
the distance radius admitted, d, and the effect length measure, T . We present the results for
the full three-year impact horizon, using only the innermost ring (0.1 mile) effect (Table 8).
    The results are reported in Table 11. The first row reports the simple monthly average
increase in the likelihood of investor entry. Using the innermost ring of 0.1 mile, the typical
Los Angeles area at-risk tenure is 8.1 and 10.4 percent more likely for the periods 2001-03 and
2004-2006, respectively, to become an investor because of the presence of the neighborhood
contagion effect.39
    The second row of Table 11 shows the cumulative impact of the contagion mechanism
on the volume of investor purchases, including any additional investment beyond the pur-
chase made at entry. About one-third of investors entering in the years 2001-2006 purchase
more than one property, and of these investors, the mean number of investment properties
purchased is 2.9.40 The calculation of contagion’s impact on purchases is determined by the
effect on cumulative entry and how likely these active investors are to purchase additional
properties after their first. We write the impact on volume at time t as

                                                      t−1

where vs>1 represents the additional purchases by active investors. We find that neighborhood
contagion increased the number of investment purchases by 10 percent over the period 2001-
2006.
   Aggregate effect size depend critically on exposure rates, yet the exposure rates reported
above account only for investors we have been able to spatially match, i.e., those with their
primary residence identified. However, we know these are not the only investors operating in
the Los Angeles market. If we were to scale our estimates to include investors for whom we
have not confidently identified a primary residence, the estimated average increase to entry
would rise to 13.7 percent and the increase in purchases would rise to 14.7 percent in the
2004-2006 period.
   Another way to measure the magnitude of the contagion effect is through an epidemi-
ological concept known as the “basic reproduction rate,” the number of new cases that an
  39
     We have also calculated the cumulative increase in the size of the investor pool over the reported time
periods. This is in principle different from the likelihood-of-entry calculation, because it is weighted by the
number of at-risk tenures present each month. However, since the count of at-risk tenures is very stable
between 2001-2006 (as shown in Figure 8), the magnitudes are quite similar to the first row of Table 11.

     Recall that our designation of investors limited the number of investment properties to a maximum of
40.

infected case will create.41 The reproduction rate depends on (1) the transmission rate, (2)
the contact rate, and (3) the incubation period. The transmission rate is our point esti-
mate from Table 8 with the associated incubation period of 36 months. There are two forms
of transmission–investor neighbors and flipped properties–and we need to scale the latter
transmission rate by the probability that an investment property is flipped (sold within 24
months). The contact rate is simply the number of households within a distance ring d;
that is, a measure of property densities. The density varies spatially and will therefore be
different for each specific case, but for simplicity we use the simple average to find the typical
magnitude. Together, the average number of new investors one entry creates is measured as

months of s, as 24 months or less triggers the transmission at rate βd,T      . The sale propensity
after holding for t months varies over time with the price cycle, but for simplicity we will
use the average sale probabilities over the time periods reported in the table. (For investors
entering 2001-2006, the probability that an investment property is sold within two years is
about 0.25.) Finally, Cd is the contact rate, the number of at-risk tenures within distance d.
The typical property in the greater Los Angeles market is exposed to 54.7 other properties
within 0.1 mile.
    The third row of Table 11 reports the results from this calculation, revealing that an
entering investor produces 0.15 new investors through contagion, combining the impact on
his neighbors and the impact of his purchases on the surrounding at-risk tenures. Using the
inverse of this statistic, this means that about every six investors will generate a new investor
purely through neighborhood contagion.


4       Neighborhood Influence and Investor Success
While the language of “contagion” may seem pejorative, it is not obvious a priori whether
investors susceptible to influence in their immediate neighborhood should perform better or
worse than other investors. On one hand, extremely local information may be especially
salient and useful, while on the other, the influenced investors may be naı̈vely mimicking
behavior around them without any special skill or insight. This is, in principle, an empirical

question. The goal of this section is to examine the subsequent performance of investors that
are drawn into the real estate market because of the influence of neighbor investors or nearby
flipped properties.
    The analysis presented in this section reports the results of regressions that relate various
aspects of an investor’s performance to measures of neighborhood investment activity at the
time of investor entry. To isolate the performance of those drawn into real estate investing by
their immediate neighbors, we follow a similar research design to that used in Section 3 above,
inferring causal effects by estimating the impact of hyper-local neighborhood investment
(within 0.10 miles) while controlling for the same measures of investment at slightly larger
distance bands (0.50 miles).
    Accurately measuring the impact of being drawn into real estate investing by neighbor-
hood investment activity requires one additional adjustment relative to the specifications
reported in Section 3. In essence, when analyzing the impact of neighborhood influence on
investor performance, we must account for the fact that the exposure to nearby investment
activity only raises the likelihood of entry fractionally: many potential investors who are
exposed would have entered anyway as a result of the baseline rate of investor entry during
this period, and some exposed at-risk tenures will not enter. Thus, to properly estimate
effects for those actually drawn in by neighborhood activity, we must scale the magnitude of
the measures of neighborhood investment activity by the inverse of the estimated cumulative
marginal effect of investment activity on entry from a comparable specification in Section
3. This adjustment is analogous to accounting for the impact of the instrument in the first
stage of a two stage least squares regression.
    Finally, all of the analysis reported in this section of the paper conditions on the time
of investor entry to allow for different cohorts to have varying levels of sophistication.42 In
  42
       As noted in the discussion of Table 6, conditioning on the outer ring exposure already accounts for most


                                                             34
this way, all estimates are implicitly based on the returns of investors drawn into investing
through the neighborhood contagion mechanisms relative to all other investors that entered
the market in the same period.


4.1     Return on Re-Sold Properties
We begin our analysis of investor performance by examining various components of the
investor’s return for properties that were re-sold during the sample period in Table 12. Sub-
sequent tables will also examine the likelihood that investors continued to hold properties
through the peak of the housing boom and whether they eventually defaulted.
    The first column of Table 12 reports results for the overall returns for homes purchased
by real estate investors between 2000-2006. The results imply that, relative to other real
estate entrants, investors that were drawn into the market as a direct result of neighborhood
investment activity do markedly worse. In particular, those drawn in by exposure to investor
neighbors realize returns that are 16 percentage points lower than the typical investor, while
those drawn in by observing a nearby flipped property experience total returns that are 9
percentage points lower.43
    To further understand the basis for these lower returns, columns 2 and 3 of Table 12 report
results for two specific elements of the total return: the amount that investors pay when they
buy the property relative to expected market price and the amount they receive when they
sell the property (again relative to market). Note that this conditions on market timing and
measures performance stemming from the transactions themselves. These results indicate
that investors drawn into the market by both types of neighborhood investment activity
perform worse than other investors when both buying and selling properties. Homeowners
drawn into investing by observing nearby flipped by properties pay an especially high price at
the time of purchase - 6.6 percent more than other investors, while the comparable number
for those drawn in by neighbor investors is 4.1 percent. Investors drawn in through both
neighborhood channels sell their properties for 2-4 percent less than other investors.
    By comparing the results from column 1 to those shown in columns 2 and 3 it is also
possible to infer the relative market return of investors drawn in by neighborhood activity
compared to other investors, which is a function of both the timing and location of their pur-
chases. The calculation of this remaining portion of the total return that is not attributable
to buying relatively high and selling relatively low implies that investors drawn in by either
form of neighborhood activity earn about an 8 percent lower market rate of return on their
of the time variation anyway.
  43
     On an annualized basis, the effects sizes are returns lower by 7 and 4 percentage points, respectively, for
investor neighbor and flip influence.


                                                      35
holdings relative to other new investors.
    It is interesting to note that these effects seem confined to the boom and bust period
of the 2000s. We do not find materially different outcomes for influenced and uninfluenced
investors in the 1990s, as Table 17 in Appendix B shows.

4.2      Holding Properties Past the Peak
The results presented in Table 12 reveal that investors drawn into the market through the
neighborhood contagion mechanisms perform significantly worse than other investors across
each dimension of buying and selling for properties that were re-sold during the sample
period. But conditioning on the set of properties that were re-sold potentially masks another
important part of performance: the propensity to re-sell properties in time to avoid the severe
drop in prices in the subsequent housing bust.
    To examine differences in selling behavior just before the market peak, Table 13 reports
a series of specifications that examine the extent to which investors continued to hold the
properties that were purchased in the pre-peak years of 2004-2006 before the market collapsed.
    The specifications reported in Table 13 follow the same structure as those reported in Ta-
ble 12 but consider several different dependent variables. In particular, columns 1-3 examine
whether investors held the property through 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, while column
4 considers whether the investor held the property past the point where the housing price
index for the corresponding county fell below the “break-even” point at which the investor


                                                               36
had purchased the property.44 The table reports the marginal effect for each specification,
implying that those investors drawn into the market in 2004-2006 by their neighbors were
14.4 percentage points more likely to continue to hold their investments through 2009, while
those drawn in by observing nearby flipped properties were almost 13 percentage points more
likely to hold their properties through 2008 and 2009. The magnitude of these effects suggest
that the investors pulled into the market through the neighborhood contagion mechanism
were far less skilled in anticipating the market peak than other investors that entered at the
same time.

4.3      Equity Stake and Default Behavior
The results presented in Table 13 clearly show that the amateurs drawn into the market
through neighborhood contagion were less able than other investors to foresee the market
peak in time to sell their holdings. Yet if these investors had a limited equity stake in their
properties (i.e., had put very little down on their mortgage at the time of purchase), the
resulting losses from the severe decline in housing prices in the bust may have fallen on the
lenders that had initially extended them credit (or, more accurately, the eventual holders of
  44
    All five Los Angeles area counties peaked in Q2:2006, though the rates of ascent before, and descent
after, varied slightly between them.



                                                           37
these mortgages).45
     Table 14 presents the results of three regressions that relate the relative size of the initial
equity stake and the likelihood of foreclosure for investors drawn into the market by neighbor-
hood investment activity versus other investors. The analyses include controls by purchase
year by county to allow for varying access to credit over time and space.46 Column 1 reports
the results of a regression of downpayment percentage on our usual measures of neighborhood
investment activity, implying that those influenced by neighborhood investment activity had
down payments that were five percentage points lower than typical investors. (From the mean
transaction prices for investment properties in Table 3, five percent is $17,500 less equity, on
average.) Similarly, column 2 reports the marginal effects of a regression of whether investors
purchased homes with very low levels of equity (less than 5 percent down). These results
imply that investors associated with the neighborhood contagion mechanisms were eight to
ten percentage points more likely to be very-low-equity investors and, thus, had relatively
little of their own money at stake.
     The final column of Table 14 examines the likelihood of foreclosure directly, reporting
a comparable set of marginal effects to those reported throughout Section 4. We measure
foreclosure in the data by identifying instances in which a property was re-sold with an
institutional seller name instead of the initial buyer’s name (indicating, e.g., a bank took
control of the property). The results show that investors drawn in by their investor neighbors
or drawn in by observing nearby flipped properties are indeed 4 percentage points more likely
to default on their investment properties (though the investor effect is towards the boundaries
of standard statistical significance with the extensive controls we include). These represent
a rather large effect relative to our measure of the overall default rate of 8.7 percent.
     The results of Table 14 provide a bit of a silver-lining for investors drawn in through
neighborhood contagion relative to other real estate investors, suggesting that they risked
less of their own money and, in fact, defaulted at a higher rate than other investors, thereby
sharing some of the downside of their investments with their mortgage holders.
  45
     It is important to note that regardless of their initial equity stake, investors would have had a strong
incentive to sell before the market peak if they had been able to foresee it. Selling before the collapse in prices
would have preserved not only their initial down payment but any of the substantial market appreciation
that had occurred just prior to the peak and allowed them to avoid any of the costs of default, such as a
worse credit scores.
  46
     We retain the outer ring exposure controls, which again soak up broad neighborhood variation.

5      Conclusion
It is a widely-held notion that financial crises and bubble-like episodes often feature conta-
gion in investment behavior. Colorful anecdotes about novice investors being drawn into a
market by others date back to some of the earliest accounts of historical asset price bubbles.
However, despite the long-standing theoretical interest in asset price dynamics, and asset
pricing models’ incorporation of these types of contagion effects, the existing evidence on
actual investor contagion is just that: anecdotal.
    This paper provides some of the first evidence of contagion in investment behavior us-
ing a research design that credibly isolates causation from correlated investment activity
across individuals. We focus on the recent boom and bust in the U.S. housing market and
consider whether individual households become investors in the housing market due to the
activity of other investors. Our approach to credibly identifying such contagion in invest-
ment behavior relies on a nearest-neighbor research design that identifies the causal effect
of nearby investment activity on a potential investor’s behavior by estimating the effect of
hyper-local investment activity while controlling for similar measures of activity at a slightly
larger neighborhood. Moreover, we advance the literature on “peer effects” in investing by
documenting the poor performance of the “influenced” investors - this is critically important
for understanding the effects of investor contagion during bubble-like episodes.


                                                        39
    Using our research design, we show that a contagion effect was present, the magnitude was
large even under a conservative measurement, and that the segment of investors drawn into
the market via the actions of others performed worse than other investors. A natural question
one might ask is how exactly the influence occurs. The empirical literature on peer effects in
investing usually cannot distinguish between social learning and social utility mechanisms,
and in this paper, neither can we. However, we suspect that social learning is relatively more
important in our context. First, there is a large theory literature on speculative bubbles that
often features such learning; second, there are numerous ways that this type of learning could
take place (e.g., novice investors could change their beliefs about market fundamentals by
observing others’ actions, or learn practical tips for investing); and third, we find that simply
living near to homes that are flipped also influences investment behavior, especially during
the periods of most rapid price growth. Nevertheless, we believe that precisely separating
out the origins of the speculative contagion we identify in this paper is an exciting area for
future work.

A     Placebo Tests
As a falsification test of our main results, we calculate a false exposure measure by randomly
drawing an at-risk tenure’s inner ring (0.1 mile) exposure to both flips and investor neighbors
conditional on their actual outer ring exposure. For example, if an at-risk tenure is exposed
to 3 flips within 0.5 miles, we randomly draw how many of these are within 0.1 mile according
the actual distribution of inner/outer exposure in the data. We then estimate comparable
hazard regressions using this false-exposure data set.
    In Figure 6, we report the distribution of the inner hazard effect from 100 draws of
the false-exposure data set. The placebo effect is centered tightly around zero, with the

                                              43
actual estimated effect far higher than even the largest placebo estimate. Alternatively,
Figure 7 presents the full distribution of both the false and actual data hazard estimates for
250 draws of one-tenth subsets of the at-risk tenure data. Here too, the placebo estimate
is approximately centered at zero, showing that our research design produces an unbiased
estimator. Moreover, the actual data produces a distribution that is clearly to the right of
the false exposure for both types of investing activity, indicating that homes actually exposed
to very nearby investing activity are significantly more likely to become investors themselves.
    While this cannot identify the actual mechanisms at work–information sharing, word-
of-mouth influence, etc.–the results of the placebo test are strong evidence of causal effects
occurring within the narrow ring, city-block level of geography that induces homeowners to
engage in investing activity.

NOTES: The figure displays the distribution of the hazard estimator for the false (placebo) exposure to investment activity.
The distribution comes from 100 random draws of placebo inner ring (0.1 mi.) exposures over the full data set. The vertical
lines indicate the means, while the solid black vertical line is the estimate from the full data sample (Table 6).
