Net Fiscal Stimulus During the Great Recession

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper studies the patterns of fiscal stimuli in the OECD countries propagated by the global crisis.
Overall, we find that the USA net fiscal stimulus was modest relative to peers, despite it being the
epicenter of the crisis, and having access to relatively cheap funding of its twin deficits. The USA
is ranked at the bottom third in terms of the rate of expansion of the consolidated government consumption
and investment of the 28 countries in sample. Contrary to historical experience, emerging markets
had strongly countercyclical policy during the period immediately preceding the Great Recession and
the Great Recession. Many developed OECD countries had procyclical fiscal policy stance in the same
periods. Federal unions, emerging markets and countries with very high GDP growth during the pre-recession
period saw larger net fiscal stimulus on average than their counterparts. We also find that greater net
fiscal stimulus was associated with lower flow costs of general government debt in the same or subsequent
period.

    I. Introduction

    In the wake of the global crisis of 2008-9 there has been an intense debate about the efficacy
of fiscal policy and the size of the fiscal multipliers (Ilzetzki et al., 2010 and the references
therein). This paper takes a positive perspective on these issues by focussing on measuring and
comparing the size of the net fiscal stimuli across countries. The impact of a given increase in
government spending (G) on GDP equals the fiscal multiplier times the net fiscal stimulus, i.e.,

∆GDP = Fiscal Multiplier * ∆G. While much of the debate has focussed on the size of fiscal
multipliers, having a measure of the magnitude of fiscal stimuli enacted is a necessary condition
for understanding the impact of fiscal policy.

    With this premise, we investigate a host of important positive questions associated with
fiscal stimuli during the Great Recession. First and foremost, we ask which OECD countries had
the largest fiscal stimuli during the Great Recession and which countries simulated least. We ask
whether the USA, a country that was the epicenter of the crisis, and a country that has enjoyed
the exorbitant privilege (i.e., relatively easy funding of its fiscal and current account deficits),
engaged in larger fiscal stimuli than other countries. Second, taking the benchmark of the
previous literature regarding the historical procyclicality of fiscal policy in developing countries,
and countercyclicality of fiscal stance in the OECD countries (Kaminsky et al., 2004 and the
reference therein), we rank countries by the revealed countercyclicality of their fiscal stimuli
during the Great Recession. We ask whether we observed the old patterns of procyclically fiscal
policy in developing countries during the Great Recession. Other questions we explore in this
paper include: did the federal structure of a country matter for the net fiscal stimulus? What is
the association between the fiscal stimuli and the flow costs of servicing the public debt? What
explained the net fiscal stimulus at the consolidated level – federal or state spending? Did the
response of state spending to GDP growth differ in the Great Recession from previous
recessions?

    To answer these questions about the size of the fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession,
we use quarterly data on the pure fiscal expenditures of the consolidated government, the central
government and the state and local governments for OECD countries. Pure fiscal expenditure is
the real consumption and investment expenditure (Cg + Ig) at any level of government. It is the


                                                   2
‘G’ or the consolidated government expenditure in the national income identity, which is
relevant for computing the neo-Keynesian fiscal multiplier. We refer to increases in G as ‘net
fiscal stimulus’. It is important to remember that the ‘G’ in the national income identity does not
include transfers – unemployment benefits, financial bailouts, etc. – and therefore these are
excluded from this study.

        OECD members include some countries that are also considered emerging markets, like
Korea, Mexico, Chile and Turkey. Some OECD members are federal unions or ‘federations’, i.e.,
they have a constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers between the center and the regional
governments, like the USA, Canada, Australia, etc, while others are non-federal unions.1 This
heterogeneity allows us to look at differences between different groups of countries. We are
particularly interested in comparing federations with non-federations because in Aizenman and
Pasricha (2010), where we looked at pure fiscal expenditures in USA alone, we conjectured that
the moral hazard concerns in a federal union may provide one explanation for the lack of a large
fiscal stimulus there.

        The results provide mixed, complex and somehow surprising mapping of these issues.
Overall, we find that the net fiscal stimulus in the USA was modest at best, despite the country
having being the epicenter of the crisis, and having access to relatively cheap funding of its twin
deficits. The USA is ranked at the bottom third in terms of the rate of expansion of the
consolidated government consumption and investment of the 28 countries in sample, well below
the largest spenders, i.e., Portugal, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Chile and Canada. Contrary to
historical experience, emerging markets had strongly countercyclical policy during the period
immediately preceding the Great Recession and the Great Recession. Many non-emerging
OECD countries had procyclical fiscal policy stance in the same periods. Contrary to the US
experience, federal unions on average saw larger net fiscal stimulus than their counterparts. We
also find that greater net fiscal stimulus was associated with lower flow costs of general
government debt in the same or subsequent period, contradicting the view that markets penalized
countries that expanded spending during the Great Recession.

  The list of federations is from Treisman (2000). Spain is excluded as although it is a de-facto federation,
it is not a constitutional one. See Table 1 for a list of countries in sample and their classification into
different groups.

    II. Data

       Our sample consists of all OECD countries for which quarterly data on pure fiscal
expenditures for the consolidated government (G) or its components was available. The list of
countries and the beginning and end dates for which quarterly data on G was available are in
Table 1. The table also lists whether the country falls in any of the three groups – Federation,
Emerging Market Economy (EME) or European Monetary Union (EMU). There are 7 emerging
markets and 7 federations in the sample. Data for all countries ends in 2010Q1 or 2010Q2. The
longest available series is for the United Kingdom, for which data since 1955 is available, and
the shortest series is for Chile, starting in 2004. We also have data on pure fiscal expenditures of
central government (Gc= Ccg + Icg) and state and local governments (Gs = Csg + Isg) for six
countries, Australia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom and USA.

       All data are in real terms, seasonally adjusted, and at annual rates. The data was collected
from national sources and Thomson Financial’s Datastream, IMF’s International Financial
Statistics, OECD Stat, EuroStat and DataInsight. For countries for which non-seasonally adjusted
data was available from the source, the G, Gc and Gs series were adjusted for seasonality using
Census X12 method. As far as possible, the seasonal adjustment was done after converting the
series to real terms. For conversion into real terms, where possible, series specific deflators were
used (e.g.: government consumption deflator for government consumption series and
government GFCF deflator for government investment series). When separate consumption and
investment deflators for each level of government were not available, government consumption
or government expenditure deflators for the same level of government were used to deflate the
pure fiscal expenditures at each level of government. For the central and state level data, general
government deflators were used if that was the only series available. Finally, for countries for
which none of the government expenditure specific price deflators were available, the GDP
deflator was used to convert the G, Gc and Gs series to real terms.

       The NBER dated the most recent recession in the USA (also referred to as the Great
Recession) from 2007Q4 to 2009Q2. However, due to lags in policy formulation and
implementation, we measure the fiscal stimulus over the entire period since 2007Q4 over which
we have data, i.e. 2007Q4-2010Q1. We also split the period into two: 2007Q4-2008Q4, and




                                                 4
2009Q1 to 2010Q1. The changes in pure fiscal expenditures during the latter period are more
likely to reflect the policy response to the recession.

We use the data on pure fiscal expenditures to address 5 questions:

       1.       Which countries delivered a large net fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession?
       How did the growth of the pure fiscal expenditure during this period compare to its
       growth and to GDP growth during the pre-crisis period?
       2.       Was the average fiscal stimulus different between emerging markets, federal
       unions, EMU countries and their counterparts?
       3.       To what extent was fiscal policy at the consolidated government level
       countercyclical, in the cycle consisting of the expansionary phase pre-2007 and the
       contractionary phase since?
       4.       How was the net fiscal stimulus associated with the flow cost of public debt faced
       by countries?
       5.       What drove the net fiscal stimulus at the consolidated level – federal or state
       spending? Did the response of state spending to GDP growth differ in the Great
       Recession from previous recessions?




    III.     On the size of the net fiscal stimulus across countries
       Portugal, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Chile and Canada saw the fastest growth in G over
the period 2009Q1-2010Q1, whereas Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Poland, Austria and Italy saw a
contraction of G over the same period. The USA saw the 9th lowest rate of expansion of G of the
28 countries in sample. Moreover, in nine countries - Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland,
Iceland, Italy, Poland, Turkey and USA - the average growth of G during 2009Q1-2010Q1 was
lower than the mean GDP growth during pre-crisis period by more than one standard deviation.


       To compare the size of the net fiscal stimuli across countries, we look at the growth rates
of consolidated government real consumption and investment expenditures over the Great
Recession and its sub-periods. We compare this growth across countries and for each country
over time.



                                                  5
       Figure 1 plots the growth rates of each country’s G over the period 2007Q4-2008Q4 and
2009Q1-2010Q1. The growth rate used in the figure is the compound annual growth rate
(CAGR). A CAGR of x% between 2007Q4-2008Q4 implies that if the G during 2007Q3 grew at
a constant rate of x% compounded annually over the next five quarters, it would reach the level
that it was in 2008Q4. It applies a constant annual rate of growth over each year in the period, to
the value at the beginning of the period. The reason for using CAGR, rather than an average of
quarterly growth rates is that such an average does not tell us whether the G at the end of the
period was higher or lower than the G at the beginning of the period.2 The average of quarter-on-
quarter (QoQ) growth rates can be positive even if the value at the end of the period is lower than
the value in beginning of the period.
       Due to lags in formulation and implementation of fiscal policy, we consider the latter
period, 2009Q1-2010Q1 as the period in which one would expect to see in the data, a policy
driven response to the crisis. Accordingly, the countries in Figure 1 are ranked based on their net
fiscal stimulus during the period 2009Q1-2010Q1. Of the 28 countries in the figure, the six
countries on the extreme left saw a decline in G over the period 2009Q1-2010Q1. These 6
include the countries that had or have since had sovereign debt crises in this period - Greece,
Iceland and Ireland – but also Poland, Austria and Italy. Greece had the largest negative net
stimulus over this period, with a contraction of G at a rate of 15.8 percent per annum.
       Twenty two out of the twenty eight countries in Figure 1 saw a positive growth of G
during 2009Q1-2010Q1, i.e. the G in each of these countries was higher in 2010Q1 than it was in
2008Q4. At the far right in the figure are the countries that had the highest net fiscal stimuli.
These were: Portugal, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Chile and Canada. Three out of the 5 largest
stimuli were in emerging economies. Growth rates of G in Portugal, Australia, Mexico and
Korea averaged close to 10 percent per annum over this period.
       The USA, which saw the worst recession since the Great Depression is ranked 9th from
the bottom. Its G grew at a compound annual rate of only 0.31 percent over 2009Q1-2010Q1.
Germany had a growth of G over the same period that was almost 10 times as large, at 2.81

                                                         4            
                                                                      
2                          Ending Value  Number of         Quarters 
  The CAGR is computed as                                                -1 and expressed as a percentage.
                           Beginning Value 
When measured over 4 quarters, this would be the same as percentage change over the 4 quarters. Here,
the value is measured over 5 quarters, so using the CAGR rather than the percentage change allows
express the rate of change as percent per annum.


                                                      6
percent. In many countries in the figure, including all that had a negative net fiscal stimulus in
the period 2009Q1-2010Q1, and also including the USA, the discretionary response to the
recession seemed to involve a curtailment in the growth of G, as the growth rate of G during
2007Q4-2008Q4 is higher than the growth rate over 2009Q1-2010Q1. However in other
countries, for example, Hungary, Portugal, Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan and Denmark, the
net fiscal stimulus during 2009Q1-2010Q1 involved a reversal of the decline in G over the
previous period, or an increase in its rate of growth.
       The figure underscores the fact that the fiscal response to the Great Recession differed
greatly across the OECD countries. The net fiscal stimulus during 2009Q1-2010Q1 varied from
-16 percent in Greece to 12 percent in Portugal. Out of twenty eight OECD countries, 16
countries saw their growth rate of G decline in the second half of the Great Recession period and
10 countries had growth gates of G close to zero (including the USA). Just as the expansion in
fiscal spending during the recession was not uniform across countries, the need for consolidation
after the recession also varies, and fiscal retrenchment everywhere post-crisis may be
unwarranted.
       Next, we compare the growth of G in each country during the Great Recession quarters
with its growth and with GDP growth in the period immediately preceding the Great Recession.
Using the standard deviation of quarterly growth rates, we construct confidence intervals around
the average growth rates during the pre-Great Recession period for each country. If the average
growth rate of G during the Great Recession lies above these confidence intervals, it indicates a
large stimulus push during the Great Recession, and vice versa.
        In table 2, we construct confidence intervals for the average quarterly growth of G, based
on the mean and standard deviation of the quarterly growth rates of G during the period 2004Q1-
2007Q1. Only two countries, Australia and Canada, saw an average quarterly growth of G during
2009Q1-2010Q1 that was more than one standard deviation higher than the average growth
during the pre-crisis period. For the USA, the growth during 2007Q4-2008Q4 was more than one
standard deviation higher than the average growth during the pre-crisis period, but during the
2009Q1-2010Q1, the average quarterly growth rate slowed to 0.31 percent per annum, lower
than the average growth during 2004Q1-2007Q1 of 0.81 percent per annum. Greece, Iceland and
Austria had negative growth rates of G that were more than one standard deviation lower than
the average growth rates during the pre-crisis period.



                                                  7
       In table 3, we construct the confidence intervals based on the pre-crisis GDP growth. If
the GDP had continued to grow at the pace it was growing at in the pre-crisis period, keeping the
growth of G within these confidence intervals would have kept the expected size of the
government stable with respect to GDP. Five countries – Australia, Canada, Chile, Korea and
Portugal – had an average QoQ growth of G during 2009Q1-2010Q1 that was more than one
standard deviation higher than the average GDP growth in the pre-recession period, indicating an
effective stimulus effort in these countries. On the other hand, in nine countries - Austria, Czech
Republic, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Poland, Turkey and USA - the average growth of G
during 2009Q1-2010Q1 was lower than the mean GDP growth during pre-crisis period by more
than one standard deviation.
       These tables suggest that the growth rate of G during the Great Recession were
significantly larger than in the pre-recession period in only a handful of countries, and in fact did
not exceed the trend they would have followed had the government tried to stabilize the G/GDP
ratios with the expectation that the pre-crisis GDP growth would continue.


   IV. Net fiscal stimulus across groups of countries
       Federal unions, emerging markets and countries with very high GDP growth during the
pre-recession period saw larger net fiscal stimulus on average than their counterparts.



       In order to better understand whether countries that shared certain characteristics were
more likely to deliver a large net fiscal stimulus, we look at the average fiscal stimulus across
different groups of countries. We consider 6 groups of countries:

       1.      Federal Unions vs. Non-Federal Unions
       2.      European Monetary Union (EMU) countries vs. non-EMU countries
       3.      Federal Unions in EMU vs. Federal Unions not in EMU
       4.      Emerging Market Economies (EME) vs. Non Emerging Markets
       5.      High Growth vs. Moderate Growth countries. High growth countries are those that
               had an average QoQ growth rate of GDP per capita during the period 2004Q1-
               2007Q1 in the top 25 percent of such growth rates for all countries in sample.
               Low growth countries are those that had an average QoQ growth of GDP per



                                                  8
               capita in the bottom 25 percent of GDP growth rates during the same period, and
               all countries between 25th and 75th percentiles are in the moderate growth
               countries group. The list of countries included in each group is in appendix table
               A1.
       6.      Low Growth vs. Moderate Growth countries.


       Figure 1 compares the relative average QoQ growth of G over these groups. The figure
shows that in federal unions, the average growth in G during the pre-recession period, 2004Q1-
2007Q1 was lower than in non-federal unions, but during the recession period, 2007Q4-2010Q1,
the average growth rate of G in federal unions was about twice that in non-federal unions. This
suggests that a federalist structure by itself was not an impediment to a large net fiscal stimulus.
       EMU countries had a rapid increase in G in the pre-recession period, with average
quarterly growth rates over twice the average growth in non-EMU countries, but during the
recession period, their average growth in G was less than half the size of the average growth in
non-EMU countries. The same pattern holds if one compares only the federal unions amongst
EMU countries against non-EMU federal unions. This suggests that EMU countries – whether
federal unions or not - were relatively fiscally profligate in the pre-recession period, (and perhaps
as a result) more conservative during the Great Recession period.
       Emerging economies, on the other hand, saw relatively slower growth of pre fiscal
expenditures at the consolidated government level in the pre-crisis period, despite having higher
GDP growth rates in this period. Perhaps this fiscal restraint in the good times allowed them to
deliver a substantially larger net fiscal stimulus than non-EMEs during the Great Recession. For
countries that were in the high or low growth categories during the pre-recession period also,
fiscal expenditures of the consolidated government grew at a relatively slower pace during the
pre-recession period but relatively faster during the recession period.

       Not all of the differences in average growth are significantly difference from zero, due in
part to the large differences between countries within groups, and over time. Table 6 presents the
t-tests for the difference in average growth rates during different periods, between groups of




                                                  9
countries.3 During the pre-recession period, federal unions saw significantly slower growth and
high growth countries saw significantly faster growth in G than their counterparts. In the
recession period 2007Q4-2010Q1 also, countries that had seen higher growth in the pre-
recession period also saw significantly larger net fiscal stimulus, as did emerging market
economies.4 Non-EMU federal unions also saw significantly faster growth of G during the full
recession period, 2007Q4-2010Q1 and during 2009Q1-2010Q1, than federal unions that are also
part of EMU.

        To summarize, a federalist structure by itself was not an impediment to a large fiscal
stimulus during the Great Recession – to the contrary, federal unions were fiscally more
conservative in the pre-recession period but delivered a significantly larger stimulus during the
Great Recession period, than other countries. Being part of EMU, however changed things. EMU
countries- whether federal unions or otherwise – were fiscally profligate during the pre-Great
Recession period and fiscally more conservative during the Great Recession period. The
Emerging economies were relatively fiscally responsible during the pre-recession period, and
delivered larger stimuli during the Great Recession period, perhaps explaining their faster
recovery. This suggests a countercyclical fiscal policy in emerging economies on the whole. In
the next section, we measure the degree of countercyclicality for each country.



    V. On the countercyclicality of fiscal policy in different countries
        Emerging markets had strongly countercyclical policy during the period immediately
preceding the Great Recession and the Great Recession. Many non-emerging OECD countries
had procyclical fiscal policy stance in the same periods, contrary to historical experience.
      A large body of empirical literature suggests that historically, fiscal policy has been
countercyclical in the developed countries, and procyclical in emerging and developing
economies (Kaminsky et.al., 2004 and references therein). To test whether and to what extent
fiscal policy was countercyclical between the expansionary phase immediately preceding the
Great Recession and the Great Recession period, we compute the amplitude of fiscal policy for
each country, as in Kamisky et. al. (2004). This measure is the difference between the

  The t-tests are conducted on annual data, to smooth over large variations in quarter-on-quarter growth
rates within the year.
4
  The two groups overlap to a large extent.


                                                    10
(compound annual) growth rate of G during the ‘good time’, 2004Q1-2007Q1 and its growth rate
during the ‘bad time’. We consider two periods to measure the growth rate during the ‘bad
time’: the full recession period, 2007Q4-2010Q1 and only the later period, 2009Q1-2010Q1, to
allow for lags in fiscal policy. A negative number indicates a countercyclical policy, as the G
grew faster in bad times than in good times, whereas a positive number indicates a procyclical
policy. 5
        The amplitudes for different countries are plotted in Figures 2 and 3. For the period
2007Q4-2010Q1, Figure 2 shows that over half the countries in sample had a countercyclical
policy, with the strongest countercyclicality being in Mexico, Australia, Korea, Finland, Portugal
and Germany. The most procyclical policy was in Greece, Ireland, Hungary, Iceland and Turkey.
        The USA also had a mildly countercyclical policy over these periods. However, this
effect was entirely due to the expenditures during 2007Q4-2008Q4, which may have been
determined before the crisis started. When only the second half of the recession period is
considered – 2009Q1-2010Q1, Figure 3 shows that USA was among the 13 countries that had a
procyclical policy stance, as the G of the consolidated government grew faster during 2004Q1-
2007Q1 than it did during 2009Q1-2010Q1. Of the 7 countries in the sample that are also federal
unions, three – USA, Belgium and Austria – had procyclical fiscal policy over the cycle, whereas
four – Mexico, Australia, Canada and Germany – saw countercyclical fiscal policy.
        Going beyond the most recent business cycle, we compare the cyclicality of fiscal policy
in the past recession periods with the Great Recession. To do so, in Tables 4 and 5, we compute
correlations between GDP growth and G growth during the pre- and post-2007 periods, for
different groups of countries using two different definitions of recession periods.
        In table 4, we define recession periods as periods with at least two consecutive quarters of
negative GDP growth for all countries except the USA. For the USA, NBER recession dates are
used. For these recession periods, we compute the correlation between quarterly percentage
change in GDP and the one year forward expansion in G, using two measures of such change.
The first block in table 4 uses the year-on-year (YoY) change in (or the CAGR of) G between the
fourth quarter from the recession quarter and the recession quarter. The second block averages
the QoQ change in G over the four quarters after the recession quarter. For federal unions, the

5
 In Section III, we looked at growth rates of G during the Great Recession quarters only. In this section,
we compare this growth with growth during the pre-Great Recession period, with other recession periods
only and with other expansion and contraction periods.


                                                    11
correlation between recession quarter declines in GDP and average YoY forward change in G
was negative and of comparable value in the pre-2007 and the Great Recession periods. For
emerging markets, the correlation in the pre-2007 period is positive but in the Great Recession
period is negative. However, these correlations are not significantly different from zero using
any measure, indicating large differences between countries. The results are slightly different
when average QoQ growth rates are used (with negative correlations in both periods), but as
discussed earlier, the CAGR gives more accurate information about the change in G over the
entire period in question. For non-emerging OECD countries, the pre-2007 correlation
coefficient was negative and significant, indicating a countercyclical fiscal policy, but positive
and not significantly different from zero during the Great Recession period.
        In Table 5, we present the correlations of the cyclical components of GDP and
consolidated government G, after extracting the trend using Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. Here,
the results are a bit different. For federal unions, the correlations in both periods (i.e., pre- and
post- 2007) are positive, whereas for non-emerging OECD, they are negative and significant in
both periods. For emerging markets, the fiscal policy is strongly countercyclical in the post-2007
period. There are two potential sources of the differences in results between the two tables: one,
that the correlations using the HP filtered series uses information on good times as well as bad
times, and two, that the correlations using cyclical components do not allow for lags in
implementation of policy.


    VI.     Net fiscal stimulus and the flow costs of public debt
        Greater net fiscal stimulus was associated with lower flow costs of general government
debt in the same or subsequent period.
        We now turn to the question of whether countries that enacted larger fiscal stimuli had to
face higher borrowing costs, i.e., we ask whether there was a positive association between the
size of the net fiscal stimuli and the flow costs of public debt. The flow cost of public debt is the
primary surplus the government needs to generate every year in order to keep the debt-GDP ratio
constant. It is defined as the difference between the real rate of interest on general government
bonds (r) and the real GDP growth rate (g), multiplied by the debt GDP ratio for general




                                                   12
government debt (d). 6 Table 7 presents the correlations between net fiscal stimulus and the same
period, and next period flow cost of public debt. These correlations are computed for the net
fiscal stimuli during each of three periods, 2007Q4-2008Q4, 2009Q1-2010Q1 and 2007Q4-
2010Q1. The top panel of the table presents the same period correlations between net fiscal
stimulus and the same period flow cost of public debt. These are negative and significant for all
periods under consideration, indicating that higher fiscal stimuli were associated with lower, not
higher, flow costs of public debt in the same period.
        However, correlation is not causation. The negative correlation is consistent with higher
stimuli leading to lower flow costs of public debt, or with lower flow costs allowing higher
stimuli to be enacted. In order to shed some light on the question of whether fiscal stimuli led to
lower borrowing costs, in the lower panel, we compute the correlations between the net fiscal
stimuli and the next period costs of public debt. These correlations are also all negative and two
out of the three are also significantly different from zero.
        Figure 5 clarifies the negative association. In this figure, we plot the compound annual
growth of G during 2007Q4-2010Q1 and the average of the flow costs over the same period. The
countries with very large contractions of G during this period had very large flow costs of public
debt , whereas countries with very large expansions of G during this period (Chile, Mexico,
Australia, Korea, Poland) had very low, close to zero or negative flow costs. In Figure 6, we look
at what is driving the flow costs by plotting its components over the period 2007Q4-2010Q1.
The countries with the highest average flow costs had a combination of high interest rates and
low real GDP growth rates, whereas for countries with the highest net fiscal stimuli, the real
interest rate was similar to that in medium flow costs countries but the real GDP growth rate was
considerably higher.
        Figure 7, which is from Aizenman and Pasricha (2010) places the current flow cost in the
context of the future projected costs, based on projected debt for 2015 and historical realizations
of (r-g) for each country. It shows that for most countries with low delivered stimulus,
particularly the USA, the future expected flow costs of the public debt are also low, indicating

  As in Aizenman and Pasricha (2010), the interest rate used is the interest rate on local currency
government bonds of the maturity closest to the effective maturity of government debt in each country.
The nominal interest rates were converted to real rates by subtracting the rate of change of GDP deflator.
Both the r and g series are available at a quarterly frequency by the debt GDP ratio is available at annual
frequency. For data sources of each of the three series, r, g, and d, see the appendix.


                                                    13
that the current or expected flow costs need not have constrained the size of the net fiscal
stimulus.


    VII.    Central and state level spending in the delivery of net fiscal stimulus

       We turn now to the question of who delivered the stimulus – whether it was delivered by
central or the regional governments. The data on central and state level pure fiscal expenditures
was available for six countries – Norway, USA, United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland and
Australia, of which USA and Australia are federal unions. In Table 8, we present the compound
annual growth rates of real GDP and of Cg + Ig for each level of government for the three
periods, 2007Q4-2008Q4, 2009Q1-2010Q1 and 2007Q4-2010Q1. Figures 8 and 9 plot the Cg +
Ig growth over the period 2007Q4-2010Q4 and over 2009Q1-2010Q1 for all three levels of
government. USA and Iceland were the only two countries of the six in which the state and local
level spending fell over any of the three periods, and in both these countries, state and local level
spending contracted in each of the three periods. In USA, an expansion in federal spending
prevented a contraction in consolidated government spending in each of the three periods, as
state and local level spending was falling. Australia saw the largest net fiscal stimulus of these
countries. In Australia, central as well as state and local level spending increased by over 9
percent during 2009Q1-2010Q1. The trends in government spending over the full recession
period for each country can be seen in Figure 10.

       To gauge the degree of countercyclicality of fiscal policy for each of the countries, in
Figures 11 and 12, we plot the ratio of the growth rates of Cg + Ig and real GDP, for each level of
government, for the period 2007Q4-2010Q1 and 2009Q1-2010Q1. Norway, Sweden and UK had
countercyclical fiscal policy at each level of government during2007Q4-2010Q1, whereas
Australia had a procyclical fiscal policy, since its real GDP expanded over this period. In the
USA, state and local level spending contracted, and the net fiscal stimulus was entirely the result
of an expansion of federal spending. During 2009Q1-2010Q1, four countries, Australia, Sweden,
Iceland and USA appear to have procyclical fiscal policy at the consolidated level. However,
each had quite different experiences. In this period, GDP in the USA expanded and state and
local spending continued to contract. Australia and Sweden, real GDP also expanded along with




                                                 14
Cg + Ig at each level of government. However, in Iceland, real GDP as well as Cg + Ig at each
level of government fell.

       This leads to the question of whether the central and region spending patterns during the
Great Recession were comparable to those in the previous recessions. In Table 9, we present
panel regressions, using fixed effects estimators, for explaining changes in G, Gc and Gs during
recession periods before 2007 and during the Great Recession. The left-hand side variable is the
quarter-on-quarter change in Cg + Ig for the given level of government, in the fourth quarter from
each recession quarter. The explanatory variables are the quarter-on-quarter change in real GDP
during the current recession quarter, and its two lags and leads. For the state and local level
spending, the partial correlations with real GDP are either not significantly different from zero,
or positive and significant at 10 percent level of significance, indicating a procyclical fiscal
policy at the state and local level on average. The central level changes in spending are not well
explained in the pre-2007 period, and during the Great Recession, are countercyclical to two-
quarter lagged GDP but procyclical to 3-quarters lagged GDP. The consolidated government
spending was negatively related to two-quarter or four-quarter lagged GDP during the Great
Recession, but not in the pre-2007 period, during which the only significant association is
positive.




    VIII. Conclusions

       The main results of this paper are:

       1. The countries with the largest net fiscal stimuli during the Great Recession were
            Portugal, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Chile and Canada. Six out of 28 OECD countries
            had negative net fiscal stimuli. These were Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Poland, Austria
            and Italy. The USA is ranked 9th from the bottom in the size of its net fiscal stimulus.
       2. Federal unions, emerging markets and countries with very high GDP growth pre-
            Recession enacted larger stimuli on average than others.
       3. Emerging markets enacted strongly countercyclical fiscal policy during the business
            cycle consisting of the pre-Great Recession and the Great Recession periods, whereas
            several developed OECD countries had a pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance.


                                                  15
       4. Larger net fiscal stimuli were associated with lower flow costs of public debt in the
            same and the subsequent periods.
       5. There was no significant net fiscal stimulus without help from the regional
            governments.

       The above results describe the patterns in the distribution of net fiscal stimuli in OECD
countries during the Great Recession. However, why these patterns exist is an open question, in
need for future research. We close the paper with an outline of some of the underlying issues.
The overall timid fiscal stimuli of the developed members of the OECD (including the US)
relative to emerging markets may be either the outcome of a well functioning automatic
stabilizers in the higher GDP per capita countries, or possible overreaction of developed OECD
countries that switched from fiscal laxity during the great moderation to relative fiscal frugality
during the Great Recession. While Greece and Ireland had very limited fiscal space during the
Great Recession, this seems not to be the case with most other OECD countries. The evidence
of the relatively low projected flow cost of servicing the future public debt for about half of the
OECD countries raises related questions. The fiscal fatigue of various OECD counties in 2010
may reflect cautious prudent approach, possibly due to concerns about the greater exposure to
downside risks associated with aging population and an over-extended welfare state.
Alternatively, it may reflect overshooting of policymakers’ reactions, where fiscal issues that
were swept aside during the great moderation period became the focal point of the present debate
in the aftermath of the crisis.

       Arguably, the resilience of the emerging markets relative to the developed OECD
countries may reflect the lessons of the crisis of the 1990s, when emerging markets found that
fiscal excesses and balance sheet exposure entail large downside risk. In contrast, most
developed OECD countries viewed the 1990s and the first half of 2000s as affirmation of their
sound fiscal positions. This reflected an optimistic assessment of future, propagated by the
presumption that the great moderation would endure. In addition, the Euro project probably led
to under-pricing of public debt in non-core countries, masking their growing fiscal
vulnerabilities. The degree to which the Great Recession would lead to enduring fiscal
consolidation in OECD countries without overshooting in the short-run remains an open
question.

Note: The t-tests use the variation in annual average of quarter on quarter growth rates of consolidated government
real consumption and investment expenditures for each country to test for difference in group means over each
period, assuming unequal variances between groups. See footnotes to Figure 4 for definitions of various country
groups. Group 1 is the first group mentioned in the row titles. For example, in the first row, group 1 refers to federal
unions and group 0 is the alternative group, in this case, non-federal unions.

Note: CAGR is the compound annual growth rate over the period, r is the real rate of interest on local
currency government bonds of maturity closest to the average effective maturity of central government
debt for each country, g is the growth rate of real GDP and d is the gross debt of the consolidated
government as a percentage of GDP. For more details on these variables, see data appendix. Values in
red correspond to a p-value less than 0.10.

Note: The graph plots the relative average quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth of consolidated government C+I over
the relevant period and country group. For example, the blue shaded bar labelled FU/NFU plots the average QoQ
growth of G for countries that are federal unions divided by the average of such growth for non-federal unions in the
sample. The abbreviations are: FU=Federal Unions, NFU=Non-Federal Unions, EMU = European Monetary Union
countries, NonEMU = Non-EMU countries, EMU_FU = countries that are in EMU and are also federal unions
(Austria, Belgium and Germany), NonEMU_FU = Non EMU countries that are federal unions (Australia, Canada,
Mexico, Sweden, USA), EME = Emerging market economies, Non-EME = non-emerging market economies,
HighGr = countries that had an average QoQ growth rate of GDP per capita during the period 2004Q1-2007Q1 in
the top 25% of such growth rates for all OECD and federal union emerging economies in the sample. MedGr group
includes countries that had GDP per capita growth defined as above, between 25th and 75th percentiles and LowGr
countries are those whose GDP per capita growth was below the 25th percentile of average GDP per capital growth

Note: Average (r-g)*d, 2007Q4-2010Q1 is the flow cost of consolidated government debt, measured by (real interest
rate-real GDP growth rate)* Debt/GDP, averaged over the period 2007Q4-2010Q1. The Debt/GDP ratio uses the
gross debt of the consolidated government and is available at an annual frequency. All other variables are measured
at a quarterly frequency.

Note: The Figure is from Aizenman and Pasricha (2010). Countries are sorted by the lowest to highest average over
all years. The gross debt burden representing the lowest (best scenario) and the highest (worst scenario) flow costs is
calculated by taking the lowest and the highest historical values, respectively, of the r-g, and multiplying it with the
projected 2015 gross government debt to GDP ratio. Real rates for Austria are based on the average return on bonds
with maturities greater than one year for 1970-1982, and with a 9-10 year maturity for 1983-2010. Real rates for all
other countries are the real rates on the maturity closes to the most recent average maturity of consolidated
government debt in Table 2 of Aizenman and Pasricha (2010). The growth rate of GDP deflator was used to convert
nominal interest rate to real rate.

Note on the treatment of financial and non-financial sector bailouts during the crisis.


The infusions of money by the governments into financial or non-financial corporations during
the crisis are not included in the consumption and investment expenditures of the government sector.
Such transactions, whether they involve loans or acquisitions of equity, are included in the
financial accounts of the government. They typically involve the exchange of one asset (for
example, cash) for another (e.g.: equity or loan) and do not constitute spending. However, to the
extent that the government provides a subsidy (for example, pays above the market price for
equity), this subsidy is recorded in national income accounts as a capital transfer by the
government. Again, since Cg + Ig excludes capital transfers, these figures do not include the
bailouts. However, all administrative costs of such transactions are recorded as usual in either
compensation of employees or use of goods and services and are included in Cg + Ig.

The only exception to the above would be if the government ends up owning the enterprise fully
and it is not classified as a ‘public corporation’, but as a government department.7 However,
during this crisis, most interventions by governments were considered to be temporary and a
decision was taken by the statistical authorities in the US, UK and EU to not include any such
interventions in the national accounts, except to the extent described above. This may change in
the future, for example if at some point, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac become classified as part
of the government sector.

For detailed discussions of the national income accounts and the treatments of financial bailouts
in each of the above three regions, see the following documents:

Note: The average growth rate is the average over the period of the quarter -on-quarter growth rate. High
growth group has countries whose average growth rate exceeded the 75th percentile of growth rates across
countries (all the rates in the table above). Low growth group includes countries whose average growth rate
was below the 25th percentile of the growth rates in the table above.

                      adjusted for seasonality using Census X12
                      method. As far as possible, the seasonal
                      adjustment was done after converting the series to
                      real terms. For conversion into real terms, where
                      possible, series specific deflators were used (e.g.:
                      government consumption deflator for government
                      consumption series and government GFCF
                      deflator for government investment series). When
                      separate C and I deflators for each level of
                      government were not available, government
                      consumption or government expenditure deflators
                      for the same level of government were used to
                      deflate C+I at each level of government. For the
                      central and state level data, general government
                      deflators were used if that was the only series
                      available. Finally, for countries for which none of
                      the government expenditure specific price
                      deflators were available, the GDP deflator was
                      used to convert the C+I series to real terms for
                      each level of government.
