How Do Youth with Mental Disorders Fare in the Juvenile Justice System?

                                              ABSTRACT

¸

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between mental health problems and justice
outcomes. Several studies have documented that individuals with a variety of mental disorders are
overrepresented in the justice system. This pattern could result if persons with mental disorders are
more likely to commit crimes, or more likely to commit serious crimes, than persons without disorders.
 In addition, individuals with mental disorders may be more likely than those without disorders to
be sanctioned conditional on committing a particular crime. The major public policy concern is around
the latter possibility, which has been interpreted as the justice system being biased against those with
mental disorders. In this paper we explore several channels through which mental health problems,
measured as ADHD and depression, may lead to over-representation in the criminal justice system.
 Using a large sample of adolescents, our findings show that youth with ADHD fare worse in the juvenile
justice system in terms of the probability of being arrested and the probability of conviction once arrested.
 We find that elevated ADHD symptoms during adolescence are associated with statistically significant
and meaningful increases in the probability of arrest and conviction after controlling for preexisting
factors and mechanisms that may arise from the disorder itself.

1. Introduction

       Rates of mental illness among incarcerated populations are more than twice as high as in

the general U.S. population (Teplin, 1990; Robins and Regier, 1991). An estimated 10-16

percent of all individuals in the criminal justice system have a severe mental illness (Guy, et al

1985; Teplin 1990; Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999), which corresponds to approximately

700,000 to 1.1 million severely mentally ill individuals across jails, prisons, and probation. 1 The

fact that individuals with a variety of mental disorders are overrepresented in the justice system

also has been documented in studies (Teplin et al, 2002; Wasserman, et al, 2002). How can such

a pattern be explained? Are persons with mental disorders more likely to commit crimes, or

more likely to commit serious crimes, than persons without disorders? Or are individuals with

mental disorders more likely than those without disorders to be sanctioned conditional on

committing a particular crime? The major public policy concern is around the last possibility,

which has been interpreted as the justice system being biased against those with mental disorders

(Massaro, 1999). Despite such concerns, there have been few systematic comparisons of persons

with and without mental illness in the justice system, and almost no information is available

about mechanisms that may lead from mental health problems to subsequent over-representation

in the criminal justice system.

       Understanding the mechanisms that may lead to over-representation of persons with

mental illness in the criminal justice system is critical to inform public policy. If mental

disorders affect the probability of committing crimes or the severity of criminality, and this is the

main mechanism that leads to over-representation in the justice system, then policies related to

mental heath treatment should focus on prevention of criminal behaviors. If bias is a primary




                                                  3
mechanism, in the sense that individuals with mental disorders are more likely to be sanctioned

for a given crime or sanctioned more severely, then a concerted policy focus on changing the

behaviors of key players in the justice and mental health systems is needed. This implies greater

education of police, defense attorneys, prosecutors, probation officers and judges. It also implies

a greater need for speedy access to mental health screening, treatment and information for those

who become involved with the justice system.

        This goal of this study is to examine the relationship between mental health problems and

justice outcomes. This paper adds to the literature in several ways. First, we develop the

plausible channels through which mental illness might affect justice outcomes. Conceptually, we

draw parallels to the employment discrimination literature, where researchers have faced similar

issues in assessing the impact of race or gender on labor market outcomes. Observed differences

in justice outcomes that are not explained by differences in offending behavior and delinquency

may reflect discrimination against those with mental health problems. This discrimination may

be based on personal prejudice (Becker 1957, 1971), or the discrimination may be statistical in

nature (Phelps 1972, Arrow 1973). In this application, statistical discrimination would imply

that law enforcement officials, facing imperfect information about youths’ delinquent behavior,

rationally may use mental health symptoms as signals. For example, a police officer may be

more likely to arrest a youth displaying psychiatric symptoms, after controlling for delinquency,

since mental illness is associated with more violent criminal behavior (Brennan, et al, 2000;

Swanson, et al 1990)

        Differences in justice outcomes that are not explained by differences in delinquency,

however, may result if mental health problems affect other characteristics associated with justice

 Based on rates of mental illness among inmates and probationers in 1998 (Bureau of Justice Statistics,1999) and
applied to year-end 2004 data on inmates (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005) and probationers (Bureau of Justice


                                                         4
outcomes, such as academic outcomes, substance use, and family relationships. If such

mediating factors, or mechanisms, are significant barriers to equitable treatment, then they ought

to be addressed as a first step. Depending on the policy purpose we may be interested in the “full

effect” of mental illness on justice outcomes, which would include differences that operate

through these mechanisms, or the “partial effects” of mental illness, which would be calculated

after holding constant differences that operate through mechanisms In this study, we estimate

both full and partial effects of mental health problems, which provides some insight into the

intermediate mechanisms that lead from these problems to justice outcomes.

         A second contribution of this paper is our use of the National Longitudinal Study of

Adolescent Health (Add Health), which includes data on a community sample of youth. Add

Health offers several advantages over databases that have been used in prior research. First, it

relies on data from a large, nationally representative sample of youth, which greatly increases the

generalizability of our findings compared to previous studies. Second, youth in the sample are

first interviewed in the community rather than in institutions, further avoiding problems of biased

sampling criteria. Third, we can control for important variables that are not present in previous

studies. These include the nature of the justice sanction, the youth’s history of delinquency,

mental health, and individual demographic and community variables. Fourth, our data are

longitudinal, which allows us to explore mechanisms linking early mental health problems to

subsequent justice outcomes.

         Using a rich, longitudinal data source to sort out the contribution of preexisting factors

and mechanisms is important to our understanding of whether and why juvenile justice

disparities exist for youth with mental disorders and how to address them. Our results show that

observable differences between youth with and without disorders can explain a large fraction of


Statistics, 2006).

                                                   5
the gap in justice outcomes. Yet, a significant unexplained gap remains.

       The paper proceeds in the following manner. Section I describes the previous literature.

Section II discusses the unconditional gap in justice outcomes between youth with mental

disorders and those without. It also addresses possible sources of observed disparities. Section

III assesses how conditioning on different characteristics affects the estimated differences in

arrests and convictions for ADHD. Section IV presents similar analysis for the impact of chronic

depression. Section V decomposes the observed differences in arrest and conviction

probabilities. Section VI concludes with a discussion of our evidence.

       2. Previous Literature

       Previous studies have documented a high prevalence of mental disorders among youth

(Teplin et al, 2002; Duclos, et al, 1998; Timmons-Mitchell, et al 1997; Wasserman, et al, 2002)

and adults (Teplin, 1990) in the justice system. These studies find that the rate of disorder is

typically higher than those found in community studies (see Shaffer, et al 1996). It may be

tempting to interpret these data to say that the justice system is biased against persons with

mental disorders, but such an interpretation should be made with caution. Aside from their small

sample sizes, these studies also have design limitations that limit our ability to assess whether

individuals with mental disorders are sanctioned more heavily than others for the same crimes.

       Many of these studies assess youth for mental disorders in a particular justice setting,

such as in detention facilities (where cases typically have not been adjudicated or “tried” and

stays are relatively short) or in commitment facilities (where youth have been found delinquent

or “guilty” and are serving their punishment). Incarcerated youth are a relatively small subset of

all justice-involved youth; thus, the studies provide only a narrow view of the juvenile justice

system. The prevalence of disorder across these studies varies considerably, in part because the




                                                 6
likelihood of any youth being arrested or otherwise involved in the justice system varies

geographically. For example, Duclos et al (1998; 2003) found a relatively low prevalence of

mental disorders in an area where incarceration rates of youth were generally quite high. In

other words, the broader the involvement of youth in juvenile justice, the more the justice sample

resembles a community sample. Studies restricted to youth in commitment facilities are further

difficult to interpret because youth with shorter sentences leave more quickly, leading to

oversampling of long-stay youth. Similar issues exist in studies of adult inmates in jails, which

confine individuals for short periods, and in prisons, which typically confine inmates guilty of

felony offenses and sentenced to more than a year. Importantly, these studies also typically do

not control for demographic characteristics or offending behaviors.

       Other studies have found that prisoners with mental illness are more likely to be arrested

and to serve longer sentences than prisoners without mental illness (Teplin, 1984; Hochstedler,

1987; Ditton, 1999). Ditton (1999), in a federal survey of mental illness among inmates, found

that state prison inmates with mental illness were sentenced to serve an average of 12 months

longer than other inmates. On the other hand among jail inmates, the findings were reversed: the

average maximum sentence was 6 months shorter among those with mental illness than those

without. Studies of inmates also find that those with mental illness are more likely than others to

be involved in fights and break more rules (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). One difficulty

with inmate surveys, as mentioned previously, is that they overrepresent long-stay individuals

relative to short-stay individuals and this may be confounded with mental illness.

       Another study compared individual court cases involving mentally ill defendants with

aggregate population-level data on court cases (Hochstedler, 1987). Although the study finds

that those with mental illness were more likely to receive probation or imprisonment, rather than




                                                 7
fines or dismissal, this study could control only for broad differences in the offense for which the

individual was charged (i.e., felony vs. misdemeanor offenses) which is discretionary. The study

is not able to control for actual offending behavior, prior level of criminal activity, or

demographics.

       Teplin (1984) undertakes a qualitative study of policy-citizen encounters and tests for

differences in arrest rates controlling for visible signs of mental disorder. The degree to which

the police behavior was affected by researchers’ observation of the encounters is not known.

The study is narrowly focused on the role of visible symptoms of severe mental illness such as

bizarre speech, confusion/disorientation, or paranoia. Among its limitations are the fact that it is

able to study only two urban precincts in a single city in 1980/81. Furthermore, the study is

limited to the probability of arrest among 500 citizens considered “suspects” by the police, 30 of

whom were considered mentally disordered. The labeling of suspects, however, is discretionary

and itself endogenous. The study finds that, controlling for offense type, the arrest rate is higher

among those exhibited signs of mental disorder than those who did not. The study is unable to

control for other characteristics.

       The existing literature ultimately does not answer the key question of what would have

happened to those with mental illness in the justice system had they not had mental illness. The

complication is that, in addition to affecting delinquency, mental illness may affect the

distributions of other characteristics associated with justice outcomes. Depending on the policy

purpose we may be interested in the full effect of mental illness, including these other

differences, or the partial effect, net of some differences. In the next section we focus on youth

with mental illness, because it matches our empirical approach, but similar arguments can be

made for adults.




                                                  8
       3. The Full Effect of Mental Illness on Justice Outcomes

       There are many points in the juvenile justice system at which discretionary decisions are

made which may lead to disparate outcomes for youth. These include the decision by police to

arrest youth rather than send them home or otherwise serve a warning; the court intake step at

which an offense is recorded; the decision to detain a youth in a formal facility to await further

case processing, rather than have them wait in a community setting; the decision by the probation

officer or prosecutor to formally or informally pursue a case; the decision by the judge to

adjudicate the youth as delinquent or not (i.e., find them guilty or not); and finally the degree of

the sanction, such as confining the youth in a commitment facility or having them perform

community service.

       One challenge is sorting out the channels through which mental illness affects justice

outcomes. Similar challenges are faced in the employment discrimination literature that assesses

the impact of race on labor market outcomes. We draw the following analogy. In the labor

market literature, observed differences in wages across racial groups may be explained by

discrimination, meaning minority workers with the same ability and training receive lower

wages. The observed wage differences may also be explained by minorities having less ability

and training which leads to lower rewards. As Carneiro et al (2005) point out, the policy

implications are profoundly different. In addition, if discrimination or expectations of

discrimination contribute to some dimensions of lower ability and training of minorities, then

these factors are proxies for discrimination and should not be included as control variables when

testing for wage differences across racial groups (Neil and Johnson, 1996; Carneiro, Heckman,

Masterov, 2005). This is true to the extent one wants to know the “full effect” of discrimination

through all channels.




                                                  9
       Whereas the employment discrimination literature focuses on whether wage differences

arise from discrimination, from discrimination’s role in acquiring abilities, or from differences in

abilities unrelated to discrimination, we focus on observed differences in justice outcomes for

persons with mental illness. The empirical goal of the paper is to determine whether youth with

mental illness, measured as elevated symptoms of ADHD and depression, experience worse

outcomes in the juvenile justice system compared to youth without these problems.

       Our data come from the Add Health, a nationally representative study of adolescents

living in the community which surveys youth regarding delinquent behavior and justice sanctions

as well as mental disorders. Add Health surveyed all students in grades 7 through 12 in a pair of

schools in each of 80 communities in the United States. In 1994 and 1996, two waves of the

survey were conducted, with data collected at the individual, family, school, and community

level. Respondents were then re-interviewed as young adults in a third wave of the survey

conducted in 2001 and 2002. We included only youth who responded to the in-home survey in

all three waves (1994, 1996, and 2001). Our sample size is 9,201 youth.

       Juvenile Justice Outcomes. As outcome variables, we consider two measures of justice

system response to youth delinquency. For all youth, we measure whether a youth was ever

arrested prior to age 19. Additionally, among those ever arrested, we measure whether the youth

was ever convicted prior to age 19 in juvenile court. Youth who are incarcerated during the

Wave III interview are not observed.

       Mental Health. As the primary covariate of interest, we focus on two types of mental

health problems that are highly prevalent among adolescents: Attention Deficit and

Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depression. To measure symptoms of ADHD, we use the

18-item Retrospective Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Scale from Wave 3. This scale requires




                                                10
respondents to report on the frequency of behaviors such as impulsiveness, inattention,

disorganization, and hyperactivity between the ages of 5 and 12 We define youth as having

elevated ADHD symptoms if they were at the 75th percentile of the sample distribution or higher

in terms of their self-reported symptoms. To measure depression, we use the modified Center

for Epidemiologic Scale for Depression (CES-D) used in waves 1 and 2. We identify youth as

having chronic, elevated depressive symptoms if their average score in both waves ranks at the

75th percentile or higher of the sample distribution for depressive symptoms.

       Since Add Health does not include formal diagnostic interviews for mental disorders,

neither the ADHD nor the depression measures are diagnostic assessments per se. Our measures

are broad in the sense that they capture adolescents who would meet diagnostic criteria for these

disorders, as well as adolescents with sub-threshold disorders and no disorders. Consequently,

we assess the effect of elevated symptoms, rather than diagnosis. Youth who are being treated

for their conditions will thus have lower symptoms.

       Table 1 describes rates of justice outcomes by mental health disorder. It shows that youth

who had ADHD were more likely to be arrested prior to age 19 than other youth (7.6 percent vs.

3.9 percent). Among those arrested, youth with ADHD were more likely to be convicted (50.6

vs. 37.8 percent). Similarly, youth with depression were more likely than other youth to be

arrested (5.7 percent vs. 5.0 percent). Among those with depression who were arrested, the

likelihood of conviction was greater (48.1 percent vs. 42.3 percent).

       3. Decomposing the Gap in Justice Outcomes.

       Differential response to youth with mental disorders could arise from multiple

mechanisms operative in the justice system. One is simple prejudice, or beliefs and stereotypes

by prosecutors, probation officers, defense attorneys and judges that reflect unjustified negative




                                                11
attitudes based on a person’s group membership (Dovidio, et al 1996). Some have argued, for

example, that antisocial behavior among African Americans is viewed as delinquent, whereas

similar behavior among Whites is attributed to a mental illness (Campbell, 1998; Bridges and

Steen, 1998). This would affect perceptions of culpability and choices of punishment. Similarly,

individuals with mental disorders may exhibit behavior that exacerbates perceptions of their

delinquency, for example, by exhibiting less remorse or by being inattentive or hostile.

Disrespectful and hostile behavior has been found to be associated with higher likelihood of

arrest (Novak and Engel, 2005). Being remorseless, inattentive or hostile during case processing

is likely to increase the chances of conviction. Thus, the justice system may be reacting to

symptoms of mental illness, rather than the presence of the illness itself.

       In addition to true prejudice and intolerance for those displaying symptoms of mental

illness, statistical discrimination also may result if there is uncertainty about whether punitive or

rehabilitative justice approaches are more likely to succeed and reduce recidivism for youth with

mental disorders. Such uncertainty may lead to unequal application of justice approaches,

leading one to observe more punitive approaches for one group than the other. Another possible

mechanism is that incarceration is viewed as an alternative to mental health treatment,

particularly in geographic areas where supply of health care services is low or in circumstances

where involuntary heath care treatment is difficult to impose (Wexler, 1983); however, this

avenue into the justice system would only be relevant for those with mental illness.

       Finally, there are a number of covariates correlated with mental illness that may partially

explain its effect on justice outcomes. Some of these covariates are preexisting characteristics,

such as race and gender, that may confound an observed association between psychiatric

symptoms and justice outcomes. Other covariates, such as academic outcomes and family




                                                 12
relationships, are of interest as mechanisms, as they are factors that may link mental illness to

justice outcomes. In the following sections, we evaluate the effects of preexisting characteristics

and mechanisms by estimating the model below:

              J = α1MH + α2X + α3C + α4D + α5S + α6A + α7F +ε                          (1)

        In Equation (1), juvenile justice outcome (J) is a function of a measure of mental health

(MH), standard demographic variables including gender and race (X), community characteristics

(C), delinquency history (D), substance use (S), school outcomes (A), and family relationship

characteristics, (F). Construction and interpretation of these variables is described in detail

below. To estimate Equation 1, we use logistic models and include the two mental health

variables (ADHD, depression) separately because these variables are highly collinear. We start

with a specification that includes only the mental health measure on the right hand side. We then

incrementally add each set of covariates (X, C, D, S, A, F) to the model and gauge how the

addition of each set of variables affects the magnitude and statistical significance of the

coefficient on the mental health measure. The demographic and community variables which are

added first (X and C) are considered preexisting factors, while delinquency, school outcomes,

substance use, and family relationships (D, S, A, F) are of interest as mechanisms. If the mental

health coefficient is still a statistically significant predictor of justice outcomes, even after all the

preexisting factors and mechanisms have been added to the model, we would interpret this

coefficient as capturing the effects of discrimination towards youth with mental health problems,

as well as the effects of any unobserved heterogeneity or unmeasured mechanisms.

        Table 3 summarizes findings from logistic models which focus on the effect of ADHD

symptoms on justice outcomes. Models are estimated using a combined gender sample as well

as a males only sample (we do not show findings for a females only sample because the sample



                                                   13
size of arrested females is too small to analyze convictions). Panel A in Table 3 shows the

models with arrested before age 19 as the dependent variable, while Panel B shows the models

with conviction before age 19 as the dependent variable. Each column in Table 3 represents a

successively richer model in which we add additional covariates. Each cell shows the estimated

coefficient of a binary indicator for ADHD symptoms and is from a separate regression. Table 4

shows similar results from models in which the effect of depressive symptoms on justice

outcomes is of interest. Here, too, each cell is from a separate regression. Full regression results

are shown in the appendices.

       3.1 The Role of Demographic Characteristics

       Observed differences in arrest rates could arise not only from differences in delinquent

behavior and academic performance but also from the correlation between mental disorder and

other sociodemographic factors that influence justice outcomes. For example, the prevalence of

mental illness differs by gender. The clinical literature finds that males are more likely to be

diagnosed with ADHD than females, but less likely to be diagnosed with depression (USDHHS,

1999). At the same time arrest is more likely for males. Consistent with the clinical literature

we find in our sample that youth with ADHD are more likely to be male (59 percent) than youth

with depression (40 percent) or youth with neither disorder (49 percent).

       Prior literature also shows that mental illness is correlated with low income (Glied, et al

1997) which, in turn, may affect the quality of a person’s legal representation. We proxy family

income by measuring whether or not the mother completed less than high school or high school

and with whether either the mother or father received welfare assistance. We also control for

whether the youth lived with two parents. In our sample youth with ADHD or depression are

somewhat more likely to be from lower income families. Sixty percent in both groups had a



                                                 14
mother with high school education or less, compared to 56 for youth with neither disorder. Rates

of welfare receipt were similar with 13 percent reporting welfare among youth with ADHD,

compared to 14 percent among youth with depression and 11 for youth with no disorder.

       Race and ethnicity also are correlated with mental illness. Data from the National

Comorbidity Survey-Replication show that lifetime prevalence of mental disorders is lower

among Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks and that the lower risk of disorder begins in

childhood (Breslau, et al 2005). At the same time, there is evidence that minorities are

overrepresented in the U.S. justice system (OJJDP, 2004). Minorities represented approximately

one third of youth in 1997, but two thirds of youth incarcerated in detention or commitment

facilities. Further, studies find minorities are overrepresented at each stage of case processing

and that these differences persist after controlling for severity of crime and prior rates offenses.

Consequently, minority status in the mental health context is a protective factor for justice

outcomes.

       In our first specification, we estimate the association between ADHD and justice

outcomes with no other covariates included (Table 3A, Column 1). From this model, estimated

with the combined gender sample, we see that high levels of ADHD symptoms are associated

with a 3.7 percentage point increase in the probability of arrest, which is about a 71 percent

increase at the sample mean arrest rate of 5.2 percent. In the males only sample (Table 3B,

Column 1), high levels of ADHD symptoms are associated with a 49 percent increase in the

probability of arrest measured at the sample mean arrest rate for males. Among individuals who

have been arrested, ADHD is associated with a 12.6 percentage point increase in the probability

of conviction, which is a 28 percent increase at the sample mean conviction rate of 44.5 percent.

Similarly, in the males only sample, ADHD is associated with a 29 percent increase in the




                                                 15
likelihood of conviction at the sample mean for males.

           To see whether these effects change appreciably as we add preexisting characteristics to

the model, we begin by including gender in the model (Table 3A, column 2). When gender is

included, the coefficient on ADHD declines sharply, although it remains positive and statistically

significant. The marginal effect of ADHD declines from 3.7 percentage points to 1.9 percentage

points. In the model with conviction as the dependent variable, the coefficient on ADHD also

declines when gender is added to the mode. The marginal effect declines by roughly one

percentage point, from 12.6 percent to 11.5 percent.

           Including the other demographic variables to the model (column 3) has virtually no

impact on the coefficients for ADHD either in the arrest or in the conviction models.

Coefficients on the demographic variables are shown in Appendix 1 (arrest) and Appendix 2

(conviction). While having two parents in the household is associated with a decline in the

probability of arrest, race, welfare receipt and mother’s education have little independent effect

on justice outcomes. The probability of arrest increases with age, but at a declining rate. Age

also increases the probability of conviction. We run separate models for males and find similar

results.

           3.2 Community Characteristics

           In this section we address the role of community influences. The literature on crime finds

after controlling for individual factors, residence in underclass neighborhoods is significantly

associated with delinquent behavior (Peeples and Loeber, 1994). In addition, although urban

residence does not appear to be an independent risk factor for mental disorder for adults (Judd et

al, 2002), among adolescents, urban residence is associated with more conflict and externalizing

behaviors (Elgar et al., 2003a) and higher levels of behavioral and substance use problems




                                                   16
among juveniles (Elgar et al., 2003b). The stability, or perceived stability, of the local

environment may also influence whether youth are returned to their homes conditional on

delinquent behavior.

       We control for several measures of community influences measured at the level of the

Census tract, including median housing value, percent of households with income below poverty

and its square, and urbanicity. 2 Some of these measures, for example median income, may also

proxy for family characteristics. In our sample, we find very small differences in community

characteristics across the three groups of youth (Table 2). In Table 3A, column 3, we show that

controlling for observed community characteristics has little effect on the estimated effect of

ADHD on arrest. The effect of neighborhood characteristics on conviction, however, is more

pronounced. After including community characteristics in the model, the marginal effect of

having ADHD on the likelihood of being convicted increases from 11.7 to 15.9 percentage

points. For males (Table 3B, column 3), the marginal effect increases from 13.3 to 17.5

percentage points.

       3.3 The Role of Delinquent Behavior

       We now move from examining the effects of confounding, preexisting characteristics to

considering potentially important mechanisms in the relationship between ADHD and justice

outcomes. One obvious explanation for the high prevalence of mental disorder in the criminal

justice system is that mental disorders in adolescents may manifest themselves in inappropriate

or unlawful conduct (Fabrega, Ulrich and Loeber, 1996; Rawal, et al 2004). Certain mental

disorders, such as hyperactivity and depression, are associated with higher rates of delinquent

behavior, not just higher rates of arrest (Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, Fletcher, 2004). Youth with

ADHD, for example, experience peer rejection and engage in numerous disruptive behaviors




                                                 17
(NIH 2000); their increased impulsivity also has been found to lead to greater initiation of fights

(Halperin et al. 1995). For persons with depression a sense of hopelessness and lack of future

orientation may lead them to discount future consequences and be more likely to commit crimes.

Juveniles also are more apt than adults to act out their depression through disruptive and

aggressive behaviors (Bleiberg, 1991). Problems with social functioning and peer relations can

make juveniles with depression more prone to delinquent behavior and aggression (Brimaher, et

al, 1998).

         Delinquency is measured as the reported frequency of a given activity in the past 12

months. 3 The frequency is summed across 8 separate activities in each wave and we take an

average. We include both a linear and squared term for delinquent acts. Separately, we sum the

number of violent acts reported in the past 12 months each wave and take an average. 4 We also

create indicators for whether the youth reported a nonminor theft 5 or selling or possession illegal

drugs in each wave and take averages for both.

         Youth with mental disorders were more likely to report high levels of delinquency. Table

2 shows that all youth reported 2.6 delinquent acts on average across both waves, compared to

3.0 for youth with ADHD and 3.4 for youth with depression. The average number of violent acts

was 0.8 for all youth, 1.1 for youth with ADHD and 1.1 for youth with depression. Similarly, the

0.12 of all youth reported nonminor theft and sale/possession of drugs respectively, compared to


2
  We impute missing values.
3
  The reported activities: “How often did you paint graffiti on signs on someone else’s property or in a public place;
deliberately damage property that didn’t belong to you, it to your parents or guardians about where you had been or
whom you were with; take something from store without paying for it; run away from home; drive a car without the
owner’s permission; steal something worth less than $50; and act loud, rowdy, or unruly in a public place.
4
  For each wave we assigned a one if youth reported having done any of the following in the past 12 months: get
into a serious physical fight; hurt someone badly enough to need bandages or care from a doctor; use or threaten to
use a weapon to get something from someone; take part in a fight where a group of your friends was against another
group; pulled a knife or gun on someone; shot or stabbed someone. We then sum each youth’s responses across
waves, resulting in a composite variable has possible values of 0, 1 or 2.
5
  We define nonminor theft as stealing more than $50 or going into a house/building to steal in the past 12 months.


                                                         18
16 percent and 17 percent for youth with ADHD and 18 percent for youth with depression.

       In Table 3, column 5 we include the measures of delinquent behavior. We find that the

effect of ADHD remains positive and significant after controlling for delinquency, although as

expected the coefficient on ADHD drops considerably after the inclusion of the delinquency

covariates. The marginal effect declines from 1.6 percent to 0.8 percent in the full sample and

from 3.9 percent to 2.1 percent in our sample of males only. Adding delinquency measures also

has a substantial effect in the conviction models. Here the marginal effect of ADHD declines

from 7.1 percent to 5.8 percent in the full model (17.5 percent to 14.4 percent for males only).

These findings indicate that after controlling for demographic and community characteristics as

well as delinquency, youth with high levels of ADHD symptoms still fare appreciably worse

than youth without high levels of ADHD symptoms in the justice system.

       3.4 The Role of Substance Use

       In this section, we focus on substance use. Previous research suggests that psychiatric

disorders, including ADHD, anxiety and depression, are strong correlates of substance use

(Kandel, et al 1997; Pulkkinen & Pitkanen 1994, Caspi et al. 1996, Block et al. 1988, Boyle &

Offord 1991, Deykin et al. 1987, Deykin et al. 1992). Because alcohol and illicit drug use

among minors is by law a punishable offense, this correlation between mental illness and

substance use may be an important contributor to observed differences in arrest rates.

       Following a large body of previous research, our adolescent substance use measures are

continuous measures capturing binge drinking, the frequency of alcohol use, and the frequency

of illicit drug use (Dee & Evans, 2003; DiNardo & Lemieux, 2001; Rees et al., 2001; Kenkel &

Ribar, 1994; Farrelly et al., 2001; Guillamo-Ramos et al., 2005; Swahn et al., 2004; Lundborg,




                                                19
2002 and others). 6 For frequency of alcohol use we calculate the number of days on which the

youth drank alcohol in the past year in wave I and wave II and create an average.7 For frequency

of binge drinking we identified chronic, frequent drinkers who report binge drinking in both

wave I and wave II. Our indicator is equal to one if in both waves the youth reported report

having binged (i..e., having had 5 or more drinks on one occasion) on 2 or more days in the past

month. Our illicit drug use measures focus on marijuana use, since this drug is the most

commonly used in our sample. Marijuana use is measured as the number of times over the past

month and we take the average response for both waves. For categorical responses to survey

questions on alcohol and drug use, we use the midpoints of the categories to create continuous

measures of frequency of use.

        Our data on mental illness and substance use are consistent with the prior literature. For

youth with neither disorder the average frequency of drinking alcohol drinks was 15.2 days,

compared to 19.1 days for youth with ADHD and 20.8 days for youth with depression. The

average proportion reporting binge drinking was 8 percent for youth with neither disorder, 11

percent for youth with ADHD, and 12 percent for youth with depression. Finally, average

marijuana frequency was 1.9 for youth with no disorder, 2.6 for youth with ADHD and 2.8 for

youth with depression.

        Table 3, column 6 shows the effect of including substance use measures. When the

measures of binge drinking, alcohol frequency, and marijuana use are included, the coefficients

on ADHD change only modestly in both the arrest and the conviction models. Frequency of

alcohol use increases the likelihood of arrest, but not of conviction (see Appendix 1 and 2).

6
 As is the case for our measures of ADHD and depression symptoms, respondents who drink heavily may or may
not meet diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders.




                                                    20
Controlling for alcohol frequency, binge drinking has a small negative effect on arrest and no

statistically significant effect on conviction. Marijuana frequency does not affect the probability

of arrest, but it is associated with an increased likelihood of conviction.

        3.5 Academic Performance

        Another mechanism through which mental illness may affect justice outcomes arises

from academic performance. Youth with certain mental disorders have more trouble in school

and develop poor academic performance relative to other youth. For example, youth with major

depression for example have lower grade point averages and more suspensions than other youth

(Marmorstein and Iacono, 2003). This relative poor academic performance may be a direct

consequence of the mental health symptoms experienced by the youth. A youth with poor

academic performance also may be perceived as more severely delinquent or more likely to

recidivate than another youth. Poor academic performance, thus, may affect the willingness of

the justice system to process a case informally (e.g., by not arresting or charging the youth) and

the degree of any sanction assessed. Since grades, in particular, are not observable to an

arresting officer we include this variable only in the conviction models.

        We use two measures of academic performance. First, we use an average grade point

average based on youth reported grades in math and English in wave I and wave II. We also

average how many days the youth reported being absent from school with no excuse across wave

I and wave II. Absolute differences in unexcused absences were relatively small across groups,

however, youth in the full sample had fewer unexcused absences (1.3) than youth with ADHD

(1.6) and youth with depression (1.6). Column 7 in Tables 3 shows including school

performance reduces the magnitude and statistical significance of the ADHD coefficient in the

7
  In waves 1 and 2, respondents provide information regarding the number of days on which the youth drank alcohol
in the past 12 months and regarding the number of drinks per occasion. We multiply these responses to create a


                                                       21
arrest model (both in the combined gender and male only samples), suggesting that these

outcomes may be a mechanism linking psychiatric symptoms to justice outcomes.                      In the

conviction models, however, the magnitude and statistical significance of the ADHD coefficient

actually increases with the addition of school outcomes. This finding is counterintuitive, as

youth with elevated ADHD symptoms have worse schooling outcomes and a higher probability

of conviction compared to youth without elevated ADHD symptoms.

        3.6 Parent Relationships

        The strength of a youth’s relationship with their parents may proxy for whether the

parents would take an active role in the event the youth is picked up by the police following a

delinquent act. To include two measures of the parent-youth relationship. One is a parent–

adolescent activities composite which reflects the number of shared parent-child activities within

the past 4 weeks (averaged over wave I and wave II reports). This measure was based on an item

in which adolescents reported involvement in up to 10 activities with a parent. 8 Activities are

asked of mother and father separately. We included the activity in our count if it was reported

for either mother or father. In addition we include a measure of parent-child closeness. We sum

responses to five questions on a 5-point scale that measures how close adolescents’ feel to their

mother and how much they believe their mother cares about them. 9 We then average the

response across both waves. A low score indicates a closer relationship. We include an


measure of total drinks in the past year.
8
  Youth were asked about having done the following in the past four weeks: have you gone shopping? Have you
played a sport? Have you gone to a religious services or a church-related event? Have you talked about someone
you’re dating or a party you went to? Have you gone to a movie, play, museum, concert, or sports event? Have you
had a talk about a personal problem you were having? Have you had a serious argument about your behavior? Have
you talked about your school work or grades Have you worked on a project for school? Have you talked about other
things you’re doing in school?
9
  Youth responded that on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being strongly agree and 5 being strongly disagree) to the following
statements: Most of the time your mother is warm and loving toward you. Your mother encourages you to be
independent. When you do something wrong that is important, your mother talks about it with you and helps you




                                                        22
indicator if there is no resident mother.

        Youth report relatively small differences in parent relationships across disorders. Those

with neither ADHD nor depression had mean parental relationship scores of 8.5 compared to 8.6

for youth with ADHD and 9.0 for youth with depression. The number of joint activities with a

parent was virtually the same across groups (2.6 for youth with ADHD or no disorder and 2.8 for

youth with depression). Our multivariate regression results show that the coefficient on ADHD

does not change much with the inclusion parental relationship measures in either the arrest or the

conviction models.

        IV. Chronic Depression

        Table 4 has the same layout as Table 3, but shows the estimated coefficients of the binary

indicator for chronic depression. In the most basic model, depression appears to have a positive,

but not statistically significant effect on arrest. Once we add gender to the model (in the

combined gender sample), the estimated coefficient for depression then becomes positive and

statistically significant. The addition of other preexisting factors has little effect on the

depression coefficient. However, once we add delinquency as a mechanism, the effect of

depression becomes zero and not statistically significant. Adding additional mechanisms, such

as substance use, school performance and parental relationships does not change this effect.

Thus, the effect of depression on arrest can be explained by the higher rates of delinquency

among depressed individuals. The results also hold for our sample of males. In our models of

conviction, we find that depression has a positive effect on conviction in all models, but the

effect is not statistically significant. This is also true in the model estimated with males only.

understand why it is wrong. You are satisfied with the way your mother and you communicate with each other.
Overall, you are satisfied with your relationship with your mother.


                                                      23
         In this section, we examine the proportion of the total gap in justice outcomes that can be

explained by observable characteristics following Oaxaca (1973) and Blinder (1973). In our

application this method involves estimating separate justice outcome equations for two groups

(e.g. those with a mental disorder and those without) and decomposing the estimated differential

in outcomes between the groups into two components: (1) a component that can be explained by

differences in the distributions of observed characteristics (e.g. differences in delinquency); and

(2) a component that can be attributed to the structure of the model (e.g. differences in the

coefficients on delinquency for the two groups and differences in unobservable endowments).

We quantify the contribution to group differences in outcomes from all measured characteristics,

i.e., delinquency, substance use, school performance, parent relationships, demographics and

community characteristics.

         The decomposition for a nonlinear equation, Y = F ( Xβˆ ) , can be written as (Fairlie,

1999):

                       ⎡ N A F ( X iA βˆ A ) N B F ( X iB βˆ A ) ⎤ ⎡ N B F ( X iB βˆ A ) N B F ( X iB βˆ B ) ⎤
         Y −Y
           A     B
                     = ⎢∑                   −∑                   ⎥ + ⎢∑                 −∑                   ⎥    (2)
                       ⎢⎣ i =1   NA          i =1    NB          ⎥⎦ ⎢⎣ i =1  NB          i =1    NB          ⎥⎦

         where A denotes the group of youth with a mental disorder, B denotes the group of youth

without, and N denotes the sample size for group j. The first term captures the part of the gap in

outcomes that is due to group differences in the distribution of X. This equation assumes that the

group with a mental disorder represents the appropriate baseline. Equally valid is a specification

that assumes that the group B, those without the mental disorder, constitutes the appropriate

baseline in which case βˆ B would be used as weights in the first part of the decomposition. In

fact, any combination of βˆ A and βˆ B could be used as weights (Ransom and Oaxaca, 1994). For

this analysis we compose the gap in justice outcomes using coefficient estimates from the pooled



                                                            24
sample of groups A and B.

       The results in Table 5 confirm that most of the gap in justice outcomes for youth with

ADHD is due to differences in observable characteristics. The explained portion of the arrest

gap is 68 percent for ADHD among all youth. For convictions the explained portion of the

ADHD gap is lower, 38 percent for the full sample. For depression observables explain a higher

portion of the gap. For convictions, the observable covariates explain 71 percent of the gap for

the full sample. Table 5 also underscores the previous findings on arrests that selection on

observables favors youth with depression. Results for the male only sample are qualitatively

similar.

       VI. Discussion and Conclusion

       Using a large sample of adolescents, our findings show that youth with some mental

disorders fare worse in the juvenile justice system in terms of the probability of being arrested

and the probability of conviction once arrested. Our models control for most likely correlates of

mental disorders and juvenile justice outcomes. We find that elevated ADHD symptoms during

adolescence are associated with statistically significant and meaningful increases in the

probability of arrest and conviction after controlling for preexisting factors and mechanisms.

       We examined factors, such as demographics and community characteristics that in most

cases preexist the youth’s mental illness. An important preexisting factor is gender, as males

fare worse in terms of justice outcomes than females. Among mechanisms that may arise from

the ADHD disorder itself, delinquency accounts for a significant fraction of the observed

difference in arrest rates between those with and without ADHD. School performance and

parental relationships play a lesser role.

       For depression we did not find a disparity in arrests rates. In fact, conditional on




                                                25
preexisting factors and mechanism, such as delinquency, substance use, and academic

performance, youth with depression appeared to have a lower probability of arrest than those

without. Depression is an “internalizing disorder” which is often not readily detected by

observers.

       Our study has several important limitations. First, it is limited by the fact that the

measurement of mental disorders is based on symptom scales rather than on a diagnostic

assessment tool. Symptoms, however, are likely to be what is observed by agents of the justice

system. At the time of conviction it is possible that diagnostic information becomes available.

Our measures of justice sanctions rely on youth's recall of these events, and were not

independently confirmed with administrative records from the police or juvenile justice records.

Similarly, delinquent behaviors are self-reported and we can not rule out that the delinquent

behaviors of youth with mental illness are different from the behaviors of other youth in subtle

ways. Furthermore, we estimate an average effect of each disorder, but this may mask large

differences across jurisdictions.

       This study is able to control for important individual and area characteristics that are

lacking in previous studies, but which may otherwise confound the relationship between mental

health and justice contact. Despite the richness of the data there may be dimensions of the crime

or sanction that are unobserved to us and that are correlated with the youth’s disorder leading to

biased regression results. Such unobserved characteristics could be aspects of the crime

committed (e.g., degree of violence) or of the youth’s attitude (e.g., remorse exhibited or

disrespectful behavior). In addition, since we measure delinquency and intermediate

mechanisms at the same time, the possibility of structural endogeneity remains (e.g. academic

performance leading to depressive symptoms instead of or in addition to the other way around).




                                                 26
However, in the end, this limitation is less relevant since these mechanisms did not prove to be

important empirically. Despite these limitations this study offers important advantages over

existing research and enables us to address directly the question of whether youth with mental

disorders are sanctioned disproportionately by the justice system.

       Results of this study will have important implications for identifying a group of youth

whose health needs are not being appropriately recognized and who face a greater likelihood of

being punished as a result of their disorder. Bias in the justice system may reflect a lack of

understanding that untreated mental disorders can exacerbate the propensity to engage in

delinquent behavior. Careful consideration of a youth’s mental disorders could lead to more

appropriate referral of delinquent youth to community treatment services and the expansion of

the public mental health system. Recognizing the needs of youth with mental disorders, the

justice system may also develop more appropriate sanctions that include treatment components.

With appropriate assistance, youth with mental disorders who are serving sentences, such as

probation, may more successfully comply with the terms of probation and not face additional

sanctioning. Ultimately, this study has implications for education programs in the justice system,

as well as the delivery system of public mental health services.
