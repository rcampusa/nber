                      THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE ELDERLY


        In the first part of the paper using official data sources, we

 estimate the real income of the elderly and of the rest •of the population

during the 1970s. We find   that   income per household of the elderly has

 increased more rapidly than income per household of the rest of the

population, even though the elderly's fraction of income from work

decreased greatly.

       In the rest of the paper we use the 1969 and 1975 Retirement History

Surveys to estimate income, wealth and inflation vulnerability of households

whose heads were ages 58 through 63 in 1969. The income data verified the

results from the official data. The 1969 wealth data show that a represen—

tative person on the eve of retirement has small holdings of financial

assets: most of the assets are in housing, Social Security and Medicare.

Between 1969 and 1975 real wealth increased slightly on average. There was

some tendency for the distribution to tighten. e found that contrary to

popular opinion, on average the elderly are not especially vulnerable to a

sudden increase in either prices or the rate of inflation. Most of their

assets are inflation protected. The wealthy are most vulnerable to inflation.

Introduction

         This paper seeks to present a picture of the economic status of

the   eiderly. We   examine the change      in   their cost of living relative to

the rest of the population,       the   size, composition,   and distribution of
their   income, and, correspondingly, the size, composition and distribution

of their wealth. We develop and calculate a measure of their vulnerability

to one time unexpected changes in the price level and to an unexpected

increase in the long run rate of inflation (and interest rates). In order

to assess the economic welfare of the elderly, we use a variety of data

sources, but most of our analysis comes from the Social Security Administration's

Retirement History_Survey. We use the 1969, 1971, 1973, and 1975 surveys ftom

that longitudinal data file.

         We seek to determine how the elderly have been faring economically

for a number of reasons. First, they are usually considered to be the segment

of the population most vulnerable to inflation. The image of an elderly

household struggling to get by on a fixed income pension or meager interest

income from a modest savings account is an enduring one. The past 15 years

have seen a marked and, presumably, unexpected increase in the rate of inflation.

So, how have they coped? Second, the size and number of governmental programs

to assist the aged have increased. At the federal level Social Security,

Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Medicare have all grown rapidly.




                                             1

How significantly have these programs affected the incQmes and wealth

of the elderly? Third, it is we]l known that the labor force participation

of the elderly has been falling secularly. Has this meant lower incomes?

Finally, some of the assets in which elderly invest for retirement,

particularly common stocks, have performed very poorly. How much has this

hurt their position?

        We want to emphasize that we evaluate the economic welfare of the

elderly only in the narrowest sense. A major determinant of the happiness

of the elderly is their health, which we do not take into account.

Further, we do not evaluate the increased leisuie which accompanies

their reduced labor force participation. Nor can we assess a number of

other factors determining their well being such as life expectancy,

changing living arrangements and housing, and decreasing inter—generational

contact. Without these considerations we do not present our results as a

complete assessment of the welfare of the elderly, but we do believe that

our data give a good appraisal of how the financial position of the elderly

has changed in the past decade or so.



I. Cost of Lyn
        In   order to assess the incomes and wealth of the elderly, all of

which are available only in nominal terms, we first examine what has happened

to their cost of living. The first question we attempt to answer is whether

their cost of living has changed relative to that of the rest of the population.

The possibility of a difference arises because of the elderly's particular

expenditure patterns and because of the fact that relative prices have changed.

To address this question, a researcher usually compares the Department of Labor's
                                            3


Consumer Price Index (CPI), which    uses       the expenditure weights of the

entire population, with a Laspeyres index which uses the expenditure

weights of the elderly. Virtually all researchers who          have   done this

(see, for example, Bridges and Packard [1981]) have reached the same

conclusion: while expenditure weights vary by age, prices have changed

in such a way that over reasonably long time periods the price index of

the elderly has risen the same amount as the CPI. Recent results of

Boskin and Hurd (1982) are shown in Table 1.           They divide expenditure into

17 categories and calculate cost of living indices for five age groups.

The measures are set at 100 in 1967. The first result which is apparent

in Table 1   is   that there is essentially no variation in the index across

age groups for the years shown.'     Thus,       the percentage increase in the cost

of living since 1967 has been the same for each age group despite significantly

different expenditure patterns and sharp changes in relative prices. A

second finding, of equal importance for this paper, is shown in Table 1.

For all age groups, the Boskin and 1-jurd cost of living indices have grown

slower than the official CPI. While their figures show that the cost of

living was roughly 128 percent higher in 1980 than 1967, the CF'I indicates that

the increase was 147 percent. The reason for this is that the official index

weights housing far more than the estimates of Boskin and Hurd, which use a

rental value measure of housing expenditure similar to that to be adopted by

the U.S. Department of Labor in 1983. The over—statement of inflation by the

CPI is important for the elderly as Social Security benefits are tied to this

measure during the payout period.

I I. Incomeso f the Elder1v_pu la   t ion
        Civen   that the cost of living of various age groups has risen

proportionately, we can compare real income growth of the elderly with

that of the total population, by comparing the growth of nominal incomes.

Table 2 shows per household and per capita income data for both the

elderly (head of household age 65 or over) and the entire population.

Row 1 shows a series on personal incomes (before tax incomes) of the

elderly. It includes, besides the usual sources of income, imputed returns

from owner—occupied housing and the income—value of Medicare and Medicaid.2

Rows 2 and 3 show that real income per household and per capita grew

continuously over the period 1970 to 1978, although more than half of the

growth occurred between 1970 and 1973. The conversion from nominal to the

real incomes of this table used the Bureau of Labor Statistics' CPI. If

the CPI overstated the rate of inflation, as we mentioned in Section I,

then the growth in real income is actually higher than shown. This would be

true for the entire population as well, of course. Rows 5 and 6 show real

income per household and per capita for the entire population. The percentage

growth is substantially higher in the per capita series because of the sharp

decline in the number of persons per household in the non—aged group.

        Row 7 of Table 2 displays the ratio of average elderly household

personal income to average household personal income for the entire population.

We see that elderly households, which are much smaller than non—elderly

households in size, had on average 52 percent as much personal income as the

average household in the entire population in 1970. By 1978 the relative

household personal income of the elderly had risen to 58 percent. This change

in the relative position of a large subpopulation over such a short time

interval is remarkable. Another measure of the relative position of the

elderly is shown in row 8 of Table 2 where the ratios of per capita

personal incomes are reported.3 The elderly have higher per capita incomes

than the non—elderly and they gained on the rest of the population in the

first eight years of the 1970s. The gain in the per capita figures is

more modest than in the per household figures because of the aforementioned

decline in the number of persons per household in the non—aged group.

           The results of Table 2 are even stronger when one considers that

labor force participation declined among the elderly over this period, but

increased sharply among the non—elderly. For example, the participation

rate of males 65 and over declined from 25.8 in 1970 to 19.7 in 1978; the

participation rate of elderly females declined from 9.2 to 7.8; yet, the

participation rate of the entire population rose from 60.3 to 62.7. Despite

this, the elderly gained on the non—elderly in terms of relative income.

This relative income shift was partly due to the slow growth in real wages.

Real before—tax wages grew by only 4.85 percent for the entire period 1970

to 1978.

           In Table 3 we examine how the poorer households and individuals among

the elderly have done relative to an arbitrary real income standard, the

official poverty level. It shows a very substantial decrease in the fraction

of elderly with incomes less than this standard.4 This is particularly

striking for elderly families, 27 percent of whom were below the poverty

level in 1959. By 1978 only 7.6 percent of such families had incomes below

the standard. The incidence of poverty is much higher for unrelated elderly

individuals, primarily women, but here, too, significant progress is shown.

        Table 4 augments the income data of the previous two tables by

providing a time series of income composition of the elderly. The figures

show the percentage of total income derived from particular sources. The

table shows that Social Security pensions and private pensions have both

become more important income sources. However, the more dramatic shifts

involve Medicare/edicaid and labor earnings. Labor earnings accounted for

29 percent of all income of the elderly in 1963, but only 18 percent in 1976

and 1978. This fall of more than 50 percent in relative importance and a

total of 11 percentage points is more than matched by the growth in Medicare!

Medicaid.5 Public assistance and veteran's benefits have declined in relative

importance. This is probably because they have been displaced by the more

generous pensions and Medicare benefits.




IV. Income of the Retirement History
     Survey Population

        The remainder of this paper uses the Social Security Administration's

Retirement History Survey (RHS) as the primary data source. It contained

8,244 households whose ages ranged from 58 to 63 in 1969 whom we could track

to 1975, and whose records were sufficiently complete that they were usuable.

We report on their economic status in 1969 and 1975, but used the intervening

1971 and 1973 surveys to impute values which were missing in either 1969 or

1975. It should be noted that the remainder of our results are not necessarily

accurate for the entire elderly population, but rather for a group which

was 58—63 in 1969 and 64—69 in 1975.

         Table 5 divides the RI-iS sample into six vintages by age of head

of household in January, 1969. It then shows the mean real income in

1968 dollars of each vintage in 1968 and 1974. The results are presented

for couples, singles, and total households. For couples and households,

one observes a noticeable decline in income with age in both 1968 and 1974.

However, the real incomes in 1974 are higher than one would project simply

from the income—age profile in the 1968 cross section. For couples, we

roughly estimate that there is an upwards shift in the income—age relationships

of at least $1,000 or about ten percent. This can be seen in Figure 1.       One

would imagine that incomes would continue to drop at age 64, reflecting

increased retirement;     instead, income is substantially higher among couples

whose heads were 64 in 1974.6 The upward shift is less for households. The

figures for singles are clouded by compositional changes——there are more

singles in 1974 than in 1968, particularly widows. These new entrants into

the single category bring with them assets and corresponding income from the

previous couples category.

        Two other observations should be noted here: (1) among couples and

households real income is lower in 1974 than in 1968 for all vintages. This

is a normal pattern with aging and it is due to the sharp increase in the

fraction of the RHS population retired. The drop in the real income of each

vintage is not an indication that consumption or welfare of each vintage

decreased.   (2) In this table and in subsequent ones, we have used the Boskin—

Hurd cost of living deflator (of Table 1) rather than the official CPI.

        Table 6 shows the distribution of real income in 1968 and 1974 by

family type. Several points can be made about them. First, the median

real incomes are substantially less than the mean incomes. For example,

for households in 1968, the median income was $6,658 whereas the mean was

$8,136. The most striking fact about these distributions, however, is the

increase in the incomes of those in the lower tail of the distribution.

Most dramatically, single women in the lowest five percent of the income

distribution had incomes less than $208 in l968. This figure was raised

more than sixfold to $1,327 in 1974. The largest single factor in this

increase was the eligibility for Medicare at age 65, although Social Security

receipt was also a major determinant of the increase. The lower tail of the

other income distributions also raised substantially from 1968 to 1974,

while the real income of those in the upper tail of the distribution was

lowered (with the exception of the single women category which again particularly

reflects the compositional changes previously discussed). The reduction of

the real incomes of those in the upper tail of the income distribution is

primarily a result of decreased labor force participation.

        Table 7 gives additional information about the distribution of income

in the PuS sample. It displays the Cmi coefficient of income inequality for

both 1968 and 1974. The Cmi coefficient has been constructed so that a

measure of zero reflects complete equality and one complete inequality. This

commonly used measure has been estimated at .4746 for family income for the

entire U.S. population in 1966 (Okner, 1975). Table 7 shows that inequality

is lower than this for our sample of elderly. Further, it shows that inequality

was substantially lower in 1974 for this population than in 1968. We hypothesize

that the increase in inequality observed in the population aged 62 and 63 in

1969 relative to the younger members of the sample is due to the fact

that some of the 62 and 63 year—olds have retired, while others have not.

Inequality is sharply reduced for this vintage by 1974 when the vast

majority of them have retired. In general, we cannot separate out the

effects of aging from those of time on income inequality, but we believe

that most of the reduction in inequality from 1968 to 1974 in our population

does reflect its aging.



V. Wealth_of the Retirement His
    Survey Population
        Our results of the last two sections have shown that the elderly's

income has grown faster than the rest of the population, that the composition

of their income has changed, and suggest that income inequality is less among

the aged than the non—aged and decreases with age. A measure of the elderly's

economic position at least as important as their income is their wealth. In

this section, we calculate non—human capital balance sheets of the Retirement

History Survey population. Information on means and the distriubution of

wealth will be presented. Our wealth calculation includes the capitalized

value of all cash flows except labor income. That is, the entries under

pensions and annuities, SSI, welfare and other transfers, Medicare, Social

Security, and transfers from relatives are all capitalizations of current

or anticipated flows using a real discount rate of four percent and the correct

life expectancy for each unit.

        Table 8 gives mean assets over households reporting positive values

and the percent reporting positive values.8 This permits us to separate the

change in mean value into a change in "participation" and a change in mean

value of those participating. The table indicates a decrease in the fraction

of the sample owning homes from 68.3 percent to 64.8 percent. The average

house appreciated 62 percent in nominal terms or about 9.3 percent real.

Among participants, farm values only increased at about the inflation rate,

even though farmland generally increased at a much faster rate. This

probably was due to a higher rate of retirement among wea1tI'farmers. Both

farm and business ownership decreased substantially. The people in the

sample were paying off home mortgages (only 15.3 percent had them in 1975

versus 22.8 in 1969) and farm mortgages. The participation in U.S. bonds

is down sharply and the participation in the stock market is down slightly.

There is an increase in both the real balance and the participation in savings

accounts. As one would expect, there is an increase in the fraction of the

RHS population receiving or anticipating receiving pensions. This is partly

due to vesting and partly due to the lack of accurate information before

retirement about pension rights.

        As far as inflation vulnerability is concerned, it is difficult to

see any shift away from vulnerable assets between 1969 and 1975, even though

inflation had increased substantially.

        In Table 9 we present average asset and liability holdings in 1969

over our entire sample and over a number of subsamples.9 Mean wealth in

1969 was a rather modest $71,302. We view the distribution of wealth, however,

to be the most striking information in the table. The mean wealth of the

poorest ten percent of the population was $15,324, or only 21 percent of the

average for the whole sample. Over 86 percent of their wealth is in the form

of Social Security and Medicare. On average, all other assets sum to only

$2,123 for this group. In contrast, Social Security and Medicaire amount

to 43 percent of the wealth of the whole population and only 15 percent of

the wealth of those in the upper ten percent of the wealth distribution.

        Those in the wealthiest ten percent of the RHS sample in 1969 had on

average 3.3 times as much wealth as the entire RHS population. The value of their

corporate stocks and bonds was almost eight times as great as for the sample

population, and their business wea].th was over eight times as great as for

the average of the whole sample. Their shares of farm wealth, U.S. bonds,

other property and loan assets was also higher than their share of total

wealth. Proportionately, they had less of their wealth in houses, SSI, welfare,

Social Security, and Medicare. Bank accounts and pensions form roughly the

same proportion of the portfolio of the wealthy as of the average portfolio

for the RHS sample.

        Singles were substantially poorer than couples, with their wealth

barely half that of couples. Among singles, single women have roughly the

same wealth as single men, although the composition varies somewhat. On

average, single women have smaller financial assets, but a more valuable

claim on Social Security and Medicare. This latter fact is primairly due

to the longer life expectancies of women. If their longer life expectancy

is taken into account, their financial position may be worse than that of

single men in that they have to use about the same wealth to finance a longer

expected retirement. Farmers were much more wealthy than the rest of our

sample: their mean wealth was $l08,O83.

        Table 10 contains the balance sheets for the same subpopulations of

the RHS sample as Table 9, but the figures are for 1975. Mean wealth for the

whole sample has risen to $107,243 in current dollars. The mean wealth of those

below the ten and above the 90 percentile points are $25,682 and $321,455, respective:

By examining row 17, one sees the compositional changes. The number of couples is

down by 759, while the number of single women is up by 652 and the number

of single men increased by 187. The mean wealth of the single women now

exceeds that of single men.

        The relative amounts in Tables 9 and 10 can best be assessed by

referring to Table 11 which reports the percentage change in real mean values

of the various balance sheet entries. It shows a 16.7 percent average real

gain in house value between 1969 and 1975, a 34 percent decrease in average

farm value and a 52 percent decrease in real business value. The real value

of stocks and bonds was down more than 20 percent for the entire RHS population,

and about 26 percent for those in the top ten percent of the wealth distribution.

This is at least partly due to decreased participation. Substantially more

real wealth was held in the form of bank accounts in 1975, perhaps because of

the effective deregulation of interest rate ceilings during this period.

Pensions and annuities were up 22 percent for the whole population.



       The overall gain in real wealthwas4.B percent. Apparently, the

wealth distribution became somewhat more equal in that the mean wealth

of the poorest ten percent increased 16.8 percent while that of the

richest ten percent fell 6.2 percent. The poor performance of the

stock market may account for much of this decline.

          Table 12 gives a more complete picture of the wealth distributions

in 1969 and 1975. The first point to make is to contrast these distributions

with the income distributions of Table 6. The wealth distributions changed

far less between 1969 and 1975. This is because the 1969 wealth figures

include the capitalized value of assets (such as Social Security and Medicare)

which generated no current income in 1969. Further, the income distributions

were affected by labor income and retirement, whereas the wealth distributions

exclude human wealth. Table 12 confirms that the wealth of couples was around

twice that of singles throughout the distribution. Table 11 showed that the

mean real wealth of the wealthiest ten percent of the sample fell by 6.2

percent while Table 12 shows the 95 percentile point rising by 8. 7 percent

real. The reconciliation is that the very richest households in the sample

did quite poorly. In fact, the real wealth of the wealthiest household declined

by 50 percent. Table 12 also confirms that single women were as well off as

single men whether the measure is the mean, the median or the wealth distribution

itself.

          Table 13 shows mean and median growth rates in nominal wealth for

different quartiles of the wealth distribution. As measured by either the mean

or median, the top quartile in the wealth distribution had lower growth rates

than the rest of the sample. Our overall assessment is that wealth inequality

declined modestly for this population between 1969 and 1975.

          The final table concerning the wealth of the RHS population is Table 14.

It shows wealth and real wealth appreciation by age and marital status. To

avoid the compositional problems encountered in previous tables, we have included

in this table only those whose marital status was unchanged from 1969 to 1975.

The implications of Table 14 are most easily seen by examining Figures 2 and 3

in which median and mean real wealth by age may be found. We observe two

important results in Figures 2 and 3. As measured by the medians, the

wealth of couples and of the entire sample was about $10,000 higher in

1975 than in 1969, taking into account the aging of the sample. We base

this observation on the shape of the wealth by age profile in 1969 and

1975: it appears to have shifted up by about $10,000. The second observation

is that although most cohorts had an increase in real wealth over the period,

the youngest cohorts had the largest increases and the oldest cohorts had the

smallest. This may be seen more easily in Figure 4, where we display the

growth in real wealth by cohort. It is clear that the rate of wealth

accumulation falls with initial age. We take this to be fully consistent

with a life cycle model of consumption in which there were unanticipated

capital gains in some assets. These results indicate that even though the

cross section wealth profile may not drop with age, the individuals in the

cohort are consuming according to life cycle theory.

VI. Income_and Wealth

        Income is often taken to be an indicator of economic well being;

for example, poverty levels are defined by income. Nost economists, however,

would probably say that wealth is a better indicator as it measures better

permanent economic position. In this section, we study the stability of the

income and wealth distributions over tfme, and the correlation between income

and wealth.

        The first column in Table 15 gives the probability that a household

will be in a specified part of the income distribution in 1975, given that

the household was in that part of the distribution in 1969. The entries are,

therefore, one minus the transition probabilities. For example, if a household

were in the lower five percent income tail in 1969, the probability is .197

that it was in the lower five percent income tail in 1975. We see that the

income stability of the lower tail is fairly weak, at least much weaker than

the stability of the upper tail. Undoubtedly, the reason is that the income

at the upper tail partly reflects wealth, which tends to be more stable than

earnings. This result confirms the notion that there is considerable mobility in the

income distribution, and that it is generally not accurate to say that poverty

as measured by income is a permanent state.

        The second column of Table 15 gives the corresponding conditional

probabilities in wealth. It is evident that there is much more stability

in the wealth distribution than in the income distribution. This calculation

ignores an important and stable form of wealth, human capital.    If that were

included, the distribution would surely be even more stable.     Even though the

entire distribution of wealth moved up between 1969 and 1975, as reported in

earlier tables, the lower wealth tail remained low. That fact and the stability

of the lower wealth tail indicate that the same households that were poor

in wealth in 1969 were poor in 1975.

        The usefulness of income as an indicator of economic well being

can also be examined by studying the correlation between income and wealth.

Tables 16 and 17 give the cross—tabulations of income quartiles by wealth

quartiles in 1969 and 1975. In each cell two numbers are given: the upper

is the absolute frequency of the cell; the lower is the percent of the row

and column. Thus, 14.5 percent of the sample is in both the lower income

and wealth quartiles, and 57.9 percent of those in the lowest income quartile

are also in the lowest wealth quartile. We see that there is substantial

but by no means exclusive concentration along the diagonals: in 1969 49.2

percent of the observations were in the same income and wealth quartiles.

Although low income is a very good predictor of wealth, it is not completely

accurate; for example, 15.7 percent of those in the lowest income quartile

were in the upper half of the wealth distribution; about 26 percent of those

in the lower half of the income distribution were in the upper half of the

wealth distribution.

        The 1975 data show a higher correlation between income and wealth:

about 56 percent of the observations were in the same income and wealth

quartiles. Income is a stronger indicator of wealth: 7.8 percent of those

in the lowest income quartile were in the upper half of the wealth distribution.

The most important reasons for the increased correlation are that before

retirement an important component of income comes from an unmeasured component

of wealth, human capital, and that several important measured components of

wealth, Social Security and Medicare, do not yet yield an income flow before

retirement.

VII. The   Fffects of   Inflation   on   the    E1dej1
         We next investigate the vulnerability of the elderly to unanticipated

changes in the price level and the inflation rate. As we mentioned in the

introduction, it is commonly held that the elderly are particularly vulnerable

to inflation. To investigate the accuracy of this impression, we develop and

calculate three different vulnerability measures. The first two reflect the

vulnerability to a price level shock where interest rates, the rate of inflation,

etc., all remain unaffected. The third neasure calculates vulnerability to an

inflation rate shock where the long run expected rate of inflation and nominal

interest rates are revised upward.             For all measures we classify assets and

liabilities into three categories: those which offer a real or indexed return

and are therefore protected from unanticipated price changes or inflation

changes; those whose real values are reduced by inflation, and those whose

real valuincrease with inflation. The classification is shown in Table 18.

          Our first measure of vulnerability (V1) measures the percentage loss

in   real wealth per percent unanticipated increase in the price level. It is

simply defined as nominal assets less nominal liabilities (the sum of category

2 entries in Table 18 less those in category 3) divided by total net worth.

The idea is that the real value of nominal assets and liabilities decline point—

for—point with unanticipated jumps in the price level.           A V1 value of zero would

mean that the household is completely protected against price level jumps, whereas

an index of one would indicate that the household's real wealth declines one

percent for each one percent rise in the price level. V2, our second measure,

differs only in that it treats common stocks as nominal assets and is, therefore,

in category two. Theoretically, stocks represent a claim to the income flows

of real capital and unanticipated increases in the price level should increase

aThere is a theoretical reason for thinking that houses are over—indexed: the value
of houses will rise faster than inflation due to their tax treatment. Thus, our
vulnerability measures may overstate true vulnerability.

their real value to the extent the company is leveraged. That is, it is

the stockholders who should gain at the expense of the bondholders. The

performance of the U.S. stock market in the past 17 years is such that

one would not want to carry this argument too far, and hence the calculation

of V2.

         The third measure, V3, differs in that it attempts to measure the

sensitivity of the wealth position of the elderly to an unexpected increase

n the inflation rate and the long term nominal interest rates. We assume

a strict point—for—point Fisher effect. The difference between this

vulnerability and V1 and V2 is that for V3 the maturity of assets is important.

For example, a one percent price level increase would depress the real value

ofa consol by one percent. However, a one percent increase in inflation

which drove interest rates from seven to eight percent would immediately

reduce the value of a consol by 12.5 percent. We attempt to calculate in V3

the immediate fall in real wealth as a fraction of total wealth for a one point

increase in inflation. The weights in Table 18 give the sensitivity of the

value of various balance sheet entries to a rise of one percent in nominal

interest rates. In general, the items are less vulnerable to an interest

rate increase in 1975 because of shorter durations. For example, the maturity

of average government bonds was reduced from 50 months to 32, and of average

outstanding corporate bonds from 12 years to ten.

         The medians of our vulnerability measures are shown in Table 19. For

all households in the RBS sample in 1969, the median of the V1 measure is .05.

This means that a ten percent unexpected increase in the price level would

reduce the real wealth by one-half of one percent. Vulnerability does not seem to

depend greatly on marital status, but is slightly lower for single women than

NOTE: V1 and V2 measure the percentage decrease in the real value of net worth
          per percent unexpected increase in the price level. They are defined as
          net nominal financial assets divided by total net worth. V2 includes
          common    stocks   as a nominal asset while V1 treats stocks as real assets.
          V3 calculates the percent decrease in the real value of net worth for a
          one percent unanticipated change in long run inflation reflected in a one
          percent rise in long run interest rates. Common stocks are treated as
          real assets.

men. It was noted earlier that single women hold a somewhat higher

fraction of their wealth in Social Security and Medica:id and less in

financial assets. The poorest ten percent of the sample have essentially

zero net financial assets and hence are unaffected by price changes.

However, those in the top ten percent of the wealth distribution are more

vulnerable than average; the median value of V1 over the group was .19 in

1969. Vulnerability was up somewhat in 1975 over 1969 due primarily to

the large increase in bank accounts and private pensions.

        V2, which adds common stocks to the list of vulnerable financial

assets, is somewhat higher than V1, but the median is still very modest.

In 1975, for instance, the median V2 stood at .12 for the whole RHS   population.
At that point, a household is 88 percent "indexed" from price level shocks.

Even V3, the wealth sensitivity to long run inflation increases, is not too

great as measured by the median figure. Here, as in all cases, those in

the upper wealth tail are more vulnerable. The overall impression from the

median is that the wealth positions of most of the sample are not substantially

harmed by increases in the price level or in the inflation rate. Certainly,

these results indicate much less inflation vulnerability than the common

impression.

        The lower portion of Table 19 gives the percentile point defining the

upper ten percent of the vulnerability distribution. It indicates that there

is a wide distribution of vulnerability, particularly vulnerability to long

run inflation. While the median figure for V3 in 1969 for the entire

population was .06, those in the upper ten percent of the vulnerability tail

had a V3 of greater than 2.81 percent. That is, for each extra point of

inflation, they immediately lost at least 2.8 percent in wealth. The 90 percent
                                      43


 points indicate that not only is median vulnerability among the ealthy

high, but there are substantial numbers with quite high vulnerability.

For example, the 90 percentile point among the wealthyin 1969 was 3.70.

Correspondingly, almost no poor had substantial vulnerability.

         Although median vulnerability increased only slightly from 1969

to 1975, the upper part of the distribution decreased substantially.

This is shown in Figure 5 in which some of the data of Table 19 have been

graphed. The incidence of high vulnerability has decreased. For example,

the fraction of the sample having greater V3 than V2 decreased from 15 percent

in 1969 to six percent in 1975.

         Tables 20 and 21 give the distribution of V1 and V3, respectively,

by age cohort for 1969 and 1975. They show a consistent, although weak, agr

effect in that the older cohorts have higher levels of vulnerability. More

informative, however, may be that both tables indicate that more than 25

percent of the RHS sample would actually gain from a price level hike or

an increase in inflation. Some of the data from Tables 20 and 21 appear in

Figures 6 and 7.   It appears that, at least at the median, there was a slight

upward shift in the distribution of V1 between 1969 and 1975. This is not

conclusive, of course, as the difference could be due to a shift in the

distribution at about age 63 or 64, rather than a secular shift. The distri—

bution of V3 by age shows some tendency to increase with age; however, the

most important feature of Figure 7 is the downward shift in the 90 percent

point.

         We have calculated vulnerability indices by classifying assets

according to our view of their vulnerability to inflation. If the indices

are useful predictors of real wealth changes of the elderly, we should find

aggregate data show. This appears as a shift in the income profile by age

between 1969 and 1975. Similarly, there appeared to be a shift in the

wealth profile for the most important part of the sample——couples. Thus,

although no cohort gained in real wealth, it seems that taking into account

the aging of the sample, wealth was   higher.   These results offer support

for the life cycle hypothesis of consumption: wealth gain between 1969 and

1975 decreased systematically by age in 1969.
        Our results on inflation vulnerability are consistent with the gains

in wealth of the elderly. The popular conception is that the elderly are

vulnerable to inflation; yet, during the inflation of the early 1970s, the

elderly gained in wealth. Our vulnerability indices are consistent with

this gain. Even though the elderly on average appear to have maintained

their income and wealth position, our results indicate that there is a wide

distribution of income, wealth and inflation vulnerability. In the

latter especially, a substantial part of the elderly population is inflation

protected, yet some individuals are quite vulnerable. The situation is made

more tolerable, however, because the highly inflation—vulnerable individuals

are concentrated among the wealthy, who are better able to afford the inflation

risk.

        We may speculate that th inflation of the latter part of the decade

has not overly harmed the elderly because in 1975 the elderly typically were

not vulnerable as measured by our index, and that index seemed to have good

predictive power of the effects of inflation during the early part of the decade.

That this is the correct view rather than the popular view that the elderly have

suffered during the inflation period is supported by a recent poll.10 According
                                    51



to this poll, 68 percent of the people less than 65 years old think that

finances are a very serious problem for most people over 65; but only

17 percent of the people over 65 think finances are a serious problem

for the elderly.

                                     APPENDIX


I.   Descrip_t ion of   the   Data
        The Retirement History Survey (RHS) is a national longitudinal survey
of 11,153 households whose heads were 58 through 63 years old in 1969. The

surviving households were reinterviewed every two years through 1979. Detailed

data on financial characteristics, work behavior and health were obtained. The

file is especially useful for this study because the RHS data were matched to

Social Security earnings records which give contributions to Social Security

throughout the working life through 1974. Therefore, it is possible to

calculate exactly the Social Security benefits a worker would receive were he

to retire.

        Because we study changes in economic position, we dropped from the 1969

sample households that did not survive until 1975. We were left with 8,244

households.
                                                                            11
        For a variety of reasons, missing values occurred on the data tape.

If we had eliminated households on the basis of missing values, the resulting

sample would have been small because of the large number of components of

wealth. Therefore, we imputed missing values after carefully examining the

raw data. We now describe how we calculated income and wealth.



II. Income Variables

        In computing income for the sample in 1969 and 1975, we took a broad

view of the components of income. In addition to such conventional income

sources as Social Security, wage, rent, interest, pensions, government transfers,
                                           53



annuities, and contributions from relatives, we imputed income from

Medicare/Medicaid and owner—occupied housing.

       The following conventions were used to impute missing income

components for 1969 and 1975:

                                  —
       Respondentts Wage Income       delete household from sample for
                                                            12
                                      income analysis.

       Spouse's Wage Income       —   If   spouse's employment status was "working,"

                                      then assign the median value for working

                                      spouses in the sample, otherwise assign zero.

      Self—employment Income      —   If   the respondent was classified as self—

                                      employed, then assign the median value for

                                      self—employed respondents with valid responses;

                                      otherwise assign zero.

      Respondent Rental Income — Assign median rental income for respondents

                                      with positive values.

                                  —
      Spouse Rental Income            Assign    zero.

      Interest Income 1969        —   Assign .056 x [U.S. Bonds] + .04 x [Savings
                                      Accounts] +       .06 x [Stocks + Bonds   + Shares]

                                      + .06 x [Loan Assets].

      Interest Income 1975        —
                                      Assign .078 x [U.S. Bonds] + .05 x [Savings
                                      Accounts] +       .10 x [Stocks + Bonds + Shares]
                                      + .10 x [Loan Assets].

      Other Variables 1969        —   Assign    zero.

      Other Variables 1975        —   If   the response was coded that the household

                                      had the income source, then assign the median

                                      value for all households with the income source

                                      and valid replies; otherwise assign zero.
                                     54



       housing services for owner—occupants were valued at three percent

of the gross housing value for 1969 and 1975.

       Medicare/Medicaid values for the 1975 income data are computed as

follows.'3 All households without Social Security income are assigned

Medicare values of zero. For those households receiving Social Security,

male members are assigned the average Medicare value for men their age

receiving Medicare in 1975. Female members are assigned the average Medicare

value for females their age receiving Medicare in 1975. All households are

assigned the average Medicaid value for households 65 and over in 1975.



III. Wealth_Variables

       The total wealth of each household was computed from the individual

wealth components, some of which were stock variables (e.g., house value)

and some which were capitalized flow variables (e.g., present discounted

value of a stream of pension benefits). The first step was to obtain a valid

value for each component of each household's wealth.

       The general strategy for imputing missing values was to retain the

individual component of each record. The hierarchy for imputations had three

levels. At the first level, we used all valid observations. Then, if an

item was missing for 1975 (1969), its value was imputed if possible from the

previous (next) wave of the RHS by multiplying the available value by the

growth rate in the median value of such assets or income for all non—missing

respondents between the previous (next) wave of the RHS and 1975 (1969).

Imputations used the most recent wave of the R}IS that had a valid value, but

could go as far back (forward) as 1969 (1973). If a datum could not be imputed

by reference to a similar question in another year for the same respondent, the
                                         55



third level of the imputation hierarchy was to set the datum        equal   to the

median of all non—missing replies for other respondents in that year.

       Flow variables were capitalized into stock variables using a three

percent discount rate. The horizons over which different variables were

capitalized were:

       Pensions                      —   Until expected death date of respondent.

       AFDC Benefits                 —   For three years.
                                  14 —
       All other Flow Variables          Until the maximum expected death date

                                         of respondent or spouse.

All capitalizations were compounded annually.

       Medicare/Medicaid wealth was computed using the mean 1975 (1969) benefits

for elderly persons. This was capitalized at a three percent discount rate

for both respondent and spouse with the expected date of death. Then the

present value of the flow received before age 65 was subtracted off where

the individual was not yet age 65.

       Expected Social Security wealth is computed using the Social Security

Administration Earnings Record (through 1974). The algorithm to compute 1975

(1969) Social Security wealth is based upon the Social Security law in effect

on January 1, 1975 (1969). The Social Security Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

is calculated for each person based on his/her earnings record, assuming the

individual retires as soon as possible (age 62 or as soon as sufficient quarters

of covered employment are accumulated after age 62 for those not yet eligible

by age 62). It is assumed that for married couples, the male's potential PIA

is always greater than or equal to the female's PIA, so that the male's Social

Security wealth is always based on his own PIA computed from his own earnings

record. The female's Social Security wealth is taken as the maximum of her
                                          56



own PIA or her   spouse   or widow's benefit based on her husband's PIA.

She is allowed to switch from her own benefit to her spouse or widow

benefit over time, but not from spouse benefit to her own benefit.

       Single men    and women have a Social Security wealth based on their
own PIA only. Widows at the      time   of the initial survey (1969) are treated

as never   married   (no possible widow benefit calculated) because the SSA

Earnings Record match file does not contain any information on their deceased

spouse. For surviving widows of original 1969 male respondents, however,

there is information on the deceased spouse. These widows are allowed to

draw a widow's benefit if it is greater than the benefit based on their own

PIA. In computing the potential widow's benefit for surviving spouses, the

deceased husband is treated as if he had retired at the earliest possible

age according to the rules normally applied to living male respondents, unless

that age would be a year later than 1975, in which case he is treated as if

he had retired at age 65.

       If a respondent does not have sufficient covered quarters of employment

by 1975 (1969) to be eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement,

then his current work status and his expectation about receipt of Social

Security benefits in the future are taken into account to estimate whether

he ever will be eligible for benefits and at what date. These estimates are

used to calculate Social Security wealth.

       Average life expectancies for men and women are used to determine the

length of the stream of income. The streams are capitalized at a three

percent discount rate.

       If a spouse of a respondent does not have sufficient quarters of

covered employment by 1975 (1969) to be separately eligible for Social Security
                                       57


retirement benefits, then it is   assumed that he or she will never accumulate
sufficient quarters to be eligible. A male spouse then ends up with zero

Social Security wealth, and a female spouse with a Social Security wealth

based only on their potential spouse and widow benefits.

1. We choose 1968, 1969, 1974, and 1975 as much of the income and wealth

       data in later tables refer to those years.

2. The major exclusion is income—in—kind such as food stamps and subsidized

       housing.

3. Because we have no measures of scale effects in household size, we cannot

       say which is the better measure of economic position.

4. If we were to include the increase in subsidized housing and food stamps,

       the decrease would be even greater.

5. We have assumed that the elderly value these government programs at their

      insurance value. It is possible that this exaggerates their worth if the

      elderly would not have bought this coverage themselves. This type of

      valuation problem always exists for transfers in kind rather than case

      transfers.

6.   Income at age 63 is actually income of the year preceding when the

     head was 63. Thus, the sharp drop at 63 reflects retirements at 62.

7. Of course, these very low incomes do not necessarily show permanent

     economic status. We examine this issue further below when we study

     income transition and wealth.

8.   Units reporting ownership of     the asset but not its value are excluded

     from    this   table. Thus, participation is slightly higher than indicated

     here.

9. We estimated missing values. A description of our method may be

     found in the Appendix

10. New York Times, November 19, 1981.

11. For example, respondent did not know the value of an income source,

     respondent did not answer the question, the response was miscoded.

12. These households, which accounted for less than five percent of the

     sample, were deleted because no other variables were good proxies for

     the major component of income.

13. It is assumed that Medicare/Medicaid was zero in 1969 based on the age

     of the survey respondents.

14. Supplementary Security Income, other public assistance, income from

     private insurance and annuities, benefits from private welfare agencies,

     income from relatives, income from other sources.
