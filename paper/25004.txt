                                          ABSTRACT

We examine the effect of negative nominal interest rates on bank profitability and behavior using
a cross-country panel of over 5,100 banks in 27 countries. Our data set includes annual
observations for Japanese and European banks between 2010 and 2016, which covers all
advanced economies that have experienced negative nominal rates, including currency union
members as well as both fixed and floating exchange rates countries. When we compare negative
nominal interest rates with low positive rates, banks experience losses in interest income that are
almost exactly offset by savings on deposit expenses and gains in non-interest income, including
capital gains on securities and fees. We find heterogeneous effects of negative rates: banks from
regimes with floating exchange rates, small banks, and banks with low deposit ratios drive most
of our results. Low-deposit banks have enjoyed particularly striking gains in non-interest income,
likely from capital gains on securities. There have only been modest differences between high
and low deposit-ratio banks’ changes in interest expenses; high deposit banks do not seem
disproportionately vulnerable to negative rates. Banks also responded to negative rates by
increasing lending activity, and raising the share of deposit funding. Overall, our results indicate
surprisingly benign implications of negative rates for commercial banks thus far.

1. Introduction
         Low interest rates around the world due to accommodative monetary policy regimes

have been a source of concern for the banking industry for some time. In the immediate wake

of the global financial crisis of 2007-09, policy rates in several advanced economies fell to levels

close to the so-called “zero lower bound.” This interest rate environment has raised concerns

that nominal deposit rates could not fall below zero without eroding banks’ customer bases.

Accordingly, many viewed the low interest rate environment as an obstacle to bank profitability

due to narrowing interest rate margins [e.g. Jobst and Lin (2016)]. This claim has been

confirmed empirically in the literature; for example, Borio, et al (2017) found that bank

profitability is reduced at low rates of interest and that the sensitivity of profitability to rate

reductions is enhanced as interest rates fall. Moreover, Borio and Gambacorta (2017) found

that bank lending becomes less responsive to reductions in policy rates as they approach zero,

suggesting that the financial channel of the monetary transmission mechanism is weaker as

interest rates approach zero. 1


         In any case, monetary policies in a substantial number of countries have, in fact, broken

through zero, and now have negative policy rates. 2 Any arguments made for a weak monetary

transmission mechanism at low positive rates (due to the adverse implications for bank

profitability) should apply even more forcefully to negative nominal interest rates, as



1
 Reductions in short-term interest rates have been shown to affect the characteristics of both borrowers [e.g.
Bernanke and Gertler (1995)] and lenders [e.g. Kashyap and Stein (2000)], inducing increased lending activity [e.g.
Bernanke and Blinder (1992) and Jiménez, et al (2012)].

2
  See Arteta, et al (2017) for a discussion of the motivation of central banks to move interest rates below the zero-
lower bound.


                                                          1
adjustments in deposit rates hit a hard stop at the zero bound. In practice, banks have been

generally unwilling to charge negative nominal interest rates on deposits, especially for smaller

customers. Eggertson, et al (2017) make this argument and provide a theoretical foundation

for the special role of negative rates in disrupting the financial monetary transmission channel.

Their empirical evidence is based on aggregate data from five countries and the euro area as

well as bank-level data from Sweden. Rostagno, et al (2016) found that movements into

negative rates may induce lending by making it costlier for banks to hoard cash.


       Several studies, reviewed below, have examined the implications of negative interest

rates for bank profitability and behavior; almost all use bank-level data for an individual country

or currency. Most studies conclude that responses at the bank level have mitigated the adverse

effect of negative rates on bank profitability and lending. Specifically, some banks have been

adept at increasing non-interest income (such as through increased fees), while others have

adjusted funding allocations to rely less on deposits. The nature of adjustments taken by any

individual bank depends on both its business model and size, as both influence a bank’s reliance

on deposit funding as opposed to more market-based wholesale funding.


       A challenge with any study that relies on the experience of a single economy is that the

move to negative rates reflects prevailing economic conditions. This endogeneity makes it

difficult to identify any change in bank profitability and/or behavior that stems solely from

negative rates. In this paper, we move towards partially addressing this challenge by

considering a panel of cross-country data. Since different economies move to negative rates at

different times, this feature of the panel allows us to include fixed time effects to control for

responses to global conditions. Many have argued that global financial shocks – particularly

                                                 2
monetary policy shocks – have been particularly relevant during our sample period, e.g., Rey

(2015). Further, since some countries in our panel never experience negative nominal rates,

our work can be viewed as a difference-in-difference study; i.e., we compare banks in

economies that experienced negative rates (as opposed to those that did not), after policy rates

turned negative (as opposed to before). Local conditions are also likely to affect both bank

profitability and monetary policy. We respond to this econometric challenge by instrumenting

for negative policy rates with proxies for local conditions, using variables commonly associated

with conventional monetary rules: unemployment; GDP growth; the output gap; and inflation.


       Our sample includes annual income statements for 5,113 banks from the European

Union and Japan, between 2010 (before the advent of negative nominal rates) and 2016 (the

most recent period available), and includes observations (with gaps) for fourteen different

currencies, one of which is the 19-country Euro. Our sample also allows us to examine

countries that “go negative” at different times and for different reasons. Presumably,

movements into negative rates are different in floating exchange rate countries as opposed to

those with pegged exchange rates, since the latter respond more to foreign pressures that

might undermine the peg. We exploit this difference below by examining our results across

exchange rate regimes. More generally, our study differs from most of the existing literature in

looking at bank performance in a large set of banks from a variety of different monetary

regimes. To our knowledge, it is the first study that pools European and Japanese data on bank

performances at negative rates, providing substantial variability in the data. Moreover, our

sample includes a large number of banks, allowing us to analyze precisely the banks most




                                                3
exposed to adverse effects from negative interest rates. Accordingly, we split our data into

sub-samples along two interesting dimensions: a) bank size, and b) reliance on deposits.


        Our results suggest that bank profitability as a whole has, thus far, been unaffected by

negative nominal interest rates. We find no substantive effect on overall net income from

negative rates. These results are notable because relative to the existing literature, our sample

includes a relatively large share of small banks and banks that are more reliant on deposit

funding (i.e., high-deposit banks), both of which would be expected to be more exposed to

losses under negative interest rates.


        While banks have generally experienced only negligible income effects, we find that

they suffer statistically significant losses in net interest income. More precisely, banks

experience statistically significant losses both on lending income and “other” interest income.3

These losses are mitigated somewhat by reductions in interest expenses, but not sufficiently to

avoid overall interest income losses. Notably, banks do not substantially reduce deposit

expenses, probably because most nominal deposit rates are sticky at zero. Large banks appear

to be more capable of adjusting their funding costs, as they achieve statistically significant

reduction in deposit expenses, while changes in small bank deposit expenses are insignificant.


        To make up for losses on net interest income, banks have achieved significant gains in

net non-interest income; we find statistically significant increases in both fees and (especially)




3
  Other interest income is defined as interest income generated from all non-loan assets such as debt securities,
trading book items, short-term funds, and investment securities, excluding insurance related interest.


                                                         4
other non-interest income, such as capital gains and gains on securities and insurance. Large

banks also reduce other interest expenses more than their smaller counterparts.


       Furthermore, we find that banks that rely relatively less on deposits (hereafter low-

deposit or “LD”), do better under negative interest rates than their high-deposit (HD)

counterparts; HD banks are more vulnerable to losses attributable to a zero-lower bound on

deposits than their LD counterparts. LD banks suffer bigger reductions in net interest income

but also receive larger increases in net non-interest income under negative rates.


       To see if our results depend on the monetary regime, we split our data into a variety of

sub-samples composed of either large countries (Japan and German), or small countries with

similar (fixed or floating) exchange rate regimes. Our results are heterogeneous; the effect of

negative nominal interest rates on bank profitability varies with the monetary regime. Our key

result – that negative nominal interest rates only have a small overall effect on bank

profitability, since losses in interest income are offset by gains in non-interest income – appears

to stem primarily from banks in economies with floating exchange rates.

       Finally, we extend our analysis on bank performance to review the effects of the

negative rate environment on banking activities. Negative rates lead total bank lending to

increase as a proportion of total assets a result driven by small and HD banks . LD banks tend to

lower their lending activities, a key reason why they also experience a larger decline in interest

income. All banks decrease their holdings in safe assets (such as cash and central bank

reserves) in response to negative nominal interest rates. Negative rates also induce banks to

increase their deposit funding and their leverage.

2. Literature Review


        As nominal interest rates in advanced economies have been low by historic standards

since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, it is unsurprising that a literature has examined bank

performance at low positive rates. Borio, et al (2017) find that bank profitability is reduced at

low interest rates, and that the sensitivity of profitability to rate reductions is enhanced as

interest rates fall; Claessens, et al (2018) obtains similar results for a large cross-section of

banks, driven by reductions in interest rate margins. A recent study by the Committee on the

Global Financial System [CGFS (2018)] uses a large cross-country panel and finds that net

interest margins fall with declines in 3-month rates. 4


        Borio and Gambacorta (2017) find that bank lending becomes less responsive to

reductions in policy rates as these approach zero. Delis and Kouretas (2011) find that bank risk

tolerance increases at low interest rates.


        Bikker and Vervliet (2017) examine a panel of US banks from 2001-2015 and find that

bank profitability is reduced at low interest rates; the primary cause is reduced net interest

margins. They also find that American banks can maintain overall profitability under low rates

by adjusting on other margins, a result echoed below. Bikker and Vervliet speculate that

defaults drop under low rates, allowing banks to reduce provisioning for bad loans; they do not

find evidence of increased risk exposure.


4
  The CGFS (2018) study examines a panel of more than 10,000 banks over 45 jurisdictions, and includes data up to
2016. As such, its panel also includes some countries under negative rates, e.g., Japan. However, its specification
treats low positive and negative rates symmetrically. Buch, et al (2018) report results for lending activity using a
shadow monetary policy rate that allows coefficients on bank characteristics to vary over conventional and
unconventional policy periods.


                                                         6
       A literature also examines bank behavior in economies that have experienced negative

nominal interest rates. Bech and Malkhozov (2016) study the movement into negative territory

by four central banks in Europe since 2014. They note that the transmission between policy

and money market interest rates is similar under negative and low positive rates, banks appear

loathe to charge negative deposit rates. Turk (2016) examines samples of Danish and Swedish

banks and finds that bank margins were roughly stable across the zero threshold; reductions in

wholesale funding costs and increased fees offset losses experienced in interest income. Arce,

et al. (2018) find that banks with reduced net interest margins under negative rates are often

poorly capitalized and take less risk.


       A number of studies examine negative rates and banking activity using micro data.

Heider, et al (2017) examine lending activity by 46 eurozone banks to a large number of

individual firms between 2013 and 2015. Relative to similar rate cuts with positive rates, they

find that the introduction of negative rates in the euro area in 2014 induced deposit-dependent

banks to cut lending, and to reallocate loans towards more risky firms. They deal with the

potential problem of monetary policy endogeneity by including industry-year and country-year

fixed effects. Nucera, et al (2017) examine 111 eurozone banks and find that negative rates

induced change in a bank’s propensity to become undercapitalized in a financial crisis, a

characteristic known as “SRisk”; smaller, more traditional banks exhibited a disproportionate

increase in riskiness relative to large banks, in response to interest rate cuts below zero.


       Basten and Mariathasan (2018) examine 68 Swiss banks, using the share of excess

reserves as a proxy for exposure to negative rates. They find that banks with higher excess

reserves raised fees and interest income to compensate for negative liability margins. Banks

                                                 7
also adjusted liabilities, primarily through reductions in bond issuance, thus increasing maturity

mismatch.


        Demiralp, et al (2017) examine data for 205 Euro area banks and find the portfolio

adjustments at negative rates differ by bank characteristic. Banks that rely heavily on deposit

funding extend more loans when rates are negative, investment banks adjust by reducing

excess liquidity, and wholesale banks raise the share of government bonds in their portfolios.

Demiralp, et al note that identifying the impact of negative rates is difficult because of the

confluence of other policies adopted by the ECB as it moved to negative rates. 5 They respond

by asserting that a bank’s sensitivity to negative rates depend on its business model. They

further claim that banks will be more sensitive to negative rates the higher their excess

liquidity, as these assets particularly suffer from negative returns on excess reserves. Basten

and Mariathasan (2018) confirm that Swiss banks with greater initial excess reserves reduced

these more aggressively compared to banks with smaller holdings. For all these reasons, we

examine differences across bank types below, splitting banks by both size and reliance on

deposit funding.


        Our focus on the interest and non-interest income components is shared by Borio and

Gambacorta (2015), Basten and Mariathason (2017 and Stiroh (2004). Stiroh finds that U.S.

banks’ reliance on non-interest income during the 1990s increased their overall risk and had

few diversification benefits. In contrast, Albertazzi and Gambacorta (2009) found that non-



5
 For example, the movement into negative territory on June 2014 was shortly followed by the introduction of
targeted long-term refinancing operations in September of that year, while subsequent rate cuts under negative
values coincided with the introduction or the extension of the ECB asset purchase program, Demiralp, et al (2017).


                                                        8
interest income was less correlated with the macroeconomic conditions for European banks

over a similar time-period, and thus provided diversification benefits. Lee et al. (2014) focus on

Asian banks in the 2000s and find that the influence of non-interest income on risk and

profitability varied widely by country and bank business model. These disparate results

highlight the challenges in understanding the relationship between macroeconomic factors and

bank non-interest income.




3. The Data Set


         Our data set consists of balance sheet and income statement variables for individual

banks between 2010 through 2016, taken from the Fitch Global Banking database. 6 The

observations come from 28 European countries and Japan, thus covering a variety of monetary

regimes including monetary unions, exchange rate peggers, and inflation targeters. Our data

set begins two years before the onset of negative nominal interest rates and includes all

countries that experienced negative nominal interest rates through the end of our observations

in 2016.7, 8



6
  Fitch sources its data through financial statements “… directly through web crawlers, alerts, by direct request
and data feed.” See https://app.fitchconnect.com/support for more detail.

7
  We remove a number of categories of non-banks from the original Fitch data set, including: a) branches; b) bond
banks; c) securities brokers; d) credit card banks; e) leasing subsidiaries; f) factor subsidiaries; and g) other
brokerages.

8
  Data on policy rates are taken from central bank websites for: the official British bank rate; the Bulgarian base
rate; the 2-week Czech repo rate; the Danish certificate of deposit rate; the ECB deposit facility rate; the Estonian
Talibor rate; the 3-month Hungarian base rate; the Japanese uncollateralized overnight call rate; the Latvian
refinancing rate; the Lithuanian Vilibor overnight rate; the Swedish repo rate; and the Swiss 3-month LIBOR.



                                                          9
        Our data set differs from the existing literature primarily in two dimensions. First, we

include a variety of countries with different monetary regimes; these entered negative rates at

different points in time, if at all. During our sample, five economies experienced negative

nominal policy interest rates: Denmark, the EMU, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland. Denmark

first crossed into negative rates in July 2012, while the Swiss interest rates have been most

negative (with rates on sight deposits at -0.75%). 9 We also include similar countries that did

not go negative: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, and the UK.10 We include time fixed effects

to account for global conditions, and, more generally, employ a difference-in-differences

strategy; not all our economies experienced negative rates, and none for the entire sample.

        The second difference from the literature is that, with over 5,100 banks and more than

30,00 observations, our data set is relatively large. The database allows us to examine closely

the effects of negative rates on banks that differ along several dimensions, such as size and

deposit-reliance. We identify a bank as large if its assets exceed $10 billion during the sample;

about an eighth of our banks are large. If a bank’s deposits exceeded 75% of total funding at

some point in the sample (as is true of four-fifths of our sample), it is defined as high-deposit.

        Our data set has a few complications. Banks report information using different

(sometimes multiple) accounting methods. While we used bank-level fixed effects throughout,

we want as consistent a sample as possible. Therefore, when we have duplicate time series of

0Rates.pdf .

10
   Poland and Romania do not enter our sample since their nominal policy rates never fell low enough; we also
exclude Croatia since it only entered the EU in 2013.



                                                       10
banks reported in different accounting methods, we drop the less-popularly-used method for

the bank’s country. We also drop banks that use unconventional accounting systems.11 Finally,

we generally choose unconsolidated observations, only reporting consolidated observations if

unconsolidated are unavailable. We use annual observations, typically reported in the fourth

quarter (Japanese banks report them in the first quarter). Since our data set also has suspicious

outliers, we typically truncate variables at the first and ninety-ninth percentiles, dropping the

outliers (exceptions to this rule are tabulated below).

           Descriptive statistics are tabulated in Appendix Table A1. At the right, we present mean

values for bank income (as a percentage of total assets), along with standard deviations, for

nine different monetary regimes. We compare bank profitability under negative and low

positive nominal interest rates, defining the latter as a policy rate that is within the [0, 1%)

range (we refer to “positive” rather than “low positive” rates, for the sake of brevity). 12 Of the

five economies that experienced negative nominal interest rates, net income was, on average,

higher under positive rates for the EMU, Japan, and Sweden. However, the differences

between positive and negative rates were small, and both Danish and Swiss banks did slightly

better with negative rates. This impression is corroborated by Figure 1, which scatters bank

profitability against the policy rate. The regression line has no slope, suggesting little effect of

interest rates on bank profitability.




11
     We define an accounting method as unconventional if it is used in less than 10% of a country’s observations.

12
  We use official policy rates to characterize nominal interest rates in this study, and these vary in term from
overnight to three-months. In future research, we plan to repeat this study with a common-term market-based
measure of prevailing interest rates.

4. Bank Profitability under Negative Nominal Interest Rates

         Our empirical strategy is to use a plain-vanilla approach, relying on the richness of our

data set rather than elaborate econometrics. Accordingly, we begin with a conventional least-

squares panel specification:



         Yijt = βNEGIjt + {δi} + {θt} + εijt                                                       (1)




                                                         12
where:


      •    Yijt is the dependent variable of interest for bank i in country j for year t,

      •    NEGIjt is a binary variable which is one if country j had a negative nominal policy interest

           rate during year t, and is zero if the nominal policy interest rate was low and positive,

           meaning either zero or below 1% (observations with higher nominal rates are dropped),

      •    {δ} and {θ} are comprehensive sets of bank- and time-specific fixed effects, and

      •    εijt represents a residual, assumed to be well-behaved.


The coefficient of interest to us is β, the average effect of negative (as opposed to low positive)

nominal interest rates on the dependent variable of interest. We use robust standard errors,

clustered by bank.


           We are interested in a number of overall and disaggregated measures of bank

performance; we typically measure these as ratios of total assets. 13 Also, we drop outliers of

our dependent variables, typically defining those as observations outside the (1, 99) percentiles

of the univariate distribution.14


Benchmark Results


           Our single most striking set of results can be seen in the top three cells at the left of

Table 1. This presents estimates of β (multiplied by 100 for ease of presentation), for five



13
  We have confirmed that our results are insensitive to the use of earning assets – assets that are expected to
earn an actual return and thus excluding accounting-related items - instead. A little more color on this issue is
provided at the bottom of Table 1.

14
     In the case of net income (fraction of total assets), we exclude values greater than 20% in absolute value.

different regressands estimated with (1). The top cell shows negative interest rates have had

an economically small – but positive – and statistically insignificant effect on bank net income,

compared with low positive rates. The cells underneath reveal that while net interest income

has fallen significantly by around 5.4 basis points, this has been almost precisely compensated

by gains in net non-interest income of 5.2 basis points. These offsetting results suggest banks

are reluctant to charge their depositors negative rates, and are willing to endure losses from

interest income, while offsetting these losses with gains from non-interest income.

           These results are robust to a variety of perturbations to our methodology, as

summarized in Appendix Table A2. In particular, we drop banks included on the Basel

Committee’s list of Global Systematically Important Banks. 15 Next, we drop the world’s 100

largest banks, as compiled by Standard and Poors.16 Then we drop: a) the first (2010) and last

(2016) year of the sample, separately; and b) banks from Germany and Japan, the two biggest

countries in the sample. Next we: a) substitute country- for bank-specific fixed effects, b) drop

time fixed effects altogether; and c) substitute country-time fixed effects for time fixed effects.

A separate row uses four macroeconomic variables commonly used as determinants of Taylor

monetary rules (output growth, the output gap, CPI inflation, and the unemployment rate) as

instrumental variables for NEGI. The penultimate row adds the same four macroeconomic

variables to (1) as controls, while the final row adds in the Herfindahl index for gross loans

(specific to a country-year) and the slope of the yield curve as further controls. 17 In all cases,

the effect of negative nominal rates on net interest income remains negative and significant;

similarly, the effect on net non-interest income stays positive and is significant except for the IV

   Inflation is measured as annual percent change by the IMF. Sources for the activity measures are
unemployment from the IMF, output gap from the OECD, GDP from the IMF; Bloomberg provided end of year 10-
and 2-year sovereign bond yields, and the slope is the difference between the two. While these instruments are
unlikely to satisfy their exclusion restrictions (poor macroeconomic conditions are associated with both negative
rates and low profitability on bank lending), the direction of endogeneity should act against our headline result of
a surprisingly benign impact on bank profitability from negative rates.

estimator. The effects of negative rates on aggregate net income is small, positive and typically

insignificant, except for the unreliable estimator without time effects. 18

           While the left of Table 1 includes our entire sample of banks, columns to the right

disaggregate our sample by bank size and dependence on deposits. While, on average, banks

experience increases in net income when rates are negative, these are marginally significant

only for low-deposit banks. The reduction in interest income and offsetting rise in non-interest

income stems primarily from small and low-deposit banks; large and high-deposit banks seem

insignificantly affected by negative (as opposed to low positive) nominal interest rates.


           The two rows in the middle of Table 1 examine overall performance in terms of two

alternative measures of profitability. We examine both smoothed returns on assets (ROA,

defined as net income divided by average rather than year-end total assets), and smoothed

returns on equity (ROE, defined as net income divided by average common equity). The impact

of negative rates on ROA for all banks has a coefficient like that for net income, but is now

significantly positive, suggesting substantive noise in annual movements in total assets; the

same is true of large banks. Still, the ROA results indicate an even more positive picture of bank

fortunes under negative rates, especially for large banks. The effect of negative rates on ROE

are insignificant except for banks divided by depositor-dependence. LD banks experienced

marginally positive increases in total profitability, since they were able to increase non-interest

income more than their interest income fell. This shows up strikingly in the ROE results, which

are significant and large for LD banks, quite the opposite of HD banks. Our point estimates of



18
     We have also dropped subsidiaries and affiliates from our sample without substantively changing results.


                                                          16
these differences are substantial, with negative rates associated with a 71bp decline in

smoothed ROE for HD banks, and a 210 bp increase in smoothed ROE for LD banks.

       The three rows at the bottom of Table 1 are analogous to those at the top in that they

consider total net income and its two constituent parts, net interest and net non-interest

income. They differ from the top rows in being expressed as ratios to earning rather than total

assets. In practice, this makes little difference to our results.

       To summarize, the overall effect on bank profitability of moving from low positive

nominal interest rates into negative territory seems negligible. However, this masks two

underlying effects that offset each other; a decline in net interest income that is

counterbalanced by an improvement in bank non-interest income. Further, these results stem

from smaller banks and banks that depend comparatively less on deposits; large and high-

deposit banks are less affected.

       To shed further light on the matter, we now explore further by decomposing the

components of interest and non-interest income.



5. Decomposing Net Interest and Non-Interest Income


Interest Income and Expenses


       We begin by examining the components of net interest income further. Our results are

in Table 2. We first split net interest income into gross interest income and expenses. We then

further decompose gross interest income into interest income on loans and “other” interest




                                                  17
income, while splitting gross interest expense into spending on customer deposits and other

interest expenses. 19

removed (observations beyond 1/99 percentiles). Large banks have total assets >$10 billion dollars during sample; high-deposit
banks have exceeded .75 deposit/total funding ratio during sample.




         When we examine the full sample of banks at the left of the table, both gross interest

income and expense show economically significant and statistically significant declines, but the

decline in expenses is smaller than that of income, resulting in the decline in net interest

income reported in Table 1. The decline in gross interest income is largest for loan income,

though other interest income also falls and both declines are significant. The only part of gross


19
   Other interest income is defined as (gross interest and dividend income - interest income on loans), while other
interest expense is defined as (total interest expense - interest expenses on customer deposits). As always, all
components of Table 2 are normalized by total assets.

                                                             18
interest expenses to decline significantly is not attributable to customer deposits. This all

matches conventional wisdom: banks suffer interest income losses under negative rates on

loans and are unable or unwilling to pass these losses fully on to their depositors; hence, bank

net interest income declines with negative interest rates.


       The columns to the right of Table 2 show that large banks seem more nimble than

smaller banks. Large banks suffer smaller and statistically insignificant declines in gross interest

income and cut their expenses further, enabling them to avoid the losses on net interest

income experienced by small banks. LD banks suffer significantly greater losses in gross interest

income, especially income from loans. To help offset this decline in interest income, both LD

and HD banks lower their deposit expenses. However, LD banks lower other interest expenses

more since they are more reliant on other, market-based sources.


Non-Interest Income and Expenses


       Our key result is that improvements in bank net non-interest income offset, on average,

declines in net interest income. We analyze this further in Table 3, which is the analogue to

Table 2 but covers key components of the non-interest part of the income statement.


       Tabulated at the left of Table 3 are results for the entire sample of banks. The increase

in net non-interest income stems from an increase in gross income rather than a decline in

gross expenses; the latter are insignificantly different between negative and low positive

interest rates, though “other non-interest expenses” (such as depreciation and administrative

expenses), rise by a statistically significant amount. Still, the real action is on the income side,

stemming primarily from two sources, both statistically significant: a) an increase in net fees


                                                 19
and b) improvements in “other non-interest income.” 20 The latter includes “sustainable income

related to core business activities” after excluding net fees, insurance income, and the like, for

example, net capital gains and gains on securities are included in this category. 21

           A couple of previous studies, noted above, have found that net fees tend to increase

under unconventional monetary policies. The estimates in the second row of Table 3 verify


20
  The Fitch web site reports that fees “… are typically earned on commercial banking, investment banking,
custodial and trust activities.”

21
     In Appendix A3, we provide further analysis of these non-interest income categories.


                                                             20
these findings; the coefficients are similar across categories of banks and are typically

statistically significant. We find this reassuring, if not exactly novel.


        There are few substantive differences between large and small banks in the components

of non-interest income and expenses, though large banks experienced increases in non-interest

expenses much more than small banks; as with the entire sample, these are associated with

other non-interest expenses (likely depreciation and administrative expenses). However, there

are large differences between HD and LD banks. Of special interest are the differences

between HD and LD banks for the effect of negative interest rates on gross non-interest

income, which is an order of magnitude higher for LD banks than HD banks. Much of this stems

from “other non-interest income” and largely reflect gains on securities. These capital gains are

interesting for two reasons. First, they are not experienced by traditional HD banks to nearly

the same extent. Second, they may be associated with unanticipated movements into negative

rates, suggesting that a monetary shock pushing rates into negative territory might be

temporarily benign due to immediate capital gains on security holdings for LD banks. But if

these gains are transitory, remaining under negative rates may not (continue to) be painless.

The gains from selling securities that have appreciated as a result of lower policy rates can only

be booked as income once.


        To summarize: thus far, banks have largely been able to neutralize losses in interest

income stemming from the move to negative nominal interest rates via offsetting gains in non-

interest income. But it much of the latter arises from capital gains associated with the move

below zero; these are likely to be transient gains. Succinctly, the longer-term implications of

negative rates may differ from those we have observed so far, especially for HD banks.

6. Differences Across Monetary Regimes


       One of the strengths of our data set is that it includes countries with three different

types of monetary regimes. A large number of countries were members of the European

Economic and Monetary Union (EMU); indeed, three Baltic countries joined EMU during the

sample. EMU is the largest economy to have experienced negative rates. Japan and several

European countries maintained floating exchange rates (typically with inflation targeting)

during the sample; of these, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland (but not Czech Republic, Hungary

or the UK) experienced negative nominal interest rates. Finally, while Bulgaria and Denmark

maintained fixed Euro exchange rates (as did Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania prior to their EMU

entries), only Denmark experienced negative interest rates. In our analysis above, we have

implicitly exploited this panel variation across time and monetary regimes. In this section, we

explore it directly, asking how banks in different monetary regimes are affected by negative

nominal interest rates.

       We do this by estimating (1) for key measures of bank income statements variables but

restricting the sample to observations from a particular monetary regime. We focus on seven

different measures of bank performance, most importantly the three aggregate measures of

net income, net interest and net non-interest income. To provide a little more color into the

movement of these aggregates, we also look at four sub-components that provide particular

insights: gross interest income and income from loans, as well as gross non-interest income and

expenses.



                                                22
           For each of measure of bank performance, we provide results for seven monetary

regimes in Table 4. First, we tabulate results at the left for the two biggest countries in our

sample, Japan and Germany (the latter a critical part of EMU). In both cases, we are unable to

control for time fixed effects, since these would be collinear with the key variable of interest

(NEGI). 22 Excluding time effects means that all macroeconomic consequences for bank

performance from, e.g., monetary policy, are simply ignored. This is likely to give a distorted

impression, especially with respect to the precision of our estimates, so a strong note of caution

is appropriate. We provide these results for two reasons: a) to demonstrate the advantage of

using a cross-country panel; and b) as a comparison with the literature, which often uses banks

from a single monetary regime.

           We have more confidence in the results to the middle and right of Table 4, since these

columns all exploit cross-country panel data, enabling us to include time fixed effects. We

provide five different sets of results, for: a) countries with exchange rates pegged to the Euro

(Bulgaria, Denmark, and the three Baltics before they joined EMU); b) peggers plus Eurozone

banks; c) European countries that maintained flexible exchange rates vis-à-vis EMU (Czech

Republic, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, all of which target inflation); d) flexers plus

Eurozone banks; and e) all economies with flexible exchange rates (essentially d) with the

addition of Japanese banks).

           The most striking aspect of the results in Table 4 is the heterogeneity across monetary

regimes. Consistent with the headline results of Table 1, none of the five panel estimates in the




22
     The same issue would be present if we included banks from Eurozone countries other than Germany.

top row of Table 4 are significantly different from zero (two are negative, and three are

positive); that is, there is no substantive reliable effect of negative nominal interest rates on

bank profitability. This is in stark contrast to the unreliable national results tabulated at the

left, which indicate a significant decline in bank profits from negative nominal rates in both

Japan and Germany. This is the first indication that it is important to use a cross-country panel

approach to generate an estimate of the effect of negative nominal interest rates on bank

performance that is both reliable and general.

                                                              24
       More evidence of the importance of the panel approach is apparent elsewhere in Table

4. Where there is a significant effect of negative rates on net interest income it is always

negative; likewise, all significant coefficients for net non-interest income are positive. But the

magnitudes of such effects vary substantially across monetary regimes, and the effects of

negative nominal rates on sub-components of bank performance vary even more wildly. For

instance, the two panel estimates of gross interest (and loan) income effects for peggers are big

and positive, while the three for different sets of floating exchange rate countries are similar in

absolute value and negative. Similarly, the effects of negative nominal rates on gross interest

expenses differ substantively by monetary regime; they are large and positive for peggers, and

the opposite for floats. One can only discern the differences across monetary regimes by using

a panel which involves different countries.

       To summarize, our key result – negative nominal interest rates only have a small overall

effect on bank profitability, since losses in interest income are offset by gains in non-interest

income – stems from economies with floating exchange rates.



7. Bank Activity Under Negative Nominal Interest Rates

       In this section, we extend our analysis to bank lending and liquidity management under

negative nominal interest rates; our results are in Table 5.

       The most obvious effect of negative rates is probably that on loan activity, and indeed

the first row of Table 5 shows that total bank lending as a percentage of bank assets increases

by a full percentage point under negative rates. This is in line with earlier studies, such as

Demiralp et al. (2017). These increases are driven almost entirely by small banks and by HD


                                                 25
banks, whose loan share rises by over 1.6 percentage points. In contrast, LD banks display a

relatively large decline in lending of 2.3 percentage points. This shift away from lending

contributes to their larger decline in interest income and larger increases in non-interest

income (manifest in Table 3). 23

         We next examine changes in holdings of safe assets – namely, cash and central bank

reserves – under negative interest rates. Clearly, in a negative rate environment these assets



23
  Heider et al. (2016) found that HD banks decrease their lending. The difference is likely attributable to their
concentration on the syndicated lending market for corporations, whereas we examine total bank lending.


                                                              26
decline in value, and the banks in our sample unsurprisingly shift away from them in a

statistically meaningful way. Cash holdings at all banks declined by 2.5 percentage points and

by slightly higher amounts at large banks and HD banks. In contrast, while central bank

reserves fall by 2.4 percentage points for all banks, small and HD banks drive this decline.


        Changes in lending activity are likely to lead to changes in the credit risk profile of the

loan portfolio. Measuring the riskiness of loan portfolios is challenging since accrual (or

“banking book”) accounting rules provide a large degree of flexibility in recognizing when loans

default. We therefore examine in loan impairment charges and reserves for impaired and non-

performing loans, and observe two notable effects. Loan impairment charges, expressed as a

fraction of total assets, increase for all banks and for each sub-sample. Similarly, reserves set

aside to cover losses on impaired and non-performing loans (as a fraction of loans) also rose for

all bank categories, particularly LD banks. 24

        In addition to changes on the asset side of bank balance sheets, the negative interest

rate environment may also induce changes in bank liabilities (or funding). Deposit funding rose

for all banks by 2 percentage points; this finding is in line with other research – such as Kashyap

and Stein (2000) – that deposits increase under expansionary monetary policy. The increase is

greater for large banks, perhaps suggesting a preference among depositors for large banks that

enjoy more government support. Notably, LD banks did not experience a change in their

deposit-funding share, suggesting that they likely availed themselves of other lower cost


24
  A comprehensive interpretation of these results requires further information. While the negative rate
environment may have induced riskier lending requiring reserve increases, it is also possible that the reserve
increases were a delayed response to non-performing loans underwritten earlier; in this case, it would be
interpreted as risk-reducing. In addition, supervisory and regulatory changes in Europe during this period affected
reserving decisions.

                                                        27
funding sources. The leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of total bank debt to equity) increases

by 0.5 percentage points in the full sample; this increase is due to small and HD banks, as they

took in more deposits during the negative interest rate period.



8. Conclusion


       This paper investigates the behavior of banks experiencing negative nominal interest

rates, using a large recent cross-country data set of bank income statements. To our

knowledge, this is the first study that examines a wide variety of banks under negative rates for

different monetary regimes. We find little overall impact of negative nominal rates on bank

profitability, compared with low positive rates. However, different components of income

respond significantly; a decline in net interest income is largely offset by increases in non-

interest income stemming from, e.g., increased fees and “other income” such as capital gains

on securities. The richness of our panel allows us to condition for global shocks, and to dis-

aggregate banks by both size and dependence on deposit-funding. Our key results are driven

by countries with floating (but not fixed) exchange rates, and banks that are either small or

have low deposit-dependence (or both).


       Overall, our results suggest that banks fare relatively well under negative nominal

interest rates, compared to low positive rates. The considerable heterogeneity we find makes

us cautious to conclude that the financial channel of the monetary transmission mechanism

remains unchanged as policy rates cross zero. That is especially true since the positive returns

in “other non-interest income” enjoyed by banks under negative rates may well be

unsustainable if they are driven by the capital gains stemming from negative interest rate

                                                 28
surprises. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the standard monetary transmission

mechanism continues to work, at least for small and high-deposit banks, as the move into

negative policy rates induces these banks to increase lending activity.


       Despite much dire commentary from the industry, banks have thus far had a relatively

benign experience under negative nominal interest rates. We draw a few lessons. On the one

hand, our results alleviate an important concern felt by monetary policymakers considering

moving rates into negative territory. The cost of hitting zero is lower if policy rates can cross

into negative territory without substantive harm to the financial system. Since the income

effects for banks in countries with negative rates have been small and lending activity has

remained resilient, zero does not seem to be a serious lower bound for nominal interest rates.

The argument to raise the inflation target in hopes of avoiding the zero lower bound is

accordingly weakened. But we reiterate that there is no guarantee that the gains to non-

interest bank income are sustainable; this will only be revealed with time.

Appendix A3: Components of Non-Interest Income


       In the Fitch database, non-interest income is defined as the sum of six subcomponents:


   •   net fees and commissions that are typically earned on commercial banking, investment

       banking, custodial, and trust activities;

   •   net gains (or losses) on trading assets and derivatives activities;

   •   net gains (or losses) on assets booked at fair value through the income statement;

   •   net gains (or losses) on other securities revalued through the income statement;

   •   net insurance income; and

   •   the residual category of other operating income defined as other sustainable income

       related to core business activities that do not fall into any other category.


       Ideally, we would like to understand the behavior of each component, and be able to

compare its behavior under negative and low positive nominal interest rates, for different sets

of banks. Unfortunately, many of these observations are missing in the Fitch data set. We have

data for 98% and 82% respectively of all relevant observations for net fees and residual

operating income, which explains why we include the first and last variables in Table 3.

However, for the four remaining components of non-interest income, we have less than half of

all observations, often far less. Given the possibility of serious selection bias, we have

tabulated regression coefficients for these components in Appendix Table A3, along with the

percentage of observations available. These are analogous to those in Table 3, but for more

sparsely populated fields of non-interest income. Given the presence of so many missing




                                                   34
observations, we do not take these results seriously, and we urge the reader to approach them

with appropriate caution.

          The only consistently significant category is that of net gains on other revalued

securities. This is an opaque category, that includes returns on securities other than those

listed elsewhere by Fitch; this opacity obviates further analysis. Still, it points towards capital

gains/losses, consistent with the “other non-interest income” results reported in Table 3.
