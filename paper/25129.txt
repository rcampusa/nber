                                          ABSTRACT

Choices regarding the disposition of wealth at retirement can have substantial implications for
retirement income security. We analyze the factors determining annuity option choices offered
by a public sector defined pension plan with no default annuity option. Using combined
administrative records and survey data, we explore the role of individual and household
characteristics as well as risk preferences, time preferences, and financial literacy. The evidence
is consistent with predictions over which households might benefit most from each annuity
option. Comparing retirees who chose different annuities, we find that these groups of retirees
report very different levels of well-being in retirement.

                   Navigating Complex Financial Decisions at Retirement:
                  Evidence from Annuity Choices in Public Sector Pensions


   I.      Introduction

        At retirement, pension participants must decide the type of pension distribution that they

believe will maximize their utility over the rest of their lifetime. Private sector defined benefit

pension plans are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which

specifies how various distribution options are priced and requirements concerning the choice of

annuities. In general, public sector plans are not covered by ERISA, so government agencies

have greater flexibility in determining the provisions of their retirement plans. Moreover, state

and local government employees often retire in their 50’s because public sector defined benefit

plans typically allow career retirees to begin benefits at relatively young ages. Thus, state and

local employees must select the payout method that maximizes their well-being over 30 or more

years of retirement. In this environment, retirees face a complex decision in choosing the most

appropriate annuity option that will maximize their lifetime utility. Poor choices based on

insufficient information or knowledge may result in unanticipated outcomes and cause retirees to

express regret about their pension decisions later in retirement.

        This paper analyzes annuity choices by pension participants using administrative records

and survey data on North Carolina public sector retirees from 2009-2014. The estimation

follows a nested logit regression model, which allows a flexible correlation structure for the

unobserved factors affecting annuity choice. In a sample of married retirees, we find important

roles for gender, race/ethnicity, own and spouse’s life expectancy, and age and spouse’s relative

age in determining who elects each payout option. Prior research, focusing primarily on choices

by retirees in private sector plans, has explored the tendency of individuals to under-annuitize

                                                  1
wealth. 1 In sharp contrast to pension distributions chosen by private sector workers, retirees in

the public sector rarely select lump sum distributions because of the way they are typically

priced. Public sector retirees generally have the option of selecting from a menu of lifetime

annuities or a lump sum distribution. Under ERISA, private sector plans must have a default

annuity option of a joint and survivor benefit with at least 50 percent of the joint benefit payable

to the survivor and the pricing of annuity options must meet certain requirements. 2 In the public

sector, there is not typically a default annuity option and often annuity options are priced so that

they are present value neutral to the retirement system. Thus, it is important to understand why

retirees choose an annuity and how these decisions affect retirement well-being.

          This study uses the North Carolina Retirement Transitions Study-Benefit Claimants

(NCRTS-BC) data, which consists of administrative records merged with survey data for state

and local government retirees in North Carolina who initiated retirement benefits between 2009

and 2014. We focus on married retirees which allows us to study the role of spousal

characteristics in annuity choice. This is best suited for cases when a married individual’s

spouse would be their beneficiary had they chosen a J&S annuity option. While we cannot

directly test this assumption, we find evidence that is consistent with spouses as the vast majority

Reuter 2012; and Butler and Teppa 2007.
2
    The initial 1974 ERISA legislation required that pension plans offer at least a 50 percent J&S annuity
and that it be the default distribution option in the plan; however, retirees could simply request a single
life annuity when claiming benefits. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 required a spouse to sign a
notarized consent form waiving her right to the J&S before the retiree could receive a single life annuity.

of beneficiaries for married individuals. 3 For these married retirees, the spousal characteristics

are drawn from a retirement decision-making survey conducted in 2015 (one to six years after

the claiming decision for these retirees). Finally, we study retirement well-being, including

satisfaction with choices upon retirement and income security in retirement, which provides a

snapshot of perceived well-being several years into retirement. Combining administrative

records and responses to two surveys, our data provide a comprehensive picture of annuity

choice among public sector retirees in North Carolina.

      II.      Background on North Carolina Retirement Plans and Annuity Options

            We examine the provisions of public retirement systems of North Carolina and the

annuity choices of recent retirees. The retirement plan for teachers and state employees and the

state-managed pension plan for local employees in North Carolina are typical of state and local

pension plans across the country. Teachers and state employees in North Carolina are covered

by the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS), while local government

workers participate in the Local Governmental Employees’ Retirement System (LGERS).

Almost all participants in both plans are also covered by Social Security and TSERS pension

annuitants are also allowed to remain in the state health plan. 4

            The parameters of TSERS and LGERS are very similar. In order to qualify for normal or

unreduced benefits, the employee must have satisfied one of three criteria: reached age 65 with 5

years of membership service; reached age 60 with 25 years of service; or have attained 30 years

of service at any age. Early retirement with reduced benefits is available to those who have



3
    The initial survey asked respondents whom they chose as their beneficiary. Among married individuals
who indicated that they chose J&S, 93.3 percent reported that their spouse/partner was their beneficiary.
4
    See Clark and Cowell (2017) for a review of the annuity options of 85 large state-managed public plans.


                                                      3
reached age 50 and completed 20 years of creditable service and those who have reached age 60

and completed 5 years of service. Thus, for many public employees in North Carolina, these

plans provide a strong economic incentive to retire in their 50’s.

             Upon termination and achieving the age and service requirements, retirees must request

from the retirement system that their benefits begin and the annuity option they desire. This is a

one-time option and no benefits are paid until the benefit request has been finalized. In other

words, there is no default benefit. Both plans have the same six annuity options, which include a

single life annuity (called the maximum benefit), a 100 percent J&S, a 50 percent J&S, Social

Security Leveling, and two additional J&S options with a pop-up provision if the retiree’s

beneficiary dies first. Plan actuaries set the terms of all annuity options so that they are

considered present value neutral to the system. 5 There is also an option to take a lump sum

withdrawal, but most benefit claimants with long careers find that the present value of the

annuity greatly exceeds the lump sum (Clark et al. 2014).

      III.      Annuity Options in the North Carolina Retirement Plans

             We now present a more detailed discussion of the pricing of the annuity options. The

benefit formula in the plan indicates the monthly retirement benefit that a retiree would receive

from claiming until death. As discussed earlier, the retirement benefit is a function of years of




5
    In this context, present value neutral to the retirement system means that the discounted value of the
maximum benefit from retirement to death is expected to be equivalent to the discounted value of lifetime
benefits of all other options using the assumed rate of return to the plan’s assets. The discounted value is
calculated assuming no cost-of-living adjustments. Historically, cost-of-living adjustments have averaged
close to the annual increase in CPI; in recent years, there have been few increases in benefits.


                                                        4
service and final average salary. This is a single life annuity that is called the maximum benefit. 6

Once the conditions for unreduced retirement are satisfied, the monthly benefit does not depend

on age.

          To determine the monthly benefit for other annuity options, the first step is to calculate

the expected present value of the maximum benefit. First, define PV[A] to be the present value

of a $1 per year benefit payable in equal monthly payments for the life of an individual age A:

                                                𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏
                                                          𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂𝑨𝑨
                                  𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] =    �                              + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
                                                          (𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨
                                               𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏

where Survival is the probability of survival from age A to age a, ri is the assumed interest rate,

and CtsAdj is the industry-standard 11/24ths adjustment for monthly payment. Then the present

value of the monthly maximum benefit, BMAX, can be written as:

                                      𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 [𝐴𝐴] = 𝐵𝐵𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴]

            This calculation is based on the mortality experience of the system and the assumed rate

of return on the pension fund. Prior to 2012, the interest rate was 7.5 percent; however, the rate

was changed to 7.25 percent in 2012. Thus, for individuals with the same career history, the

present value of the maximum benefit decreases as age of claiming increases and there will be a

small increase in present values for those claiming benefits after 2012.

          Having calculated the present value of the maximum benefit, the retirement system then

calculates a monthly benefit the other five annuity options using the same basic assumptions.

Joint and Survivor Annuities




6
    If the worker dies before paid benefits exceed lifetime employee contributions plus interest, a lump sum
is paid to the designated survivor.

                                                             5
       The state provides four J&S options that provide for the continuation of benefits after the

death of the retired worker that are paid to the survivor until his or her death. The first option

offered by the North Carolina retirement plans is a 100 percent J&S benefit, which results in the

retirement benefit being the same as long as either the retiree or survivor is alive. For the present

value of this annuity to be the same as that of the maximum benefit, monthly benefits must be

lower. The price of this insurance for a lifetime benefit, or the magnitude of the reduction in

monthly benefits, depends on the age of the retiree and the age of the survivor. To calculate the

present value of the J&S benefit, first define the present value of a $1 per year benefit payable in

equal monthly payments if and only if both annuitants are living:

                                                     𝒂𝒂=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏
                                                                           𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂,𝒔𝒔
                                                                                           𝑨𝑨,𝑺𝑺
                       𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = �         �                                     � + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
                                                                            (𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑨𝑨
                                                 𝒂𝒂=𝑨𝑨+𝟏𝟏,𝒔𝒔=𝑺𝑺+𝟏𝟏


where Survival is the joint probability of the retiree surviving from age A to age a and the spouse

surviving from age S to age s. Then the present value of the monthly J&S benefit, BJ&S, is:

            𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆] = 𝐵𝐵𝐽𝐽&𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃&𝑆𝑆 ∗ (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝑆𝑆] − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽 [𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆])�

where PctJ&S is either 50 percent or 100 percent depending on the option chosen.

       To illustrate how the price varies across retirees, we present hypothetical monthly

benefits for several scenarios in Table 1. The mean married retiree in our sample claims benefits

at age 60 and the retiree’s spouse is on average one year older. Panel A shows the monthly

benefit for a 60 year old claimant whose maximum benefit is fixed at $2,000 per month. Panel A

assumes that the retiree’s spouse is 61 years old. For such a retiree, the 100 percent J&S benefit

is $1,813 per month, while the 50 percent J&S benefit is $1,902 per month. Since the benefit

after the death of the retiree is lower with the 50 percent J&S option, the benefit while the retiree

is alive is greater than the 100 percent J&S. The popup J&S options increase the benefits for the


                                                                   6
retiree if the beneficiary dies prior to the retiree. Relative to the standard J&S option without a

popup provision, the monthly benefit will be lower if the popup option is selected: $1,785 and

$1,887 per month for 100 percent popup and 50 percent popup J&S, respectively. Panels B and

C show the effect of own and spouse age on the 100 percent and 50 percent J&S benefit,

respectively. Moving right (up) in a given row (column) shows the benefit increase associated

with an older beneficiary (younger retiree).

                                                              [Table 1]

Social Security Leveling

          The final annuity option is called Social Security Leveling. Retirees selecting this option

receive a higher monthly benefit prior to age 62 when an individual is first eligible to claim

Social Security benefits and in return, the pension benefit is lower after age 62. The benefits

before and after age 62 are calculated by the system, using the same assumptions as described

before, so that the expected present value of the two Leveling benefits is the same as the present

value of the maximum benefit. 7 To calculate the present value of the Leveling benefit, first

define the present value of a $1 per year benefit payable in equal monthly payments that begin at

age C for a retiree currently age A:

                                           𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏
                                                     𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝒂𝒂𝐶𝐶                     𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑪𝑪𝑨𝑨
                   𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶] = �� �                             � + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶� ∗
                                                     (𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒊 )𝒂𝒂−𝑪𝑪                        (𝟏𝟏 + 𝒓𝒓𝑖𝑖 )𝑪𝑪−𝑨𝑨
                                          𝒂𝒂=𝑪𝑪+𝟏𝟏

Next define F[A,C] as follows:

                                      𝐹𝐹[𝐴𝐴, 𝐶𝐶] = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶]/𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴]




7
    One third of all state defined benefit plans whose participants are also covered by Social Security have a
Social Security leveling option. Most of these plans also use age 62 for leveling; however, some use 65
or allow the retiree to select the age for leveling (Clark et al. 2018).

                                                              7
Then the formula for the present value of the Leveling benefit is:

       𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 [𝐴𝐴] = 𝐵𝐵𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐹𝐹 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃[𝐴𝐴] − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗ 12 ∗ 𝑃𝑃𝑉𝑉[𝐴𝐴, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝐶𝐶]

where SS is the monthly benefit estimate obtained from the Social Security Administration.

         Returning to Table 1, the hypothetical retiree shown claimed benefits at age 60 and was

eligible for a maximum benefit of $2,000. The retiring worker reports to the retirement system

that her expected Social Security benefit at age 62 is $1,200. Using this information and the

leveling factor based on the system’s mortality experience and the assumed interest rate, the

system would calculate the benefit prior to age 62 and the benefit from age 62 through the rest of

the life of the retiree. In this example, the retiree would receive a monthly benefit of $2,996 each

month prior to age 62 and $1,796 each month beginning at age 62. Together with a Social

Security benefit of $1,200, the post-62 total retirement income is “level” at $2,996.

   IV.      Theoretical Predictions Regarding Saving and Borrowing in Retirement

         We offer several predictions for various individual and household characteristics that

may influence annuity choice. Individuals with higher personal discount rates place greater

value on money in the early retirement years. Thus, they are expected to favor a single life

annuity instead of a J&S annuity and among those requesting such a benefit, Social Security

Leveling should be more appealing than the maximum benefit. Given that the retiree prefers a

single life annuity, those with lower life expectancies will be more likely to choose leveling.

Between the single life annuity and J&S annuity, retirees will be more likely to choose a J&S

annuity if they have low life expectancy and are married to spouses with high life expectancy,

holding age constant. Since the retirement system prices the annuity options based on a blended

life expectancy between men and women, the leveling option is relatively more favorably priced

for men with average life expectancy than for women with average life expectancy.


                                                          8
       The work history of the spouse is expected to directly influence the annuity choice. If the

spouse has been a career worker and expects to receive a pension in his or her own right, the

retiree is predicted to be less likely to request a J&S benefit since the spouse expects to receive

this benefit after the death of the retiree. Other employer-provided benefits earned by the spouse

or the retiree or purchased by the household, such as retiree health insurance, long term care

insurance, or life insurance, should also should define the optimal annuity choice. Life insurance

could be considered a substitute for J&S benefits, i.e. similar to the lower benefit required by

J&S in that individuals pay a premium for life insurance to provide funds for the beneficiary.

The predicted effect for years of service on the annuity choice is ambiguous. On the one hand,

longer tenure is generally associated with higher pension benefits, which may reduce the demand

for higher income immediately after retirement. However, shorter tenure might be related to

retirement at younger ages with the intension to pursue a second career.

       As shown in Appendix Table B3, men are much more likely to choose a J&S annuity

compared to women (61 Percent compared to only 35 percent). We note that gender is highly

correlated with many of the other variables that affect annuity choice and as such, gender may

serve as a proxy for other characteristics. To the extent that the benefit level is correlated with

household finances, we expect that those with higher benefits are more likely to have alternative

sources of liquidity. Moreover, higher earners have a longer life expectancy, on average

(Galama et al. 2018). As such, they may be more willing to defer some of their pension income

by selecting one of the J&S options. Similarly, those without a college degree tend to have

lower life expectancies, so lower educated retirees may be more likely to choose leveling due to

shorter life expectancy. To the extent that race/ethnicity correlates with life expectancy, we

expect that non-Hispanic blacks are more likely to choose leveling than non-Hispanic whites.



                                                  9
        Holding constant mortality expectations, personal discount rate, and the absolute level of

benefits, we find no clear prediction on the relationship between age at claiming and annuity

option choice. Note that the age of the retiree and the spouse determines the reduction in

benefits associated with a J&S annuity. Next, while individuals in poor health may have lower

life expectancies, the prediction for the relationship between poor health and annuity choice is

ambiguous (McGarry, 2014). Individuals may require additional funds for medical expenditures

if they are in poor health or may want to consume more during a period of good health.

        Among those who prefer a single life annuity, risk aversion could manifest itself in a

preference for leveling if near-term consumption shocks are predominant in one’s decision

process. However, if mortality risk (i.e., dying young) is predominant, then one is likely to

prefer immediate consumption and therefore choose leveling. If instead an individual is worried

about longevity risk (i.e., outliving one’s savings), the individual is less likely to prefer leveling

so that the benefit in later years is higher. Thus, the prediction on risk preferences is ambiguous.

        It is important to remember that the annuity choice is a difficult and complex decision,

which will influence well-being throughout the retirement years. Knowledge concerning the

annuity choices, how the benefits are calculated, and how they may change over time and in

response to specific events are crucially important (Chan and Stevens, 2008). However, we have

no prediction on how financial literacy might affect which annuity options is chosen.

   V.      Regression Analysis of Annuity Choice

        We now examine the annuity choices of recent retirees in North Carolina using a

combination of administrative and survey data. The administrative records on individuals who

first claimed pension benefits between 2009 and 2014 are from the North Carolina Retirement

Transitions Study – Benefit Claimants (NCRTS-BC) data on retirees from the North Carolina



                                                  10
Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS) and Local Governmental

Employees’ Retirement System (LGERS). These data are merged with survey responses to a

survey conducted in spring 2015 and a follow-up survey conducted in spring 2017.

           The administrative records contain detailed information about each retiree including

earnings, job information, years of service, creditable service, year of retirement, annuity option

chosen, and benefit amount. The surveys gathered information about race/ethnicity, education

level, household income and wealth, work status after claiming retirement benefits, and marital

status, along with questions about their spouses’ characteristics (if applicable). In addition, the

surveys included questions on retiree well-being and satisfaction with retirement-related

decisions. 8 The first set of survey responses were received in 2015, which is one to six years

after the retiree had made their annuity choice. Thus, some answers (such as wealth and health)

may differ from those the individual might have given at the time of the retirement decision. 9

           Table 2 presents summary statistics from the administrative records (Column (1)), the

first survey respondents (Column (2)), and the first survey respondents who reported being

married or living with partner (Column (3), where we refer to both groups simply as married).

The survey was sent to 27,434 individuals from the population in Column (1). Our estimation

sample includes 5,515 useable responses, which represents a survey response rate of roughly 20

percent. 10 Comparing Columns (1) and (2), our survey sample is reasonably representative of

    Appendices B and C provide detail on the data and survey instrument.
9
    See Clark, Hammond, and Vanderweide (2018) for additional details on the pattern of annuity choice
over time. The proportion of retirees choosing J&S increases over time, with a small but noticeable jump
in 2012. This is consistent with the annuity pricing changes in 2012 discussed earlier.
10
     The survey is part of a larger project and covers all benefit claimants from 2009 to 2014. Our overall
response rate on the survey was 22 percent. For more detail on the larger project, please see our website:
https://sites.google.com/site/publicsectorretirement/.

the population of interest. Survey respondents have higher final average salary and maximum

initial benefit amounts, and they were more likely to have more than 30 years of service at

retirement.

                                                  [Table 2]

           From Column (2) to (3), we restrict the sample to survey respondents who are married.

Our focus is individuals who consider both a single life and J&S annuity; for married individuals

considering a J&S annuity, their spouse represents a focal beneficiary. While unmarried

individuals do choose J&S, their rates are much lower. 11 Further, the survey data provide

information on spousal characteristics for married individuals and this information allows us to

reconstruct the annuity benefit associated with each annuity option, assuming the spouse would

have been the beneficiary. Comparing Columns (2) and (3), the restriction to married

respondents changes the sample in relatively minor ways. There are a larger proportion of males

in Column (3) and, consistent with the arguments above, a larger proportion of men choose J&S.

           The first column in Table 3 reproduces the last column of Table 2, while Columns (2)-(4)

of Table 3 split the married respondent sample among the three annuity options. For all married

survey respondents in Column (1), the average retiree is around 60 years of age upon retirement.

Around 48 percent of all retirees are teachers, 19 percent are local government employees, and

18 percent are state government employees. In general, the public sector tends to be majority

female and the North Carolina data are consistent with this observation, as 66.8 percent of the

married respondents are women. 40.2 percent of married respondents retired with 30 or more

years of service, while the average final salary is $62,754.32 and the initial benefit check had the

retiree chosen the Maximum Benefit annuity option is $2,433.50 on average.


11
     5.8 percent of unmarried individuals in our sample chose one of the J&S annuity options.

                                                      12
                                                    [Table 3]

           Comparing Columns (2)-(4), the characteristics of those choosing the three annuity

options are quite different along several dimensions. Those choosing leveling tended to be

younger at retirement (which is intuitive because leveling is only possible for those retiring under

62), had lower salaries, and had more years of service. Those choosing J&S tended to have

higher salaries and were eligible for more from the retirement system in the form of higher

benefits had they chosen the maximum benefit. A meaningfully higher proportion of men chose

a J&S annuity relative to women. These are univariate differences along correlated dimensions,

so now we conduct a regression analysis to explore ceteris paribus associations.

           Our main regression analysis is estimated using data from married respondents to the first

survey, as shown in Column (1), Table 3. As mentioned above, we include individuals who

reported that they are married or living with partner and simply say married. The survey of

retirees provides us with the opportunity to examine the annuity choice process utilizing personal

information that is not available in the administrative records. Tables 4 and 5 present regression

estimates from a nested logit regression model (McFadden, 1981). 12 A nested logit model is a

generalized multinomial logit model with less restrictive assumptions regarding the

independence of the error terms affecting choice among each annuity option. Choice is nested

and the error terms for options in the same nest can be correlated. In our setting, there are two

nests: the single life nest includes the Maximum Benefit and Social Security Leveling, while the

J&S nest includes the four J&S options (two 100 percent and two 50 percent J&S options).




12
     In addition to the covariates shown in the table, the regression also includes an indicator for having
multiple benefit accounts and controls for five agency categories and for the year of benefit claiming.

                                                        13
          Our nested logit regression analysis in Table 4 shows estimates at the “top level” of the

nesting structure, thus the coefficients reflect the effects of observable characteristics on the

choice of J&S, with single life as the baseline. An alternative is a multinomial logit regression

model; we show nested logit results because specification tests favor our nested logit regression

model over this alternative. 13 Clark et al. (2018) provide an analysis of the choice of leveling,

among individuals who chose a single life annuity. Table 4 displays regression results and

marginal effects. Column (1) includes the baseline covariates, while Column (2) adds spousal

characteristics. The results are similar in both columns, so we focus on Column (2).

                                                  [Table 4]

          The first covariate is the only alternative-specific covariate in the model (i.e., varies

across individuals and annuity options), which ensures identification of the nested logit model.

In our setting, this is the annuity factor, defined as the ratio of the net present value of the

annuity option relative to the net present value of the maximum benefit. 14 The factor coefficient

is not our focus, and its positive coefficient simply says that a higher present value is preferred.

We simply control for the annuity factor to ask how observable characteristics affect annuity

choice.

          Men are more likely to choose J&S, with a large effect size of 14.3 percentage points.

This is consistent with the fact that men have shorter life expectancies, on average, which

implies that the survivor benefit is valued more by men than women. We explore gender more in

the next table. Non-Hispanic black retirees choose J&S at a 10.4 percentage point lower rate.




13
     Results from multinomial logit regression models are presented in Appendix Table B4.
14
     The present value calculation uses survival probabilities from the retirement system and discount
factors equal to the 20-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate at the beginning of the claiming year.

                                                      14
Later age at claiming lowers the propensity to choose J&S, an effect of around 0.5 percentage

point for five years older at claiming. We account for spousal age by constructing two age

difference variables, the number of years the retiree is older if the difference is positive and

separately the number of years younger if negative. Larger age gaps among spouses are

associated with less choice of J&S, with 1.5 percentage points per year of difference if positive

and 0.6 percentage points per year of difference if negative. The negative effect of age

difference for retirees who are younger than their spouse might reflect the fact that the survivor

benefit is less valuable to a retiree who is much younger. As shown in Table 1, younger spouses

are associated with a lower J&S benefit, relative to maximum benefit, which probably explains

the effect of positive age difference.

       Next, reporting being in good health is associated with a 10.3 percentage point lower rate

of choosing J&S; reported spousal good health also lowers J&S choice, but neither the level

effect nor the interaction with spousal health is statistically significant. A retiree’s perception of

their life expectancy and his or her perception of their spouse’s life expectancy both have the

expected effect (while the interaction is not significant). Expecting a long life is associated with

6.7 percentage point lower rate of J&S choice, while expecting one’s spouse to live a long life is

associated with 8.7 percentage point higher rate of J&S choice. The survey also asked retirees

whether they and/or their spouse had life insurance (LI) and long-term care insurance (LTCI) as

well as whether their spouse had access to a pension from their current or previous employer

(either currently receiving pension benefits or eligible to receive in the future).

       While life insurance is not associated with J&S annuity choice, having purchased long-

term care insurance has a strong effect. Retirees with long-term care insurance are 7.0

percentage points less likely to have chosen J&S, which suggests that these two products are



                                                  15
substitutes. There is an effect of spousal long-term care insurance, but it interacts with the

covariate for both retiree and spouse having long-term care insurance. Spousal pension also

affects J&S choice: retirees whose spouse has their own pension are 2.6 percentage points less

likely to choose J&S. Years of service has a monotonic effect, such that those retiring with less

service are less likely to choose J&S. Each $1,000 additional in a retiree’s initial benefit amount

is associated with 5.4 percentage points higher rate of J&S choice.

          Finally, the measures of financial literacy and preferences toward risk and time are

elicited from the survey. 15 High levels of objective financial literacy (as measured by answering

both questions correctly) are associated with a choice of J&S at a rate that is 5.4 percentage

points higher relative to a single life annuity. Time preferences affect J&S annuity choice as

expected. Those who are measured as impatient on the lottery frame only and on lottery and

benefit frames have 3.4 and 3.7 percentage points lower rates of J&S choice respectively. Risk

preferences reveal one statistically significant association, where those who are measured as

being risk averse on the pension frame chose J&S at a rate that is 12.7 percentage points lower.

However, the risk results on the lottery prize frame and from retirees who answered consistently

across both frames are opposite signed relative to the pension results. This suggests that the

framing of our pension question, rather than risk preferences per se, may be at work here.

          Next, we explicitly examine gender by presenting results for men and women separately.

Table 5 estimates the baseline specification of Table 4 separately by gender. The results in Table

5 are similar to the aggregate results. Several coefficients are more precisely estimated for




15
     The wording of these questions is included in Appendix C. We have two questions respectively for
eliciting risk and time preferences: one question asks respondents to choose between pension benefits and
one asks respondents to choose between lottery prizes.

                                                    16
women, which may be driven by our larger female sample; notably, the negative effect of long

life expectancy is driven entirely by women. Our main goal in separate gender estimation is to

decompose the difference in J&S choice into observable differences among men and women.

                                                  [Table 5]

          In our sample of married public sector workers, 61.3 percent of men and 34.7 percent of

women choose a J&S annuity, a 26.6 percentage point difference. (See Appendix Table B3.) Is

this difference explained by observable characteristics that differ by gender? From Table 4, the

predicted probability of choosing J&S (holding all covariates at their sample means) is 53.6

percent for men and 39.0 percent for women, a 14.5 percentage point difference. If the women

in our sample had observable characteristics that took the same values as our men, then the

predicted probability of choosing J&S would be 41.4 percent for women. Relative to the

predicted probability reported above of 53.6 percent for men, the difference is 12.2 percentage

points. In total, we can explain more than half of the gender difference in J&S choice by

observable characteristics. The remaining gender difference represents the residual gender

effect.

          We place our public sector workers in context using private sector workers in the Health

and Retirement Study (HRS) 2014 wave. Note that the sample of public sector workers in the

HRS is very small, which emphasizes the importance of new data such as ours for this segment

of the workforce. Restricting to married private sector workers in the HRS, 75.8 percent of men

and 49.4 percent of women choose a J&S annuity. 16 Thus, both males and females in our sample



16
     Johnson et al. (2005) examine earlier HRS waves and also report substantial gender differences in the
choice of J&S. They find that 72 percent of men and 31 percent of women choose J&S. The lower rate
they find for women may be driven by their earlier data or by our sample restrictions.


                                                      17
choose J&S annuities at rates that are more than 10 percentage points lower than private sector

workers in the HRS. 17 Overall, 43.6 percent of our sample chooses a J&S annuity, while 66.9

percent of married private sector workers in the HRS choose J&S, where the overall gap between

J&S choice in our sample and J&S choice in the HRS is wider due to the larger proportion of

women among our public sector workers.

            In total, we find that retirees choose among annuity options in ways that are consistent

with predictions over which individuals might benefit from each annuity option. J&S is more

likely to be chosen by individuals for whom survivor motives are more salient (e.g., those with

lower life expectancies such as males, those with low subjective life expectancy, and those

whose spouse does not have alternative sources of retirement incomes such as a pension or long-

term care insurance). Leveling is more likely to be chosen by individuals whose near-term

retirement income needs are more salient (e.g., those with low subjective life expectancy and

those whose time preferences are consistent with impatience). To study retirement outcomes for

individuals who chose different annuities, we now analyze self-reported retirement well-being.

      VI.      Well-being in Retirement

            Is the choice of annuity an important determinant of well-being in retirement? Our

surveys of retirees provide information on several measures of well-being in retirement, which

we group into two sets of measures. The information measures are retirees’ satisfaction with

their retirement choices and the information available upon annuity choice. The income security

measures are retirees’ satisfaction with their standard of living, belief that they saved enough,



17
     Myers et al. (1987) and Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) study J&S choice in the pre-ERISA years. They
find that J&S choice rates were lower before the ERISA default of a 50 percent J&S annuity. Holden and
Nicholson (1998) and Aura (2005) study the post-ERISA period and find higher rates of J&S choice.


                                                    18
and confidence in not outliving their savings. Each measure takes a positive value when the

individual “agrees” or “strongly agrees” with the statements. 18

          Table 6 presents means along each dimension of information and income security, shown

separately using responses to the first survey in 2015 and from the follow-up survey in 2017

(S2015 and S2017, respectively). The sample in this, and the subsequent tables, is married

individuals who claimed benefits between 2009 and 2014 who responded to both surveys. 19

First, we focus on the initial responses in 2015 and then turn to the follow-up responses in 2017.

Among all married individuals in the first survey, we observe high rates of agreement with

having made the best decisions regarding annuity choice and having had enough information

upon retirement (both rates are over 90 percent). For income security, 82.6 percent of

respondents are satisfied with their standard of living in retirement, while only 62.3 percent of

respondents believe they saved enough and 69.5 percent are confident in not outliving their

savings. Overall, we interpret these figures as being consistent with high rates of well-being in

retirement but with magnitudes that vary with the framing of the question.

                                                  [Table 6]

          Individuals report lower levels of satisfaction with information and income security, on

average, two years after the original survey. Table 7 presents additional information on changes

between the two surveys, but it is clear that the means are lower in 2017 along every dimension.

Comparing responses across individuals who chose different annuity options, J&S annuitants are



18
     The wording of these questions is included in Appendix C. Results are similar using only “strongly
agree” as the well-being measure.
19
     Appendix Table B5 presents a comparison between the estimation sample in Tables 6-8 (those who
responded to both the initial and the follow-up surveys) and estimation sample in Tables 4-5 (those who
responded to the initial survey).

                                                     19
similar to maximum benefit annuitants with the exception of satisfaction with annuity choice,

where J&S is associated with 2.9 percentage points higher satisfaction. Relative to J&S or

maximum benefit, leveling is associated with less satisfaction in terms of information and

income security. Those who chose leveling are particularly unlikely to report belief in having

saved enough and unlikely to report having confidence in not outliving their savings.

       Table 7 reports the proportion of individuals who increased or decreased along each

dimension from the original survey to the follow-up survey. The statistical test results shown in

Panel A are from tests of whether changes are equally likely to be increases and decreases. For

each cell, decreases are statistically significantly more likely than increases. Thus, perceived

retirement well-being decreases for these individuals. Panel B compares measures across

annuity options, where the statistical test results are from tests of whether the proportion of

individuals reporting less satisfaction is different across annuity options.

                                              [Table 7]

       Relative to maximum benefit, individuals who chose J&S are similar with the exception

of belief in having saved enough, where J&S is associated with a larger decrease in satisfaction

(5.0 percentage points). Relative to maximum benefit, for individuals who chose leveling, the

decrease between the two surveys is statistically significantly larger for leveling in terms of

having made the best annuity choice decision, satisfaction with standard of living, and

confidence in not outliving their savings. Overall, we find small differences among maximum

and J&S annuitants, but large differences between leveling annuitants and others. Those

choosing leveling are less satisfied and more likely to report lower satisfaction over time. This




                                                 20
result should not be surprising since many of those that selected leveling will have reached age

62 and would have had their pension benefit reduced by the specified formula. 20

          Finally, Table 8 presents a regression analysis of these five measures using the responses

to the follow-up survey in 2017, which is three to eight years after the claiming decision for these

retirees. Using the follow-up survey responses allows us to measure retirement well-being

several years into retirement. Each column presents the results from a linear probability model.

J&S is similar to maximum benefit on some measures, but J&S is associated with less

satisfaction with their standard of living in retirement (6.7 percentage points) and less belief in

having saved enough (6.8 percentage points). Consistent with the comparison of means, leveling

is generally associated with less satisfaction than maximum benefit: 4.8 percentage points less

satisfied with annuity choice decision, 12.6 percentage points less satisfied with having saved

enough, and 12.6 percentage points less confident about not outliving their savings. In total,

leveling is associated with less perceived well-being in retirement, with large effect sizes.

                                                      [Table 8]

          The other covariates in Table 8 provide additional insights regarding the characteristics

associated with well-being in retirement. Males are much more confident in not outliving their

savings than females, but they do not believe they saved enough at higher rates and are not more

satisfied with their standard of retirement living. Non-Hispanic black retirees report less

satisfaction along all dimensions, with large effect sizes. Individuals with at least a BA degree

report more satisfaction, as do those who claimed at older ages. Interestingly, those with higher


20
     The retirement system reports that they receive calls from many retirees who selected leveling who
seem surprised that their monthly pension benefit has been reduced. Perhaps due to this reaction, a bill
was introduced in the 2018 legislative session to eliminate this option (HB 1055). The bill has not
become law during the 2018 session of the North Carolina General Assembly.

                                                      21
initial benefit checks report more satisfaction with their well-being in terms of income security,

but they are no more likely to report satisfaction in terms of information/decision quality.

       The results in Table 8 do not provide causal interpretations because these covariates are

correlated with a host of unobserved factors that limit precise interpretations. However,

controlling for these observed factors, we find that individuals who chose different annuities

upon retirement report different levels of satisfaction in retirement. J&S annuitants are

somewhat less satisfied than maximum benefit annuitants in terms of income security (standard

of living and saved enough). Leveling annuitants are less satisfied than maximum benefit

annuitants in all five measures, with statistically significant differences for three measures.

   VII.    Conclusions

   Using combined administrative records and survey data, we analyze how individuals choose

among annuity options at retirement. Several findings are particularly relevant to policymakers.

First, only 44 percent of North Carolina public sector retirees select a J&S annuity. This is much

lower than the rate of 67 percent that we document among private sector workers in the Health

and Retirement Study (HRS). Some portion of the difference between our finding and those

from the HRS may be due to differences among the private sector workers in the HRS and our

public sector workers. However, we conjecture that there is an important role played by ERISA

regulations for a J&S default annuity, which does not cover the plans we study.

   Second, as has been found previously, males are much more likely than females to choose a

J&S annuity. Our regression analysis controls for a large set of individual and household

characteristics and holding these constant, the results suggest that men value survivor benefits

more than women. Men are also more likely to choose J&S when their spouse does not have

access to a pension of their own, while a spouse’s pension plays a less important role for women


                                                 22
in the choice of annuity. We decompose the gap between men and women in the choice of a

J&S annuity; observable characteristics explain more than half of the gender difference, but a

sizeable gap remains. Annuity choice appears to be a household decision that involves

bargaining between household members in ways that are consistent with predictions over which

households might benefit most from each annuity option.

   Our final analysis exploits the panel nature of our survey data to track self-reported well-

being several years into retirement. Retirees who made different annuity choices report very

different levels of well-being in retirement and changes in well-being also differ markedly. The

Social Security Leveling annuity option (which provides a level retirement income before and

after age 62) is associated with substantially less retirement income security, relative to the

Maximum Benefit or a J&S annuity. J&S annuitants are relatively similar in their self-reported

well-being with respect to those who chose the Maximum Benefit, but there is some evidence

that the Maximum Benefit is associated with slightly higher levels of retirement income security.

In total, the annuity an individual chooses matters a lot for their outcomes in retirement.

Appendix A: Sample construction and restrictions
1. Administrative Records
          The retirement system maintains records for several retirement plans including
firefighters, judicial classes, and the legislature. We construct our data using administrative
records on active retirement benefit accounts that were initiated between January 1, 2009 and
December 31, 2014. We only consider retirement accounts from the TSERS or LGERS
retirement systems. We exclude any accounts that are suspended. We do not include ancillary
accounts from other systems but do retain an indicator if the individual has other benefit
accounts, which might include the transfer benefit option or another retirement system such as
the legislature or firefighters. 21 We also exclude any accounts that were closed for any reason,
including disability, withdrawal, or transfer of benefits. We exclude firefighters and law
enforcement officers that are within TSERS and LGERS, since the eligibility rules are different
for those plans.
          We confirm that the remaining 80,241 benefit records are unique accounts – individuals
may only receive one benefit from TSERS and one benefit from LGERS. We make further
exclusions as listed in Appendix Table B1 below. These include: recorded years of service is
less than 5 years, termination of employment before 2008, days between termination and
claiming greater than one year, and missing gender code. We end up with 72,350 unique benefit
accounts representing 72,254 individuals with one account and 96 individuals with both a
TSERS and LGERS account.
          We sent a survey to 27,434 of the eligible benefit claimants. Our final sample for
analysis includes 5,515 respondents for a response rate of 20%.
          Appendix Table B2 presents a comparison between our sample and data from the
American Community Survey (ACS). For the ACS data, we used the 2012-2016 5-year Public
Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). We include individuals aged 50 or older. We consider those


21
     While we focus solely on those accounts in TSERS and LGERS, individuals may also have accounts
with these other systems. Where relevant, we include an indicator variable for the individual having an
additional membership in another retirement plan. About 1 percent of our sample has both an active
TSERS and LGERS retirement benefit. For those individuals we keep both records and treat them as
separate observations but retain an indicator variable.


                                             Appendix Page 1
who were state or local government employees and worked full time (14+ weeks and 30+ hours
per week worked). The sample is then restricted to those that did not work last week, that last
worked within the past 12 months, and that are currently either unemployed or not in the labor
force. This approximates recent retirees. Our ACS data will exclude individuals that claimed
benefits from a public sector retirement system but immediately took another job.


2. Key Policy Details
Here we outline some key policies that were in place during the 2009-2014 time period.


Return to work:
Our data will include some individuals that have “retired” but are still working within the system
according to the rules below.
       o       Pension benefits can be received while working at any other job not covered by
               that pension. This includes a TSERS employee working under LGERS and vice
               versa.
       o       Pension benefits can be received while working for a job at the prior employer as
               long as the position is not eligible for pension benefits (typically a part-time
               position).
       o       Pension benefits will be suspended if an individual works in a job that is covered
               by the same pension. After 3 years of service, the earned benefits can be
               combined into one account. If 3 years of service are not reached, the new account
               is not eligible for pension benefits and must be withdrawn as a lump sum.


Multiple benefit accounts:
We retain individuals that have multiple benefit accounts and include TSERS and LGERS
accounts separately in the data. The rules on maintaining multiple benefit accounts are below.
       o       Each retirement benefit account can be paid separately and there are no
               restrictions on coordinating annuity type or timing. Individuals with multiple
               accounts have the option to consolidate them by transferring service from one
               account to another. The average final compensation (AFC) used is that from the
               receiving account, while the years of service is the sum of all accounts. We

                                         Appendix Page 2
               cannot track in the data whether the benefit account is the sum of multiple
               benefits earned under different retirement systems.
       o       An individual may have multiple membership accounts due to:
                        Long break in work
                        Return to work
                        Work with a different retirement system (first TSERS, then LGERS etc.)
Years of Service:
In our data, we only observe creditable service, which is a combination of tenure and optional
purchased service.
       o       Creditable service: service calculation used for determining benefit level
                        Membership service
                        Purchased service: withdrawn service, military service, out-of-state,
                         temporary, educational leave, workers’ compensation, community service,
                         parental leave, extended illness leave, etc. Also, unused sick leave and
                         vacation time.
       o       Contributory service: service calculation used for determining eligibility
Using date of hire and date of termination, which are measured with some error, we estimate that
most individuals have about 6-8 months of purchased service on top of membership service.

unemployed or not in the labor force. Data from our survey include married individuals that claimed
retirement benefits in North Carolina. Survey respondents are disproportionally higher educated than the
population average.

Appendix C: Definition of Key Survey Variables
Risk and Time Preferences
Impatient: Lottery Frame
Suppose that you won a prize that is worth $1000 if you take it today. Alternatively, you could
wait one year to claim the prize and be guaranteed to receive $1200. Would you claim the $1000
dollars today, or would you wait one year for the $1200?

           � Claim $1000 today

           � Wait one year and claim $1200

           � Not sure
Impatient: Benefit Frame
Imagine you are 65 years old, and you (and your spouse/partner) are receiving $1000 per month
in Social Security benefits. Suppose you were given the choice to reduce that benefit by half, to
$500 per month. This one-half benefit reduction would continue for as long as you (and your
spouse/partner) live. In return, you would be given a one-time, lump-sum payment of $80,500.
Would you take the $1000 monthly benefit for life, or the reduced monthly benefit combined
with the lump sum payment?

           � Take the $1000 monthly benefit

           � Take the reduced benefit and the lump sum

           � Not sure
Risk Adverse: Pension Frame
Suppose that you are about to retire and have two choices for your pension benefit. Pension A
gives you an income equal to your pre-retirement income. Pension B has a 50% chance of
providing a benefit worth double your pre-retirement income and a 50% chance of providing a
benefit worth 20% less than your pre-retirement income. Which pension benefit would you
choose?

           � Pension A

           � Pension B

           � Not sure




                                       Appendix Page 10
Risk Adverse: Prize Frame
Suppose that you are offered a choice between two prizes. If you choose Prize A, you are
guaranteed to receive $1000. Alternatively, if you choose prize B, you will have a 50-50 chance
of receiving $2200 and a 50-50 chance of receiving $0. Which prize would you choose -- Prize
A or Prize B?

           � Prize A

           � Prize B

           � Not sure


Financial Knowledge
Financial Knowledge: Compounding

If you have $100 in your savings account, and the annual interest rate is 2%, how much money will
you have in your account after five years?

     � More than $102             � $102                � Less than $102          � Do not Know


Financial Knowledge: Inflation
If the current interest rate on your savings account is 1% per year, and the inflation rate is 2% per
year, how much do you think you will be able to buy with your money a year from now?
           �   A larger amount than you can buy now
           �   Exactly the same amount as you can buy now
           �   A smaller amount than you can buy now
           �   Do not know

Self-Reported Financial Knowledge:
On a scale from 1 to 7 (where 1 means very low, and 7 means very high), how would you rate your
financial knowledge?




                                         Appendix Page 11
Well-Being Outcomes:
The five retiree well-being outcomes in Table 6-8 of the text are derived from the following
questions. The outcome is binary with a 1 for “agree” or “strongly agree” and 0 otherwise.
Results are similar when the outcome is alternatively “strongly agree” only.
Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statements regarding your
retirement [Strong Disagree; Disagree; Neither Agree nor Disagree; Agree; Strongly
Agree; Not Applicable/ Don’t know]:
“Best decisions”: I made the best possible decisions concerning the payment option for my
TSERS/LGERS pension benefit.
“Enough info”: I had enough information to make the best possible decisions regarding my
retirement.
“Satisfied”: I am satisfied with the standard of living I have had since I first started receiving a
pension check.
“Saved enough”: I saved enough for retirement while working.
“Confident”: I am confident that I will not outlive my savings.
