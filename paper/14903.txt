                                             ABSTRACT

Mutual funds change their risk levels significantly over time. This paper investigates the performance
consequences of risk shifting, as well as the economic motivations and the mechanisms of risk shifting.
Using a holdings-based measure of risk shifting, we find that funds that increase risk perform worse
than funds that keep stable risk levels over time. In addition, funds that expect higher benefits from
risk shifting are more likely to increase risk and perform particularly poorly after increasing risk. Our
results are consistent with the notion that agency problems, rather than the ability to take advantage
of changing investment opportunities, are the likely motivation behind risk shifting behavior.

1     Introduction

Mutual funds change their total risk exposure substantially over time. Using the disclosed

holdings of a sample of 2,335 U.S. equity funds over the period between 1980 and 2006, we

document that 27.1% of equity mutual funds change their annualized volatility by more than

2.5% in a given quarter, and 9.6% of funds change their volatility by more than 5%. These

changes are significant given that their average long-term volatility level is only 17.9%. Our

paper studies whether funds that shift risk exhibit different subsequent performance compared
to funds with more consistent risk levels. We further investigate the economic motivations

behind risk shifting and the mechanisms through which risk shifters add or destroy value.

    Mutual funds change their risk levels for two potential reasons, which have different perfor-

mance consequences. First, the literature on delegated portfolio management has identified

a potential agency conflict between mutual fund companies and their investors. Whereas

fund investors would like their mutual funds to maximize risk-adjusted returns, mutual fund
companies would like to maximize their profits. Since their profits depend primarily on the
amount of assets under management, mutual funds might have incentives to follow investment

policies that generate money inflows even if these policies reduce the risk-adjusted returns to
their investors. For example, Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996) and Chevalier and Ellison

(1997) suggest that mutual fund companies strategically change their risk levels to attract
additional fund inflows due to the convex flow-performance relation.1 If agency problems are
the main cause behind risk shifting, then we should not expect superior performance for risk

shifting funds. To the extent that opportunistic risk shifting causes trading costs, constrains
the investment opportunity sets, and distracts fund managers from their goal of investing in

the most promising securities, we should expect risk shifters to perform worse.

    The second reason funds change their risk levels is that fund managers might actively adjust
the composition of their portfolios to capitalize on time-varying investment opportunities. If

and Zheng (2004), Huang, Wei, and Yan (2007), and Ivkovich and Weisbenner (2009).


                                                     1
funds that actively shift risk have superior investment abilities, then they should perform

better than funds that have more stable risk exposures. If, on the other hand, funds with
inferior investment abilities are more prone to shift risk (because, for example, they erroneously

believe that they have timing ability or lack the confidence to maintain a stable trading
strategy), then funds that shift risk should perform worse.

   To measure risk shifting of mutual funds, we propose a holdings-based measure that is

defined as the difference between a fund’s current holdings volatility and its past realized
volatility. The current holdings volatility is the standard deviation of the most recently dis-

closed fund holdings, and the past realized volatility is the standard deviation of the fund’s
actual return. A fund has a positive risk shifting measure if the most recently disclosed

holdings are riskier than the actual fund holdings.

   We sort mutual funds into portfolios according to their most recent risk shifting measure
and compare their subsequent performance. We find that funds that increase risk the most

perform significantly worse (with an annualized abnormal return of -2.6% using the Carhart
model) than funds that maintain stable risk levels (with an abnormal return of -0.7%). These
results are robust using alternative performance measures. The poor performance of risk

shifters suggests that they are unlikely to possess superior ability. Instead, risk shifting be-
havior is either an indication of inferior ability or is motivated by agency problems in delegated

portfolio management.

   To investigate the potential role of agency problems in risk shifting behavior, we ask
whether the propensity to shift risk and the performance consequences of risk shifting differ

across funds with different benefits of risk shifting. The expected profit of a mutual fund

increases with both the expense ratio and the assets under management. Thus, funds with
higher expense ratios have more to gain from shifting risk. In addition, the literature has

identified younger, smaller funds, and funds that belong to smaller fund families as having
a more sensitive flow-performance relation. Hence, these funds also enjoy larger expected

benefits of risk shifting. Based on these characteristics, we separate funds into subgroups and


                                                2
find that funds with larger benefits of risk shifting are more likely to shift risk and perform

particularly poorly after shifting risk. For example, 14.7% of funds with above-median expense
ratios increase their volatility by more than 2.5% and experience a Carhart alpha of -2.9% per

year, whereas only 10.5% of funds with below-median expense ratios increase their volatility
by the same amount and experience a Carhart alpha of -1.2%. Similarly, younger, smaller

funds and funds that belong to smaller fund families are more likely to shift risk and experience

more severe performance consequences when they shift risk.
   To understand the sources of the poor performance of risk shifters, we study the various

mechanisms through which funds can change risk: First, funds can shift risk by changing the
composition between equity holdings and cash holdings. Second, within their equity holdings,

funds can shift risk by changing their exposure to systematic risk (e.g., by switching between

low beta stocks and high beta stocks). Third, funds can shift risk by changing their exposure
to idiosyncratic risk (e.g., by concentrating the holdings on a few positions or industries).

We find evidence that all of these mechanisms are important in explaining the risk shifting
behavior of mutual funds. In contrast, the performance consequences are significant mainly for
funds increasing idiosyncratic risk exposure, whereas both the reduction in cash holdings and

the increase in systematic risk lead to only mild reductions in fund performance. Thus, the
poor performance of risk shifters is driven not by the unsuccessful attempts of fund managers

to time the aggregate market but by their desire to take on idiosyncratic risks. We also

sort funds into subgroups with different turnover to study the impact of transaction costs.

Surprisingly, the poor performance of risk shifters is concentrated in low turnover funds. To

the extent that turnover is a proxy for trading costs, our finding suggests that direct trading

costs are unlikely the main driver of risk shifters’ poor performance.
   Several studies have identified a convex flow-performance relation, in which mutual fund in-

vestors tend to invest in funds with stellar performance and do not penalize poor performance
equivalently. This convex flow-performance relation motivates mutual funds to strategically

shift risk levels to attract additional fund flows. For example, Brown, Harlow, and Starks


                                               3
(1996) suggest that mutual funds compete with each other in a tournament and might ma-

nipulate fund risk depending on their prior performance. In particular, they show that funds
with poor past performance tend to increase their risk levels. Chevalier and Ellison (1997)

analyze the convex flow-performance relation and find evidence that mutual funds that are
well ahead of their peers also have an incentive to increase risk to make lists of “top per-

formers.” Koski and Pontiff (1999) confirm this risk shifting behavior and suggest that risk

levels of mutual funds might also change in response to unpredictable fund flows. Further-
more, as discussed by Goetzmann, Ingersoll, Spiegel, and Welch (2007), fund managers have

an incentive to change risk levels to manipulate their performance numbers. Recently, several
theoretical and empirical studies have improved our understanding of risk shifting behavior

of mutual funds.2 Our paper contributes to this literature by investigating the consequences

of risk shifting on fund performance, which have not previously been analyzed. Studying the
performance consequences of risk shifting gives us important insights into the motivations for

risk shifting.
       The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 derives our holdings-
based measure of risk shifting. Section 3 explains the data sources and gives some basic

summary statistics. Section 4 describes the characteristics of risk shifters and the mechanisms
of shifting risk. Section 5 documents a negative relation between risk shifting and subsequent

fund performance. Sections 6 and 7 investigate the motivations behind risk shifting and the

sources of risk shifters’ poor performance. Section 8 uses a multivariate regression analysis to
control for additional fund characteristics and Section 9 concludes.

2     Risk Shifting Measure

Mutual funds can change the total risk of their portfolio by holding assets with different risk

properties or by changing the diversification level of their overall portfolio. To capture the

risk shifting behavior of mutual funds, we examine their portfolio holdings. We measure risk

shifting of a mutual fund f at time t by comparing the current holdings volatility based on
                                              H
the fund’s most recently disclosed positions σf,t with the past realized volatility based on the
                         R
fund’s realized returns σf,t :
                                                   H      R
                                          RSf,t = σf,t − σf,t .                                      (1)

    The return of mutual fund f at time t is the scalar product of the portfolio weight wf ,t
and the returns of the assets Rt :

                                                          N
                                                          X
                                    RFf,t = wf0 ,t Rt =          i
                                                                wf,t Rti ,                           (2)
                                                          i=1


where Rt = [Rt1 , . . . , RtN ]0 is the vector of the returns for all available assets and wf ,t =
  1              N 0
[wf,t , . . . , wf,t ] is the vector for the portfolio weights invested in these assets by fund f at time
                                            PN
t. The weights add up to one (wf0 ,t 1 =      i=1
                                                     i
                                                    wf,t = 1).

    The variance of the returns of mutual fund f at time t depends on the weights invested in
the various assets and on the N × N variance-covariance matrix of the individual assets Σ.
The variance of a portfolio can be determined by either computing the variance of the portfolio

returns or by pre- and post-multiplying the variance-covariance matrix of the underlying stock
returns by the weight vector.


                VAR(RFf,t ) = VAR(wf0 ,t Rt ) = wf0 ,t VAR(Rt )wf ,t = wf0 ,t Σt wf ,t .             (3)

    To estimate the current holdings volatility of fund f at time t, we compute the square root

of VAR(RFf,t ) by estimating the sample standard deviation of the return of a hypothetical

portfolio that holds the most recently disclosed fund positions over the prior 36 months. This

method is equivalent to calculating the square root of wf0 ,t Σt wf ,t .


                                                     5
   The past realized volatility of fund f at time t is estimated as the sample standard devi-

ation of the actual fund returns over the prior 36 months. It captures the total risk of the
actual positions. The realized volatility is identical to the current holdings volatility if a fund

maintains constant portfolio weights over the prior 36 months.
   The risk shifting measure RS is positive if the most recently disclosed holdings exhibit

a higher volatility than the actual fund holdings over the prior 36 months and is negative

otherwise. Thus, a positive risk shifting measure indicates that a mutual fund increases
the portfolio risk, which is achievable either by holding assets with higher risk levels or by

concentrating its portfolio more.
   Most previous papers analyze risk shifting by comparing the standard deviations of the

returns of mutual funds over two non-overlapping time periods.3 Comparing risk levels of a

fund over two non-overlapping time periods may capture the exogenous changes in market
conditions rather than the intentional changes in portfolio risk, especially during periods of

dramatic market movements. By using identical time periods to estimate both the current
holdings volatility and the realized volatility for a fund, our measure of risk shifting is designed
to capture the changes in risk levels induced by changes in the portfolio composition and is

unaffected by changes in market conditions.
   One potential concern of our risk shifting measure is that our measure might capture the

impact of interim trades, window dressing, or other unobserved actions, since the current

holdings volatility is based on disclosed holdings returns and the realized volatility is based

on realized fund returns. In Section 7, we introduce several alternative risk shifting measures,

one of which (the equity-based risk shifting measure) is based solely on disclosed holdings and

is defined as the difference between the volatility of current equity holdings and the volatility
of past equity holdings. The results are similar using these alternative measures.

     See for example, Brown, Harlow, and Starks (1996), Koski and Pontiff (1999), Busse (2001), and Elton,
Gruber, and Blake (2003). On the other hand, Chevalier and Ellison (1997) and Kempf, Ruenzi, and Thiele
(2008) do use mutual fund holdings data to compute changes in risk levels.

3         Data and Summary Statistics

This section explains the data sources and describes the main characteristics of mutual funds

in our sample.


3.1         Sample Selection

For our empirical analysis, we merge the CRSP Survivorship Bias Free Mutual Fund Database

with the Thomson Financial CDA/Spectrum holdings database and the CRSP stock price

data using the MFLINKS file based on Wermers (2000) and available through the Wharton
Research Data Services. Our sample covers the time period between 1980 and 2006. The CRSP

mutual fund database includes information on fund returns, total assets under management,
different types of fees, investment objectives, and other fund characteristics. The Thomson

Financial database provides long positions in domestic common stock holdings of mutual
funds. The data are collected both from reports filed by mutual funds with the SEC and
from voluntary reports generated by the funds. During most of our sample period, funds

are required by law to disclose their holdings semi-annually. Nevertheless, about 78% of the

observations are from the most recent quarter and only 3% of the holdings are more than two
quarters old.

        We focus our analysis on actively-managed domestic equity mutual funds for which the
holdings data are most complete and reliable. Therefore, we eliminate balanced, bond, money

market, international, and index funds.4 We also exclude funds which in the previous month

manage less than $5 million and funds that did not disclose their holdings in the previous 36

months. For funds with multiple share classes, we compute fund-level variables by aggregating

across the different share classes.5
   4
     First, we select funds with the following S&P objectives: AGG, GMC, GRI, GRO, ING, SCG, ENV, FIN,
GLD, HLT, NTR, RLE, SEC, TEC, UTI. If a fund does not have any of the above objectives, we select funds
with the following ICDI objectives: AG, GI, LG, IN, PM, SF or UT. If a fund has neither the S&P nor the
ICDI objective, then we go to the Wiesenberger Fund Type Code and pick funds with the following objectives:
G, G-I, IEQ, GCI, LTG, MCG, SCG, GPM, HLT, TCH, or UTL. If none of these objectives are available and
the fund has the CS or SPEC policy, then the fund will be included. Index funds are identified based on their
names.
    5
        Our sample focuses on actively-managed domestic equity mutual funds, for which the holdings data are


                                                       7
3.2     Summary Statistics

Table 1 reports summary statistics of the main fund attributes. Our sample includes 2,335
distinct funds and 184,519 fund-month observations with a valid risk shifting measure RS.

The number of funds ranges from 141 (April 1983) to 1,559 (October 2006). Since we need 36

months of prior fund return data to compute the risk shifting measure, we lose the first three
years of the return histories of all mutual funds. Thus, our final sample covers the period

between 1983 and 2006.

    We report summary statistics on fund total net assets (T N A), age, expense ratio, turnover,

asset allocations, and net investor returns based on the CRSP mutual fund data. Based on

the CRSP data we compute the fund flow (F LOW ), which is defined as the growth rate of

the assets under management after adjusting for the appreciation of the mutual fund’s assets

(RFt ), assuming that all the cash flows are invested at the end of the period:

                                           T N Af,t − T N Af,t−1 (1 + RFf,t )
                            F LOWf,t =                                        .                           (4)
                                                      T N Af,t−1

Since estimated fund flows are very volatile, we winsorize both the top and the bottom parts

of the distribution at the 1% level.
    The average investor return of mutual funds in our sample equals 0.83% per month. We

compute the gross holdings return based on the most recently disclosed quarter-end Thomson

equity holdings and the asset allocation weights from CRSP. The holdings database includes

only long positions in domestic common stocks and excludes other non-equity holdings. Since

we focus our analysis on equity mutual funds, these disclosed holdings compose the vast

majority of fund assets (91.28%), with the remaining assets invested in cash (6.26%) and
other non-equity holdings (2.46%) including bonds, preferred stocks, and other securities. We

proxy for these asset returns using published indices. For bonds and preferred stocks we use

the total return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index; for cash holdings and other

most complete and reliable. In unreported results we show that the results are slightly stronger if we include
all funds which are listed in the MFLINKS file that matches CRSP with Thomson. The results are not affected
substantially if we exclude sector funds or include index funds.


                                                      8
assets we use the Treasury bill rate. The gross holdings return has a mean of 0.91% per month

and a correlation of 95.5% with the net investor return across the mutual funds in our sample.
       Important determinants of the risk level of a fund are the number of stocks and the

concentration of stocks in particular industries. The number of stocks is computed based
on the holdings information from Thomson Financial and the Industry Concentration Index

(ICI) is computed following Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2005) as the concentration of the

stock portfolio in ten broadly defined industries.6
       Table 1 also summarizes holdings-based style characteristics for the mutual funds in our

sample. We group fund holdings according to their size, book-to-market, and momentum
characteristics as proposed by Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997) and Wermers

(2003). Each stock listed in CRSP is grouped into respective quintiles according to its market

value (using NYSE cutoff levels), its industry-adjusted book-to-market ratio, and its lagged
one-year return. Using the quintile information, we compute the value-weighted size, value,

and momentum scores for each mutual fund in each period. For example, a mutual fund that
invests one half of its value in stocks in the largest size quintile and the other half in stocks
in the second largest size quintile has a size score of 4.5. Mutual funds in our sample tend to

hold stocks in the largest size quintile and have a slight bias towards growth and momentum
stocks.

       The last three rows of Table 1 report the current holdings volatility, the past realized

volatility, and the risk shifting measure, as defined in Section 2. To compute the current

holdings volatility, we exclude the holdings of stocks that do not have complete return histories

over the prior 36 months. Both the current holdings volatility and the realized volatility are

computed and updated at a quarterly frequency. The current holdings volatility and the
realized volatility have similar means (17.54% and 17.86% per year, respectively) and a high
                                                                                     P10      j
   6
    The Industry Concentration Index of fund f at time t is defined as ICIf,t = j=1 (wf,t        − wjf,t )2 , where
  j                                                                                      j
wf,t is the value weight of the stocks held by the mutual fund in the j-th industry and wf,t is the weight of the
CRSP total market portfolio corresponding to the j-th industry. Industry concentration is measured across
ten broadly defined industries as summarized in Table AI of Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2005).




                                                        9
correlation of 0.83. The risk shifting measure has a mean close to zero and an annualized

standard deviation of 4.58%, which is about one quarter of the average realized volatility.
Thus, mutual funds shift risk significantly.

        To test whether the current holdings volatility is a good proxy for the future realized
volatility of a mutual fund, in unreported analysis we regress the future 12-month realized

volatility of a mutual fund on the current holdings volatility and the past realized volatility

over the prior 36 months. We find that the coefficient on the current holdings volatility is
larger and more statistically significant than the coefficient on the past realized volatility.

Thus, the current holdings volatility captures an important aspect of the future risk exposure.


4         Characterization of Risk Shifting

This section discusses the characteristics of risk shifters and clarifies the main mechanisms
through which mutual funds shift risk.


4.1         Characteristics of Risk Shifters

To identify the characteristics of risk shifters, we sort all mutual funds in each quarter into
five portfolios according to the most recent RS measure and compute average characteristics

of these funds. Funds in Portfolio 1 (5) decrease (increase) risk by more than 2.5% per year

and compose 14% (13%) of our sample, whereas funds in Portfolio 3 change risk by less than
1% and compose 41% of our sample.7

        Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of mutual funds sorted according to the RS mea-

sure. Funds in Portfolio 1 decrease risk on average by 5.60% per year, which is approximately
26% of their realized volatility over the prior 36 months. On the other hand, funds in Portfo-

lio 5 increase risk by 4.75% per year, which is also approximately 26% of their prior realized

volatility. Thus, funds exhibit significant changes in their overall risk levels over time.

        The current holdings volatility and the realized volatility contribute asymmetrically to
    7
        The results in the paper are similar if the mutual funds are sorted into decile portfolios instead.



                                                          10
the RS measure across different RS portfolios. Funds in Portfolio 5 exhibit high current

holdings volatility, and their realized volatility is not very different from the mean realized
volatility. On the other hand, funds in Portfolio 1 have high realized volatility, and their

current holdings volatility is not substantially different from the mean holdings volatility.
Thus, funds in Portfolio 5 increase their total risk significantly from the average risk level and

funds in Portfolio 1 reduce their total risk from their elevated levels back to the average. This

asymmetric pattern suggests that increasing volatility is more of an active choice for funds
while decreasing volatility is driven more by the reversion back to the mean risk level.

   Most fund characteristics exhibit a U or inverse-U pattern, which indicates that funds that
increase risk share similar characteristics to funds that decrease risk. Funds that shift risk

are smaller, younger, charge higher expense ratios, and have higher turnover than funds with

more consistent risk levels.

4.2    Mechanism of Risk Shifting

Mutual funds have several potential mechanisms through which they change the riskiness of

their portfolios. First, they can change the composition between equity holdings and cash
holdings. Second, within their equity holdings, funds can change their exposure to systematic

risks by switching between low beta stocks and high beta stocks. Third, funds can change

their idiosyncratic risk exposures by changing the number of stocks or the concentration in
particular industries and styles.

   Table 3 summarizes the initial characteristics (Panel A) and the changes in the character-

istics (Panel B) of mutual funds in the various RS portfolios. The initial levels are defined as
the average values of the various characteristics over the prior three years and the changes are

defined as the differences in characteristics between the most recent quarter and the average

over the prior three years.

   Funds with more consistent risk exposures have lower market betas despite holding smaller

cash positions than funds which shift risk. Risk shifters have higher initial levels of idiosyn-



                                               11
cratic volatility and hold more concentrated portfolios as reflected by the lower number of

stocks and the higher industry concentration index. Risk shifters also differ in their style ex-
posure from funds with more consistent risk exposures as they focus their holdings on small,

growth, and momentum stocks.
    Panel B indicates that the changes in the various characteristics are monotonic across the

RS portfolios and illustrate the multiple mechanisms through which mutual funds change risk.

For example, funds that increase risk tend to reduce their cash holdings, increase market risk
exposure, increase idiosyncratic risk exposure by reducing the number of stock positions or in-

creasing their industry concentration levels, and increase their holdings of small capitalization,
growth, and momentum stocks.
    Figure 1 depicts the persistence of the RS measure four quarters before and eight quarters

after the formation of the five RS portfolios. Risk shifting builds up gradually over the year
prior to the portfolio formation and dissipates to a large extend two years after the portfolio

formation. The short-term persistence in risk shifting occurs partly because the persistence in
trading strategies and partly because the past realized volatility is based on overlapping data.
Over longer horizons, however, it would be difficult for mutual funds to consistently increase

or decrease risk. We frequently observe that funds in one of the extreme portfolios switch to
the other extreme, while funds with stable risk levels tend to remain in the middle portfolios.


5     Performance Consequences of Risk Shifting

This section compares the performance of funds that shift risk with the performance of funds

with more stable risk properties. We use various performance measures to evaluate fund
performance.

    At the end of each month we sort mutual funds into portfolios according to their most

recent RS measure. We compute the fund portfolio return as the equal-weighted average

return of all funds in the corresponding portfolio over the next month. Subsequently, we
compute the abnormal returns using the time-series of fund portfolio returns. We analyze the


                                               12
future performance of funds after computing the risk shifting measure to avoid any potential

issues of reverse causality.
      We report four different performance measures for the fund portfolios. To adjust for risk

and style effects, abnormal returns are computed using the one-factor CAPM, the Fama and
French (1993), the Carhart (1997), and the Ferson and Schadt (1996) models. The Fama-

French-Carhart model is specified as follows:

                RFk,t − RT B,t = αk + βkM (RM,t − RT B,t ) + βkSM B (RS,t − RB,t )

                                      +βkHM L (RH,t − RL,t ) + βkU M D (RU,t − RD,t ) + ²k,t .            (5)

      The return of portfolio k during time period t is denoted by RFk,t . The index M corre-

sponds to the market portfolio and the index T B to the risk-free Treasury bill rate. Portfolios
of small and large stocks are denoted by S and B; portfolios of stocks with high and low ratios

between their book values and their market values are denoted by H and L; and portfolios

of stocks with relatively high and low returns during the previous year are denoted by U and
D. The Fama-French-Carhart model nests the CAPM model (which includes only the market

factor) and the Fama-French model (which includes the size and the book-to-market factors

in addition to the market factor).

      Following Wermers (2003), we use the Ferson and Schadt (1996) conditional model that

nests the Carhart model.

      RFk,t − RT B,t = αk + βkM (RM,t − RT B,t ) + βkSM B (RS,t − RB,t ) + βkHM L (RH,t − RL,t )

models, the factor loadings βk denote the sensitivities of the returns of portfolio k to the

various factors and are estimated for each of the portfolios separately. The intercepts αk
capture the abnormal returns of the corresponding models and are reported in Table 4.9

       Table 4 reports the performance of mutual fund portfolios sorted by their risk shifting.
We observe that funds that increase risk experience significantly worse subsequent abnormal

returns than funds with stable risk levels. Funds that reduce risk also experience relatively

poor performance, although not significantly different from funds with stable risk levels. For
example, funds that increase risk the most (in Portfolio 5) exhibit an abnormal return of

-22 basis points per month using the Carhart model; funds that decrease risk the most (in
Portfolio 1) exhibit a Carhart alpha of -7 basis points per month; and funds with the most

consistent risk levels (in Portfolio 3) have an abnormal return of -6 basis points per month. The

poor performance of funds that increase risk remains economically and statistically significant
using alternative factor models. Figure 2 illustrates these results graphically.

       In unreported results, we find that the performance results become substantially stronger
if we subdivide Portfolio 5 into more extreme portfolios. For example, the abnormal return
of mutual funds that increase their risk levels by more than 5% (corresponding to 3.8% of the

mutual fund observations) amounts to -31 basis points per month using the Carhart model,
and ranges between -25 and -46 basis points per month using the other factor models.

       The asymmetry between the performance of funds that increase and decrease risk is con-

sistent with the finding in Table 2 that increasing risk is driven by the high current holdings

volatility and is more of an active choice by funds while decreasing risk is driven by high past

realized volatility and is more of a passive reversion back to the long-term mean. Increases

in risk levels can be achieved by shifting towards riskier securities and by concentrating the

    Using a five factor model including the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) liquidity factor does not affect the
results qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, our results are also consistent if we use the manipulation-
proof performance measure of Goetzmann, Ingersoll, Spiegel, and Welch (2007).

portfolio on fewer securities and fewer sectors as documented in Table 3. On the other hand,

decreases in risk levels can be achieved by holding a more balanced and better diversified
portfolio.

       Table 5 summarizes the long-term impact of risk shifting. We form mutual fund portfolios
using longer-term lags and report the Carhart alphas of mutual fund portfolios formed based

on lagged RS measures. The first column repeats the performance results from Table 4,

which use the RS measure in the prior quarter to form portfolios. The remaining columns
form portfolios based on the lagged RS measures up to four quarters earlier. The poor

performance of Portfolio 5 remains statistically significant over the first four quarters after
the portfolio formation.
       These performance results build on an extensive literature that investigates the investment

ability of mutual fund managers. Whereas the recent mutual fund literature finds that some
mutual fund managers have significant stock selection ability, our paper indicates that risk

shifting does not improve fund performance.10 Instead, consistent with the the timing litera-
ture, we do not find that mutual funds benefit significantly by taking advantage of time-varying
investment opportunities.11


6        Motivation for Risk Shifting

The poor performance of risk shifters suggests that risk shifting behavior is either an indication

of inferior ability or is motivated by agency problems in delegated portfolio management. To

investigate the potential role of agency problems in risk shifting behavior, we conduct two

additional analyses in this section. First, we study the potential benefits of risk shifting by

comparing the return distribution of funds that shift risk with funds that follow more stable
risk levels. Second, we ask whether funds that benefit more from risk shifting are more likely

to shift risk and whether these funds experience worse performance when they shift risk.


6.1    Return Distribution of Risk Shifters

Mutual fund investors tend to invest in funds with stellar performance and do not penalize

poor performance equivalently, resulting in a convex flow-performance relation. The mutual

fund literature extensively documents this pattern and suggests that fund managers have an

incentive to shift risk levels to increase the probability of becoming a top-ranked mutual fund.

   To verify whether risk shifters are more likely to have extreme future performance, we
report in Figure 3 the cumulative distribution functions of the performance ranking of mutual
funds in different risk shifting groups. At the end of each quarter, we first compute the

percentile ranks for all the funds in our sample. The percentile ranks are based on the
Carhart alphas over the subsequent 12-month period. In a second step, we sort mutual funds
into the same five portfolios as reported in Table 2. Finally, we compute the cumulative

distribution function of the performance ranks for each of the five portfolios. The figure

shows the cumulative distributions for three different groups of mutual funds. The curve RS1

corresponds to funds in Portfolio 1 that reduce risk the most, RS5 to funds in Portfolio 5 that
increase risk the most, and RS3 to funds in Portfolio 3 that maintain stable risk levels. The

intermediate groups RS2 and RS4 are not depicted separately, but fall between the middle

and extreme groups.

   Funds that increase risk exhibit significantly higher volatility and are more likely to be
ranked in the extreme of the mutual fund distribution than funds with more stable risk

exposures. For example, 15.2% of mutual funds in the RS5 group and only 8.7% of mutual
funds in the RS3 group rank in the top decile. Furthermore, 1.8% of funds in the RS5

group and only 0.6% of funds in the RS3 group rank in the top percentile of all funds. Not



                                              16
surprisingly, risk shifting also increases the probability of being ranked at the bottom of the

performance distribution. For example, around 17.7% of mutual funds in the RS5 group and
just 7.1% of mutual funds in the RS3 group rank in the bottom decile. The more striking

difference at the bottom decile than at the top decile is the source of the lower average
performance of the RS5 group. Yet, funds might prefer the return distribution of the RS5

group because it enables them to take advantage of the convex flow-performance relation.


6.2     Differential Benefits of Risk Shifting

We investigate whether the propensity to shift risk and the performance consequences of risk

shifting differ across funds with different incentives to shift risk. The incentives of risk shifting

are higher for funds that are better able to reap the benefits of extreme performance. Since the

expected profit for mutual funds increases with both the expense ratio and the assets under
management, we expect the benefits of risk shifting to be higher both for funds with higher

expense ratios and for funds with a more sensitive flow-performance relation. The mutual
fund literature has identified younger, smaller funds, and funds that belong to smaller fund
families as having a more sensitive flow-performance relation. Hence, we consider different

subgroups of funds based on these four characteristics: the expense ratio, fund age, fund size,

and the size of the fund family.

    For each characteristic we divide mutual funds in each period into two groups depending
on whether the fund characteristic is above or below the median value. In a second step, we

further divide the two groups of funds into five portfolios according to their most recent risk

shifting measure. The first group of columns in Table 6 summarizes the frequency distribution

of funds across the two groups and the last group of columns reports the subsequent Carhart
alphas for the ten mutual fund portfolios.12

    We find that funds with larger benefits of risk shifting are more likely to shift risk and
perform particularly poorly after shifting risk. For example, in Panel A of Table 6, of the
  12
     The frequencies are computed on a quarterly basis and the differences in the frequencies use Newey-West
standard errors with a lag length of four quarters. The Carhart alphas are computed as described in Section 5.


                                                     17
50% of mutual funds that charge above-median expense ratios, 7.36% belong to Portfolio 5

(that decrease risk the most), whereas only 5.27% of funds charging below-median expense
ratios belong to Portfolio 5. In addition, high-expense funds in Portfolio 5 exhibit a Carhart

alpha of -24 basis points per month, which is statistically significant at the 1% level, whereas
low-expense funds in Portfolio 5 have an insignificant alpha of -10 basis points per month.

   The row “All” reports the average subsequent performance of high and low expense funds

across the five risk shifting groups. In contrast to the drastic performance difference be-
tween these two groups of funds in Portfolio 5, the average high-expense funds underperform

low-expense funds by only 3 basis points per month. This performance difference, which
is calculated after expenses, is lower than the difference in expense ratios between these two

groups (which amounts to 5 basis points per month). Thus, high-expense funds do not exhibit

inferior investor ability before deducting expenses. Yet, high-expense funds that increase their
risk levels experience very poor subsequent performance, consistent with the notion that these

funds opportunistically shift risk to take advantage of the convex flow-performance relation.
Our result is also consistent with Gil-Bazo and Ruiz-Verdu (2009), who find that high-expense
funds do not perform better than low-expense funds, even before expense. They interpret this

evidence as an agency problem in which high-expense funds target naive investors who are
not responsive to expenses.

   Chevalier and Ellison (1997) find that young funds with less established track records have

larger incentives to shift risk since the flow sensitivity to performance is more pronounced for

young funds. They also find smaller funds have more sensitive fund flows. In addition, Huang,

Wei, and Yan (2007) find that funds in smaller fund families have higher flow-performance

sensitivity. Hence, these funds have more significant incentives to shift risk.
   Panels B, C and D of Table 6 confirm that young, small funds, and funds affiliated with

relatively small families are more likely to shift risk and they experience particularly poor ab-
normal returns if they increase their risk levels. Since the average performance of funds sorted

by each of these characteristics is similar across the high and low groups, these characteristics


                                               18
are not significantly related to investment ability. The fact that they are all related to the

potential benefits of risk shifting provides supportive evidence that agency problems, rather
than ability, are the likely cause of risk shifting behavior.


7     Sources for the Poor Performance of Risk Shifters

In this section, we study the sources for the poor performance of funds that increase their risk
level. Mutual funds can change the riskiness of their portfolios by changing the composition

between equity holdings and cash holdings, by changing their exposure to systematic risks

within their equity portfolios, and by changing their idiosyncratic risk exposures. We construct

alternative RS measures based on these various mechanisms of risk shifting and investigate

the performance consequences of risk shifting using each alternative measure. This analysis
sheds light on the sources of the poor performance of risk shifters. We also consider several
alternative explanations for the poor performance of risk shifters, for example, the additional

trading costs to implement risk shifting strategies or to accommodate fund flows, and the role
of past fund performance and volatility.


7.1    Cash and Equity Holdings

Table 7 reports the performance consequences of risk shifting based on six alternative RS

measures. The first column reports the Carhart alphas for fund portfolios formed according
to our base case RS measure which is computed using the complete holdings of the fund. The
results correspond to the results in Table 4 using the Carhart risk and style adjustments.

    The second column focuses on the aggregate proportion invested in cash and other non-
equity positions and ignores the riskiness of the equity positions. This cash-based measure of

risk shifting is defined as:
                                     cash      cash
                                   RSf,t  = −(wf,t  − wcash
                                                       f,t ),                                (7)

       cash
where wf,t  is the most recently disclosed proportion invested in cash and other non-equity

securities according to the CRSP mutual fund database and wcash
                                                           f,t is the average proportion



                                                19
invested in non-equity securities over the prior 36 months. Other non-equity positions include

bonds, preferred stocks, and other securities, and are only 2.46% of fund assets. To be
consistent with the other RS measures in which a higher RS measure corresponds to a riskier

current position relative to the past, we multiply the difference by minus one. The portfolios
are formed using the RS cash measure in specific ranges to maintain a similar distribution

of funds in the five groups as in our base case. Portfolio 1 (5) includes funds that increase

(decrease) the proportion invested in cash by more than 7.5% and Portfolio 3 includes funds
that change their cash proportion by less than 2.5%.

   The third column considers only the riskiness of the disclosed equity positions and ignores
non-equity positions. This equity-based risk shifting measure is defined as:

                                   equity    H,equity    R,equity
                                 RSf,t    = σf,t      − σf,t      ,                            (8)

       H,equity
where σf,t      is the current holdings volatility estimated using the returns of the most recently
                                R,equity
disclosed equity positions and σf,t      is the realized holdings volatility estimated using the

returns of a hypothetical portfolio that maintains the historically disclosed equity positions,
updated whenever new holdings become available, over the prior 36 months. Portfolio 1

(5) includes funds that decrease (increase) their equity risk by more than 2% per year and

Portfolio 3 includes funds that change their equity risk by less than 1%.
   The results from Table 7 indicate that funds that increase risk have poor subsequent

performance, whether they decrease the proportion invested in cash or increase the volatility of
their equity holdings. The impact of increasing the volatility of equity holdings is similar to the

base case result using all the holdings (with a performance difference of about 17 basis points

per month), while the performance consequence of reducing cash holdings is substantially

lower (at 6 basis points per month). Therefore, increasing the volatility of equity holdings is

more costly in terms of their subsequent performance. In addition, the weaker result using

cash holdings suggests that activities that mainly affect the fraction of cash holdings (for
example, fund flows and fund managers’s effort to time the aggregate market) have a smaller

impact on fund performance.

                                                20
7.2    Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk

Fund managers might shift risk in an effort to take advantage of time-varying investment
opportunities. They might change their exposure to systematic risk if they believe that they

have superior market timing abilities; or they might change the idiosyncratic risk of their

portfolio in order to utilize their (perceived) stock selection ability.
   The last three columns of Table 7 compare the future abnormal performance of fund

portfolios sorted by systematic and idiosyncratic risk levels. The fourth column is based on

changes in systematic risk and is defined as:

                                          β      H      R
                                        RSf,t = βf,t − βf,t ,                               (9)

       H                                                                 R
where βf,t is the CAPM beta of the most recently disclosed holdings and βf,t is the CAPM

beta of the realized returns over the prior 36 months. Portfolio 1 (5) includes funds that
decrease (increase) their CAPM beta by more than 0.15 and Portfolio 3 includes funds that
change their betas by less than 0.05.

   The final two risk shifting measures in Table 7 are based on the idiosyncratic volatilities

computed using the CAPM and the Carhart factor models. The idiosyncratic risk shifting

measures are defined as
                                 idiosync    H,idiosync    R,idiosync
                               RSf,t      = σf,t        − σf,t        ,                    (10)

       H,idiosync
where σf,t        is the idiosyncratic volatility of the most recently disclosed fund holdings
            R,idiosync
return and σf,t        is the idiosyncratic volatility of the past realized fund return. The
idiosyncratic volatilities are computed as the standard deviations of the residuals from the

CAPM or the Carhart factor regressions over the prior 36 months. Portfolio 1 (5) includes

funds that decrease (increase) their idiosyncratic risk by more than 2% per year and Portfolio 3

includes funds that change their idiosyncratic risk by less than 1%.

   We find a strong relation between risk shifting and fund performance for portfolios sorted

according to changes in idiosyncratic volatilities, but do not find a statistically significant

return pattern for portfolios sorted according to changes in systematic risk. For example,

                                                 21
the performance difference between funds that increase their idiosyncratic risk the most (in

Portfolio 5) and funds that maintain stable risk levels (in Portfolio 3) is between -18 and -21
basis points per month, both significant at the 5% level, depending on whether idiosyncratic

risk is measured relative to the market model or the four-factor Carhart model. On the
other hand, the performance difference between funds that increase their systematic risk the

most and funds that maintain stable systematic risk is -5 basis points per month and is not

statistically significant. Thus, the poor performance of funds that increase risk is driven by
the increase in their idiosyncratic risk levels and not by the increase in their systematic risk

exposure. Our results suggest that the main driver of the poor performance of risk shifters
is not their inability to time the aggregate market movements but their tendency to take on

idiosyncratic risk.13

       Chevalier and Ellison (1997), Basak, Pavlova, and Shapiro (2007), and Chen and Pen-
nacchi (2009) suggest that, if fund managers are evaluated on their performance relative to

a benchmark, they have an incentive to increase tracking error volatility. Our finding that
some fund managers significantly increase their idiosyncratic volatility is consistent with these
predictions.

7.3       Trading Costs

One potential source of the poor performance of funds that increase risk could be the significant

trading costs incurred by such funds. Since we analyze only the future performance of funds

after computing the risk shifting measure, our performance measures are not contaminated

by the direct trading costs to implement the current risk shifting strategy. However, since risk

shifting is persistent, these funds might also have higher trading costs in the future.

       We use turnover as a proxy for trading costs since it captures the majority of trading costs

as described by Chalmers, Edelen, and Kadlec (1999). If trading costs are the main cause
  13
     Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006) report that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility based on daily
returns tend to exhibit relatively poor abnormal returns in the subsequent month. To investigate whether this
effect can explain our results, we augment, in unreported results, the Fama-French-Carhart factor model by
an idiosyncratic volatility factor. Adjusting for the idiosyncratic volatility factor does not qualitatively change
our main result that funds that increase their risk the most experience the worst subsequent performance.

                                                        22
of the poor performance of risk shifters, then we should observe that the relation between

performance and risk shifting is particularly pronounced for high turnover funds. We sort funds
into subgroups with different turnover and risk shifting measures, following the procedure in

Section 6.2, and report the frequency distribution and the Carhart alphas in Panel A of
Table 8. Surprisingly, we find that increasing risk has worse performance consequences for

funds with low turnover than for funds with high turnover. For example, the performance

difference between Portfolios 5 and 3 is -25 basis points per month for funds with low turnover
and only -8 basis points for funds with high turnover. Thus, direct trading costs are unlikely

the main reason behind the poor performance of risk shifters.
   Another proxy for trading costs is fund flows. Edelen (1999) documents that the extra

trading and the resulting price impact induced by fund flows can significantly reduce the

average performance of mutual funds. In addition, Coval and Stafford (2007), Chen, Hanson,
Hong, and Stein (2007), and Zhang (2008) show that distressed mutual funds experiencing

large money outflows are forced to liquidate their positions in “fire sales.” Such outflows
can increase the total risk level of mutual funds as they reduce their cash positions or as
they reduce their portfolio diversification by selling some of their positions. To examine the

impact of fund flows, we divide mutual funds into groups depending on whether their fund
flows in the prior year are below or above the median level. Panel B shows that there are no

significant differences in the propensities to shift risk for funds in these two groups, suggesting

that most funds are able to undo the effect of funds flows and reach their desired risk level.

In addition, although funds with below-median flows perform slightly worse than funds with

above-median flows when they increase risk, the performance difference is not significantly

different from zero.
   Therefore, the poor performance of funds that increase risk is unlikely driven by the

additional transaction costs needed to implement the risk shifting strategy or to accommodate
fund flows.

7.4    Past Fund Performance and Volatility

The past fund performance and volatility level may reveal the ability and incentives of fund
managers. Mutual funds with worse prior performance are likely to have inferior ability and

might continue to perform poorly. The literature suggests that past winners and losers have

different incentives to take risk. In addition, funds with higher volatility levels have more
extreme performance and might be able to take advantage of the convex flow-performance

relation without shifting risk. It is therefore important to study the impact of past fund

performance and realized volatility.

   Panel C of Table 8 sorts mutual funds by their prior year performance and the risk shifting

measure. We find that funds with relatively disappointing performance are relatively more

likely to shift risk down (in Portfolio 1), whereas funds with superior performance are more

likely to shift risk up (in Portfolio 5). To investigate the relation between prior performance
and risk shifting in more detail, we analyze in unreported results the economic determinants of
risk shifting using a multivariate regression analysis. We find that both funds with very poor

and with very high past performance increase risk above their prior realized risk levels. This

result is consistent with Hu, Kale, Pagani, and Subramanian (2008), who develop a unified

theory that generates a U-shape relation between risk choices and prior performance. They
find evidence that managers that significantly outperform or underperform the benchmark

exhibit higher subsequent risk levels. The asymmetry in the frequency distribution in Panel C

occurs because the incentive to shift risk is on average more pronounced for winner funds than

for loser funds.

   The performance consequences of risk shifting are stronger for loser funds than for winner

funds. Within loser funds, we find that funds that increase risk the most underperform
funds that maintain stable risk levels by 16 basis points per month. On the other hand,

the corresponding performance difference for winner funds is only 7 basis points and is not

statistically significantly different from zero.

   Panel D of Table 8 reports the results for funds sorted on past realized volatility and risk


                                                   24
shifting measures. While it is intuitive that funds with higher risk levels are much more likely

to shift risk down, it is rather surprising that they are also more likely to increase risk further.
Moreover, these high-risk funds that increase risk further suffer the worst future performance,

with a Carhart alpha that is -27 basis points lower than the high-risk funds that maintain
stable risk levels. In contrast, low-risk funds have similar performance across risk shifting

groups, with a performance difference of only -1 basis point between Portfolios 5 and 3. The

different impact of risk shifting for the high- and low-volatility groups is striking, especially
given their similar average performance.

    In summary, mutual funds with worse prior performance are likely to have inferior ability.
These funds also perform particularly poorly when they increase risk. We also find that past

realized volatility is not directly related to future risk-adjusted performance but is critical for

the impact of risk shifting behavior. Low-risk funds do not suffer poor performance when
they increase risk while high-risk funds have significantly lower future performance when they

choose to increase risk further.


8     Multivariate Regression

This section uses a multivariate regression analysis to investigate the relation between risk

shifting and subsequent fund performance. This methodology allows us to control for addi-

tional fund characteristics. We run the following Fama-MacBeth specification:

                                                                            R
         P ERFf,t = β0 + β1 M AX(0, RSf,t−1 ) + β2 M IN (0, RSf,t−1 ) + β3 σf,t−1              (11)

                    + β4 RFf,t−1 +β5 LOGAGEf,t−1 +β6 LOGT N Af,t−1 +β7 EXPf,t−1

                    + β8 T Of,t−1 +β9 F LOWf,t−1 +²f,t .


    The dependent variable in each cross-section is a performance measure of an individual

mutual fund P ERF in a particular month. To capture the non-monotonic impact of risk

shifting on performance, we split RS into two components depending on whether it is positive

or negative. The coefficient β1 captures the relation between risk shifting and returns when

                                                25
RS is positive and β2 captures the relation between risk shifting and returns when RS is

negative. The additional control variables are the realized volatility over the prior 36 months
σ R , the prior-year return of a fund RFf,t−1 , the age of the fund defined as the logarithm of

(1 + AGE), the logarithm of the assets under management LOGT N A, the expense ratio of
the fund EXP , the turnover ratio T O, and the fund flow over the prior year F LOW . All

control variables are lagged by at least one month. In a first step, we run in each month

a cross-sectional regression. In a second step, we compute the means of the cross-sectional
coefficients over the whole time period between 1983 and 2006.

    One commonly used methodology to adjust for risk and style in the mutual fund literature
is to first estimate the factor loadings for each fund over a rolling window using prior data

and then compute abnormal returns in the subsequent period as the difference between the

actual fund return and the expected fund return based on the estimated factor loadings. This
methodology is not appropriate in our context since we focus on the risk shifting behavior of

funds over time. The factor loadings estimated over prior windows might not be accurate for
funds that shift risk levels significantly.14 Instead, the risk adjustments for our performance
measures are based on the most recent portfolio holdings.

    We use four different performance measures: (1) the raw fund return; (2) the Carhart
abnormal return; (3) the characteristics-adjusted return; and (4) the return gap. The Carhart

alpha of a fund is defined in a similar way to the bottom-up alphas of Elton, Gruber, and

Blake (2007) as the fund return minus the expected factor return:

                                              h
         Carhart                        M                            SM B
        αk,t     = (RFk,t − RT B,t ) − βk(H),t−1 (RM,t − RT B,t ) + βk(H),t−1 (RS,t − RB,t )
                                                                                  i
                          HM L                       UMD
                        +βk(H),t−1 (RH,t − RL,t ) + βk(H),t−1 (RU,t − RD,t ) .                               (12)


    The expected factor return is computed as the product of the betas of the most recent
holdings of the fund and the returns of the four Carhart factors. The betas of the most
  14
     Despite this concern, the results are not substantially different if we use fund-specific abnormal returns as
dependent variables. This is consistent with the prior portfolio results which indicate that the performance
results are not very sensitive to alternative factor adjustments.



                                                       26
recent holdings are obtained by regressing the hypothetical return of the most recent portfolio

holdings (including non-equity positions) over the last 36 months on the Carhart factors.
   The characteristics-adjusted return is defined as the difference between the fund return

and the benchmark return of securities with similar risk and style characteristics:
                                                   ÃN                     !

                                                          i
                          αk,t         = RFk,t −         wf,t [BRi(t−1),t ]   ,             (13)
                                                   i=1


   The weight invested in position i at the beginning of month t in the mutual fund f is
            i
denoted by wf,t and the benchmark return to which position i was allocated during month

t − k is denoted by BRi(t−k),t . For equity positions, we follow Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman,

and Wermers (1997) and define the return on a benchmark portfolio as the value-weighed

return of stocks that fall in the identical size, value, and momentum quintiles as the equity

holdings of a fund. For non-equity positions we set the benchmark returns equal to the returns
corresponding to the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (for bonds and preferred stocks)

and to the Treasury bill rate (for cash and other securities).
   Finally, the return gap is computed following Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008) as the

residual that captures the impact of unobserved actions on fund returns:

                               RGf,t = RFf,t − RHf,t + EXPf,t ,                             (14)


where the investor return is denoted by RF , the holdings return by RH, and the expense

ratio by EXP .

   Table 9 reports the multivariate regression estimates. All specifications indicate a sig-

nificantly negative relation between risk shifting and the various performance measures for

funds that increase risk and a generally insignificant relation for funds that decrease risk. The

performance consequences of increasing risk are similar in magnitude to the results reported

in Table 4. For example, the first column indicates that an increase in RS from 0 to 5% (cor-
responding roughly to the difference in risk shifting between portfolios 3 and 5 in Table 2),

reduces the raw fund return by 22 basis points per month. The impact of increasing risk by

                                               27
five percentage points ranges between 8 basis points for the return gap and 30 basis points

for the four-factor adjusted fund return.
    Including additional control variables does not have a significant impact on the risk shift-

ing coefficients. The level of the realized volatility over the prior 36 months does not have a
significant explanatory power for fund performance, consistent with the evidence in Panel D

of Table 8. The positive coefficient on the lagged return indicates some performance persis-

tence. The coefficient on the expense ratio is significantly different from zero in the first three
specifications which use an after-expense performance measure. On the other hand the ex-

pense ratio has no significant relation to the return gap, which is measured after adjusting for
fund expenses. Finally, funds with higher turnover tend to exhibit slightly higher performance

using all four performance measures.

    The results in this section confirm the portfolio results reported in Table 4 that funds that
increase risk perform poorly in the future, even after adjusting for other fund characteristics

and after controlling for risk and style.


9     Conclusions

As more and more investors delegate their portfolio decisions to mutual fund managers, po-

tential agency problems between fund managers and investors have become increasingly im-

portant. Our paper extends the literature on one particular agency problem – the incentive for

fund managers to shift the risk level of their portfolios to increase their personal compensation

– and investigates its consequences for fund investors.

    Risk shifting per se does not necessarily hurt fund investors. As long as the act of risk
shifting is well-known and has no performance consequences, investors can form efficient port-

folios by adjusting their allocation to the funds based on the expected ability and risk levels.

However, if investors are not fully aware of the risk shifting behavior or if the changing risk

level hampers their ability to assess fund performance, then individual portfolios are less likely
to be efficient.


                                                28
   We find that even if investors are fully aware of the risk shifting behavior, they are better

off avoiding funds that are prone to switch risk over time. The reason is that funds that shift
risk perform worse than funds that keep stable risk levels over time. In addition, funds with

larger incentives to shift risk are more likely to increase risk and perform particularly poorly
after increasing risk. These results are consistent with risk shifting being a consequence of op-

portunistic behavior of fund managers and inconsistent with risk shifting being a consequence

of skilled fund managers taking advantage of time-varying investment opportunities.

Table 6: Performance of Funds with Different Risk Shifting Incentives
This table reports the frequency distribution and the future Carhart alphas of portfolios of mutual
funds sorted according to risk shifting and fund characteristics that are related to risk shifting
incentives (expense ratio, age, size, and fund family size). Mutual funds are first sorted into two
equal-sized groups according to whether the characteristic is above or below its median value. In a
second step, funds are further divided into five groups according to their risk shifting level. The table
reports the average proportion of funds that fall into one of the ten groups and the Carhart alphas
of the ten portfolios and the differences in the future Carhart alphas between selected portfolios.
All returns are expressed in % per month. Portfolios 1 to 5 are defined in Table 2 with cutoff RS
measures of {±1%, ±2.5%}. The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: One, two, and
three asterisks denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1% level, respectively.

Table 7: Performance Consequences Using Alternative Risk Shifting Measures
This table reports the abnormal monthly returns of portfolios of mutual funds sorted according
to the most recent risk shifting measure. We compute six different measures of risk shifting: the
standard deviation of the fund returns using all holdings; the proportion of the portfolio invested
in cash and other non-equity securities; the standard deviation of the returns using only equity
positions; the systematic risk, defined as the CAPM beta; and the idiosyncratic risk, defined as
the standard deviation of the residuals from the CAPM and Carhart regressions, respectively. All
returns are expressed in % per month. Portfolios 1 to 5 are defined similarly to Table 2 with
different cutoffs for each RS measure: {±1%, ±2.5%} for all holdings; {±2.5%, ±7.5%} for cash
proportions; {±1%, ±2%} for equity holdings; {±.05, ±0.15} for CAPM beta; and {±1%, ±2%} for
both idiosyncratic risk measures. The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: One, two,
and three asterisks denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1% level, respectively.

Table 8: Performance of Funds by Risk Shifting and Other Fund Characteristics
This table reports the frequency distribution and the Carhart alphas of portfolios of mutual funds
sorted according to risk shifting and other fund characteristics that are related to trading costs and
prior fund performance (turnover, prior year flow, prior year return, and realized volatility over
prior 3 years). Mutual funds are first sorted into two equal-sized groups according to whether the
characteristic is above or below its median value. In a second step, funds are further divided into five
groups according to their risk shifting level. The table reports the average proportion of funds that
fall into one of the ten groups and the Carhart alphas of the ten portfolios and the differences in the
Carhart alphas between selected portfolios. All returns are expressed in % per month. Portfolios 1
to 5 are defined in Table 2 with cutoff RS measures of {±1%, ±2.5%}. The significance levels are
abbreviated with asterisks: One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1%
level, respectively.

Table 9: Multi-Variate Performance Regression
To investigate the relation between risk shifting and subsequent fund performance we run a multivariate Fama-MacBeth regression.
The dependent variable in each cross-section is a performance measure in a particular month. The additional control variables are the
realized volatility over the prior 36 months, the prior-year return of a fund, the age of the fund defined as the logarithm of (1 +AGE), the
logarithm of the assets under management, the expense ratio of the fund, the turnover ratio, and the growth rate in new money over the
prior year. To adjust for risk and style, we use four different performance measures: (1) the raw fund return; (2) the Carhart abnormal
return; (3) the characteristics-adjusted return; and (4) the return gap. The Carhart alpha of a fund is defined as the fund return minus
the expected factor return using the betas estimated from the current fund holdings over the last 36 months. The characteristics-adjusted
return is defined as the difference between the fund return and the benchmark return of securities with similar size, book-to-market,
and momentum characteristics as proposed by Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997). Finally, the return gap is computed
following Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2008) as the difference between the fund return and the holdings return after adjusting for fund
expenses. The significance levels are abbreviated with asterisks: One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10, 5, and 1%
level, respectively.

Figure 2: Future Performance of Portfolios by Risk Shifting Measure.
This figure depicts the abnormal monthly returns of portfolios of mutual funds sorted ac-
cording to the most recent risk shifting measure. The figure summarizes the intercepts from
factor regressions based on the CAPM, Fama-French, Carhart, and Ferson-Schadt models.
All returns are expressed in % per month.

Figure 3: Cumulative Distribution Function.
We report the cumulative distribution functions of the fund rankings for mutual funds in
different risk shifting groups. We sort mutual funds into the five portfolios according to their
most recent risk shifting measure. At the end of every quarter we compute the cumulative
distribution function of the percentile ranking of funds based on the Carhart alphas over the
subsequent 12-month period for each of the five portfolios. Finally, we depict the average
levels of the quarterly cumulative distribution functions. The figure shows the cumulative
distributions for three different groups of mutual funds. The curve RS1 corresponds to funds
in portfolio (1) that reduce their risk by more than 2.5%, RS5 to funds that increase their
risk by more than 2.5%, and RS3 for funds that change their risk by less than 1%. All returns
are expressed in % per month.
