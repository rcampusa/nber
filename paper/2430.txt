                   Tax Neutrality and Intangible Capital




                                 ABSTRACT


         Many studies measure capital stocks and effective tax rates for
different industries, but they consider only tangible assets such as
equipment, structures, inventories, and land. Some of these studies also
have estimated that the welfare cost of tax differences among these assets
under prior law is about $10 billion per year or 13 percent of all corporate
income tax revenue. Since the investment tax credit was available only for
equipment, its repeal raises the effective rate of taxation of equipment
toward that of other assets and virtually eliminates this welfare cost.

         However, firms also own intangible assets such as trademarks,
copyrights, patents, a good reputation, or general production expertise.
This paper provides alternative measures of the intangible capital stock,
and it investigates implications for distortions caused by taxes. The
existence of intangible capital markedly alters welfare cost calculations.
Investments in advertising and R&D are expensed, so the effective rate of
tax on these assets is less than that on equipment under prior law. With
large differences between these assets and other tangible assets, we find
that the welfare cost measure under prior law increases to $13 billion per
year. Repeal of the investment credit taxes equipment more like other
tangible assets but less like intangible assets. The welfare cost still
falls, to about $7 billion per year, but it is no longer "virtually
eliminated." With additional sources of intangible capital, credit repeal
could actually increase welfare costs. Finally, however, the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 not only repeals the investment tax credit but reduces rates as
well. Efficiency always increases in this model because the taxation of
tangible assets is reduced toward that of intangible assets.

     Before the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the investment tax credit was viewed

as favoring equipment-intensive industries such as those in manufacturing.

The standard view was that noninanufacturing industries were disadvantaged by

receiving a relatively low portion of tax credits for equipment. Measured

effective tax rates were often high for nonmanufacturing industries, and a

major focus of tax reform was an attempt to "level the playing field" by

repealing the investment tax credit. Not surprisingly, perhaps, "the

legislation was opposed by the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S.A., the

National Association of Manufacturers, ... and a long roster of

representatives of corporate America" (Birnbaum and Murray, 1987, p. 161).

     However, this standard view ignores intangible capital such as

trademarks, copyrights, patents, or a good reputation. Firms invest in

these assets through advertising, research and development, and other

expenses that create future goodwill and know-how essential for profitable

future production. These expenses are deducted immediately rather than

capitalized and amortized over the life of the intangible asset. Thus

firms' accounting for tax and book income may overstate expenses and

understate profits. If so, measured effective tax rates would be overstated

for firms with a relatively intensive use of intangible capital. Many of

these firms had little to lose from repeal of the investment tax credit and

would naturally favor rate reduction: their intangible investments were

already written-off at the earlier high statutory rate and would generate

subsequent income to be taxed at the new low rate. In fact, tax reform was

favored by "such powerhouse companies as General Motors, IBM, and Procter

and Gamble" (Birnbaum and Murray, 1987, p. 161). Later in this paper we
                                   -2-




measure intangible capital and find that its ratio to total capital is

highest in transportation equipment and ordnance, second in motor vehicles

(including General Motors), third in finance and insurance, fourth in

chemicals and rubber (including Procter and Gamble), and fifth in machinery

(including IBM).

     Mismeasurement extends beyond the "average effective tax rate," or

ratio of taxes paid to capital income. It also affects the "marginal

effective tax rate" which expresses the future tax on a marginal investment

as a fraction of the expected future income. Many studies have calculated

these rates for tangible assets such as equipment, structures, land, and

inventories, but they often omit intangible capital. If the statutory rate

is constant, the marginal effective tax rate is zero on intangible capital

because an immediate deduction for the outlay is equivalent in present value

to exempting from tax all future income generated by the asset.

     These marginal effective tax rates are often used to measure the

economic cost of tax distortions and niisallocations. In this paper, we

calculate the "welfare cost", or the dollar cost of production inefficiency,

attributable to tax differences among corporate assets. With only tangible

assets such as equipment, structures, inventories, and land in the corporate

sector, tax differences under the old law create welfare costs of about $10

billion per year, or 13 percent of federal and state corporate tax revenue.

These results accord with existing estimates, where the major distortion is

the low tax on equipment due to investment credits. This welfare cost is

virtually eliminated by a reform that includes repeal of the investment tax

credit.
                                     -3-




     The existence of intangible capital markedly alters welfare cost

calculations because the effective rate of tax on these assets is even less

than that on equipment under prior law. We provide alternative measures of

the intangible capital stock. With large tax differences between intangible

assets and other assets, using our basic measure of intangible capital, we

find that the welfare cost measure increases from $10 billion to $13 billion

per year. As pointed out by Summers (1987), repeal of the investment credit

taxes equipment more like other tangible assets but less like intangible

assets. The welfare cost still falls, to about $7 billion per year, but it

is no longer "virtually eliminated." Our basic estimate of intangible

capital is constructed by considering only advertising and R&D expenditures.

With additional sources of intangible capital, credit repeal could actually

increase welfare costs.

     Finally, we note that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 also reduced the

statutory corporate rate that applies to tangible assets. That is, it does

not just raise the tax on equipment (away from intangibles), it also reduces

the tax on other tangibles (towards intangibles). With our basic measure of

intangible capital, the efficiency cost falls from $13 billion per year

under the old law to $4 billion per year under the new law. No amount of

increase in the stock of intangible capital in this model reverses the

finding that the Tax Reform Act reduces interasset distortions.

     This finding does not mean that the new law is perfectly efficient.

There remain tax advantages to investment in advertising, research and

development, and other intangible capital. The subsidy to R&D might be

justified by the existence of "external spillover benefits": the firm may
                                    -4-




not receive all of the returns to its discoveries and therefore may not have

sufficient incentive to undertake research. Calculations below show the

efficiency-improving nature of the subsidy in the presence of such an

externality. It is more difficult to justify the advantage to advertising,

however. Calculations with a reduction of this benefit show the greatest

efficiency gain of all.

     The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. The first section shows

how average and marginal effective tax rates are affected by the existence

of intangible capital. The second section discusses the nature of

intangible capital and the procedures we use to measure it. Tables show the

relative use of each type of tangible and intangible capital in each

industry. The third section further discusses the tax treatment of tangible

and intangible capital, while specifics of our tax and efficiency cost

calculations are relegated to an appendix. The fourth section reports

results of our efficiency cost calculations, and a final section summarizes

our findings with concluding remarks.



1. Effective Tax Rates and Intangible Capital

     Much of the discussion about tax differences revolves around measures

of effective tax rates that take the ratio of taxes paid to capital income

in each industry. This "average" effective tax rate has been used by many

to identify high-taxed and low-taxed sectors of the economy. For other

applications, such as measuring the effect of taxes on investment

incentives, this measure suffers from a number of problems. First, as an

aggregate measure, it cannot distinguish the taxation of income earned from
                                    -5-




the various types of assets in which firms invest. Second, it looks

backward at the taxes paid in a given year, rather than forward at the taxes

that would be paid on the future income generated by a new investment under

consideration in that year. Fullerton (1984) describes many reasons that

the two concepts would differ.

     For these reasons, many choose to characterize tax differences by the

cost of capital or "marginal" effective tax rate. This rate can be

calculated for each asset, and it compares the present value of taxes

expected to be paid over the life of a given investment with the gross

income expected to be generated. It is a "marginal" effective tax rate

because it is calculated for an investment that is expected to yield a

return just equal to the cost of funds.

     Here, however, we would like to emphasize that past measures of both

average and marginal effective tax rates often do not account for intangible

capital and thus mischaracterize tax differences across industries. An

industry that makes extensive use of intangible capital may pay a tax that

is relatively low, even though past reported measures of average or marginal

effective tax rates have been characterized as relatively high.

     The key feature of intangible capital is that firms can expense it. In

accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, advertising and R&D

expenses are deducted immediately, for both book and tax purposes. If the

firm is growing, the deduction for current investments in advertising and

R&D is larger than a deduction for economic depreciation of existing
                                    -6-




intangible assets. Thus expenses are overstated, profits are understated,1

and the ratio of taxes to profits is overstated. This is the mismeasurenient

mentioned above: average effective tax rates may not have been so high in

industries receiving the tax advantages of expensing intangible investments.

     Because an immediate deduction for the initial expenditure on

intangible capital is equivalent to exempting the entire income stream from

the investment, the marginal effective tax rate of intangible capital is

zero. If industries differ in their relative use of intangible capital,

comparisons of marginal effective tax rates that excluded the taxation of

intangible capital may be misleading.

     An example using actual tax data may help demonstrate the tax advantage

of expensing intangible capital and the mismeasurement of tax rates. In

1983, corporations in the chemical and rubber industry had taxable income

after deductions of $15.9 million.2 The tax liability of this industry

after the use of tax credits was $3.15 million. The ratio of taxes paid to

taxable income is 19.8 percent.

     Using data described later in this paper, we calculate that firms in

this industry spent $15.5 million in advertising and R&D in 1983. Taxable

income before the expensing of these intangible investments is therefore

$31.4 million ($15.9 million plus $15.5 million). To measure economic

income, however, firms should be allowed a deduction for the depreciation of




1While the amount of profit is understated, profit rates are likely to be
overstated if capital in the denominator excludes intangible capital.

     tax and income data are from the Internal Revenue Service, Statistics
of Income - 1983. Corporate Income Tax Returns. The construction of our
data on intangible capital expenditures is described in section 2.
                                      -7-




the existing stock of intangible capital. We calculate that total economic

depreciation of advertising and R&D capital in this industry is $13.4

million. Subtracting this amount from the $31.4 million yields taxable

income equal to $18.0 million. Actual taxes paid as a fraction of this

income is 17.5 percent, about 10 percent less than without this correction.

Thus previously reported effective tax rates were overstated.

     Finally, if firms in this industry were required to deduct only

economic depreciation of advertising and R&D capital, tax payments at a 46

percent statutory tax rate would have been nearly $1.0 million higher, or

22.9 percent of the restated taxable income. As shown in this example, some

industries may receive a significant tax advantage from the expensing of

these intangible investments.



2. The Measurement of Intangible Capital

     Conceptually, the firm's stock of intangible capital includes its

patents, trademarks, copyrights, customer lists, reputation, and any firm-

specific   knowledge about technology, marketing, or production. These assets

may be specific to the firm and difficult to sell in the market, but they

are assets nonetheless. They wear out or become obsolete just like other

assets, requiring reinvestment to maintain their stock. While the return to

any particular investment may be uncertain, in the aggregate these

investments must be expected to generate a viable rate of return since they

utilize funds that could have been profitably invested elsewhere.

     For many assets, value can be measured using data from market -

transactions,   but intangible assets are rarely bought and sold. For total
                                    -8-




tangible assets in the national accounts, the Commerce Department and others

measure capital by the "perpetual inventory" method. Starting with a time

series on investment in equipment, for example, and using assumptions about

economic depreciation, this procedure simply starts with the earliest

available year, adds investment, subtracts depreciation, accounts for

inflation, and repeats for successive years up through the most recently

available year.

     The sante procedure can be followed for intangible capital, once the

proper investment series and rate of depreciation are established. Time

series data are available for advertising and R&D, but not all of these

expenditures generate future income. Much advertising information is used

by customers immediately, and much research may never pay off. In fact, for

a given firm, expenditures on R&D may bear little relation to intangible

capital: small R&D in one firm may lead to dramatic scientific discoveries,

while much R&D in another firm may not. Firms likely invest in R&D until

the expense is matched by the expected future value of the intangible asset,

however, so the aggregation of many firms in the economy or even within one

industry may provide a good correspondence between R&D expenditures and

subsequent intangible capital.

     Some previous research has been directed toward measuring intangible

capital. Much of this literature relates to prior claims that industries

with high rates of return must have entry barriers and monopoly profits.

When measures of intangible capital were added to the denominator of each

industry's rate of return, there was much less variation. Clarkson (1977),

for example, uses time series on advertising and R&D expenses from a sample
                                        -9-




 of 69 firms representing 11 manufacturing industries. For depreciation, he

cites various studies that "indicate that the economic life of advertising

capital ranges from less than one year in one industry to more than ten

years in some ..."   (p.   41), whereas "estimates of the average life cycle of

a pharmaceutical product, including research and development time, range

from twenty to thirty years" (p. 43). He chooses to assume three-year

straight line depreciation for advertising; basic research expenditures are

assumed to last for periods of 18 to 21 years, and development expenditures

last for 13 to 16 years. Sensitivity analyses on alternative assumptions do

not substantially affect his major conclusion, namely, that proper

measurement reduces the variation of rates of return among industries.

Grabowski and Mueller (1978) use a questionaire study concerning mean R&D

project durations and R&D output lifespans. They assign each of the 86

firms in their sample to one of 9 manufacturing industries and find that "a

depreciation rate of 10 percent would be a plausible starting point for all

of our industries except pharmaceuticals" (p. 334).     They cite other studies

showing faster depreciation of advertising, so they use a 30 percent rate of

depreciation for that type of capital.

     Our own procedure is as follows. First, we want comprehensive measures

of advertising and R&D, not just for some firms or just for manufacturing

industries. We take advertising data from annual issues of the Statistics

of Income Corporate Income Tax Returns, published by the Internal Revenue

Service of the Treasury Department. This source provides corporate

advertising deductions taken by disaggregated manufacturing and noruuanufac-
                                   -10-




turing industries. From this source, we construct a time series on

corporate advertising investment in each industry for the period 1977-l983.

     Second, for R&D expenditures, we use annual issues of Research and

Development in Industry, published by the National Science Foundation. We

separate the R&D expenditures in each industry into corporate and

noncorporate components, which we assume to be allocated in proportion to

the tangible capital stock in each sector for each industry. Although the

data are provided with sufficient breakdown among manufacturing industries,

we are forced to allocate a single relatively small figure for the

nonnianufacturing sector among several nonmanufacturing industries using IRS

data on the distribution of R&D credits. At this point, we construct a time

series on corporate R&D in each industry for the period 1963-1983.

     Third, to account for each type of intangible capital at the beginning

of the time series, we (a) measure the rate of growth of investment in the

asset in each industry during the time period, (b) assume that prior

investment grew at the same rate, and (c) construct an infinite series for

prior investment.

     Finally, we construct a measure of the stock of each intangible asset

as of the end of 1983 in a manner similar to the perpetual inventory method

used by the Commerce Department for tangible capital. Thus the stock for

year-end 1983 includes investment in 1983 with a half year's depreciation

and inflation, 1982 investment with 1.5 years of depreciation and inflation,




3Because of high rates of depreciation assumed for advertising, it is not
necessary to collect more years of data. We include constructed estimates
for investment in advertising before 1977, as discussed below, but these
depreciated investments comprise a very small fraction of the 1983 stocks.
                                   -11-




and similarly for earlier years. We undertake considerable sensitivity

analysis on annual rates of depreciation. For advertising, we use rates of

one-sixth, one-third, and one-half. For R&D, the rates are .10, .15, and

.20. Our central estimates are one-third for advertising and .15 for R&D.

     Measured stocks of intangible capital are shown in Table 1, where the

central depreciation choices imply $165 billion of advertising capital, $305

billion of R&D capital, and $470 billion of total intangible capital. This

total could be as low as $330 billion with the high depreciation assumptions

or as high as $775 billion with the low depreciation assumptions. Under any

assumptions, the largest amount of advertising capital is in wholesale and

retail trade, followed by food and tobacco, metals and machinery, chemicals

and rubber, and finance and insurance. The most R&D is in our large metals

and machinery industry, followed by transportation equipment (including

ordnance), chemicals and rubber (including drugs), and motor vehicles.

     More important to each industry, however, is the relative use of

different capital types. Thus we need measures of tangible capital types

used in each industry, and we need to combine several data sources. The

Commerce Department's Survey of Current Business provides equipment and

structures by industry, but not land and inventories. The Federal Reserve

Board's Balance Sheets of the U.S. Economy provides inventories and land,

but only in total. Unpublished data of Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981)

provide each asset by industry, but only for 1977. We therefore adjusted

the 1977 matrix until it matched appropriate totals for 1983. These data

are very similar to the tangible capital data used in earlier efficiency
                                   -12-




cost calculations by Gravelle (1982), Auerbach (1983), and Fullerton and

Henderson (1986).

     In Table 2, we show the ratio of each type of capital to total capital

in each industry. The most advertising-intensive industry is finance and

insurance, followed by food and tobacco. The trade industry falls in this

relative ranking because it uses large amounts of other assets, particularly

inventories; finance and insurance rises in this ranking because it uses

small amounts of other tangible assets. The most R&D-intensive industry by

far is transportation equipment, followed by motor vehicles. Metals and

machinery had the highest absolute amount of R&D capital, but is third in

this ranking of relative intensity. It is followed by chemicals and rubber.

     This measure of intangible capital constitutes about 11 percent of the

total capital stock. With extreme assumptions about depreciation rates,

this figure could almost double. The problem of setting depreciation rates

is modest, however, compared to the problem that advertising (as reported to

the IRS) and R&D expenditures may only account for a small part of total

investment in intangible capital. First, much of what one considers

advertising may be deductible as another allowable business expense. For

example, a company that hires a consultant to mount an advertising campaign

could properly deduct this expense as a consultant fee rather than as

advertising. The costs of consumer relations divisions and sales personnel

are deductible largely as wages. Second, firms may take less direct methods

to create intangible capital. While advertising is one way to create a

reputation, a new firm may sell at lower margins or take greater care in

production or customer service as an alternative way to create intangible
                                   -13-




capital.4 Here, foregone profits is the mechanism by which the firm invests

in future reputation. Firms also invest in the future productivity of their

labor force through recruiting and training. Our basic measure of

intangible capital is probably an understatement of the total intangible

capital stock.

     There are no appropriate time series data for the amounts of all such

investment, so the perpetual inventory method can never be comprehensive.

In related research, we are investigating alternative methods of measuring

intangible capital. One method would reverse the logic of above-mentioned

attempts to measure variations in the return to properly measured capital:

assume instead an equilibrium where all types of capital must earn the same

net rate of return. For each industry, we can then divide total net income

by the assumed net rate of return to derive the total capital stock, and

subtract estimates of tangible capital to get the implied intangible capital

stock. Problems include measuring capital income, choosing a rate of

return, and accounting for risk differentials.

     A second possible method would take the total valuation of capital in

the stock market and subtract tangible capital. Problems here include

transitory influences and correction for taxes. In fact, the market value

of the capital stock divided by its replacement cost is "q", a ratio that is

expected to depend on taxes and to influence investment. It is typically

measured by market value over tangible capital stock, however, a ratio that




41f consumers have full information about the quality of the product, then
extra production costs may not create intangible capital. It may take time,
however, for consumers to recognize quality and recommend the product.
                                   -14-




might exceed one if shareholders value intangible capital. Lindenberg and

Ross (1981) found that average q was 1.5 over the period 1960-1977 for a

large sample of firms. If the entire difference between the firms' market

value and the replacement value of their tangible capital stock is

attributable to intangible capital, then intangible capital could be as

large as one-third of the total capital stock. Further, time series

estimates of the effects of taxation on investment using q, such as those in

Summers (1981), could be misleading if intangible investments are not just a

constant fraction of tangible investments used in the estimation. Even more

likely is that intangible capital is not a constant fraction of tangible

capital across industries. Thus estimated q would be expected to differ

among industries for more than tax reasons.

     This other work is not complete, but a simple calculation reveals the

possible importance of intangible capital. Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux,, and

Poterba (1983) indicate that net capital income divided by tangible capital

varies between about 3 and 4 percent. If the properly measured net rate of

return were only 2 percent, for example, then the stock of intangibles would

be one-third to one-half of the total capital stock. This is four to eight

times the estimate of intangible capital from the perpetual inventory

method.

     As a rough approximation, suppose that this total intangible capital

appears in different industries in proportion to the advertising and R&D

capital estimated above. We can then represent the possibility of greater

intangible capital by simply multiplying the basic estimates by integers
                                       -15-




 from one to eight, or more. We show how efficiency cost estimates depend on

 the quantity of intangible capital.



 3. Tax Distortions and Efficiency Costs

     To measure the efficiency cost of tax distortions, we use the cost of

capital or marginal effective tax rate in this paper. First, we assume

certain conditions about the future enviroument for marginal investments

currently under consideration. In particular, we assume that all

investments will earn a risk-free nominal after-tax return of 8.5 percent,

that inflation will run at 4 percent, and that firms face a set of tax rules

including Federal and state statutory corporate tax rates, investment tax

credit rates, depreciation allowances, and local property tax rates that may

vary by asset. (See King and Fullerton (1984) for derivation of these

parameters under prior law.) Second, we assume that firms will undertake

all investments for which the present value of all net returns exceeds the

outlay for the asset. They stop investing when the present value of net

returns just equals the outlay. Third, this equality can be used to solve

for the real pretax return on the marginal investment that just allows the

firm to earn the assumed 8.5 percent net return (4.5 percent after

inflation). The equation is shown in the Appendix. This required pretax

return is the "cost of capital" net of depreciation, because it includes tax

costs and financing costs (the required net return). Finally, the marginal

effective tax rate is the difference between this real pretax return and the

4.5 percent real posttax return, as a fraction of the real pretax return.
                                   -16-




     Only the cost of capital is used in subsequent calculations, and it

does not depend upon actual choices for financing the marginal investment.

With arbitrage by the firm among various real and financial assets in this

risk-free world, all assets would have to earn the same net return. For

example, arbitrage between debt and real capital assures that any asset must

earn the after-tax interest rate. All investments thus have the same

assumed 4.5 percent real cost of funds, regardless of actual financing.5

The effective tax rate, calculated only to help interpretations, is the

fraction of the cost of capital that would be attributable to business taxes

if the investment were financed by equity.

     An advantage of this approach is that we do not have to deal with

personal tax changes. Although increases in personal exemptions and

reductions in personal rates were crucial components of tax reform, they do

not relate in this model to the firm's choice among capital assets.

Similarly, we abstract from other detailed aspects of tax law that are not

directly related to this allocation decision, including passive loss rules,

51n a different model, it is possible that financing proportions could
affect the cost of capital. Bosworth (1985) and others have pointed out
that structures might use relatively more debt finance and take greater
advantage of interest deductions. Also, churning might have provided
greater tax advantages to real estate, as discussed in Gordon, Hines, and
Summers (1987). Other problems are discussed in Summers (1987).

6Fullerton, Gillette, and Mackie (1987) consider accounting rule changes and
argue that (a) much of the revenue is from existing investment and does not
apply to new investment, (b) some of the changes are best modelled as
redced output subsidies rather than reduced investment incentives, and (c)
remaining changes have a small effect on marginal effective tax rates.

foreign tax provisions, and loss carryforwards.7 To simplify further, we do

not model the intricate R&D   credit.8   The model captures the important

conceptual distinction that advertising and R&D are capital assets

substantially favored under both old and new laws. These investments are

still expensed, while other assets lose their investment tax credits or

accelerated depreciation allowances.

     The effective tax rate includes all business level taxes on the

corporation. It would just equal the statutory rate (34 percent under

present law) if there were no state taxes or property taxes and if cost

recovery were based on economic depreciation at replacement cost. State and

local taxes raise the effective rate, while the investment tax credit (a

maximum 10 percent under prior law) and accelerated depreciation allowances

lower it. With no local property tax on intangible capital, the effective

rate is zero because an immediate deduction for the initial outlay is

equivalent in present value to exempting the entire income stream. For

other assets, we summarize complicated depreciation allowances in a single

parameter for the exponential rate of tax depreciation. We report for all

equipment and for all structures the annual rate of depreciation on




7Any of these aspects may have some effect on our results. For example,
Hulten and Robertson (1984) point out that start-up firms may invest
relatively heavily in advertising or R&D but may be least able to expense
these investments. Early losses mean that deductions must be carried
forward and might be lost altogether.

8lncentive effects of the incremental R&D credit can be small, or even
negative, depending on the circumstances of the firm. See Eisner, Albert,
and Sullivan (1984). Details of the effects of tax reform on R&D are
provided in Cordes, Watson, and Hauger (1987).
                                   -18-




historical cost that would provide the same present value of allowances as

the actual law.9

     These tax parameters for present law, as provided by the Tax Reform Act

of 1986 (TRA), are shown in Table 3 for our six assets. The exponential

rate of economic depreciation for equipment is .13, derived by averaging

over estimates in Hulten and Wykoff (1981) for twenty kinds of equipment.

Comparison with the .38 exponential rate for tax depreciation indicates the

degree of acceleration for equipment, but inflation erodes the real value of

these allowances since they are based on historical cost. For structures,

the average exponential rate of economic depreciation is .03, and the rate

for tax depreciation on historical cost is .076. Inventories and land

effectively receive economic depreciation allowances, since they do not

depreciate and do not get deductions. Effective tax rates for these two

assets would match the .383 combined Federal and state statutory rate,

except that local property taxes push them up to 44 and 47 percent,

respectively. The effective rate for structures is 44 percent. The

effective tax rate for equipment is 38 percent, which indicates that tax

depreciation is a little more generous than: economic depreciation at an

inflation rate of 4 percent.




9Fullerton and Henderson (1986) provide present value calculations for
depreciation under the old law where many diverse types of equipment receive
150 percent of declining balance, and structures receive 175 percent of
declining balance, both switching to straight line. They set a lifetime for
each asset, incorporate the half-year convention, and adjust the basis for
half the investment tax credit. Similar calculations apply to the new law
with double declining balance for equipment of different lives, and straight
line for nonresidential structures with a 31.5 year life.
                                   -19-




     These differences are all reflected in the cost of capital in column

(4) of Table 3. The cost of capital under TRA   for   equipment is 7.3 percent

and the cost of capital for other tangible assets is between 8.1 percent and

8.4 percent. Intangible assets have a significantly lower cost of capital,

at 4.5 percent.

     Because the pretax return on tangible assets is higher than that on

intangible assets, total output could be increased by shifting capital out

of intangible assets and into tangible assets. For example, replacement of

one dollar of intangible capital by one dollar of structures would increase

output by 3.6 cents, the difference in their pretax returns (8.1 minus 4.5).

To analyze more than marginal changes in the allocation of capital we need

to know the marginal product schedule of each type of capital. We assume

that asset demands are Cobb-Douglas: a one percent increase in the cost of

capital will reduce asset demand by one percent.1° Since we assume that

firms demand capital as long as the marginal product exceeds its cost, this

assumption effectively provides all marginal product schedules as well. We

use these marginal product schedules to show how much more output would be

produced by shifting capital toward the locations with a high cost of

capital (and high marginal product) and away from locations with a low cost

of capital (and low marginal product). That is, we calculate the additional

real value of output that could be produced with a given total stock of




10The loss in production efficiency is dependent on the responsiveness of
investment demand to the change in the pretax return of each type of asset.
The greater the responsiveness of demand to changes in this rate of return,
the greater is the efficiency cost of tax distortions. Fullerton and
Henderson (1986) provide some evidence on the sensitivity of the efficiency
cost to this parameter.
                                   -20-




capital, if it were simply reallocated to more productive locations and used

more efficiently.

     These calculations are similar to those of Gravelle (1982) and Auerbach

(1983) for different types of equipment and structures under the old law.

They represent interasset distortions only and do not include additional

misallocations between the corporate sector and noncorporate sector or

distortions of saving decisions, risk-bearing, financial choices, housing,

and labor markets.11 Fullerton, Lyon, and Rosen (1984) perform similar

calculations including equipment, structures, inventories, and land.

Fullerton and Henderson (1986) include intersectoral distortions and

housing, but none of these studies considers intangible assets. In the

previous section we calculated large amounts of intangible capital, and in

the next section we calculate revised costs of interasset distortions.



4. Welfare Results under Alternative Tax Regimes

     The cost of capital for different assets under the Tax Reform Act are

first compared with prior law and a modification of prior law that merely

repeals the investment tax credit (Repeal ITC). Under prior law, firms

faced a combined Federal and state statutory corporate tax rate of .495 and

were eligible for an investment tax credit of 10 percent on most equipment

and certain structures (as classified in the National Income and Product

Accounts). Tax depreciation for equipment is represented by an exponential




11These calculations also assume that all corporate assets are separable in
production. Feldstein (1985) and others have pointed out that particular
substitutability relationships among assets could make nonuniform taxation
more efficient.
                                   -21-




rate of .34, a figure which is less generous than the .38 rate under TRA

because the basis is reduced by half the investment tax credit. The present

value of depreciation allowances for equipment at an 8.5 percent nominal

after-tax discount rate under prior law is 2 percent less than under TRA,

indicating that in the absence of the half-basis adjustment of prior law (a

5 percent reduction in the value of depreciation allowances), depreciation

allowances would have been more accelerated under prior law than under TRA.

Tax depreciation of structures is represented by an exponential rate of

.135, providing depreciation allowances that are 30 percent greater in

present value than under TRA. Other tax parameters are the same as in Table

3. Repeal of the credit is modeled identically to prior law, except the

investment tax credit rate is zero for all assets.

     The cost of capital for each type of capital under each of the three

tax regimes is shown in Table 4,12 Because of the investment tax credit,

the cost of capital is lower under prior law than under TRA for equipment,

while because of the higher statutory tax rate, the cost of capital is

higher under prior law for structures, inventories, and land. Because of

expensing, however, the cost of capital always equals the real net return

for intangible assets. Repeal of the investment tax credit raises the cost

of capital for equipment by two-thirds but leaves other assets unaffected.

     Average measures of the cost of capital also are shown in Table 4 for

all tangible capital and for all capital, including advertising and R&D




'2Not shown separtely in the table, but included in the overall averages,
is the cost of capital under prior lawfor structures eligible for the
investment tax credit. This cost of capital is estimated to be 6.98
percent.
                                   -22-




intangible capital. Under TRA and "Repeal ITC", all tangible assets have

similar costs of capital, indicating that there is likely to be little loss

in productive efficiency due to misallocation of capital across the

different types of tangible capital. Major differences in the cost of

capital between tangible and intangible capital in all three tax regimes,

however, may be a significant source of production inefficiency.



4.1 The Inclusion of Intangible Capital

     Previous studies have calculated the cost of the loss in production

efficiency of differential taxation among tangible assets. Because we wish

to show how this welfare loss changes with the introduction of intangible

capital, we first calculate the welfare loss for the three tax regimes

assuming no intangible capital.

     Our findings under the assumption of no intangible capital are similar

to those of previous research. Under prior law, the annual welfare loss

from differential taxation is $9.8 billion per year. This cost is 13

percent of corporate tax revenue in 1983, or .3 percent of GNP. With repeal

of the investment tax credit, distortions among tangible assets are greatly

reduced, and the welfare loss falls to $0.7 billion. The Tax Reform Act of

1986, by reducing the statutory corporate tax rate, provides some further

reduction in interasset distortions, and the welfare loss falls to $0.4

billion. In the absence of intangible capital, TRA or repeal of the credit

appears quite successful in creating a level playing field.

     Next, we repeat these calculations for the three tax regimes using our

central estimate of the intangible capital stock attributable to advertising
                                    -23-




and R&D. Under all three tax regimes, the addition of these untaxed assets

increases the interasset distortions and the welfare loss measures. (The

addition of any capital with a cost of capital different from the average

will increase our measure of the welfare loss.) The cost of interasset

distortions under prior law increases to $12.8 billion; under repeal of the

ITC it increases to $6.7 billion; and under TRA it   increases   to $4.1

billion. These welfare losses are compared in Table 5 with the previous

estimates under the assumption of no intangible capital.

     An important result is that the consideration of intangible capital

does not increase the welfare loss by the same amount in each tax regime.

Comparing the welfare losses across tax regimes, we find that the absolute

welfare gain from repeal of the credit is reduced by one-third when we

include intangible capital, from $9.1 billion ($9.8 billion minus $0.7

billion with no intangible capital) to $6.1 billion ($12.8 billion minus

$6.7 million with intangible capital). The investment tax credit can be

viewed as less distorting in the presence of intangible capital, because the

average cost of capital for all assets is lower.

     Under the Tax Reform Act, the inclusion of advertising and R&D

intangible capital reduces the absolute welfare improvement over prior law

only slightly, from $9.5 billion ($9.8 billion minus $0.4 billion) to $8.7

billion ($l2.8 billion minus $4.1 billion). As under repeal of the ITC,

intangible capital adds more of a distortion under TRA than under prior law,

but the reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate mitigates this effect.

The statutory rate reduction lowers the cost of capital for all positively

taxed assets, while the cost of capital remains unchanged for intangible
                                   -24-




capital with a zero effective tax rate. Therefore, TRA still provides

significant efficiency gains relative to prior law.

     As mentioned in Section 2, changes in assumed rates of depreciation for

advertising and R&D could nearly double or reduce by one-half our measure of

the stock of these assets. More importantly, this study omits many other

forms of intangible capital. Because the actual level of intangible capital

may be much greater than we have measured here, we also calculate the

welfare loss under the three tax regimes for variations in the level of

intangible capital between zero and 12 times our measured intangible capital

stock. Our results show that inclusion of greater amounts of intangible

capital increases the welfare loss from distortionary taxation under each

tax regime. Under prior law, if the actual intangible capital stock is four

times larger than our measured intangible capital stock, the welfare loss is

nearly double the measure in studies that omit intangible capital ($19.2

billion). Figure 1 shows how increases in the level of intangible capital

increase the welfare loss measure under each tax regime.

     Further, we find that if the actual level of intangible capital is

between four and five times our measured level, repeal of the investment tax

credit results in a loss of welfare. For these magnitudes of intangible

capital, the average cost of capital is low enough that repeal raises the

cost of equipment away from the average instead of toward the average.

     Repeal of the credit in combination with the corporate rate reduction

of TRA, however, results in efficiency gains relative to prior law for all

levels of intangible capital modeled. The absolute improvement in

productive efficiency declines from $8.7 billion at our measured level of
                                       -25-




advertising and R&D   intangible   capital to $5.6 billion when intangible

capital is assumed to be 12 times our measured level.



4.2 Further Sensitivity Analysis

     The favorable tax treatment for R&D is often justified as a proper

correction for postive externalities generated by R&D. In this view, firms

are unable to appropriate all of the returns from the research they

undertake. Competitors or the world at large may benefit from the R&D

performed by a firm. Part or all of this effect might be offset by the fact

that we ignore the incremental R&D credit. Under TRA, firms can receive a

20 percent credit for qualifying R&D expenditures exceeding a base period

amount. Because R&D expenditures increase the base for calculating future

credits, however, the marginal incentive of this credit is very difficult to

model. We abstract from it here, but this omission is equivalent to the

assumption that the marginal incentive of the R&D credit exactly offsets any

positive externalities from R&D.

     Suppose, however, that these spillover benefits are even greater than

the marginal incentive of the R&D    credit.   To be specific, assume the

marginal return to society from R&D is 50 percent greater than the private

after-tax return of 4.50 percent, i.e., 6.75 percent. For all other assets

we continue to assume no externalities. Under this assumption, the pretax

return to R&D including the externality is closer to that of all tangible

capital, causing welfare losses to be lower than shown     in   Table 5 or Figure

1. At our measured level of intangible capital, the welfare loss under TRA

and prior law is about $2.0 billion lower than in Table 5, and under repeal
                                   -26-




of the ITC it is $3.0 billion lower than in Table 5. The absolute welfare

gain of TRA relative to prior law is therefore the same as shown in Table 5,

while it is slightly greater for repeal of ITC relative to prior law. At

higher assumed levels of intangible capital (but holding the level of R&D

fixed), the welfare losses are only slightly lower than those shown in

Figure 1.

     Next, we consider a modification to the tax treatment of advertising

expenditures. One proposal considered during tax reform and again during

this year's budget reconciliation is a partial disallowance of the deduction

for advertising expenditures. Here, we consider a modification of TRA that

provides a deduction for only 80 percent of advertising expenditures. This

disallowance is equivalent in present value to capitalizing all advertising

expenditures and allowing them to be depreciated at a 34 percent exponential

rate, comparable to that for equipment under TRA. To calculate the new cost

of capital for advertising, we assume advertising capital has an economic

exponential depreciation rate of 33 percent. The partial disallowance of

advertising expenditures results in a cost of capital of 9.2 percent, or an

effective tax rate of 51 percent. This tax cost is higher than that of

other assets because the 80 percent deduction (or equivalently 34 percent

rate of depreciation on historical cost) is not enough to cover economic

depreciation at 4 percent inflation.

    At our measured level of intangible capital (and assuming no

externalities for R&D), welfare losses under TRA with a partial deduction

for advertising decrease from $4.1 billion to $3.0 billion. At greater
                                   -27-




levels of intangible capital (while holding constant the level of

advertising capital), these welfare gains are snialler.13

     Finally, some believe that advertising may generate negative

externalities, that is, yield a social rate of return below its private rate

of return. Some advertising may simply redistribute sales between competing

brands but provide no net increase in total sales. Under the assumption

that advertising generates negative externalities, welfare losses under all

three tax regimes would be greater. A tax on advertising would raise the

social rate of return on advertising toward that of other assets, and result

in welfare gains.



5. Conclusion

     Intangible capital has escaped the attention of many tax researchers

and tax policymakers. As a consequence, discussions of a "level playing

field" have concentrated on the relative taxation of equipment, structures,

and other tangible assets. They have ignored the significant tax advantages

of expensing investments in advertising, R&D, and other intangible assets.

We show in this paper that the consideration of intangible capital renders

invalid many of the standard views about what constitutes an efficiency

increasing reform. For sufficiently large levels of intangible capital,


13
  In fact, if the total stock of intangible capital is at least eight times
greater than our measured stock of advertising and R&D intangible capital,
the partial deduction for advertising actually decreases welfare. This
result occurs because the cost of capital for advertising is greater than
the cost of capital for all other assets. With sufficiently large amounts
of untaxed intangible capital, it is more distorting to tax advertising at
greater than average rates than to leave it untaxed. At any level of
intangible capital, however, a less restrictive partial deduction for
advertising would always generate efficiency gains.
                                   -28-




repeal of the investment tax credit can actually increase the cost of

distorting firms' choices among assets. Importantly, however, we find that

the Tax Reform Act of 1986 still reduces the cost of these distortions

relative to prior law.

     The point of this paper is not to provide refined estimates of the

welfare costs of taxes on income from capital. Indeed, other studies

calculate detailed effects of specific tax provisions on distortions among

assets, between the corporate and noncorporate sectors, between business

capital and housing, among sources of finance, or between present and future

consumption. They might use more sophisticated formulas that account for

estimated asset demands or particular relationships among assets in

production. Other studies do not consider intangible capital, however.

This paper uses very simple calculations to show that this omission has a

major effect on measures of distortions among assets that were a major

concern in discussions of tax reform.

     These results do not imply that concerns about the level playing field

were misplaced, however. Perhaps they were only too limited by considering

only tangible capital. The model in this paper starts with the presumption

that corporate capital is allocated most efficiently when all types of

capital have the same pretax return (or, in the presence of externalities,

the same social return). With unequal effective tax rates, efficiency can

be increased by any reform that raises the lowest effective rates and uses

the revenue to reduce the highest effective rates. Repeal of the investment

tax credit may have raised the low effective tax rate for equipment and

provided revenue for rate reduction, but it did not deal with the asset
                                   -29-




having the lowest effective tax rate. Further efficiency gains are possible

in this model. If advertising and R&D do create assets that depreciate over

time, then expensing provides a zero effective tax rate for that asset. Any

cut-back from expensing, such as a partial disallowance or delay in

deductions, would raise the lowest effective tax rate, remove further

distortions, and provide revenue that could be used to reduce or maintain

lower rates.
Technical Appendix



     In the framework of Hall and Jorgenson (1967), we consider a corporation

facing a certain nominal after-tax discount rate r and inflation rate ir.            The

firm makes a one-dollar marginal investment in asset j that depreciates

exponentially at rate 6. and earns a net marginal product              Income from the
                                                                 p.
asset is taxed at the statutory corporate rate u. The firm receives an

immediate investment tax credit at rate k. and delayed depreciation allowances

on the original purchase price. The present value of these allowances per

dollar of investment is z. where the firm discounts future nominal allowances
                         J
by the nominal after-tax discount rate. For further discussion of these

assumptions, see Bradford and Fullerton (1981).

     The profit-maximizing firm continues to make such investments until, in

competitive equilibrium, the cost of the asset is just equal to the present

discounted value of after-tax returns and tax savings from the asset. This

equilibrium condition is used to solve for the net marginal product or pretax

return p, as a function of other parameters:


           r — ir + S.
                     (1 — k. — uz.) — 6..
     p.
            1—u            j               j                                             (1)




This cost is gross of taxes but net of depreciation. This pretax return can

easily vary among assets with different credit rates         depreciation rates

and/or a1loqances z.. With no investment tax credit, however, depreciation

could be set so that the firm receives economic allowances at replacement cost

for every asset. The firm then discounts by the real net return s =          r   — it.     In
this case, z. equals S./(s +   S.),   and p. reduces to s/(1 —   u)   for all assets.

Alternatively, equation (1) shows that expensing all assets (k = 0 and            z = 1)
provides p. equal to s for all assets. If the total corporate capital stock is

fixed, the tax system does not distort its allocation in either of these two

special cases. Other tax rules also can provide the same p for all assets, as

shown in Bradford (1980) and Brown (1981).

     In general, taxes do distort the allocation of capital among assets. In

this paper, we follow Hendershott and Hu (1980) and Gravelle (1982) in

measuring the associated welfare cost by a more recent version of the formula

used by Harberger (1966):



                K.
             N rJ
     W   =   E        [p.(K.) — —

                           ]        3
                                        ,                                    (2)
         j=1 J K* J
                  J



where K' is the stock of asset j in the distorted equilibrium, k. is the stock

in the undistorted equilibrium, p(K.) is the net marginal product given the

level K., p is the cost of capital in the undistorted equilibrium, and N is the

number of assets. To measure W therefore we need to know how the use of K.
                                                                               3

depends upon its cost p. Econometric studies reviewed in Jorgenson (1974)

suggest that firms' total use of capital changes by approximately one percent

for each one percent change in its cost. This cost could conceivably be gross

or net of depreciation, and gross costs are often used in empirical work

finding that gross output is a Cobb-Douglas function of capital and labor.

However, the use of net costs p. in equation (2) guarantees a fixed total stock

of capital under all reallocations. No empirical work has measured price

elasticities separately for each of the capital assets used in this study, but

we assume that the demand for each K. has unitary elasticity with respect to

its price
             p.
     Expenditure on each type of capital is a constant under our assumptions,

so   K. =    p'K   for any K. Thus, we can substitute PJKJ/Kj for   (I(s) in

equation (2). Further algebra then provides:


           N   **                    —*
     W   = >   p.K.[ln(p./p) — 1 +   p/p.]   .                                 (3)
        j=l
     For the distorted equilibrium under old law, capital costs     are given by

equation (1) using parameters for old law derived in King and Fullerton (1984).

We obtain the distorted capital allocation K for 1983 from data in Jorgenson &

Sullivan (1981), more recent issues of the Survey of Current Business, the

Federal Reserve Board's Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy, and our

constructed stocks of intangible capital. We estimate the long-run distorted

allocation for the other tax plans using the same Cobb-Douglas reactions to

changes in the cost of capital. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), for

example, K is given by capital expenditures (K.p.) under 1983 law divided by

the cost of capital (pr) under TRA.

     For the undistorted or counterfactual equilibrium, capital costs should be

the sani'e for all assets. Our particular choice for p is the capital-weighted

average of      from the distorted equilibrium, such that both equilibria have

the same aggregate pretax return, the same aggregate after-tax return, and the

same total tax revenue.

     Once we specify r, it, and tax parameters for each law, equations (1) and

(3) together provide the cost of capital for each asset and the efficiency cost

of distortions, as reported in the text.

Note: The cost of capital is defined here to be gross of tax but net of
depreciation. It is based on equation (1) of the Appendix, using a corporate
rate of .383 including state corporate taxes, a discount rate of .085, an
inflation rate of .04, and therefore a real net return of .045 as shown in the
table.
