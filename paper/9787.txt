                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the short- and long-run effects of financial liberalization on capital markets. To do so,
we construct a new comprehensive chronology of financial liberalization in 28 mature and emerging
economies since 1973. We also construct an algorithm to identify booms and busts in stock market

prices. Our results indicate that financial liberalization is followed by more pronounced boom-bust
cycles in the short run. However, financial liberalization leads to more stable markets in the long

run. Finally, we analyze the sequencing of liberalization and institutional reforms to understand the
contrasting short- and long-run effects of liberalization.

I. Introduction


        The crises of the 1990s have claimed several victims.                      Banking systems in many
countries collapsed, roaring growing economies suddenly faced sharp recessions, and the
booming international capital flows of the mid 1990s dwindled to a trickle. This is not all.
Another important casualty of these crises has been the support for the liberalization of financial
systems. In the aftermath of the Asian crisis, many have argued that globalization has gone too
far, leading to erratic capital markets and causing costly crises. This has prompted some to
suggest a return to the old order of financial controls. For example, Stiglitz (1999) clamors for
developing countries to put some limits on capital inflows to moderate “excessive” boom-bust
patterns in financial markets.1 Even controls on capital outflows, not long ago dismissed as
ineffective, have been recommended again. Krugman (1998), for example, argues that capital
controls might help in managing, at least temporarily, an otherwise disorderly retreat of
investors. Rodrik (1998) and (2000) argues that financial liberalization can lead to financial
crashes and that capital controls might be beneficial given the boom-bust nature of capital flows.
The debate has reached the general public, with Soros (2002) and Stiglitz (2002) broadly
criticizing the functioning of the international financial system.                     With many economists
supporting intervention in financial markets, long gone seem to be the days of an indiscriminate
advocacy of financial integration.2
        Interestingly, in what seems to be a parallel world, many still praise the advantages of
liberalization. It is claimed that financial liberalization helps to improve the functioning of
financial systems, increasing the availability of funds and allowing cross-country risk
diversification. For example, Obstfeld (1998) argues that international capital markets can
channel world savings to their most productive uses, irrespective of location. Stulz (1999) and
Mishkin (2001) claim that financial liberalization promotes transparency and accountability,
reducing adverse selection and moral hazard while alleviating liquidity problems in financial
markets.      They argue, moreover, that international capital markets help to discipline
policymakers, who might be tempted to exploit an otherwise captive domestic capital market.


1
  These overreactions in capital markets are often explained by information asymmetries. With imperfect and costly
information, investors may act as a herd and overreact to shocks, withdrawing from countries at the smallest signs of
problems, even when fundamentals do not warrant it. See, for example, Calvo and Mendoza (2000).
2
  See, for example, Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1993) and Wyplosz (2001).


                                                         1
Others even claim that financial liberalization and the financial development it triggers tend to
greatly facilitate economic growth.3 As with the group that favors more repression, the group
supporting deregulation has also been growing in numbers.4
        The empirical research, so far, has not helped to resolve the conflicting views. The
findings in the crisis literature suggest that excessive booms and busts in financial markets are at
the core of currency crises and that these large cycles are triggered by financial deregulation.5
On the contrary, the findings in the finance literature tend to support the claim that deregulation
is beneficial, with liberalization reducing the cost of capital.6 Perhaps, the inability to settle this
debate is due to the fact that the various lines of empirical research focus either on the short-run
or on the long-run effects of deregulation, without studying the possible time-varying effects of
financial liberalization.       Moreover, the existing empirical literature has not provided a
comprehensive analysis of the liberalization process. It has concentrated alternatively on the
liberalization of the domestic financial sector, the capital account, or the stock market, even
when liberalization reforms have entailed the progressive opening of the three sectors.
        The goal of this paper is, first, to provide a better understanding of the liberalization
process and, second, to explain both the link between liberalization and crises as well as the
relation between deregulation and more stable financial markets. To do so, we first assemble a
new, more comprehensive database on financial liberalization for 28 countries for the period
January 1973-June 1999. By itself, this is an important contribution because this database
improves over the existing ones in several respects.                  First, the new dataset looks at the
experiences of a wide set of countries, both developed and developing. Second, it captures with
a similar framework various aspects of liberalization, namely the deregulation of the capital
account, the domestic financial sector, and the stock market. Third, the chronology covers an
extended period in which several regulatory changes occurred, including deregulations and
impositions of new controls.          Fourth, the new data provide information on the degrees of
liberalization.

3
  The evidence on the benefits of financial deregulation seems to be quite strong with, for example, output growth
rates estimated to have increased about one percentage point following liberalization (as shown in Bekaert, Harvey,
and Lundblad 2001).

        We also construct an anatomy of stock market cycles by applying algorithms designed to
identify business cycles. With this technique, we study the duration and magnitude of upturns
and downturns. Since financial cycles would be spurious if markets were efficient, we test the
null hypothesis of a random walk.7 We then study whether booms and busts change with
financial liberalization. Though financial liberalization is expected to affect different parts of the
financial system, we find it useful to concentrate on stock market fluctuations. First, stock
market prices are one of the few financial variables for which one can obtain meaningful long
time series across countries. Thus, the time span of these data allows us to analyze the effects of
financial liberalization. Second, the finance literature has extensively study the behavior of
world stock market prices, providing a benchmark for our results. We finally analyze the
possibility that financial deregulation triggers forces that favor changes in institutions, which can
ultimately promote financial stability and growth.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the new data on
financial liberalization and examines the patterns of deregulation. Section III characterizes
booms and busts in the different regions. Section IV examines whether domestic financial
liberalization and capital controls can explain the changing nature of financial cycles. Section V
relates financial liberalization to institutional reform. Section VI concludes.


II. The Evolution of Global Financial Liberalization


        One of the most prolific areas of empirical research in international economics and
finance has been that of the analysis of the effects of controls and financial liberalization on
financial markets, investment, and growth. Surprisingly, in spite of the great interest of several
disciplines on the effects of deregulation of financial markets, the information on the evolution
of financial regulations is still very fragmented.              Below is a brief review of the existing
measures.




7
  Some empirical evidence in the last two decades has undermined the belief in efficient markets. Now many
economists believe that imperfections in asset markets trigger bubbles and protracted and predictable bull and bear
markets. See for example, De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990), Allen and Gorton (1993), and
Allen, Morris, and Postlewaite (1993).


                                                        3
         Information on capital account controls is mostly based on indicators published by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.8 For
the period 1975-1995, this publication reports a single indicator classifying only two capital
account regimes: a “no controls” regime, which includes episodes with full liberalization of the
capital account, and a “controls” regime, which includes both episodes with minor restrictions to
the free flow of capital as well as episodes with outright prohibition of all capital account
transactions. This indicator does not distinguish between controls on capital inflows and controls
on capital outflows. Only in 1996, the IMF began to publish a more comprehensive report on
capital account controls, which still does not capture the intensity of controls.9
         Information on regulations of the domestic financial sector is even more fragmented.
There is no institution compiling systematic cross-country information over time and researchers
have relied on varied sources. One of them is Williamson and Mahar (1998), which dates
liberalization according to five distinct dimensions of financial liberalization: existence of credit
controls, controls on interest rates, entry barriers to the banking industry, government regulation
of the banking sector, and importance of government-owned banks in the financial system. Most
researchers construct their own liberalization chronology. For example, Demirguc-Kunt and
Detragiache (1999) date liberalization for 53 countries since 1980. In that study, liberalization of
the domestic financial sector is interpreted as liberalization of domestic interest rates.
         Information on the liberalization of domestic stock markets is also still quite partial. The
International Financial Corporation (IFC) provides this information just for emerging markets.
Again, this index (as the IMF index for the capital account) only captures two regimes: a
“liberalization” regime and a “restricted” regime. The liberalization dates are determined based
on whether foreigners are allowed to purchase shares of listed companies in the domestic stock
exchange and whether there is free repatriation of capital and remittance of dividends and capital
gains. Others, such as Bekaert and Harvey (2000), construct their own chronologies of stock
market liberalization to date liberalization episodes for emerging markets, using information




8
  See Quinn and Inclan (1997) for an alternative measure.
9
  The new indicators evaluate restrictions on 11 types of capital account transactions: (1) capital market securities,
(2) money market instruments, (3) collective investment securities, (4) derivatives and other instruments, (5)
commercial credits, (6) financial credits, (7) guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities, (8) direct
investment, (9) liquidation of direct investment, (10) real estate transactions, and (11) personal capital movements.


                                                          4
compiled by the IFC and the establishment of new investment vehicles like country funds and
depositary receipts.10
        The existing chronologies share some limitations. One limitation is that they do not
distinguish between different intensities of liberalization/repression. Since deregulation tends to
change slowly, valuable information is lost when the indicators only try to assess whether or not
the liberalization has occurred.11 Another limitation is that most chronologies analyze financial
liberalization episodes as if they were permanent. Still, many countries have undergone several
liberalization reversals, particularly following currency crises.12 Naturally, these limitations call
for a more comprehensive analysis of the various aspects of financial controls.


A. New Measures of Financial Liberalization


        The new measures of financial liberalization introduced in this paper try to overcome part
of the shortcomings of previous chronologies discussed above. Thus, our database captures to
some degree the intensity of financial liberalization episodes as well as episodes of liberalization
reversals. Our chronology also tries to address some of the limitations of the empirical research
on the effects of financial liberalization.           First, most of the empirical research focuses on
emerging markets, perhaps because most concerns are associated with liberalization episodes in
developing countries, with even the most averse critics of capital account liberalization still
supporting the financial deregulation of mature markets. A comprehensive picture of the effects
of financial liberalization requires the analysis of deregulation episodes in both developed and
developing countries, which the new database covers. Second, most of the previous studies
focus on the elimination of controls on just one particular financial sector, be it the capital


10
   There is a very large related literature that studies the extent of financial and economic integration from
observable economic variables, not from government regulations. See, for example, Frankel (2000), Obstfeld and
Rogoff (2001), Edison and Warnock (2002), and Obstfeld and Taylor (2002).
11
   For example, Chile introduces restrictions on capital inflows at the beginning of the 1990s. Controls are
reinforced in the mid-1990s in the midst of the capital inflow episode. In 1998, under the threat of a contagious
speculative attack against the Chilean peso, controls are eliminated. Similarly, domestic financial deregulation may
take several years to be complete. For example, the deregulation of the domestic banking sector in Colombia is
initiated in August 1974. Only in the 1980s, credit controls are finally eliminated.
12
   For example, Argentina implements a broad liberalization of financial markets in 1977, which is later reversed in
1982. Again, in the late 1980s, a new wave of financial liberalization affects the domestic financial sector, the
capital account, and the stock market. This time around the liberalization attempt is longer lasting. Still, again in
2001, in the midst of Argentina’s crisis, the government reintroduces controls on interest rates and restrictions on
capital account transactions.


                                                         5
account, the domestic financial sector, and the stock market. This focus on the opening of just
one financial market may result in a biased picture, since controls in one sector can also affect
the behavior of other parts of the financial system, which may or may not be directly under any
type of restrictions.13 The new chronology deals with the regulations in three sectors.
         The new database includes 28 countries for the period 1973-1999.14 We classify the
sample into four (mostly regional) country groupings: the G-7 countries, which are comprised of
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States; the Asian
region, which includes Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, (South) Korea, Taiwan,
and Thailand; the European group, which excludes those countries that are part of the G-7, and
includes Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden; and the Latin
American sample, which consists of the largest economies in the region, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. We work with these countries due to the
availability of rich data covering both their processes of financial liberalization and the long run
behavior of their stock markets.15
         To capture the liberalization of the capital account, we evaluate the regulations on
offshore borrowing by domestic financial institutions, offshore borrowing by non-financial
corporations, multiple exchange rate markets, and controls on capital outflows. The first two
indicators reflect restrictions on capital inflows. Restrictions on capital inflows can take various
forms, with the most extreme restriction being an outright prohibition to borrow overseas.
Milder controls include restrictions of minimum maturity on capital inflows and non-interest
reserve requirements on foreign borrowing.
         To measure the liberalization of the domestic financial system, we analyze the
regulations on deposit interest rates, lending interest rates, allocation of credit, and foreign-


13
    This problem may be particularly important because the complete deregulation of financial systems is not
accomplished in just one round, and the time span between the deregulation of one market and the elimination of
controls across the board takes, in most cases, several years. For example, the data show that, in the 1970s,
domestic financial repression is widespread not only in emerging markets, but also in several mature financial
markets. Governments start lifting the various restrictions gradually. In many cases, the liberalization reform starts
in the banking sector with the deregulation of domestic interest rates. The elimination of interest rate controls not
only affects the market for bank loans and deposits, but also attracts international capital flows (when these flows
are not strictly prohibited). Also, the stock market flourishes as the extent of credit rationing diminishes.
14
   In fact, since Hong Kong and Taiwan are part of China, the database has fewer countries. Still, for simplicity we
refer to those economies as countries.
15
   Other possible countries were not included in the dataset to make the study feasible, in light of the large amount of
work needed to collect all the data. Nevertheless, we believe that no particular selection bias was introduced in the
process of choosing the countries.


                                                           6
currency deposits. As additional information, we also collect data on reserve requirements. To
set the liberalization dates, we focus mainly on the first two variables, the price indicators.
However, we complement that information with the regulations on the last three variables, those
on quantities, to have a better picture of the degree of repression of the domestic financial sector.
Finally, to track the liberalization of stock markets, we study the evolution of regulations on the
acquisition of shares in the domestic stock market by foreigners, repatriation of capital, and
repatriation of interest and dividends.
        For each sector, the chronology identifies three regimes: “fully liberalized,” “partially
liberalized,” and “repressed.” The criteria used to determine whether the capital account, the
domestic financial sector, and the stock market are fully or partially liberalized, or repressed, are
described in detail in Appendix Table 1. We established these criteria after collecting all the
regulations and carefully studying the range of restrictions adopted throughout countries and
years. We believe that these criteria characterize well the degrees of financial liberalization.
The chronology of restrictions compiled for each country and sector are described in Annex
Table 1. The complete list of references used to construct the chronology is reported in Annex
Table 2.16
        Table 1 reports the dates of partial and full financial liberalization for all the countries in
the sample. The first three columns of dates display the liberalization of the capital account, the
domestic financial sector, and the stock market. The last two columns report dates of partial and
full liberalization taking into account the three sectors analyzed. A country is considered to be
fully liberalized when at least two sectors are fully liberalized and the third one is partially
liberalized. A country is classified as partially liberalized when at least two sectors are partially
liberalized.


B. Pace and Dynamics of Liberalization


        Figures 1-3 and Table 2 summarize the information in Table 1 by displaying the time-
series and cross-sectional variation of liberalization.       Figure 1 plots the index of financial

  The sources of information include the IMF publications Exchange Rate Arrangements and Restrictions and
Recent Economic Developments (country reports), the IFC publication Emerging Markets Database, and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) publication Economic Surveys. We also use




                                                   7
liberalization in emerging and mature markets. This index jointly evaluates the liberalization of
the capital account, the domestic financial sector, and the stock market. It can take values
between one and three, with one indicating fully liberalized and three indicating fully repressed
financial systems. As expected, mature financial markets are on average less regulated. The
index for mature markets averages 1.7 over the sample, while for emerging markets, it averages
2.3. Interestingly, across all regions there is a gradual lifting of restrictions, with the index of
liberalization declining from an initial value of 2.5 for mature markets and 2.9 for emerging
economies to one and 1.2, respectively, toward the end of the sample. Still, there is also a
regional pattern in the dynamics of financial liberalization, with emerging markets suffering
liberalization reversals in the early 1980s, following the debt crisis. In contrast, the pace of
liberalization in mature markets, while also gradual, is uninterrupted.
        Figures 2 and 3 examine separately the sequencing of liberalization of the capital
account, the domestic financial sector, and the stock market. Figure 2 shows the index of
liberalization for each sector for both emerging and mature markets. Stock markets in developed
countries are liberalized earlier, with the index for this sector oscillating around 1.5 in the early
1970s. In contrast, both the domestic financial sector and the capital account tend to be severely
repressed until the early 1980s. In the early 1970s, the indexes for both sectors are on average
above 2.5. Financial markets across the board are heavily repressed in developing countries in
the early 1970s. But in the mid and late 1970s, many emerging economies liberalize the
domestic sector and the capital account. The liberalization reform is short-lived. Controls are
re-imposed in the aftermath of the 1982 debt crisis. Overall, restrictions in stock markets remain
in place until the late 1980s when a liberalization wave occurs in Asia and Latin America.
        While Figure 2 provides information on the average level of restrictions in the various
financial markets in the two regions, it may still mask individual country experiences. For
example, a medium value of the index in one region may reflect that all the countries in that
region are partially liberalized, or that some countries are fully liberalized while the rest of the
countries are completely repressed. Figure 3 presents another perspective of the sequencing of
liberalization across countries. This figure reports the proportion of countries with (at least)
partial liberalization of the capital account, the domestic financial sector, and the stock market,


various reports by the Economist’s Intelligence Unit, the World Bank, annual reports of central banks, as well as
research papers with chronologies on financial market restrictions.


                                                       8
again examined separately for emerging markets and mature markets. By the early 1970s, about
80 percent of stock markets in mature markets are already liberalized. In mature markets, the
liberalization of the domestic financial sector also predates the opening of the capital account,
with about all countries liberalizing, at least partially, the domestic financial sector by the mid
1980s. It is only in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, in part driven by the
movement toward the formation of the European Monetary Union, that capital account
liberalization reaches all mature markets.
       Liberalization follows a different path in emerging markets. Only a small proportion of
countries implement reforms before the early 1970s. This proportion increases in the late 1970s
and then again in the mid and late 1980s. By early 1990s, all the sectors of the financial system
are finally liberalized. There are two episodes of financial liberalization. The first one is in the
late 1970s. In this episode, all the action centers in the domestic sector and the capital account,
with the stock market continuing to be out of the reach for foreign investors. This liberalization
episode ends following the debt crisis in 1982. The second wave of liberalization starts in the
late 1980s. This time around, basically both the domestic sector and the stock market are jointly
deregulated, predating capital account liberalization that only starts in the early 1990s.
       Table 2 examines even further the sequencing of liberalization by analyzing the strategies
and duration of liberalizations in Asia, Europe, G-7 countries, and Latin America. The top two
panels show the proportion of episodes in which the capital account, the domestic financial
sector, or the stock market is liberalized first. The top panel focuses on partial liberalization
episodes, the panel below examines full liberalization episodes. The bottom two panels display
the duration of liberalization episodes; they report the number of months from the time the first
market is deregulated until liberalization is implemented in all markets. The top two panels
reveal that the paths toward financial reform differ across regions.            Basically all the G-7
countries deregulate the stock market first. European countries implement a somewhat mixed
strategy toward deregulation, with 25 percent of the countries liberalizing the domestic financial
sector first and basically all the rest deregulating the stock market first. On the other hand, Latin
American countries overwhelmingly adopt liberalization of the domestic financial sector first,
while Asian countries follow a mixed strategy, with some countries opting for deregulating the
domestic sector first and some others focusing on the stock market first. Capital account
liberalization in all Asian countries is mostly introduced at a latter stage.



                                                   9
           The bottom panels reveal that liberalization reforms take a long time to be completed.
On average, 66 months elapse from the time the first market is liberalized until all markets are
deregulated. Interestingly, the time to completion of the liberalization reform is far longer in
Asia than in Latin America. Finally, liberalization episodes that are first implemented in the
stock market are the ones that become completed the fastest. The variety of experiences in
financial reforms indicates that it is important to examine not just the responses to liberalization
in one particular financial market, but that it is important to examine the effects of the
sequencing of the deregulation reform.


III. Financial cycles


           As discussed above, to understand better the conflicting stylized evidence on the effects
of financial liberalization, it is useful to study the short- and long-run response of financial
markets to deregulation.            This section sets the groundwork to reconcile the evidence by
constructing an anatomy of booms and busts (crashes) in stock markets.


A. Methodology for Identifying Financial Cycles


           There is a long tradition in macroeconomics in analyzing economic fluctuations in terms
of business-cycle phases. Economists have examined the behavior of output in expansions and
recessions, with particular attention to asymmetries in the two phases and to the possible
changing nature of those fluctuations.                For the United States, there is also an “official”
classification of the cycle in expansions and contractions. No similar interest has flourished in
characterizing boom-bust cycles in financial markets. Most studies in financial markets are
focused on examining the relation between dividends, interest rates, and stock prices to evaluate
whether markets are efficient. Other papers analyze the time-varying volatility in financial
markets using ARCH-GARCH models. A third line of research looks at the domestic and global
factors that influence prices.17 In contrast, there seem to be no studies on the behavior of stock
prices over financial cycles. This lack of evidence on the amplitude and duration of booms and



17
     For a review see, for example, Karolyi and Stulz (2002).


                                                           10
busts seems particularly notable in light of the evidence that links booms and busts in credit and
asset prices with financial crises.
        Perhaps, the lack of interest in booms and busts in stock prices steams from the idea that
in efficient markets prices should follow random walk processes.                       In this case, cycles are
meaningless. However, the interest in booms and busts in international financial markets has
been growing, following the performance of stock markets in recent years.18 Also, as Cecchetti,
Lam, and Mark (1990) show, even in efficient markets stock prices can follow mean-reverting
processes, with cycles in the stock market replicating cycles in output. Moreover, cycles could
be magnified by the increasing presence of institutional investors, which tend to follow
momentum-based fads (buying stocks that are past winners and selling past losers), and by the
presence of asymmetric information that leads to herding.19
        This paper concentrates on the fluctuations of stock prices without trying to quantify the
possible imperfections in financial markets. The latter would not be an easy task due to the lack
of agreement about the empirical counterpart to any definition of equilibrium stock prices.
However, while we do not isolate the effects of fundamentals and fads on financial cycles, the
characterization of stock market cycles will allow us to start understanding the behavior of
financial markets.       In particular, we will be able to have a reading on whether financial
liberalization has magnified the boom-bust cycles in financial markets.
        The question now is how to identify historical cycles in stock prices. There is no general
agreement on the techniques to isolate fluctuations of variables at business cycles frequencies.
The first approach was that pioneered by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER).20 The business cycle turning points were identified retrospectively and on an
ongoing basis by the NBER.                 Although initially these turning points were determined
judgmentally, the process can be well approximated by a computer algorithm developed by Bry
and Boschan (1971). The NBER continues to use this methodology to identify what has become
to be known as the official business cycles dating in the United States.21

   See, for example, Tornell and Westermann (2002) and Ventura (2002).
19
   See, for example, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995).
20
   These researchers include Mitchell (1927), Mitchell and Burns (1938), and Burns and Mitchell (1946).
21
   Other researchers of the business cycle have used linear filters to distinguish between the trend and cyclical
components of time series. However, there has not been any agreement on whether variables are trend stationary or
difference stationary or what is the best filter to isolate the fluctuations at different frequencies. As examined in
Stock and Watson (1998), these considerations have led econometricians to find methods that better isolate the


                                                        11
        In this paper, we follow the approach used by the NBER to construct an algorithm that
identifies turning points. We examine stock market fluctuations at intermediate frequencies,
since financial crises tend to follow boom-bust cycles in financial markets of an intermediate
duration, between two and three years. According to Bry and Boschan (1971), the first step in
the determination of cycles is the identification of cyclical turning points. This technique and the
algorithms that we apply look for clearly defined swings in stock market prices in each country.
We work with the same order of duration as business cycles, that is swings that are longer than
two years. This is the only identifying restriction. We are not imposing any other restrictions
such as minimum amplitude of cycles. Essentially, the algorithm isolates local minima and
maxima in a time series, subject to the constraint that the duration of upturns and downturns
cannot be less than 12 months.22
        The cycles we identify would be spurious if stock prices followed random walk
processes. However, there are a number of papers that argue that the null hypothesis of random
walk can be rejected in both developed and developing countries, though the debate is still
open.23 Here, we confirm that conclusion using our methodology, which provides evidence that
the random walk does not capture the basic properties of our data on stock prices. To do so, we
estimate random walks with drift using parameters calculated from the actual data. For each
country, we simulate a specific model 1,000 times. Since some of the series on stock prices do
not span the whole sample, the number of months for each country simulation is the same as the
number of months in the actual data. We then filter the simulated data with the algorithm and
compare the cycles generated by random walk processes and those generated by the actual data.


B. Empirical regularities


        Figure 4 reports monthly log stock price indexes for the 28 countries in the sample.
Stock prices are measured in 1993 U.S. dollars (Appendix Table 2 reports the indexes used as


cyclical component of economic time series with some researches proposing using the Hodrik-Prescott (1997) filter
and others arguing in favor of the Baxter and King’s (1995) band-pass filter.
22
   The algorithm dates contractions and expansions using each country’s stock price series, rather than the de-
trended series. Therefore, busts correspond to sequences of absolute declines in stock prices rather than periods of
slow growth relative to the trend.
23
   See, for example, Fama and French (1988), Lo and MacKinlay (1988), Poterba and Summers (1988), Frennberg
and Hansson (1993), and Urrutia (1995). For a debate on how the results vary according to the sample period, see
Lo and MacKinlay (1999).

well as their sources.).24 Figure 4 also identifies the booms and crashes obtained using the
algorithm described above. The algorithm identifies 146 cycles. The shaded areas denote
expansions. The series show well-defined swings with an average duration of about 44 months.
         Table 3 examines the characteristics of stock cycles in the 28 countries in the sample and
compares them to the behavior of the random walk simulations. This table provides mean values
and tests of whether the differences between the actual and simulated samples are statistically
significant. Columns 2-3 and 5-6 report the mean amplitude and duration of cycles using the
actual and simulated data. Columns 4 and 7 report the significance level of tests of the null
hypothesis that mean cycles from the actual and simulated data are equal. The depth of the
contraction (height of the expansion) is measured as the change between the peak (trough) and
the following trough (peak), as a percent of the mid value of the peak and trough. This measure
puts the amplitude of expansions and contractions on an equal foot. Finally, the duration of a
contraction (expansion) is defined as the number of periods between a peak (trough) and the
following trough (peak).
         According to Table 3, booms across all regions oscillate around 74 percent. The typical
contraction in stock markets is about 61 percent. The data reveal that contractions tend to be
short-lived relative to expansions. The mean duration of contractions is around 18 months, while
the mean duration of expansions is around 26 months and statistically different from the duration
of contractions at all conventional significance levels. From the table, it is clear that there are
significant differences between the amplitude of booms and crashes in the actual data relative to
the one that is observed under the null hypothesis of a random walk. The amplitude of booms
for the actual data is about 15 percent larger than the average amplitude for the simulated data.
Similarly, the average duration of booms for the actual data is about 20 percent longer than the
average duration for the simulated data. Analogous comparisons can be made for contraction
episodes. Again, contractions obtained from the actual data are significantly more protracted
than those obtained from random walk processes.
         To provide another picture of the differences between the actual and simulated data,
Figure 5 reports the frequency distribution of the amplitude and duration of booms and crashes.

24
  As it is common in the international finance and finance literature, we look at stock returns from the point of view
of investors with portfolios comprising assets in various countries. This is why, we study returns in one
international currency. Alternatively, we could have focused on prices in domestic currency deflated by the




                                                         13
The horizontal axis in each figure shows the size or duration of booms and crashes, the vertical
axis shows the frequencies in percent. If stock prices followed a random walk process, the
frequency distribution of the amplitude and duration of each phase of the cycle for the actual and
the simulated data would be equal.           From this figure, it is clear that there are significant
differences in the amplitude and duration of booms and crashes relative to what one would
expect if stock prices followed random walks. Booms and crashes are more pronounced and
protracted than those generated under the null hypothesis of a random walk. Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests are used to evaluate the null hypothesis of equal frequency distributions of the size
and duration of booms and crashes in the actual and random walk data. As shown by the p-value
at the bottom of each panel, we reject the null hypothesis that stock prices follow random walk
processes.
        Figure 6 examines the characteristics of the typical cycle in the four regions. The top
panel reports the mean amplitude and duration of booms and crashes in Asia, Europe, the G-7
countries, and Latin America. The bottom panel plots the typical cycle in each region. The
horizontal axis in the figure records the number of months before and after the peak of the cycle.
The horizontal axis contains 26 months for expansions and 18 months for contractions. These
are the durations of the two phases for the typical cycle in our sample. The vertical axis reports
the value of the stock index. To obtain the typical cycle, the value of the stock index in each
cycle is normalized to 100 at the peak. Each line in this panel represents the average value of the
stock index during the 44 months around the peaks of the four regions.
        Figure 6 shows that cycles are more pronounced in Latin America. On average, the
amplitude of cycles in this region is about twice as large as the amplitude of cycles in the G-7
countries. As expected, the most developed countries, the G-7, have milder stock market cycles,
with the Asian and the other European stock market cycles being of intermediate magnitudes.
The Asian cycles are larger than the European ones. In contrast to the disparities concerning the
amplitude of cycles, the duration of booms and busts is similar across regions, though the ones
from developed countries tend to be longer, making the larger amplitudes for emerging markets
even more striking. This evidence of more pronounced booms and busts in less developed




domestic price index. Our results do not change substantially when using prices in domestic currency from those
discussed in the text.


                                                      14
economies is consistent with the argument presented in Ventura (2002), according to which
bubbles tend to appear in countries with relative low productivity.


IV. Stock market cycles and financial liberalization


        To examine the claim that financial liberalization triggers more protracted and deeper
booms and busts in asset markets, we examine the characteristics of financial cycles during
episodes of financial repression and liberalization. Our first approach is in the event study
tradition, analyzing the behavior of stock markets in the aftermath of liberalization relative to
their functioning in repression times, those years before deregulation occurs. To examine the
conflicting views that liberalization triggers financial excesses but also contributes to less
volatile financial markets, we compare the characteristics of financial cycles in the short run and
long run following liberalization. We then report regression results that control for other factors
and study the sequencing of the openings. Those results examine whether liberalization creates
larger cycles when the first market opens or whether each consecutive opening triggers
substantial increases in booms and crashes.                 The regressions also test whether financial
turbulences are just the product of liberalization episodes that start with opening first the capital
account, the domestic sector, or the stock market.


A. Event Studies


        Figure 7 examines the characteristics of financial cycles around the time of the overall
partial liberalization of financial markets, that is, when at least two sectors are partially
liberalized. We classify financial cycles in three categories, those that occur during repression
times, those that occur in the short run after liberalization, and those that occur in the long run
following liberalization. The short run is defined as the four years after liberalization. The long
run includes the fifth year after liberalization and the years thereafter, conditional on the
deregulation not being reversed.25 The top panel in Figure 7 shows the average amplitude of
booms and crashes for all countries in our sample during repression times (the striped bars), the


25
  Since the choice of the short-run window is ad-hoc, we also examined the robustness of the results to different
definitions of window size. The results for three- and six-year windows are quite similar.


                                                       15
short-run effects of liberalization (the white bars), and the long-run effects of liberalization (the
gray bars). It also reports the characteristics of cycles separately for emerging and mature
markets since the evidence from these two groups of countries might differ. The bottom panel
examines whether the differences of amplitudes across regimes are statistically significant.
         The evidence for the 28 countries in the sample indicates that the amplitude of booms
substantially increases in the immediate aftermath of liberalization (about 20 percent higher than
during repression times). But equity markets stabilize in the long run if liberalization persists,
with the amplitude of booms about 25 percent smaller than in repression times. Similarly, the
amplitude of crashes increases in the immediate aftermath of liberalization (about 15 percent
higher than during repression times), but declines to about 60 percent of its size during
repression times if liberalization persists in the long run. As shown in the bottom panel, these
differences are statistically significant at conventional levels.
         The evidence for the 28 countries, however, obscures important differences across
emerging and mature markets. When examined separately, we note that the short-run effects of
liberalization in emerging markets are more striking, with booms and crashes in the immediate
aftermath of liberalization increasing by about 35 percent over their size during repression. Still,
if liberalization persists, financial cycles become less pronounced, with booms about 30 percent
smaller than during repression times, and crashes about 90 percent of their size during repression
times. On the other hand, the evidence from mature markets indicates that if liberalization
triggers more volatile stock markets in the short run, booms and busts do not increase as much as
in the case of emerging markets. Moreover, on average, crashes do not increase relative to their
value during repression times.      Still, liberalization seems to generate more stable financial
markets in the long run, with crashes averaging only about 60 percent of their size in repression
times.


B. Accounting for domestic and external shocks


         While the evidence in Figure 7 suggests that financial liberalization influences the size of
expansions and contractions in financial markets, stock price fluctuations also reflect changes in
other market fundamentals. For example, stock prices respond to expansions and recessions in




                                                  16
the domestic economy. They also react to world economic conditions.26 The omission of these
variables may bias our results, especially since the timing of liberalization may not be fortuitous.
In fact, we have described in Section I that Latin American countries reintroduce controls on
domestic interest rates and credit and re-impose controls on capital flows following the hikes in
interest rates in industrial countries in the early 1980s. Also, many emerging markets liberalize
their financial markets when international capital flows resume in the late 1980s. Insofar as
countries react to “bad times” by adopting capital controls and to “good times” by relaxing them,
there is the danger that we may ascribe the increase in the size of booms to liberalization and the
amplification of crashes to capital controls, when in fact it is the world market condition the one
fueling changes in stock prices.
        To account for these factors, the event study analysis is complemented with regressions
that control for domestic and world economic conditions. In particular, we examine the role of
growth in domestic and world economic activity and changes in world real interest rates. We
estimate the following equation by least squares with heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors,
                        amplitudei = α ' Χ i + ρ1d ir + β1d isr + λ1d ilr + ε i ,     (1)

where amplitudei is the amplitude of expansion (contraction) i.                     Χi is a matrix of control

variables that includes the change in world real interest rate, the world output growth, and the
domestic output growth during each expansion (contraction). d ir is a dummy variable equal to

one if the cycle occurs during “repression” times, and zero otherwise.                      d isr is a “short-run”

dummy variable equal to one if the cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of financial
liberalization (four-year window), and zero otherwise.                  d ilr is a “long-run” dummy variable

equal to one if the cycle occurs after four years have elapsed from the time of financial
liberalization, and zero otherwise. The world real interest rate is proxied with the U.S. federal
funds real interest rate, world output is the average of the industrial production indexes of the G-
3 countries, and domestic output is captured by the index of industrial production in the domestic
economy. All data come from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
        The results from this estimation are shown in Table 4. As in Figure 7, this table
examines the effects of overall partial financial liberalization (when at least two sectors have

26
  For example, Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993) argue that decreases in U.S. interest rates trigger large
capital flows to emerging markets, which in turn fuel increases in asset prices.


                                                         17
been partially liberalized). As expected, fluctuations in the world interest rate affect stock
market cycles as does output growth, with a one percentage point increase in the world real
interest rate leading to a five percentage point contraction in the amplitude of stock market
expansions. Similarly, booms and crashes in stock markets are also explained by upturns and
recessions in the domestic economy. Even after accounting for these other determinants of
fluctuations in stock prices, financial liberalization still matters. Financial liberalization triggers
larger cycles in the short run and stabilizes financial markets in the long run. Interestingly, once
we control for the state of the economy (domestic and foreign) and for interest rate fluctuations,
the short-run effects of financial liberalization become even more pronounced. For example, in
the immediate aftermath of liberalization, booms increase by about 40 percent in emerging
markets and by 55 percent in mature markets relative to repression times. Similarly, crashes in
emerging markets increase by 30 percent in the immediate aftermath of liberalization vis-à-vis
repression times.
        Note that the results in Figure 7 and Table 4 suggest two tales about the aftermath of
liberalization reforms. While larger booms follow liberalization in both emerging and mature
markets, it is only in emerging markets that crashes are more severe following liberalization.
The average short-run experience in emerging markets seems to support the evidence from the
crisis literature that concludes that liberalization leads to excessive financial booms and crashes.
Liberalization episodes do not seem to bring (on average) this short-run pain to mature markets;
larger booms are not followed by larger crashes, suggesting that larger booms may just reflect
the reduction in the cost of capital once deregulation takes place, as the finance literature
argues.27 Still, financial liberalization brings more stable financial markets in both emerging and
mature market economies in the long run. In Section V, we examine possible explanations for
the varied short-run effects of liberalization as well as for the long-run gains across countries.


C. Sequencing of Liberalization


        So far we have studied the liberalization across all markets. Now we turn to examine
whether the short-run increase in boom-bust amplitudes occurs every time a new sector is


27
  As always averages may hide exceptions, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden suffer financial collapses and
banking crises in the early 1990s following liberalization.


                                                     18
deregulated and whether the sequencing of the openings matters. Table 5 examines whether the
short-run increase in booms and busts occurs every time a new sector is deregulated. We limit
our search to the deregulation of the first two sectors. We define repression times as those
episodes in which all sectors are closed. The short-run liberalization periods are the four years
after the opening of the first sector and the four years after the opening of the second sector. The
long-run liberalization episode includes the fifth year after the opening of the second sector and
the following years if the liberalization reform is not reversed.
       We estimate the following regression,
                     amplitudei = α' Xi + ρ1d ir + β1d isr ,1, 2 + β 2 d isr , 2 + λ1d ilr , 2 + ε i . (2)

The new variable disr ,1, 2 is a dummy variable equal to one if the cycle occurs in the immediate

aftermath of financial liberalization (four-year window after the first sector is deregulated and
four-year window after the second sector is deregulated), and zero otherwise. d isr , 2 is a dummy
variable equal to one if the cycle occurs in the four years after the deregulation of the second
sector, and zero otherwise. d ilr , 2 is a dummy variable equal to one if the cycle occurs after four

years have elapsed from the time of the liberalization of the second sector, and zero otherwise.
Thus, the average amplitude of booms (crashes) in the aftermath of the first opening is captured
by β1 , while that of the second market opening is captured by β1 + β 2 .
       While the evidence on short- and long-run effects of financial liberalization is not
reversed, the focus on the first and second openings reveals some important differences.
Interestingly, the increase in the amplitude of booms is similar following the first and second
opening, but crashes in the immediate aftermath of the first opening are smaller than those
observed during repression times. The amplitude of crashes in emerging markets only increases
following the opening of the second sector. Again, this evidence is consistent with the results
from the crisis literature, which finds that booms of credit persist for several years following the
deregulation of financial markets with these booms in turn fueling protracted bull markets.
       Table 6 examines the effects on financial markets of various types of sequencing of the
deregulation process. We estimate the following regression,
      amplitudei = α' X i + ρ1d ir + β1d isr ,1, 2 + β 2 d isr , 2 + β 3d iCA + β 4 d iSM + λ1d ilr , 2 + ε i .   (3)

The variables d iCA and d iSM help to capture the possible differential effect on booms and crashes

of opening respectively the capital account and the stock market first. These dummy variables


                                                               19
are equal to one if the cycle occurs during the four years after that particular sector is liberalized,
and zero otherwise. The average amplitude of booms (crashes) in the aftermath of the first
opening, when the liberalization reform is initiated with the deregulation of the domestic
financial sector, is captured by β1 . If the liberalization reform starts with the opening of the
capital account (stock market), the amplitude of booms or crashes in the four years after the first
opening is captured by β 1 + β 3 (β 1 + β 4 ) .
        Our results indicate that the ordering of liberalization does not matter in general.
Opening the capital account or the stock market first does not have a different effect than
opening the domestic financial sector first. But one exception exists; crashes seem to be larger in
emerging markets if the capital account opens up first. This might provide some mild support to
the usual claim that the capital account should be opened last.
        In sum, our results suggest that we gain from examining the effects of deregulation of
different sectors. In particular, we find that crashes become more pronounced not at the onset of
the liberalization reform but after some years have elapsed. Interestingly, the sequencing of
financial liberalization does not seem to matter when evaluating the effects on financial cycles.
Finally, as also shown in the previous section, the experiences of mature and emerging markets
look different in the aftermath of financial liberalization. We analyze these differences next.


V. Financial liberalization and institutional reform


        Our findings necessarily provoke several questions. What is the essential ingredient for
more stable financial markets in the long run? Is it just financial liberalization? Or, does
liberalization trigger some other changes that in turn deliver more stable financial markets in the
long run? Can we explain the differences in the aftermath of financial liberalization in mature
and emerging markets? And, is it possible to avoid the short-run pain following liberalization?
        These questions have generated an intense debate on the sequencing of liberalization and
institutional reform.28   29
                               Many have argued that it is very risky to open up financial systems.


28
   There is a related literature that studies the link between capital controls and institutions. See, for example,
Alesina, Grilli, and Milesi-Ferretti (1993).
29
   Note that the sequencing mentioned here discusses the optimal order between financial liberalization and other
financial sector reforms. While the sequencing mentioned in the previous section deals with the order of
liberalization of the stock market, the domestic financial sector, and the capital account.


                                                        20
During financial repression, banks tend to have poor balance sheets.30 Protected from outside
competition, badly regulated, and badly supervised banks do not have the pressure to run
efficiently. Liberalization in this scenario unveils a new problem, as protected domestic banks
suddenly get access to new sources of funding, triggering protracted financial booms. Moreover,
financial liberalization brings competition and lowers bank profits, eroding banks’ franchise
values and lowering their incentive for making good loans. Naturally, this worsens problems of
moral hazard.31 Based on these views, a standard recommendation on sequencing is to first clean
up domestic financial institutions and change government institutions, then deregulate the
industry and open up the capital account.
        This discussion about sequencing may be irrelevant if the timing is such that reforms
never predate liberalization, with institutional changes happening mostly as a result of financial
deregulation. To shed new light on this sequencing debate, we collect data on the quality of
institutions as well as data on the laws governing the proper functioning of financial systems.
Then, we compare the timing of financial liberalization and institutional reforms. The data on
the quality of institutions is captured by the index of law and order.32 To better assess the
functioning of the financial system, we use information on the existence and enforcement of
insider trading laws, constructed by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002). Appendix Table 3 reports
the time of improvement in the law and order index, the time when the insider trading law is
passed, and the time when insider trading starts to be prosecuted.                    We characterize as an
improvement in the quality of government institutions when the index of law and order increases
by one unit and this change is maintained for at least two years.
        The top panel in Table 7 examines the sequencing of liberalization and reform in our
sample of 28 countries. It shows the probabilities that financial liberalization occurs conditional
on reforms having already been implemented. In particular, we look at whether reforms to
institutions occur prior to the partial or full liberalization of the financial sector. If governments
clean up financial institutions and improve the quality of institutions prior to deregulating the
financial sector, one would expect this probability to be close to one.


30
   This is shown, for example, in Rojas-Suarez and Weisbrod (1994).
31
   See Akerlof and Romer (1993) and Hellman, Murdok, and Stiglitz (2000).
32
   This index is published in the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). The law sub-index assesses the strength
and impartiality of the legal system, while the order sub-index assesses the popular observance of the law. Each
index can take values from one to three, with lower scores for less tradition for law and order.


                                                       21
        The evidence for emerging and mature markets displayed in Table 7 suggests that
reforms to institutions occur mostly after liberalization is implemented. For example, in the case
of emerging markets, in only 18 percent of the cases, law and order improves prior to the partial
liberalization of financial markets. Also, while in 62 percent of the cases, the laws prosecuting
insider trading exist prior to partial financial liberalization, insider trading starts to be prosecuted
in only 11 percent of the cases before the partial deregulation of the financial sector.
Interestingly, law and order improves substantially following partial liberalization. By the time
the financial sector becomes fully liberalized, the quality of institutions, as measured by the law
and order index, has improved in 64 percent of the cases. Also, insider trading prosecution is
enforced in 44 percent of the cases before the full liberalization of the financial sector.
        This evidence casts doubts on the notion that governments tend to implement institutional
reforms before they start deregulating the financial sector.         On the contrary, the evidence
suggests that partial liberalization fuels institutional reforms. The evidence for mature markets is
less compelling. Still, insider trading prosecution is only enforced in 17 percent of the cases
prior to the partial liberalization of the financial sector, but in this case, in 44 percent of the
cases, institutions improve prior to the full liberalization of the financial sector. Again, both
indicators show that reforms continue following partial liberalization.
        There are several reasons that can explain why financial liberalization might prompt
institutional reforms. First, as discussed in Rajan and Zingales (2001), well-established firms
may oppose reforms that promote financial development because it breeds competition. These
firms can even be hurt by financial development as financial development implies better
disclosure rules and enforcement (reducing the importance of these firms’ collateral and
reputation) and permits newcomers to enter and compete away profits.                We can add that
incumbents may oppose the removal of capital controls as capital can flow away to more
attractive destinations, limiting their sources of funds. However, opposition may be weaker in
the presence of worldwide abundance of trade and cross-border flows. In these times, free
access to international capital markets will allow the largest and best-known domestic firms to
tap foreign markets for funds, with the support for financial liberalization becoming stronger.
But financial liberalization sows the seeds of destruction of the old protected and inefficient
financial sector, as foreign and domestic investors (now with access to international capital
markets) require better enforcement rules.



                                                  22
          Second, as mentioned before, the liberalization and the gradual integration of emerging
markets with international financial markets by itself may help to fortify the domestic financial
sector.    Foreign investors have overall better skills and information and can thus monitor
management in ways local investors cannot. Liberalization, moreover, allows firms to access
mature capital markets. Firms listing on foreign stock markets are also in the jurisdiction of a
superior legal system and have higher disclosure standards.
          Third, the integration with world markets and institutions tends to speed up the reform
process to achieve a resilient financial system. Capital markets can help supervise domestic
financial institutions, imposing stricter market discipline, increasing transparency and the
diffusion of information, and even pushing governments into guaranteeing that its financial
system is well supervised and regulated.33
          To have a sense of the effects of changes in institutions on financial booms and busts, we
estimate the following regression,
            amplitudei = α 'Χ i + ρ1d ir + β1d isr + λ1d ilr + τ 1d iL & O + τ 2 d iITA + τ 2 d iITE + ε i .   (4)
This regression is the same as regression (1) but also evaluates the possible effects of changes in
government institutions. d iL & O is a dummy variable equal to one if the boom (crash) occurs

when the law and order index has improved or it is at its highest level, and zero otherwise. diITA
is a dummy variable equal to one if the boom (crash) occurs following the approval of the law
prosecuting insider trading, and zero otherwise. d iITE is a dummy variable equal to one if the

boom (crash) occurs when insider trading prosecution is enforced and zero otherwise.
          The results are also reported in Table 7. Note that improvements in the law and order
index trigger more stable financial markets, with the amplitude of booms and crashes declining
about 18 and 9 percentage points, respectively. This evidence provides one possible explanation
of why mature markets, with better government institutions, do not experience the larger crashes
observed in emerging markets in the aftermath of liberalization.34

VI. Conclusions


        This paper presented a new approach to understand the effects of financial liberalization
by introducing a novel database on liberalization and by focusing on booms and busts in stock
market prices. Our main results can be summarized as follows.
        First, our chronology of financial liberalization indicates that domestic and international
financial liberalization is a process in which different types of restrictions are removed over time.
Moreover, while liberalization has been an uninterrupted process in most mature markets, it has
been characterized by reversals in emerging markets, in which capital controls and restrictions
are at times reintroduced. We also found that the pattern of liberalization varies across regions,
with developed countries liberalizing first their stock markets and developing economies opening
first their domestic financial sector.
        Second, with regard to the possible changing nature of financial cycles, our analysis
showed that stock market booms and busts have not intensified in the long run after financial
liberalization. In fact, despite the claim that financial integration leads to volatile capital markets
around the world, stock market cycles become less pronounced after liberalization. Still, in the
short run, we found that financial liberalization does tend to trigger larger cycles. Interestingly,
the short-run effects of liberalization vary across mature and emerging markets. The evidence
from emerging markets, with larger booms and crashes in the immediate aftermath of
liberalization, provides some support to the arguments of excessive financial cycles following
liberalization. In contrast, the evidence from mature markets, with larger bull markets but less
pronounced bear markets in the aftermath of deregulation, supports the view that liberalization is
beneficial even in the short run.
        Third, to explain the contrasting short- and long-run effects of financial liberalization, we
explored the dynamics of liberalization and institutional reform. We collected information on
the quality of institutions as well as data on the laws governing the functioning of the financial
system. The evidence suggests that institutional reforms do not predate liberalization. Most of
the times, government reforms are implemented within a few years after the partial opening of
financial markets.     As the quality of institutions improves, financial cycles become less
pronounced. Perhaps due to lack of correct incentives, countries do not tend to improve their
financial systems before liberalization, disregarding the typical policy prescriptions.



                                                  24
       To conclude, this paper opened several avenues for future research. First, the new dataset
will allow researchers to understand better the link between financial liberalization and financial
development, investment, and growth. Second, the richness of the data will allow researchers to
better comprehend the channels through which financial deregulation impacts economies. Third,
more research on whether financial liberalization can be a first step to institutional reforms
would be welcome. Last but not least, the relation between financial liberalization and reforms
leaves unanswered the question of whether countries can deregulate financial systems without
becoming vulnerable to crises.

This table reports the dates of partial and full liberalization of financial markets. The first three columns provide information by sector: capital account, domestic financial sector, and
the stock market. The last two columns provide information on an integral measure of financial liberalization. The dates are based on the criteria displayed in Appendix Table 1. A
country is considered to be fully liberalized when at least two sectors are fully liberalized and the third one is partially liberalized. A country is considered to be partially liberalized if
at least two sectors are partially liberalized. Otherwise, the country is considered to be financially repressed. If there is no information about the month of liberalization, we use January
(December) if the corresponding report indicates that liberalization is implemented at the beginning (end) of the year. "-" followed by a blank means that it covers the period until June
1999. Pre 73 (Pre 73p) means that the sector is already fully (partially) liberalized at that time, with no significant measures taken at that date.

The table shows the average amplitude and duration of booms and crashes in stock prices for the actual data and for the simulated data,
under null hypothesis that stock prices follow a random-walk process. The stock market indexes start in January 1975 and end in June 1999.
The filter used identifies 146 stock market cycles. To estimate the average amplitude of booms and crashes under the null hypothesis of a
random walk, we first estimate a random walk with drift model for each country. We simulate those models 1,000 times. Since the stock
market series for several countries do not span the whole sample, the length of the simulated random walk series for each country is the
same as the length of the actual series. Amplitude is expressed in percent, calculated as a deviation from the mid point between the peak and
the trough. Duration is expressed in months. Standard errors are in parentheses.

The top panel shows regressions of the amplitude of booms (crashes) in stock markets on changes in the world real interest rate, world output growth, domestic output growth, a
dummy for "repression" effects, a dummy for "short-run liberalization" effects, and a dummy for "long-run liberalization" effects. The bottom panel reports hypothesis tests on
the regression coefficients. A country is considered to be partially liberalized if at least two sectors are partially liberalized. Otherwise, the country is considered to be financially
repressed. The change in world real interest rate, the change in world output, and the change in domestic output are growth rates from the beginning to the end of the
corresponding boom or crash. "Repression" is a dummy variable equal to one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs during repression times, and zero otherwise. "Short-run
liberalization" is a dummy variable that equals one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of partial financial liberalization (four-year window),
and zero otherwise. "Long-run liberalization" is a dummy variable equal to one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs after four years have elapsed from the time of the partial
financial liberalization, and zero otherwise. Standard errors are in brackets. *, **, *** mean significance at 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively.

This table analizes whether the sucessive liberalizations of the three sectors trigger more unstable financial markets (larger booms and crashes) in the short run. The top panel
shows regressions of the amplitude of booms (crashes) in stock markets on the change in the world real interest rate, world output growth, domestic output growth, a dummy for
"repression" effects, two dummies for "short-run liberalization" effects, and a dummy for "long-run liberalization" effects. The change in world real interest rate, the change in
world output, and the change in domestic output are growth rates from the beginning to the end of the corresponding boom or crash. "Repression" is a dummy variable equal to
one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs during repression times, and zero otherwise. "Short-run liberalization sector one and two" is a dummy variable that equals one if
the particular phase of the cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of financial liberalization of the first or second sectors (four-year window), and zero otherwise. "Short-run
liberalization sector two" is a dummy variable that equals one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of financial liberalization of the second sector
(four-year window), and zero otherwise. "Long-run liberalization" is a dummy variable that equals one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs after four years have elapsed
from the time of financial liberalization of the second sector, and zero otherwise. The bottom panel reports hypothesis tests on the regression coefficients. "Short-run

This table shows whether the short-run effects of liberalization depend on which sector is deregulated first. The top panel shows regressions of the amplitude of booms
(crashes) in stock markets on changes in the world real interest rate, world output growth, domestic output growth, a dummy for "repression" effects, two dummies for "short-
run liberalization" effects, a dummy for the capital account opening if this is the first sector to open, a dummy for the stock market opening if this is the first sector to open,
and a dummy for "long-run liberalization" effects. The change in world real interest rate, the change in world output, and the change in domestic output are growth rates from
the beginning to the end of the corresponding boom or crash. "Repression" is a dummy variable equal to one if the particular phase of a cycle occurs during repression times,
and zero otherwise. "Short-run liberalization sector one and two" is a dummy variable that equals one if the particular phase of a cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of
financial liberalization of the first and second sectors (four-year window), and zero otherwise. "Short-run liberalization sector two" is a dummy variable that equals one if the
particular phase of the cycle occurs in the immediate aftermath of financial liberalization of the second sector (four-year window), and zero otherwise. "Long-run
liberalization" is a dummy variable that equals one if the particular phase of the cycle occurs after four years have elapsed from the time of financial liberalization of the
second sector, and zero otherwise. "First sector to open: capital account (stock market)" is a dummy variable equal to one if the first sector to open is the capital account
(stock market), and zero otherwise. The bottom panel reports hypothesis tests on the regression coefficients. "Short-run liberalization domestic financial sector (capital
account/stock market)" corresponds to the test of the null hypothesis that opening first the domestic financial sector (capital account/stock market) does not trigger larger
booms and crashes relative to repression times or long-run liberalization, alternatively. If the stock market is liberalized before 1973, only the capital account and the

Panel A shows the probability of financial liberalization conditional on the existence and enforcement of insider trading
laws and on the dummy for law and order. Panel B reports the regression reported in Table 4 with the inclusion of the
institutional variables: law and order, existence of insider trading laws, and enforcement of insider trading laws. "Law and
order" is a dummy variable that equals one in periods in which there is a "permanent" improvement in the International
Country Risk Guide's index of law and order or the index is at its highest level. The improvement periods in this index are
characterized by at least one point increase in the index from its two-year period average, and the maintainance of the index
above this average for at least another two years. "Insider trading laws" are dummy variables that equal one after the
existence or enforcement of those laws. The data come from Bhattacharya and Daouk (2000). See Appendix Table 3.
Standard errors are in brackets. *, **, *** mean significance at 10, 5, and 1 percent, respectively.

Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for equality of distribution functions: P-value 0.18

The figures report the frequency distribution of the amplitude and duration of booms and crashes for the actual and simulated
data, assuming random walk processes with drift. The horizontal axis in each figure shows the size or the duration of booms
and crashes, the vertical axis shows the frequencies in percent. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to evaluate the null
hypothesis of equality of the frequency distribution of the amplitude and duration of booms and crashes in the actual and
generated data.

The table and figure show the average cycle per region. The sample starts in January 1975
and ends in June 1999. The total number of cycles per region is as follows: 28 for Asia; 35
for Europe; 44 for G-7; and 39 for Latin America. In the top panel, duration is expressed in
months while amplitude is expressed in percent; it is calculated as a deviation from the mid
point between the peak and the trough.

The figure shows the average amplitude of booms and crashes in the different periods and markets (mature and emerging). The table shows hypothesis tests of equality of booms and
crashes during repression times and after liberalization. The repression period occurs when less than two sectors are partially liberalized. The short-run liberalization period is defined
as the immediate aftermath of partial financial liberalization (four-year window), and zero otherwise. The long-run liberalization period occurs after four years have elapsed from the
time of the partial financial liberalization.

Column (1) reports the dates in which there is a "permanent" improvement in the International Country Risk Guide's index of law
and order. In this index, law and order are assessed separately, with each sub-component comprising zero to three points. The law
sub-component is an assessment of the strength and impartiality of the legal system, while the order sub-component is an
assessment of popular observance of the law. The improvement periods in this index are characterized by at least one point increase
in the index from its two-year period average, and the maintainance of the index above this average for at least another two years.
This column also shows those countries for which the index of law and order was at its highest level during all the sample. "No
change" corresponds to no permanent changes in the index. Columns (2) and (3) come from Bhattacharya and Daouk (2000). The
columns report, respectively, the dates when insider trading laws are aproved and when the first prosecution under these laws
occurs. The authors surveyed stock market participants and national regulators to obtain the answers. "n/a" means not available.
"No" means that there is no enforcement of insider trading laws.
