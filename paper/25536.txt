Narratives about Technology-Induced Job Degradations Then and Now

                                           ABSTRACT

Concerns that technological progress degrades job opportunities have been expressed over much
of the last two centuries by both professional economists and the general public. These concerns
can be seen in narratives both in scholarly publications and in the news media. Part of the
expressed concern about jobs has been about the potential for increased economic inequality. But
another part of the concern has been about a perceived decline in job quality in terms of its effects
on monotony vs creativity of work, individual sense of identity, power to act independently, and
meaning of life. Public policy should take account of both of these concerns, inequality and job
quality.

Fears about the effects of labor-saving machines on our jobs, as these machines replace many

tasks, have a long history. The fears are expressed both in professional writings of economists

and in popular stories. We here give a brief history of narratives expressing these fears and

briefly consider the relevance of such narratives for public policy.

       The term “narrative” is often used as a synonym for “story,” a sequence of events. But

the word narrative has an important other aspect. A narrative is a telling of a story, that attaches

meaning and significance to it, that often is intended as providing a lesson or a moral. A

narrative can become an interpretation of ongoing events by comparing them with a story. With

economic narratives, the narrative may represent a proto-economic model, understandable by the

most general public.

       Especially important among narratives are those about our life’s work—our jobs. While

people in jobs of low prestige may not express much delight in telling the story of their life of

work, it is a story they think about and that defines their contribution to loved ones and to

society.

       In my 2017 American Economic Association presidential address Narrative Economics,

and in a forthcoming book with the same name, I have been arguing that it is important for

economists to appreciate the popular economic narratives that go viral, that come and go

according to epidemiological patterns. Just as a disease, an economic narrative, a story that is

connected to things that matter in the economy, rises like an epidemic to influence a large

fraction of the population. The epidemic alters their economic actions and their voting. It then

influences government economic policy, and also drives economic fluctuations. During the

                                                  3
growth phase of the narrative epidemic, the contagion rate has to be above the forgetting rates,

allowing the narrative to grow in influence. Eventually the narrative fades away, after the

contagion rate falls below the forgetting rate. Then the narrative may mutate, as viruses do, and

another epidemic may return again, and again.

       In this paper I will present a brief history of thought on both professional and public

narratives related to the effects of machines replacing jobs. The immediate concern most

expressed is that one will lose a job altogether, resulting in poverty and unemployment. But the

spell of unemployment may not be the dominant concern. There is also the fear that the resulting

eventual job switch will be to a job that is demeaning.

       In a psychologically healthy environment, narratives establish honored membership in

community. Everyone wants to be loved. Everyone feels a deep need to be part of a community

that at the very least respects one’s contribution. Narratives about jobs are among the most vivid,

since we tend to spend most of our lives working in the market economy and to define ourselves

in terms of our work there.


Ancient Religious and Philosophical Narratives about Work

       In the book Ecclesiastes, in the Bible, written between 400 BCE and 180 BCE, a concept

of meaning in work is laid out in vivid poetry:

    III-1There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven. a time
    to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, . . .
    V-11 As goods increase, so do those who consume them, and to what benefit are they to
    the owner except to feast his eyes on them?
    V-18 Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find
    satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has
    given him—for this is his lot. 1



                                                  4
The book Ecclesiastes in its New International translation uses the word “meaning” or

“meaningless” repeatedly. (The King James translation used the word “vanity” or “vanities”.) It

is a book about the meaning of life. In fact, the opening line of Ecclesiastes is

    “’I-2 Meaningless! Meaningless!’ says the Teacher. ‘Utterly meaningless! Everything
    is meaningless’.”

But that was an expression of despair, and the book comes around to finding meaning in day-to-

day work.

    The religious narrative is not absent even for people who do not go to church, temple or

Mosque at all, transmitted by ordinary talk, or in news or songs or plays. Work is as inevitable as

the changing seasons or the life cycle. Consumption of goods beyond what is necessary may be

meaningless. Toilsome labor is not onerous because it is part of our life story.

       Economists are accustomed to writing utility functions that depend positively on

consumption of goods and negatively on labor supplied. But poems like the above are suggesting

something very different.

        This Ecclesiastes poem has a long history, I would say a long epidemic, the poem is

contagious. It generates new epidemics from time to time, like a disease mutation starting a new

epidemic. In the late 1950s, the folk singer Pete Seeger wrote a song, entitled “Turn, Turn, Turn”

that took the opening words from Ecclesiastes III above. It became a number one hit on the

Billboard Top 100 when it was recorded by The Byrds in 1965, got further impetus with Judy

Collins in 1969, Emmylou Harris, yet other singers, and in plays and movies.

       The protestant revolution, the Reformation, starting in the year 1517, was associated with

a renegade Catholic monk, Martin Luther. Luther emphasized that every person has a Beruf, a

calling, denying the then-extant emphasis on martyrdom. According to Luther, the work one
                                                  5
does has religious significance, and is deep with meaning about one’s identity and purpose in

life. One’s work is not just one’s lot in life, it is a source of inspiration.

        A secular account of the pleasure in work is revealed in personal accounts of the meaning

of work—placing the work as part of a life story. These longstanding concerns about the

meaning of work continue today. The concerns about loss of meaning were expressed long

before the appearance of significant labor-saving machines and continue today even beyond

concerns about such machines. Changes in business procedures to routinize and standardize jobs,

reduce the jobs to narrow tasks that machines cannot do yet, may have serious effects on the

meaning of work.

        For example, the advent of chain stores, whose very beginnings can also be traced back

to the 19th or even the 18th century, seems to stir up the same feelings of loss of meaning. Such

“Formula businesses” are in many cases banned by local communities, who do not want to see

their unique spirit invaded by standardized and vulgarized businesses.




Narratives during the Eighteenth Century and the Industrial Revolution

Early indications of public concerns about the modern degradation of job quality may not have

mentioned machines at all, though one suspects that the advent of the industrial revolution

played a real role. A 1785 farmer, in an article written for the Connecticut Courant, the ancestor

of today’s Hartford Courant, describes his wondering if he should leave the farm and become a

part of the more exciting urban environment. It is a narrative about the meaning of life, also a

scene of happiness, though maybe not the same as joy in the repetitive tasks themselves. He

describes a farm that seems to be comprised of only him and his wife, and a happy scene:


                                                    6
           When young I entertained some thoughts of selling my farm. I thought it
    afforded but a dull repetition of the same labours and pleasures. I thought the former
    tedious and heavy, the latter few and insipid; but when I came to consider myself as
    divested of my farm, I then found the world so wide, and every place so full, that I
    began to fear lest there would be no room for me. 2
His narrative includes scenes of simple pleasures on the farm:

            My wife would often come with her knitting in her hand, and sit under the shady
    trees, praising the straightness of my furrows, and the docility of my horses; this
    swelled my heart and made every thing light and pleasant, and I regretted I had not
    married before. 3
He also asserted that his farming was a statement of mastery and freedom:

            The instant I enter on my own land, the bright idea of property, of exclusive
    right, of independence, exalts my mind. Precious soil, I say to myself, by what singular
    custom of law is it that thou wast made to constitute the riches of the freeholder? What
    should we American farmers be without the distinct possession of that soil? 4
He does not mention labor-saving machinery in this piece, though his perceptions of life in the

city might already show some influence from that. But one can imagine from what he says that

he would not entirely welcome a machine that makes his plowing unnecessary.

       The idea of robots got a firm foothold in the public imagination in the eighteenth century,

though the word “robot” was not to come until the twentieth century. A Google Ngrams search

shows that books referred to them as “automatons,” starting in the late 18th century, and this term

saw another variation, “automation” in the second half of the twentieth century. The word

“creativity” took hold toward the end of the twentieth century, perhaps in reaction to these

supposedly intelligent humanoid machines who lacked it.

       In 1769 the renowned inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen produced “The Turk,” a chess-

playing robot in the form of a dummy in Turkish clothing seated attached to a large cabinet filled

with machinery, on top of which was a chessboard. Visitors were invited to open the doors to the

cabinet and look inside, where they saw some machinery. The device was designed so that a

                                                 7
complex mechanism obscured their view so that they could not see that there was a man, a chess

master, hiding inside. A system of magnets allowed the hidden man underneath the chessboard to

see the positions of the pieces on the chessboard, and a system of controls allowed him to move

the arms of the automaton, and thus to move the chess pieces. The machine played chess

brilliantly, defeating both Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The popularity of the

word “automaton” begins with the von Kempelen narrative and lasts to the present day. Did

people believe the machine was real? Their willingness to believe was enhanced since von

Kempelen was also a renowned inventor, and his apparatus was cleverly done. Probably many

did believe, but skepticism was also rampant, since they could not see how such a machine could

possibly work.

       The invention of the water-powered roller gin by Joseph Eve in 1788 and of the cotton

gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 began to draw attention to the loss of jobs that might be occasioned

by new machines. The new machines removed the seeds from cotton bolls so that they could be

spun into cotton for cloth. The gin was vastly quicker than the hand-picking at the seeds that

preceded it. This development occasioned some concern that the new machines would depress

the price of slaves in the southern United States, since it would replace one of their main

occupations.

       One would think that if these machines were replacing manual labor, there would surely

be concern expressed for the investment value of slaves. A search for articles about the price of

slaves and labor-saving machinery produced only a little. Many years after the 18th century, The

Picayune in New Orleans, a precursor after merger with the Times-Democrat to today’s Times

Picayune there, wrote in 1859, just before the American Civil War that resulted in the

emancipation of the slaves, referring to a northern newspaper article:

                                                 8
             The Philadelphia American and Gazette gets off a theory, in its peculiar style, to
    the effect that the South is opposed to labor saving machinery because “saving labor
    depreciates the slave.” It is mistaken, both in the fact and the reason. It was not a fact
    that the South has an antipathy to labor saving machinery, nor is it true that “steam as
    the slave and ingenuity as its driver” reduces the value of black labor of the slave
    States. 5
The fact that slave prices were generally increasing right up to the Civil War has recently

been called the “Cotton Gin Paradox. 6 Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman added another

element to the paradox, that slave prices should have been depressed as the abolitionist fury

gained strength as the 19th century progressed, up to the Civil War, which should have

shown an increasing probability that the slaves would be freed. 7

       Some of the earliest mechanization examples were threshing machines, which separated

wheat from chaff. Andrew Meikle invented a celebrated thresher in 1786, which offered to

replace a major task on traditional farms. It was powered by horses. The horse-powered

machines led to a view of mechanization that suggested that at issue was the replacement of

people by horses.

       Thomas Paine was an extremely important thinker. In the context of the American

Revolution, his book Common Sense, which appeared in early 1776, was a huge bestseller by

July when the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed. Less well remembered is his book

Agrarian Justice 1797. He was worried already about the superfluity of labor, but not so much in

the context of labor-saving machines, a concept he does not mention. But his model of the world

was that of a single limiting constraint in an agricultural economy: land. His references to land

are akin to the references to robots today. Who owns the land was the winner, instead of who

owns the robots.




                                                 9
       Thomas Paine wasn’t describing the world of the future, he was describing the world of

time immemorial, when labor was, in his view, already largely redundant, already in poverty. He

did not seem to think of labor as a factor of production, but as merely a moral obligation to

society. He advocated a sort of universal basic income to be given to everyone.




Nineteenth Century Economists’ Narratives

Following the Luddite riots in 1811, economists began to be thinking about the effects of labor-

saving machinery on the price of labor. In his 1821 third edition to his On the Principles of

Economics and Taxation, ten years after the Luddite rebellion, David Ricardo added a “Chapter

XXXI: On Machines.” 8 In that new chapter he said that he had made a mistake on the impact of

labor-saving machines on human society:

    My mistake arose from the suggestion, that whenever the net income of a society
    increased, its gross income would also increase. I now, however, see reason to be
    satisfied that the one fund, from which landlords and capitalists derive their revenue,
    may increase, while the other, that upon which the laboring class mainly depend, may
    diminish, and therefore it follows, if I am right, that the same cause which may increase
    the net revenue of the economy, may at the same time render the population redundant,
    and deteriorate the condition of labourers. 9
Ricardo gives an example of what might happen if new machinery allows the more effective use

of horses. Then, capitalist farmers might substitute horses for hired men, and divert the resources

for feeding the men to feeding the increased population of horses, with a consequential hardship

for men. This is the flipside of Wassily Leontief’s famous comparison of men with horses in the

twentieth century, observing that mechanization has finally eliminated most of the need for

horses, with the result that the population of horses has shrunk drastically, horses sent to the

slaughterhouse. 10




                                                 10
        Alfred Marshall in his 1890 first edition of the textbook Principles of Economics, in a

chapter on the division of labor tied the advent of laborsaving machines with the standardization

of tasks:

    We are thus led to a general rule, the action of which is more prominent in some
    branches of manufactures than others, but which applies to all. It is, that any
    manufacturing operation that can be reduced to uniformity, so that exactly the same
    thing has to be done over and over again in the same way, is sure to be taken over
    sooner or later by machinery. 11
He discussed the monotony of such work, but said it is not necessarily contrary to happiness:
    Monotony of Work is an Evil of the First Order Only When It Involves Monotony of
    Life. . .The social surroundings of factory life stimulate mental activity in and out of
    working hours, and many factory workers, whose occupations are seemingly the most
    monotonous, have considerable intelligence and mental resources. 12
Marshall in this same textbook anticipates the frequently expressed modern view that machinery

replaces tasks for labor, but creates new tasks, which Acemoglu and Restrepo have called the

“displacement effect” and the “reinstatement effect.” Marshall anticipates these effects in his

1890 textbook:

    Thus machinery constantly supplants and renders unnecessary that purely manual skill,
    the attainment of which was, even up to Adam Smith’s time, the chief advantage of
    division of labour. But this influence is more than countervailed by its tendency to
    increase the scale of manufactures and to make them more complex; and therefore to
    increases the opportunities for division of labour of all kinds, and especially in the
    matter of business management.” 13
The same idea has also been expressed quite recently by David Autor, a labor economist, who

puts the current situation into perspective after centuries of worry about machines replacing jobs:

“Why hasn’t automation already wiped out employment for the vast majority of workers?” was

the title of a 2016 paper. His answer: “Tasks that cannot be substituted by automation are

generally complemented by it.” 14




                                                11
       But note that this principle that automation creates jobs is not a theorem in basic

economics. It could be otherwise, and manual labor could see its fortunes collapse, just as

Ricardo insisted.




Twentieth to Twenty-First Centuries Narratives

       The word “robot” finally entered the languages of the world in 1920 with the play

Rossum’s Universal Robots by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek. This play coined the word

robot, from the Czech word for slave. The play was translated from Czech to English and

became a hit in English-speaking countries, eventually, and spread to much of the world. The

word robot then entered most of the languages of the world. The story depicted a company,

headed by a Mr. Domin, that had started producing and selling robots, an invention of Mr.

Rossum:

                                             Domin
    What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical point of view?
                                             Helena
    Perhaps the one who is most honest and hardworking.
                                             Domin
    No; the one that is the cheapest. The one whose requirements are the smallest. Young
    Rossum invented a worker with the minimum amount of requirements. He had to
    simplify him. He rejected everything that did not contribute directly to the progress of
    work!—everything that makes man more expensive. In fact, he rejected man and made
    the Robot. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically they are more
    perfect than we are, they have an enormously developed intelligence, but they have no
    soul.



The play gives no space to the thought that the robots might make one unemployed. Instead it is

a vision of a horrible world without love and feeling. The robots in Karel Čapek’s play

eventually rise up and kill almost all humans.


                                                 12
       A Google Ngrams search shows that a new term “technological unemployment,”

unemployment caused by new machines, rose rapidly into prominence in the 1920s and 1930s.

Then in the 1960s there was another epidemic of attention to the problem of machines replacing

jobs, with a newly popular word, “automation.” One observer in 1965 wrote a book The

Automation Hysteria which descried a “huge spate of alarmist literature” about this automation,

and fears then of a future of unemployment worse than that of the Great Depression. 15 The term

“Triple Revolution” suddenly and briefly appeared in the 1960s too, the three revolutions being

automation, weapons of mass destruction, and expanding human rights.

       But the automation hysteria of that time was not just about the loss of jobs per se. Robert

Theobald wrote an influential book in 1963, Free Men and Free Markets, that argued for

deciding on a new and revised version of work and its meaning. He was an economist of sorts,

though he dropped out of graduate school at Harvard. His book called for the government

providing everyone with a “Due Income” (Basic Income). He was not enthusiastic about policies

to promote high employment, asking, what is good about keeping people on the assembly line?

He expressed faith in people: people will find something more meaningful to do when freed from

drudgery. The question is not "How do we find jobs for everybody?" but "How do we find

purpose and meaning and rights to resources for everybody" — which is a completely different

question.”

       Robert Theobald’s rise to fame was rapid, so that by the 1960s he was one of the most

famous economists, in the 1960s after the publication of Free Men and Free Markets briefly

outshining superstars Kenneth Arrow and Paul Samuelson. But, following typical epidemic

curve pattern, his fame dropped precipitously, so he is almost forgotten today. His due income




                                                13
narrative continues, but he was not the originator of the idea and his name is no longer attached

to it.

         Another influential voice at this time was John Kenneth Galbraith. In his best-selling1957

book The Affluent Society he argued, after noting that progress had created a class of a rich and

self-indulgent class, that:

     The solution is a system of taxation which automatically makes a pro rata share of
     increasing income available to public authority for public purposes. The task of public
     authority, like that of private individuals, will be to distribute this increase in
     accordance with relative need. 16
     Concerns about automation as invading our lives were expressed in Herbert Simon’s 1966

book The Shape of Automation. The book argued that it is not just manual labor that is threatened

by automation. The jobs of physicians, corporate president and college professors may be

completely automated. Such a prospect creates uncertainty about how people in these jobs will

find any work that offers comparable purpose and meaning that they have today.

     The unanswered question from then, to today, is whether there will still be a demand for the

augmentation of this automation with the uniquely human. The need seems to be, as expressed

by David Autor and David Dorn, “interpersonal interaction, flexibility and adaptability to offer

services that are uniquely human.” 17 This interpretation opens the question whether there could

be jobs in the future that are also uniquely meaningful to human beings.

     Edmund Phelps in his book Rewarding Work (1997, 2007) said that work is “the main

source of people’s personal and intellectual development.” Phelps poses a question to himself:

     . . .but surely there is not much mental stimulation and intellectual development
     provided by the jobs filled by disadvantaged people, is there? I responded that, for most
     people participating in the world of work, even on the bottom rungs, even unstimulating
     work is more interesting and satisfying than the alternatives if they do not get out of the
     house.” 18

                                                 14
Getting “out of the house” seems to be a metaphor for getting connected with larger society.

Phelps proposes a subsidy to employers of low-productivity earners, so that the employees see it

in their paychecks and do not see the subsidy directly. The subsidy will raise the market price of

unskilled labor, and gives the appearance that the work of the subsidized labor force is highly

valued. Well, such a subsidy does make their work highly valued, in the market.

        One may wonder what economics literature Phelps is referring to when he singles out

work as such an important aspect of personal and social development. It appears not to be from

economics journals. If one searches Google Scholar for “work” and “the meaning of life” one

finds many articles, but not in economics journals. Some of the journals that come up in this

search are: Journal of Career Assessment, Applied Psychology: Health and Well Being,

International Journal of Organizational Analysis, Journal of Counseling, Journal of Adolescent

Research, Personality and Individual Differences, Ethics, and British Journal of Psychology.

The absence of economic journals on this important topic is part of a bigger problem in academic

research caused by specialization.

        Anthony Kronman, former Dean of the Yale Law School, wrote in a 2007 book

Education's End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life that

it is not just economists who are missing the meaning of life:

    Graduate students learn to restrict their attention to a single segment of human
    knowledge and to accept their incompetence to assess, or even understand, the work of
    specialists in other areas. But they also learn to accept the idea that this same narrowing
    of attention, which cuts them off from those in other disciplines, alone qualifies them to
    join the company of fellow specialists in their own field, spread over many generations
    and united in a common commitment to the subject they share.


He argued that we are failing our students, or suggesting that life has no meaning, contrary to

their deepest instincts.
                                                15
    Raghuram Rajan in his 2019 book The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the

Community Behind argued that connections to community are far more important than most

economists imagine. He says here that the community:

    anchors the individual in real human networks and gives them a sense of identity; our
    presence in the world is verified by our impact on people around us. 19
The first pillar of the economy is the markets, the second is the government, and the third is the

local community, those one sees in the extended family, neighborhood and at work. The local

community is the place where one’s work narrative is most visible.


Social Hierarchy and Inequality

       Narratives can trigger deep feelings based on the instinct for hierarchy. The pecking order

matters to humans just as to chickens. With humans, the story of one’s job affects one’s social

ranking. But there is in human society no consistent agreement on ranking. Each individual

savors his or her own imaginary high ranking.

       Political talk is strong on narratives about jobs. Politicians in the United States frequently

refer to “hardworking Americans.” One sees colorful appreciations of a life of hard work in

obituaries, which often see fit to praise a life of devotion and hard work. For example, from an

obituary in the 1930s:

             Mr. Lloyd, whose puzzles challenged newspaper readers for more than 30 years,
    originated 10,000 puzzles by his own estimate. His goal was to create one puzzle a day.
    Working eight hours a day, in his Brooklyn studio he turned out an average of 300 a
    year.” 20
Such colorful stories work to define a person’s identity, his or her real significance in life. The

stories involve suggestions of broad categories of social ranking but also the little details, of

literary quality, like the one puzzle a day. Mr. Lloyd was significant because he appears to have

been a unique source of pleasure to millions of people. Mr. Lloyd’s occupation, and its meaning
                                                  16
to him in life, appears to be relatively less threatened by labor-saving machinery, but most

people feel some insecurity in the security of their perceived narrative.

       The narratives around the job, or lack of a traditional job, depends on the choice of words

describing the activities of the person. Lack of a traditional job may be compensated for by the

narrative that is applied to nonwork. Thus, today, people retiring on a pension take it as

acceptable to go through decades of retirement without traditional work, because of the narrative

that has emerged around them. In the United States, “Social Security,” with its “OASDI,” “Old

Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance” has associated with it different narratives, that are far

less controversial than any other form of redistribution to reduce economic inequality, even

though it is just as well considered largely an institution to tax the rich and transfer to the poor.

The difference is that it identifies only with sources of inequality that have good positive

narratives, and it is framed as insurance, which is something paid for and earned.

       Moreover, the fact that the narrative involves paying in to the insurance, with a deduction

from one’s paycheck called F.I.C.A. for Federal Insurance Contributions Act, it is framed as a

purchase for one’s own benefit. In fact, one is compelled to make the purchase, and for higher

income people the purchase is not advantageous. Still, the fact that one paid for it seems to make

the income redistribution acceptable. More than acceptable, the narrative of social security

makes the system practically immortal. President Roosevelt, when asked in 1941 about the

mandatory contributions for Social Security, said

      “We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral,
      and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With
      those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program”

Some Policy Alternatives in Light of the Narrative History

The history of thought presented here highlights the fact that people have for centuries been

concerned, when confronted with labor saving machines, with not only their effects on their

incomes, but also with something deeper, the meaning of work and life, a concept which our

psychology will not let us neglect.

       The rise of populism and retreat into nationalism around much of the world in the twenty-

first century may be related to past technological unemployment and as well to the narratives of

loss of self-esteem. The potential for conflict from this event is worrisome.

       Some kind of redistribution of income has long been advocated, in response to labor-

saving machinery, as we have seen. In choosing among variants of this redistribution, it is

important to consider the kinds of narratives that would be encouraged by the choice made.

Some kinds of income redistribution look like charity or bailout, and as injustice to higher

income people who may have worked hard for their success. Redress of inequality could be

achieved along different lines than direct redistribution. We have seen the example of Social

Security, that has been presented as a form of insurance rather than a tax. I argued in my 2003

book that framing our strategy for dealing with dislocations caused by labor-saving machinery as

a form of insurance, collecting insurance premia today to provide protection against possibly

much worse inequality in future decades, may make it a better narrative. 21 I then called it

“inequality insurance.” That name may not be suggesting the right story. The word “insurance”

sounds honorable and apt, but the word “inequality” seems to suggest a narrative that the policy

is a form of charity for the losers. Perhaps a name for a government program protecting people

could be named after existing long-standing government social insurance. In the United States it


                                                 18
could be “human capital insurance” or even called something like “Social Security Part B”

borrowing authority from an existing insurance program that is widely accepted.

       President Franklin Roosevelt attempted such a reframing of narrative by naming his

Depression program “The New Deal.” It was inspired by a 1932 book with that title by one of his

advisors, Stuart Chase. Thus the entire edifice of his redistributive policies was defined as a sort

of business deal rather than a charity. The policies are thus presented with a positive orientation,

and a business narrative, overcoming resistance and shame as from living off the government,

upon retirement.

       Private long-term “livelihood insurance” as I called it in my 2003 book, which could also

be called occupational income insurance, could also help protect people who are investing in

risky human capital, protecting against technological progress reducing the remuneration and

quality of jobs in their specified field or area. Such insurance could not only protect people

against career risks as measured by occupational income indices, but also enhance a narrative of

risk-taking with human capital, investing in forms of one’s human capital whose subsequent

advantages are uncertain. The policies would by pay out to a beneficiary if an occupational

income index for the beneficiary’s category declines. With such a narrative, this insurance would

not have the stigma of charity or government redistribution. With such insurance, there could be

a name of the product, such as entrepreneur’s insurance, or a name that suggests a story of

adventuresome human-capital investment. The sales literature for the private insurance could

emphasize that it would enable people to make risky but possibly highly successful human

capital investments, by telling stories of other human-capital entrepreneurs that are suggestive of

a personal narrative. The insurance may thus enhance both the stability of personal income and

the sense of meaning in work.

                                                 19
       Mentorship programs for young people have been growing exponentially since around

1980, in recognition of the powerful force friendship with otherwise distant successful people

can have on the youth’s self-image and personal narrative. Such mentoring is especially

important for segments of the population that already feel excluded from a success narrative. 22

Such mentoring could also be tilted towards helping them define themselves in terms of a life

story of their contribution to society, a human contribution that might never be entirely replaced

by machines. Such a narrative might cause them to take actions that put their livelihood at risk,

but at the same time would help them maintain their self-esteem if such risk-taking puts them in

a situation where they must accept help in maintaining their living standard.

       With the long history of concern about the meaning of work that we have seen here, it

seems that it must be that innovations, in the form of different kinds risk management

institutions, or of jobs, or of mentorship, may be as important to promoting human welfare in the

midst of a technological revolution as any direct government redistribution of income or wealth.
