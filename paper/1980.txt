     Irreversible Investment, Capacity Choice, and the Value of the Firm




                                  ABSTRACT




     A model   of capacity choice and utilization is developed
consistent with value maximization when investment is irreversible
and future demand is uncertain.       Investment requires the full
value of a marginal unit of capacity to be at least as large as
its full cost. The former includes the value of the firms option
not to utilize the unit, and the latter includes the opportunity
cost of exercising the investment option.        We show that for
moderate amounts of uncertainty, the firm's optimal capacity is
much smaller than it would be if investment were reversible, and a
large fraction of the firirVs value is due to the possibility of
future growth.   We also characterize the behavior of capacity and
capacity utilization, and discuss implications far the measurement
of marginal cost and Tobin's q.

 1.   Introduction.

      When investment is irreversible and future demand          conditions are
 uncertain, a firms investment expenditure involves the exercising, or

 11killing," of an option (the option to productively invest). One gives up

 the option of waiting for new information (about      evolving demand and cost

conditions), and using that information to re—evaluate the desirability

and/or timing of the expenditure. This lost option value must be included

as part of the cast of the investment. As a result, the standard investment

rule "Invest when the marginal value of a unit of capital is at least as

large as the purchase and installation cost of the unit" is not valid.

Instead the marginal value of the unit must exceed            the purchase and
installation cost by an amount equal to the value of         keeping the firms
option to invest alive —— an opportunity cost of investing.

      This aspect of investment has been explored in    an emerging literature,
and most notably in the recent paper by McDonald and Siegel (1986). They

show that with even moderate levels of      uncertainty, the value of this
opportunity cost can be large, and an investment rule that ignores it will
be grossly in error.   Their calculations, and those in the related papers by

Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and Maid and Pindyck (1985), show that in many

cases projects should be undertaken only when their present value is at
least double their direct cost.1

      The existing literature has been concerned with investment decisions

involving discrete prijects, e.g. whether to build a factory.       Ihis paper
examines the implications of irreversibility for capacity choice, e.g. how

large a factory to build. In particular I focus on the marginal investment

decision. This provides a simple and intuitively appealing solution to the
                                  —2—
optimal capacity problem, as well as insight into the sources and evolution

of the firm's value.      In addition, it clarifies issues related to the

measurement of long—run marginal cost, and the interpretation and measure-

ment of Tobins q.

     A firm's capacity choice is optimal when the value of the marginal

unit of capacity is just equal to the total cost of that unit. This total

cost includes the purchase and installation cost, plus the opportunity cost

of exercising the option to buy the unit.   An analysis of capacity choice

therefore involves two steps.     First, the value of a marginal unit of

capacity must be determined, given that the firm already has capacity K.

To do this we must account for the fact that if demand unexpectedly falls,

the unit of capacity may be unutilized. Second, the value of the option to

invest in the marginal unit must be determined (it will depend in part on

the value of the marginal unit itself), together with the decision rule for

exercising the option. In essence, this decision rule is the solution to

the optimal capacity problem.

     Because a marginal unit of capacity need not be utilized, it is worth

more when demand fluctuates stochastically. This might suggest that the

firm should hold more capacity when future demand is uncertain, but in fact

the opposite is true.    The reason is that uncertainty also increases the

opportunity cost of exercising the option to invest in a marginal unit.

Although the value of the marginal unit increases, this opportunity cost

increases even more, so the net effect is to reduce the firm's optimal

capacity.2 Indeed, for many product markets the volatility of demand is

such that firms should hold far less capacity than standard investment

models would suggest.
                                    -3—
      This model of capacity choice also has implications for the valuation

of firms. The value of a firm has two components:     the value of installed

capacity, and the value of the firm's options to install more capacity in

the future. Solutions of the model based on plausible        parameter values

suggest that for typical firms, "growth options" should account for more

that half (and in some cases much more than half) of market value.

     This paper, like others cited above, stresses the options that firms

have to productively invest.    These options are important assets of firms.

Firms hold them even if they are price—takers in product and input markets,

and they can account for a good fraction of their market value. What gives

firms these options? It may be a patent on a particular production techno-

logy, or ownership of land or natural resource reserves. Rut more general-

ly, a firm's managerial resources and expertise, reputation, market posi-

tion, and possibly scale, all of which may have been built up over time,

enable it to productively undertake investments that individuals     or other

firms cannot undertake.3

     The next section lays out a simple model of capacity choice with

irreversible investment, based on the assumption that firms maximize their

market value.    It differs from previous models of this type, e.g. Brennan

and Schwartz (1985) and McDonald and Siegel (1986), in that the focus is on

the marginal investment decision, rather than the decision to invest in    a

discrete project. As the model is developed, a numerical example is used to

show how the marginal value of capital, the opportunity cost of investing,

and the firm's optimal capacity depend on current demand and uncetainty over

future demand.   Remaining sections of the paper use the model to study the

value of the firm, the behavior of capacity and capacity utilization over
                                                      —4—
time, and implications for the measurement of                     marginal   cost and Tobins q.



2.     4 Model of Capacity Choice.

        Consider the investment decisions of a firm that might have monopoly

power, and faces the following demand function:4

              P =       6(t)    —                                                             Cl)

(The firm might be a price—taker, in which case                        =   0.)     Here 6(t) evolves

over time according to the following stochastic process:

                    =    a$dt       +   cr9dz                                                 (2)
where d: is the increment of a Weiner process, i.e. dz =                           (t)(dt)1'2,    with

c(t)    a   serially uncorrelated and normally distributed random variable.

Eqn. (2)      says that the current value of 9 (and thus the current demand

function) is known to the firm, but future values of                       e are    unknown, and are

lognormally distributed with a variance that grows with the time horizon.

Thus even though information arrives over time (the firm observes 9

changing) ,     future demand is always uncertain, as is the case in most
real—world markets.'

       Denote by g.. the correlation of 6 with the market portfolio. Now

suppose some asset or portfolio of assets exists with a stochastic return

perfectly correlated with , so that if x is the price of this asset, it

evolves according to:

              dx =      pxdt        +   oxdz

By the CPM, the expected return on this asset must be p =                          r   +         where

     is the market price of risk. We will assume that u, the expected percen-

tage rate of change of 9,                       is less than p.     (It will become clear later

that if this were not the case, no firm in the industry would ever install
                                     —5-.
any capacity. No matter what the current level of $,     firms   would always be

better off waiting and simply holding the option to install capacity in the

future.) Denote the difference between p and      by 8, i.e. 8 = p — c.

     The firms problem is to determine, initially and over time, its

optimal investment spending on new production capacity.     I assume that the

firm starts with no capacity, so that at t = 0 it decides how much initial

capacity to put in place. Later it may or may not add more capacity,
depending on how demand evolves.

     For simplicity    I assume that new capacity can be installed instantly,

and capital in place does not depreciate.' Another assumption ——          and an

important one ——      is   that investment is irreversible. That is, although

capital in place can be sold by one firm to another, its scrap value is

small because it has no alternative use than that originally intended for

it. Thus a factory built to produce widgets can only be used to produce

widgets, so if the demand for widgets falls, its market value will fall.

     The fact that investment is irreversible implies that there is an

opportunity cost associated with adding capacity —— adding       capacity today

forecloses the possibility of adding it instead at some point in the future

(or never at all). Put another way, the firm currently has options to

install capacity at various points in the future (options that can be

exercised at the cost of purchasing the capital), and by installing capacity

now, it closes those options. The optimal rule is to invest until the value

of a marginal unit of capital is equal to its total cost ——   the purchase and
installation cost, plus the value of the option on the unit.1

     A few more details are needed to finish specifying the model:     (i) each

unit of capital can be bought at a fixed price k per unit;       (ii) each unit
                                            —6—
of capital in place provides the capacity to produce one unit of output per

time period; and (iii) the firm has an operating cost C(Q)                         c1Q +

(1/2)c202.    In general c1 and/or c2 can be zero, but if               = 0 (so the firm

is a price—taker), we require c2 > 0 to bound the firm's size.

       For purposes of comparison, note that if future demand were certain

(a      0), and if c > 0,            the firm's optimal initial capital stock would be

        = (9 — c1 —       rk)/(2+c2)      i.e. the firm should add capacity only if

9(K)    :   (2+c2)K   +   c1   +   rk.   We will see that with moderate amounts of

uncertainty over future demand, the optimal capital stock is considerably

smaller than this.

       The Value of a Marginal Unit of Capacity.

       To solve the firm's investment problem we first determine the value of

an incremental unit of capacity. That is, given that the firm already has

capacity K, we want to find the value to the firm of an incremental unit,

which we denote by V(K). (Note that V(K) is a function of 9 as well as

K.) This is just the present value of the expected flow of incremental

profits from the marginal unit.             Because the unit does not have to be

utilized, future incremental profits are a nonlinear function of 8, which is

stochastic. In particular, given a current capacity K, the incremental

profit at any future time t resulting from a marginal unit of capacity is:

                          max CO, (8 — (2r+c2)K     —   ct))                      3)

       Thus EV(K) can be written a;:


             V(K)
                               t;9(9,t8tdt                                        (4)




where f($,t) is the density function for 8 at time t, p is the risk—adjusted

discount rate, and ir(K;9) is given by eqn. (3).               It is difficult, however,
                                                           —7—
to evaluate (4) directly. In addition, the rate ji might not be known.

        Instead we obtain AV(K) by solving the following equivalent problem:

What is the value of a factory that produces 1                                      unit of output per period,

with operating cost (2+c2)K + c1, where the output is sold in a perfectly

competitive market at a price Ot,                          and where the factory can be shut down

(temporarily and costlessly) if the price 9t                                          falls      below the operating

cost?e It is shown in the Appendix that the solution to this problem is:

        V(K) =                                                                                                    (5)

        A numerical example is useful to illustrate the characteristics of

V(K), as well as other aspects of the model. For this purpose I choose
r = 8    =
             .05,   k = 10, c1 =             0, and either I = .5 and c2 = 0,                       or equivalently

I = 0 and C2            = 1.'           1 vary 9 or K, and consider values of o in the range of

0 to 410 For purposes of comparison, let V0(K) denote 1V(K) for u = 0,

so V0(K) =          9/8          —   ((21+c2)K    +   c1)/r   for $ > (21+c2)K +            c1, and 0 otherwise.
For our numerical example, AV0(K) = 20(9—K) for 9 > K, and 0 otherwise.

        Figure 1 shows AV(K) as a function of $ for K                                      I and a =          0, .2, and
.4. Observe that V(K) looks like the value of a call option —— indeed                                                   it

is the sum of an infinite number of European call options (see Footnote B).
                                             —B—
As with a call option, V(K) is increasing with , and for u > 0,
V(K) > V0(K) because the firm               need not utilize its capacity. As e -

VU() 4 V0(K) for e very large relative to                       K, this unit of capacity

will almost surely be continuously utilized over a long period of time.

     Figure 2 shows AV(K} as a function of K for e = 2, and u =               0, .1, .2,
and .4.     Because demand evolves stochastically, a marginal unit of capacity

has some positive value no matter how large is the existing capital stock;

there is always some chance that it will be utilized over any finite period

of time. The greater i , the more slowly V(K) declines with K.                     Also,

the smaller is K,         the more likely it is that the marginal unit will be

utilized, and so the smaller is AVIK) — AV0(K).            When K =   0, AV(O) = AV0(K);
with c1 =   0, the first marginal unit will always be utilized.
     The fact that AVIK) is larger when a > 0 might suggest that the firm

should hold a larger amount of capacity, but just the opposite is true.                 As

shown below, the firms opportunity cost of exercising its option to invest

in the marginal unit also becomes larger, and by an even greater amount.

     The Decision to Invest in the Marginal Unit.

     Having valued the marginal unit of capacity, we now value the firm's

option to invest in this unit, and the optimal decision rule for exercising

the option. This is analogous to a perpetual call option with exercise

price k, on a stock that pays a proportional dividend at rate 8 and has a

current price AV(K). In the Appendix it is shown that its value, AF(K), is:

                          a8                  $ < $(K)
            AF(K) =   {                                                           (6)
                          AVIK) — k     ;
                                              e > $0(K)


where:      a =   P.($*) (P2P1)       + ..L($.)           > o
                                      —9—
P, P2, and b2 are given under eqn. (5) above, and e*(K) is the critical

value of 8 at or above which it is optimal to purchase the marginal unit of

capacity, i.e. the firm should purchase the unit if 8 > 8*(K). This

critical value $*(K) is in turn the solution to


                            +    :fl-$* — I            -k   =            (7)
               P1                8p              r


Eqn. (7) can be solved numerically for 8, and eqn. (6) can then be used to

calculate óF(K).

     Recall our assumption that & > 0.    The reader can verify that as & -,   0,
$*(K) 4 .     Unless   8 > 0, the opportunity cost of investing in a unit of

capacity always exceeds the benefit, and the firm will never install

capacity.1t Thus if firms in an industry are investing optimally and some

positive amount of investment is taking place, we should observe 8 > 0.

     As with a call option on a dividend—paying stock, both F(K) and the

critical value $0(K) increase as         increases. Figure 3 shows F(K) as a

function of $ for K =    1 and    = 0, .2, and .4.     When u    0, $ = 1.5,
i.e. the firm should increase capacity only if 8 exceeds 1.5. For              .2

and .4, $* is 2.45 and 3.44 respectively. The opportunity cost of exercis-

ing the firms option to invest in additional capacity is tF(K) , which

increases with u, so a higher o implies a higher critical value e*(K).

Also, it is easily shown that 8(K) is monotonically increasing in K.

     The Firms Optimal Capacity.

     The function 8*(K) is the firms optimal investment rule; if $ and K

are such that 8 > 0(K), the firm should add capacity, increasing K until 8*

rises to 8.     Equivalently we can substitute for b2(K) and rewrite eqn. (7)

         Figure 4 shows K($) for         o   =    0,   .2 and .4.          (For many industries .2 is

a conservative value for             ——          see Footnote 10.) Observe that K' is much

smaller when future demand is uncertain.                            For    =    .4, f must be more than
three times as large as when                     0 before any capacity is installed.

         Another way to see how uncertainty over future demand affects the

firm's optimal capacity is by comparing LF(K) ,                           the    value of the option to

invest in a marginal unit, with V(K) —                         k,    the net of purchase cost) value

of the unit. The optimal capacity K'($) is the maximum K for which these

two quantities are equal.            Note from eqn. (6) that for e                          $',    or equiva—

lently, K < K', exercising the option to invest maximizes its value, so that

F(K) =          V(K)   —
                           k, but for K > K', F(K) > V(K) — k, and the option to
invest is worth more "alive" than 'dead."

         This is shown in Figure 5, which plots F(K) and .V(K)                          —
                                                                                            k    as functions

of K, for $ = 2 and u = .2.           Recall that V(K) is larger when future demand

is uncertain. As the figure shows,                     if the opportunity cost of exercising

the option to invest were ignored (i.e. the firm added capacity until AV(K)
—   k   was zero), the firm's capacity would be about 2.3 units,                                as opposed to

1.5 units when o = 0.           But at these capacity levels the opportunity co3t of

investing in a marginal unit exceeds the net value of the unit, so the

value of the firm is not maximized. The optimal capacity is only K' =                                     .67,
the largest K for which F(K) =               V(K)      —
                                                           k,   and the solution to eqn. (7).



3. The Value of The Firm.

        As noted above, K'($) is the capacity level which maximizes the firm's
                                                   — 11 —

market value, net of cash outlays for the purchase of capital. This can be

seen algebraically and from Figure 5 by noting that the value of the firm

has two components, the value of installed capacity, and the value of the

firm's options to install more capacity in the future.                           The firm's net

value as a function of its capacity K is thus given by:

                           K
             Net Value =   ,fV(v)dv       +    J'1F(v)dv     — kK                         (B)
                           0                   K


Differentiating    with respect to                 K shows that this is maximized when K =

such that AV(K) —     F(K*)     — k   =       0.

         The value of the firm's installed capacity, V(K), is just the first

integral in eqn. (8).          In Figure 5 it is the area under the curve V(K) — k

from K      0 to K*, plus the purchase cost kK. The value of the firm's

options to expand is the second integral, which in Figure 5 is the area

under the curve F(K) from K =          K           to .     As the figure suggests, the value

of the firm's growth options is a large portion of its total value.

         The sensitivity of firm value and its components to uncertainty over

future demand can be seen from Table 1, which shows K, V(K), F(K), and

total value for different values of u and e. When                        =
                                                                             0, the value of the
firm is only the value of its installed capacity. Whatever the value of

8, the firm is worth more the the more volatile is demand.                            A larger

implies a larger value for each unit of installed capacity, and a much

larger value for the firm's options to expand. Also, the larger is a, the

larger is the fraction of firm value attributable to its growth options.

When a = .2 or more, more than half of the firm's value is F(K), the value

of its growth options. Even when a =                  .1,   F(K) accounts for more than half

of total value when 0 is 1 or less.                    (When demand is currently small, it is
                                       — 12 —

the possibility of greater demand in the future that gives the firm much of
its value.)      And there is always a range of 8 for which K is zero, so that

all of the firm's value is due to its growth options.

     As mentioned earlier,      =   .2 or more should be typical for many
industries. A testable implication of the model is that for firms in such

industries, the fraction of market value attributable to the value of

capital in place should not be much more than one half.         A second implica-

tion is that this fraction should be smaller the greater is the volatility

of market demand.     I   have not tried to test either of these implications

(valuing capital in place is itself a difficult task). However, calcula-

tions reported by Kester (1984) are consistent with both of them, He

estimated the value of capital in place for 15 firms in 5 industries by

capitalizing a    flow of anticipated earnings from this capital, and found

it is half or less of market value in the majority of cases. Furthermore,

this fraction is only about 1/5 to 1/3 in industries where demand is more

volatile (electronics, computers), but more than 1/2 in industries with less

volatile demand (tires and rubber, food processing).



4. The Dynamics of Capacity Capacity Utilization, and Firm Value.

     If the firm begins with no capacity, it initially observes 8 and

installs a starting capacity K($).        If    8 then increases, it will expand

capacity accordingly, and the value of the firm will rise. The value of its

growth options will also rise, but will become a smaller fraction of total

value (see Table 1).      However if    8 decreases, it will find itself holding

more capacity than it would have chosen had the decrease been anticipated.

The firm's value will fall, and depending on how much 8 decreases, some of
                                     — 13   —


its   capacity may become unutilized.

       Because capital does not depreciate in this model, the firm's capacity

is non—decreasing, but will rise only periodically.                The dynamics of

capacity are characterized in Figure 6, which shows a sample path for 8(t),

and the corresponding behavior of K(t).          (The duration of continuous upward

movements in K(t) is exaggerated.) The firm begins at t0 by installing

             K. Then 8 increases until it reaches a (temporary) maximum 8 at

t1, and K is increased accordingly to K. Here it remains fixed until t,

when $ again reaches $.       fterwards   K is increased as $ increases, until t3

when 8 begins to decline from a new maximum, and K remains fixed at K.

      Thus an implication of the model is that investment occurs only in

spurts, when demand is rising, and only when it is rising above historic

levels.t2 Firms usually increase capacity only periodically, and this is

often attributed to the 'lumpiness' of investment. But lumpiness is clearly

not required for this behavior.

      Let us now examine the firm's capacity utilization.           Clearly during

periods of    expansion,   all capacity will be utilized.       When demand falls,

however, some capacity may go unutilized, but only if it falls far enough.

      If the firm had unlimited capacity it would maximize current profits by

setting output at Q = (O—cj)/(21+c2).           However K(8) < (8—c1)/(21+c2), and

as shown in Section 2, can be much less even for moderate values of .         Thus

for 8 in the range 8(K)         (2+c2)K +   ct   < 9 < 9((), capacity will remain

fixed but will be fully utilized. Capacity will go unutilized only when 8 <

9(K). In Figure 6 this occurs durinq the intervals (t., tb) and (t6, ta).

      The irreversibility of investment induces firms to hold less capacity

as a buffer against unanticipated drops in demand. s a result there will
                                                — 14 —

be periods of low demands when capacity is fully utilized. 4 large drop in

demand is required for capacity utilization to fall below 1007..

     The value of the firm will move in the same direction as $.                      Most    of

the time the firm's capacity K will be above K*(8) ——                in   Figure   exceptions

are during the intervals (t0, t1) and (t2, t3) ——                  but given e and K, the
firm's value can always be computed from:

                     K
           Value =   ftV(v;$)dv       +    ,fF(vE3)dv                                  (9)
                     0                     K


The share of the firms value due to its growth options will also fluctuate

with $.   For example as Table             1    shows, during periods when capacity is
growing (so that K =          K(O))            this share falls.    It also falls when $ is

falling and K > K*($). Thus as firms in this model evolve over time, growth

options tend to account for a smaller share of value.



5. The Measurement of Long—Run Marginal Cost.

     The measurement of long—run marginal cost and its relationship to price

can be important for industry analyses in general, and antitrust applica-

tions in particular.           As shown below, when investment is irreversible,

traditional measures will understate marginal cost and overstate the amount

by which it differs from price, even in a competitive market. This problem

is particularly severe when product markets are volatile.

     Suppose o = 0.      Then F(K) =            0, and the firm sets K (and 0) so that:
          AV(K) = 0/8     —
                              [(2+c2)K          +   c1)/r   = k                        (10)

Note that V(K), the value of a marginal unit of capacity, is net of

(capitalized) niarginal operating cost. Let us rewrite (10) as follo's:

          0/8 —   2K/r    =   Cc1 +       c2K)/r     + k                               (10')
                                               — 15 —

The left—hand side of            (10') is ca;italized marginal revenue (8 is capital-

ized at a rate 8 because 't is growing at rate                            with o       0,     8 =   r    —

The rAght—hand side is full marginal cost, the capitalized operating cost,

plu. the purchase cost of a unit of capital.                               Eqn. (10')        is the usual

relation between marginal revenue and marginal cost when the former is

increasing at a deterministic rate.

      Now suppose u > 0, and K =             K*(8).     Then from eqn. (5),                 the optimality

condition AV(K) =    k   +   F(K)      can be written as:

           V(K) = b282           +   $18 —   E(2+c2)K     +   c1)/r           k +   F(K)                (11)

or:        $i6 —   2IKlr     =   — b2&32 + (c2K + c1)Ir +             k   +   F(K)                      (11')


Observe that two adjustments must be made to obtain full (capitalized)

marginal cost, the RHS of (11'). The first term on the RHS of (11')                                     is the

value of the firm's option to let the marginal unit of capacity go unutil—

ized, and must be subtracted from capitilized operating cost. The last term

is the opportunity cost of exercising the option to invest. As we have seen

in Section 2, the last term dominates the first, so that K must be smaller

to satisfy (11'), and marginal cost as conventionally measured will under-

state true marginal cost.

      If the firm is a price—taker, I =               0       and P = 8.              Price will equal

marginal cost, if the latter is defined correctly as in (11'). Unfortunate-

ly the first and last terms on the RHS of                      (11') are difficult to measure,

particularly with aggregate data.                 But if one wishes to compare price with

marginal cost, ignoring them can be misleading.'3



6. Marginal g and Investment.

      The q theory of investment says that firms have an incentive to invest
                                            —1     —


whenever     marginal q ——         the     increase in market value resulting from a

marginal unit of capital divided by the cost of that unit ——                exceeds one.

But models based on this theory have not been very successful in explaining

investment.14 There may be several reasons for this but one possibility is

that in such models the cost of a marginal unit of capital typically

includes only the purchase and installation cost. As we have seen, this can

grossly understate the true cost of the unit.

     In empirical applications (e.g. Abel and Blanchard), the change in

market value from a marginal unit of capital is measured as the NPV of the

expected profit flow from the unit, i.e. the present value of the unit. In

our notation, q =       LV(K)/k.     But this ignores the opportunity cost F(K);

clearly q     >     1   does not imply that K should be increased. The correct

measure for q is found by noting that the addition of a marginal unit of

capital increases the value of the firms capital in place by V(K), but

decreases the value of the firms growth options by LFUO.                  The net change

in market value is thus V(K) —             F(K),   so the correct measure for q is:

                    [AV(K) —   LiF(K)]/k                                          (11)


Setting q*        1 yields the optimal K0.

     It is easy to see why marginal q as it is usually measured may fail to

explain investment. Note that an increase in demand (i.e. in 8) will

increase V(K), but it will also increase F(K), although by a smaller

amount. And if u increases, both AF(K) and V(K) rise, but V(K) by less,

so that the desired capital stock falls. But the market value of the firm

increases, so that even if market value data is used to measure q, we will

see an increase in q but a decrease in investment.

     As mentioned earlier, F(K) is unfortunately difficult to measure. But
                                   — 17   —


in   some cases it may be possible to construct a proxy for F(K) based on the

sample variance of demand fluctuations.         The use of such a proxy miqht

improve the explanatory power of q theory models.



7. Conclusions.

      The model presented here is a simple one that ignores complications

such as adjustment costs, delivery lags, and lumpiness of capital expendi-

tures.    It can easily be extended to account for these factors, but

numerical methods may then be required to obtain solutions. Of course once

numerical methods are used, other aspects of the model can also be general-

ized. For example, demand can be a nonlinear Function of        I?,   or   e   could
follow some alternative stochastic process, perhaps including Jumps.

      By treating capital in place as homogeneous, we have been able to focus

on the marginal investment decision, and clarify the ways in which irrever-

sibility of investment and uncertainty over future demand affect both the

value and cost of a marginal unit of capacity. Besides yielding a relative—

1y simple solution to the problem of capacity choice, the model provides a

straightforward method for calculating the firm's market value and its

components.   It also provides insight into the measurement of long—run

marginal cost, and Tobin's q.

      In many markets output prices fluctuate with annual standard deviations

in excess of 20 percent. Our results show that in such markets, firms

should hold much less capacity than would be the case if investment were

reversible or future demand were known with certainty.     Also, much of the

market value of these firms is due to the possibility (as opposed to the

expectation) of stronger demands in the future. This value may result from
                                  — 18 -

patents   and technical knowledge, but it also arises from the managerial

expertise and infrastructure, and market position that gives these firms (as

opposed to potential entrants) the option to economically expand capacity.

     One might ask whether firms correctly compute and take into account the

opportunity cost of investing when making capacity expansion decisions.

Ignoring such costs would lead to overinvestaent. McConnell and Muscarella

(1986) have found that for manufacturing firms, market value tends to

increase (decrease) when managers announce an increase (decrease) in planned

investment expenditures, which is inconsistent with a systematic tendency to

overinvest.15   But there is anecdotal evidence that managers often base

investment decisions on present values computed with discount rates that far

exceed those that would be implied by the CPPM ——     diversifiable   and non—

diversifiable risk are sometimes confused, and an arbitrary 'risk factor' is

often added to the discount rate.     It may be, then, that managers use the

wrong method to get close to the right answer.

     Here we derive eqn. (5) for AV(K;8) and eqns. (6) and                                         (7)    for the

optimal investment rule and value of the investment option F(K;8).

     The value of a marginal unit of capacity, iV(k(;$), is found by valuing

an equivalent "incremental project" that produces 1                                       unit of output per
period at cost (2+c2) + c1, which is sold at price e(t) , and where the firm

can (temporarily and costlessly) shut down if price falls below cost. To

value this, create a portfolio that is long the project and short AV. units

of the output, or equivalently the asset or portfolio of assets perfectly

rational investor would hold the corresponding long position). The value of

      Eqn. (A.2) can also be obtained by dynamic programming. Consider the

optimal operating policy (J           0 or 1) that maximizes the value               of the

above portfolio. The Bellman equation is:

      r =                   — (2+c)   —   c1]   —          +                         (A.3)
                                                               Etd)
i.e. the competitive return r has two components, the cash flow given by

the first two terms in the maximand, and the expected rate of capital gain.

Expanding d dV — Vede and substituting into (A.3) gives (A.2).
      Finally, note that V must be the solution to (A.2) and the boundary

conditions even if the unit of capacity (the "incremental project") did not

exist, and could not be included in a hedge portfolio. All that is required

is an asset or portfolio of assets                  (x)   that replicates the stochastic

dynamics of    €3.    As Merton (1977) has shown, one can replicate the value

function with a portfolio consisting only of the asset x                      and risk—free

bonds, and since the value of this portfolio will have the same dynamics as

AV, the solution to (A.2), tV must be the value function to avoid dominance.

     Eqn. (6) for F(K;e) can be derived in the same way.                     Using the same

arguments as above, it is easily shown that F must satisfy the equation:

                        + (r_8)$F — rAF = 0                                          (A.4)


with boundary conditions:

            AF(8=D)     0

            tF(e=e') = V($=$0) — k

                        =


where E3*   = $*(K) is the exercise point, and V($*) —             k   is the net gain from

exercising. The reader can verify that eqns. (6) and                   (7) are the solution

to (A.4) and the associated boundary conditions.

                                    FOOTNOTES

1.   Other examples of this literature include the papers by Bernanke
     (1983), Cukierman (1980), Baldwin (1982), and Paddock, Siegel, and
     Smith (1984).    In the papers by Bernanke and Cukierman, uncertainty
     over future market conditions is reduced as time passes, so firms have
     an incentive to delay investing when markets are volatile (e.g. during
     recessions). In the other papers cited above and in the model I
     present here, future market conditions are always uncertain. But
     because access to the investment opportunity is analogous to holding a
     call option on a dividend—paying stock, for any positive amount of
     risk, an expenditure should be made only when the value of the result-
     ing project exceeds its cost by a positive amount, and increased
     uncertainty will increase the incentive to delay the investment
     expenditure.  Thus the results are similar to those in Bernanke
     and Cukierrnan, but for different reasons.

2.   In Abel (1983) and Hartinan (1972) uncertainty over future prices leads
     to an increase in the firm's optimal capital stock when the production
     function is linear homogeneous and there are convex adjustment costs.
     The reason is that the marginal revenue product of capital is a convex
     function of price, so that as in our model, a marginal unit of capital
     is worth more when price is stochastic. However in Abel and Hartean,
     investment is reversible, so that no options are closed when the firm
     invests, and the opportunity cost of investing is zero.

3.   A complete model of industry evolution would also describe the competi-
     tive processes through which firms obtain these options.   Such a model
     is beyond the scope of this paper.

4.   Analytic solutions for this model can be obtained for any demand
     function linear in 8, i.e. P      8(t) +   f(Q).   I use (1) for simplicity.

5.   It   is straightforward to also allow for uncertainty over future
     operating cost. The qualitative results would be the same.

6.   Relaxing these assumptions makes no qualitative difference in the
     results. In fact, allowing for lead times in the construction and
     installation of new capacity will magnify the effects of uncertainty.
     For a related model that looks specifically at the effects of lead
     times, see MaJd and Pindyck (1985).

7.   Still another way to see this is to note that the NPV of investing in a
     marginal unit of.capital might be positive because of possible future
     states of nature that are profitable. But that NPV might be made even
     larger by investing at a later date (and discounting the cost).

B.   The valuation of a factory that can be temporarily shut down has been
     studied by Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and McDonald and Siegel (1985).
     Observe from eqn. (3) that the present value of an incremental profit
     at future time t is the value of a European call option, with expira-
     tion date t and exercise price (2'+c2)K + c1, on a stock whose price is
                                    — 23 —

      8, paying a proportional dividend .     This point was made by McDonald
      and Siegel (1985). Thus AV(K), the value of our "equivalent factory,"
      can be found by summing the values of these call options for every
      future t.  However this does not readily yield a closed form solution,
      and I use an approach similar to that of Brennan and Schwartz (1985).

9.    With r and 8 equal, c = 0 if stochastic changes in 8 are completely
      diversifiab]e (i.e.    0 so p  r), but    > 0 otherwise. Also, as
      can be seen from eqn. (5), U=0, c2=1) and U=.5, c20) give the
      same marginal value of capital, and the same optimal behavior of the
      firm. In the first case the firm is a price—taker but earns infra—
      marginal rent, and in the second case it has monopoly power.

10.   The standard deviations of annual changes in the prices of such
      commodities as oil, natural gas, copper, and aluminum are in the range
      of 20 to 50 percent. For manufactured goods these numbers are somewhat
      lower, but often 20 percent or higher. Thus a value of u of .2 could
      be considered "typical" for simulation purposes.

11.   If S   =0, V(K) has an expected rate of growth equal to the risk—
      adjusted market rate. Since the firm's option to invest is perpetual,
      there would be no gain from installing capacity now rather than later.

12.   If we allow for depreciation, investment will occur more frequently and
      even when demand is somewhat below historic highs, but it will still
      occur in spurts.

13.   Hall (1986) reports that price significantly exceeds marginal cost for
      most two—digit industries, and finds no explanation for this disparity
      consistent with competition. Hall's test of marginal cost pricing is
      based on the relation between the marginal product of labor and the
      product wage.    If firms set marginal operating cost equal to a
      (constant) proportion of price, his technique will apply, whatever the
      capital stock. But as shown in Section 4, there can be a wide range of
      prices for which the firm is capacity constrained, and the ratio of
      marginal operating cost to price will vary with price.

14. For example, the model developed by Abel and Blanchard (1986) is one of
     the most sophisticated attempts to explain investment in a q theory
     framework; it uses a carefully constructed measure for marginal rather
     than average q, incorporates delivery lags and costs of adjustment, and
      explicitly measures expectations of future values of explanatory
      variables.  But Abel and Blanchard conclude that "our data are not
      sympathetic to the basic restrictions imposed by the q theory, even
      extended to allow for simple delivery lags." Also, see Summers (1981).

15. But they find the opposite true for firms in the oil industry, where
      there may be a tendency to overinvest in exploration and development.
