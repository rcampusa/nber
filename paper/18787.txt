                                              ABSTRACT

We propose a social choice rule for aggregating preferences elicited from surveys into a marginal adjustment
of policy from the status quo. The mechanism is: (i) symmetric in its treatment of survey respondents;
(ii) ordinal, using only the orientation of respondents’ indifference surfaces; (iii) local, using only
preferences in the neighborhood of current policy; and (iv) what we call “first-order strategy-proof,”
making the gains from misreporting preferences second order. The mechanism could be applied to
guide policy based on how policy affects responses to subjective well-being surveys.

       Making policy choices is unavoidable. The standard economic approach to guiding policy
consists of two steps: estimate policy effects on individuals’ utility, and then use a social choice
rule that aggregates across individuals to generate a policy recommendation. Traditionally, the
policy-effect estimates come from market data. However, market data are insufficient in some
contexts involving externalities, public goods, and non-market goods, and may not reliably
reveal preferences in contexts where people are uninformed or make systematic mistakes. For
these reasons, economists have increasingly been exploring survey-based approaches to
estimating policy effects on utility. For our purposes, such surveys have two key features: they
are unincentivized, and they generally work best for eliciting local preferences at the status quo
(because respondents find it harder to introspect about how they would feel in counterfactual,
unfamiliar situations). In this paper, we propose a social choice rule for aggregating local ordinal
preferences elicited from surveys into a local policy improvement, while reducing the incentive
for survey respondents to misreport their preferences.
       We have in mind three examples of survey-based preference measurement to which our
method could be applied. First, contingent valuation surveys often elicit respondents’ marginal
rates of substitution between different policies or between a policy and money (i.e., willingness
to pay).
       Second, much research on subjective well-being (SWB) treats the response to a SWB
survey question, typically regarding happiness or life satisfaction, as a proxy for utility and
estimates how policies affect it. Unlike contingent valuation or policy referendums, this approach
sidesteps respondents’ policy misconceptions or lack of information; and relative to traditional
market-based indicators such as GDP, SWB data may capture a broader range of aspects of well-
being (e.g., Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, 2009). However, evidence indicates that people make
choices that systematically deviate from what they believe would maximize their responses to
commonly-used SWB measures (Benjamin, Heffetz, Kimball, and Rees-Jones, 2012, 2013),
suggesting that a single-question SWB measure is inadequate as a utility proxy.
       The primary application we have in mind is estimating the effects of policy on responses
to a range of SWB questions that capture distinct aspects of well-being, including, for example,
own and family happiness, health, security, and freedoms. The effect of policy on utility can be
estimated as a weighted average of the effect of policy on these responses, with the weights
derived from a separate survey that elicits individuals’ marginal rates of substitution across

                                                  2
aspects of well-being.1 The theory and methods for combining responses to multiple SWB
questions into a utility proxy are developed in a companion paper (Benjamin, Heffetz, Kimball,
and Szembrot, 2012).


I. Key Properties
        As our setup, we imagine a government agency that conducts a national survey—along
the lines of one of the above examples—and uses it to estimate local preferences over policies.
Our proposed mechanism for aggregating these preferences to yield a local policy change has
four defining features.
        First, the mechanism treats all individuals symmetrically. Second, it treats the preference
data as ordinal and non-comparable across individuals. When aggregating policy effects on a
SWB-based utility proxy, non-comparability is important not only because of well-known
objections to assuming interpersonal comparability of utility, but also because different people
might use the SWB response scales differently.
        Third, the mechanism is local in using only the orientation of indifference surfaces in the
neighborhood of a status-quo policy vector, and in generating a marginal adjustment of policy.
Two attractions of a local approach to social choice are that local policy effects can be estimated
empirically more credibly than global effects, and that designing policy de novo is usually less
practical than adjusting policy (cf. Feldstein, 1976). Moreover, in the particular context of SWB
data, we believe that using these data in a limited way (as a supplement to more familiar inputs
to policy-making) is prudent because the enterprise is still exploratory and untested.
        Finally, the mechanism is what we call “first-order strategy-proof” (FOSP). The
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem rules out a mechanism being strategy-proof for all possible
preferences; FOSP means strategy-proofness when indifference surfaces over policies are linear.
That is, in the mechanism-design problem where each such individual reports her local
preferences to the government agency, the mechanism makes truthful reporting a dominant
strategy. Hence if the agency estimates policy preferences from SWB data, answering the SWB



  1
     While such a combination of SWB measures may be the best available candidate for a survey-based utility
proxy, we emphasize the need for work to deal with a variety of issues that bedevil the measurement of SWB (see,
e.g., Adler, 2012), which we do not address. In addition, there are many econometric challenges to identifying the
effects of policy on SWB responses. For example, a policy might affect an individual’s use of the response scale.

                                                        3
survey honestly is a dominant strategy. More generally, since any smooth indifference surface is
locally linear, FOSP makes the gains from misreporting second order.
        While incentive-compatibility has been a concern in the contingent valuation literature, it
is virtually unmentioned in the SWB literature. Indeed, there are reasons not to worry: any single
individual would have negligible effect on policy but may incur a psychic cost from being
dishonest, and many ways of advantageously manipulating responses would be hard to figure out
because the survey responses only matter indirectly for policy (via the agency’s estimates of
policy effects).
        Nonetheless, we would be worried if there were easy ways to advantageously manipulate
policy, because interest groups could organize their members to do so.2 FOSP rules out many
straightforward incentives for survey-response manipulation.


II. The Aggregation Mechanism
        Suppose that there are P ≥ 1 policies. Each element of                               represents the
level of one policy and is a real number that the government can adjust independently of other
policies. (It is straightforward to recast the policy vector to eliminate dependencies—e.g., those
due to a budget constraint—by reducing the dimensionality of the policy space.) Let                     denote
the status-quo policy vector. There are Θ > 1 types in the population, defined by having identical
preferences over policies (a reduced-form representation of the effects of policies on the
arguments of utility). For each type , let            denote its fraction of the population. Let
denote its ordinal utility as implied by its survey responses, which—allowing for misreporting—
is not necessarily the same as             , its true ordinal utility. We assume that each              and
is continuously differentiable, and hence we can locally approximate them as linear.
        A government agency conducts a national survey and, for each type , uses the survey

responses to estimate the marginal rates of substitution,                  , across each pair of policies j and


  2
      For example, if SWB survey responses were treated as cardinal and added up to get a “social welfare
function”—as is done implicitly in empirical work that estimates effects of policy on SWB averaged across all
individuals—individuals could increase their impact on policy by spreading their responses to make use of the entire
SWB response scale. To take an example that treats SWB data as ordinal, suppose that the equivalent variation of a
policy were estimated as the change in income required to hold SWB constant—as is commonly done in the SWB
literature—and these money-metric utilities were used for guiding policy. Then individuals could magnify their
weight in policymaking by making their reported SWB less sensitive to changes in income—say, by answering the
SWB question while focusing on non-income-related aspects of well-being.

k. Let                              and                          respectively denote the gradients at            of

the (survey-based) utility-proxy and the (unobserved) utility. 3 The agency’s aggregation
mechanism is its algorithm for mapping the                ’s into a policy change            .
          Since the P policies are measured in different units (e.g., tax rate vs. dollars of spending),
it is necessary to define what is meant by a “local change” in each policy. For each policy j, let
the exogenous distance-metric parameter                      denote the amount of change corresponding to
“1 policy-unit.” Three considerations may inform how the                  ’s are set. First, since the
mechanism assumes that the indifference surfaces are linear, the policy units should be small
enough that this approximation is likely to be good based on prior beliefs. Second, since 1 policy
unit will be the maximum Euclidean distance that the mechanism can prescribe,                      should be
small enough that policymakers are comfortable entrusting                  amount of policy j to be
determined by survey data. Third, the relative            ’s can correspond to intuitive judgments of
similar-sized changes. The mechanism’s key properties do not depend on the values of the                         's
but, as we discuss in section IV below, these values would matter in practice.
          Define the matrix             diag                   . Note that any policy change           in natural
units is the change                 in policy units, and any utility gradient         corresponds to
when the policy change is measured in policy units. If                           , define the “normalized

gradient”                      , which is the utility-proxy gradient in policy units, normalized to have

length 1. If                    , define             .
Example: Imagine two types, Young and Old, and two policies, the federal tax on distilled
spirits and spending on national parks. Suppose the relevant government agency estimates that a
$1 increase in the tax per proof gallon on distilled spirits increases the utility proxy of the Old by
3 units and decreases the utility proxy of the Young by 3 units. The agency also estimates that a
$100-million increase in spending on national parks decreases the Old’s utility proxy by 2 units
                                                                                     utils         utils
and increases the Young’s by 3 units. With these data,              Old                                    and
                                                                                per proof gallon    mil.

    We assume local non-satiation except at a bliss point. Then, without loss of generality, we choose a monotonic
transformation for     and such that neither          nor          is an inflection point. This ensures that     if
and only if   is a bliss point of   , and           if and only if     is a bliss point of     .

             In order to apply the mechanism, the agency must pin down the policy units. Suppose
that one policy unit corresponds to a $1.25 per proof gallon change in the tax on distilled spirits,
or a $125 million change in federal funding for the National Park Service:                                                                                per proof
gallon and                             million.

             As illustrated in Figure 1, each is a vector of length 1 that points in the direction of
maximal increase in the utility proxy for the group.

             The aggregation mechanism is:


                                                                                       Θ




In words, the policy change (in policy units) is the weighted sum of the normalized gradients,
with weights equal to population shares.
Example (continued): Suppose that the population shares are                                                                     Old     2/5 and   Young   3/5. The

mechanism prescribes a policy change (in policy units) of

                    . Figure 2 illustrates this vector addition, with the resultant policy change from
to         shown by the solid vector. Converting back to natural units: reduce the tax by
             per proof gallon                                per proof gallon, and increase spending on national parks by
                                                          million.


             To see that the mechanism is FOSP, notice that it decentralizes the policy change: each
type contributes a vector (of fixed length) that it chooses via its survey responses. Each type
evaluates its most-preferred direction starting at                                                                                    (i.e., taking into account the
summed contributions of the other types), but with linear preferences, the most-preferred

                                                                                   6
direction there is the same as at       . Therefore, each type does best by ensuring that the agency’s
estimate of its most-preferred direction at            is correct—i.e., that        is proportional to        .
         To provide some intuition regarding the form of the mechanism, consider the problem
faced by a social planner who directly observed the cardinal utilities of the individuals and
maximized a social welfare function,                       Θ   , where         is strictly increasing, strictly
concave, and continuously differentiable. To ensure that the policy change is local, we constrain
it to be at most 1 policy unit:

                                           Θ                   subject to

                                                   Θ
         The vector first-order condition is                                      , where          is the

Lagrange multiplier. Hence the optimal                    has length 1 policy unit and direction
  Θ
                  . Notice that our mechanism is this solution, except: (i)                 is replaced by

(because respondents are treated symmetrically); (ii)                    is replaced by           (because only

a survey-based gradient is available, and it must be normalized since its magnitude has no
meaning); and (iii) our mechanism changes policy by less than 1 policy unit unless all types have
the same local preferences.
         This set of observations yields three insights. First, a (non-symmetric) variant of the
mechanism could give different weights to different types (e.g., more weight to worse-off
individuals). Second, given that every type has an incentive to ensure that its                   is proportional
to its     , the direction of change yielded by the mechanism is optimal for the class of social

welfare functions satisfying                     for each . Therefore, if the agency had only ordinal

preference data but were not concerned about incentive-compatibility, it might nonetheless use
the mechanism to determine the direction of policy change—but then implement a change of 1
policy unit. Finally, the inefficiency that arises from changing policy by less than 1 policy unit
can be interpreted as the social cost incurred by having FOSP. As illustrated in Figure 3, if the
policy change were instead guaranteed to have length 1 policy unit, then in general there would
be an incentive to misreport one’s preferences.4

  4
    An alternative way of motivating the mechanism—as if it were balancing social welfare against a quadratic cost
of change—generates a smaller policy change when there is disagreement, even if one leaves aside any concern
about truthful reporting. Intuitively, at an optimum, the marginal cost of change in dimension j (proportional to
    ) is equal to the marginal social benefit, which is smaller with more disagreement.

                                                         7
III. Additional Properties
       The mechanism satisfies a local version of the Paretian principle: if some direction of
policy change would make all groups better off, then the mechanism will implement change in
that direction. Formally, for any policy-change vector     such that                    for all , it
                   Θ
follows that                             and hence                     . This property implies that,

even if respondents have divergent interests on some policy dimensions, the mechanism will find
and implement changes on policy dimensions where respondents’ interests coincide. The
mechanism can even disfavor policies, such as certain restrictions on trade, that benefit a few
individuals a great deal but hurt almost everyone else a little bit.
       Another important property is that, when P > 1, each type has more influence on the
policy change along the policy dimensions where a marginal adjustment matters relatively more
to that type. Consequently, the direction prescribed by the mechanism can depend on which and
how many dimensions are included. Figure 4 illustrates an example with three types that have
equal population weights. With only information about preferences over policy dimension 1
                                                              Θ
(Figure 4b), the mechanism, which specializes to                       sign      , prescribes an

increase in policy 1. Incorporating information about preferences over dimension 2 (Figure 4a),
however, the mechanism prescribes a decrease in policy 1. Since including more dimensions
uses more information on tradeoffs, the mechanism ideally would be used with as many policy
dimensions included as possible.


IV. Discussion
       The mechanism’s biggest practical limitation may be the degrees of freedom afforded by
the several considerations that inform the choice of the     ’s. All else equal, with a larger       the
mechanism will generate a policy change that is relatively larger in magnitude in dimension j; it
could also reverse the direction of change in another dimension (in Figure 4, changing             from
zero to positive reverses dimension 1’s direction of change). To minimize the risk of
manipulation by government (which is akin to agenda-setting), it is crucial that the agency that
determines the     ’s be independent and non-political.



                                                   8
        Since in practice the mechanism would be likely to be applied iteratively, the most urgent
next step is to understand its dynamic properties. Our preliminary analysis suggests that if
individuals differ in their preferences but truthfully report them, the iterated mechanism could in
some circumstances have a limit cycle. We view such non-convergence as an undesirable
property similar in spirit to the intransitivity of voting—a limitation that the public seems willing
to tolerate in democracies. Moreover, any social-preference ordering that uses only local
information about individuals’ preferences will be intransitive (Fleurbaey, Suzumura, and
Tadenuma, 2005); indeed, it is well-known that widely-used criteria such as compensating
variation share this limitation.
        We view this paper primarily as a first step that merits further development. Nonetheless,
there are several immediately actionable implications for empirical researchers that would
facilitate exploring realistic applications of the mechanism. First, researchers should report the
quantile of SWB respondents at which the estimated effect of a policy is zero; the mechanism as
applied only to that policy dimension would dictate adjustment proportional to the implied vote
margin. Second, when studying the effect of more than one policy, researchers should report the
marginal rate of substitution between policies. Third, researchers should report policy effects on
different subgroups of the population in order to move toward identifying types and analyzing
the implied tradeoffs between them.
