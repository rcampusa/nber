This paper addresses whether macro news arrivals affect currency markets over time. The null from

macro exchange-rate theory is that they do not: macro news is impounded in ex-change rates

instantaneously. We test this by examining the effects of news on subsequent trades by end-user

participants (such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and non-financial corpo-rations). News arrivals

induce subsequent changes in trading in all of the major end-user segments. These induced changes

remain significant for days. Induced trades also have per-sistent effects on prices. Currency markets

are not responding to news instantaneously.

                  Do Currency Markets Absorb News Quickly?



         This paper addresses an important null hypothesis within exchange-rate theory: that
macro news is impounded in exchange rates instantaneously. This is typically understood to mean
a matter of seconds, or perhaps minutes (e.g., 5 to 10), but certainly contained within the day of
news arrival. We test this by examining the effects of news on subsequent currency trades by end-
user participants (such as hedge funds, mutual funds, and non-financial corporations). We find
that news arrivals induce subsequent changes in trading behavior in all of these major end-user
segments. These induced changes in trading remain significant for days. Induced trades also have
persistent effects on prices. These findings provide strong evidence that currency markets are not
responding to news instantaneously.
         Our basis for pursuing whether induced trades might prolong the absorption of news
comes from recent empirical work demonstrating a tight link between signed transaction volume
(order flow) and signed exchange rate changes.1 This link is not predicted by macro exchange rate
theory, but it is predicted by an alternative modeling framework from microstructure finance. In
this micro-based framework, transactions play a central, causal role in price determination (see,
e.g., Glosten and Milgrom 1985, Kyle 1985). The causal role arises because transactions convey
information that is not common knowledge. In this paper, we address whether the tight link
between price adjustment and order flow that exists in general might also be playing a role in how
currency markets absorb news.
         Most of the existing literature linking exchange rates to news is event-study based, and
does not address how transaction quantities respond to news (i.e., it addresses the link between
news and price in isolation). This literature has two branches. The first addresses the direction of
exchange-rate changes (first moments) and the second, later branch addresses exchange-rate
volatility (second moments). A common finding of the first branch is that, at least at the daily
frequency, directional effects from scheduled macro announcements are difficult to detect
because they are swamped by other factors affecting price. Intraday event studies do find
statistically significant effects, particularly for employment and money-supply announcements


1
  This evidence is from both micro (i.e., single marketmaker) and macro (marketwide) studies. On the micro side, see,
e.g., Lyons (1995) and Bjonnes and Rime (2004). On the macro side, see, e.g., Evans and Lyons (2002a,b), Payne
(2003), Osler (2004), and Bjonnes, Rime, and Solheim (2004). Order flow is the cumulation over time of signed trades,
where trades are signed according to whether the initiating side is buying or selling. (The marketmaker posting the
quote is the non-initiating side.)



                                                         1
(Andersen et al. 2003).2 The second, later branch of this literature—which focuses on news
effects on volatility—is partly a response to early difficulty in finding news effects on first
moments.3 This work finds that arrival of scheduled announcements does indeed produce the
largest exchange-rate changes. Nevertheless, the ability of these fundamentals to account for
overall volatility changes is lower than that of less fundamental factors such as time-of-day
effects and ARCH (Andersen and Bollerslev 1998).
          A more recent literature has emerged that addresses the currency market’s response to
news as a joint quantity/price response (Carlson 2002, Danielsson et al. 2003, Evans and Lyons
2003). Carlson (2002), for example, takes a case-study approach and analyzes a single macro
announcement arrival. He finds that market characteristics were affected for hours following the
arrival. (For example, liquidity remained significantly below normal—and below its ex ante
state—for about 2 hours.) The case-study approach leaves open the question of how systematic
these prolonged market effects are, and whether they might extend beyond the day of news
arrival. The work of Danielsson et al. (2003) and Evans and Lyons (2003) provides less intraday
resolution than Carlson, but these papers do examine multiple news arrivals over periods of
months, and thereby do provide and sense for whether quantity responses to news are systematic.
(Both papers find, for example, that roughly half of the transmission of news to prices actually
operates through induced order flows.) Nevertheless, given sample sizes measured only in
months, both of these papers have to aggregate across arrivals of very different news types. The
limited sample sizes also restrict them to examining only induced transaction effects intraday—
neither paper addresses whether the absorption of news is prolonged over more extended periods.
          Our paper departs from earlier work in three main ways. First, our analysis is based on
the induced trades of currency-market end users. All three of the papers noted in the previous
paragraph use quantity data that reflects trades between marketmakers only (i.e., interbank
trades).4 This is relevant for the question that we address because, relative to end users, market-
maker reactions to news are unlikely to be as protracted. Second, our data span over 6 years, a
much longer sample than is used in existing work on the joint quantity/price response to news.
This allows us to treat individual announcement types separately, without aggregating them into

  See, for example, Goodhart et al. (1993), DeGennaro and Shrieves (1997), and Andersen and Bollerslev (1998). See
also the work on bond prices and announcements, e.g., Fleming and Remolona (1999), Balduzzi et al. (2001), Fleming
(2002), and Green (2002). The latter two papers are especially relevant in that they use direct measures of order flow in
fixed income markets. Green (2002), for example, finds evidence that asymmetric information increases following
public macro announcements.

composite news measures. We find, in fact, that different announcement types have quite
different effects on induced transactions, which is consistent with the findings of earlier work that
addresses the news/price link in isolation. Third, and also related to the sample length, we are
able to address whether the market’s absorption of news is genuinely protracted, which here we
take to mean that it extends beyond the intraday dynamics addresses elsewhere.
         The remainder of the paper is in four sections. Section 1 describes our data and presents
descriptive statistics. Section 2 addresses identification, specifically, our approach to identifying
effects of news on trades and prices. Section 3 presents our analysis of how news affects trades
and prices beyond the arrival day. Section 4 concludes.


1. Data and Descriptive Statistics
         This paper uses transaction data on end-user customers, which is a qualitative departure
from other micro-approach analysis of exchange rates and news. These data are from Citibank
and cover all of the customer trades that Citibank executed in the USD/EUR market from April
11, 1993 to June 30, 1999.5 (Prior to the euro’s launch in January, 1999, these trades correspond
to the trades of all the euro component currencies against the USD.) Citibank is among the top
three currency marketmakers worldwide, with a market share for end-user customers around 10
percent (major currencies against the dollar). These transactions data are daily aggregates—
intraday data were not available to us. (Any trades with end-users that are executed over a
weekend—relatively rare—are included in Monday order flows, so each trading week has five
days.) Days begin in this dataset at 00:00 GMT. This timing applies to both the end-user
transactions and to the daily log exchange rate changes (the latter also from Citibank). Hence-
forth, we shall refer to daily log exchange rate changes as “returns”. (Prior to the Euro’s launch,
exchange rates for the euro against the dollar are synthesized from the underlying bilateral rates
against the dollar, using the respective weights in the euro.)
         Advantages of the data are many. First, the data span more that six years, so analysis of
announcements that arrive only monthly is possible. Second, the data include both spot and
forward trades, but are netted of any trades in FX swaps (because FX swaps do not have net order
flow implications—they correspond to offsetting purchases and sales). Third, and perhaps most


4
  Moreover, these other micro-approach papers consider only aggregate trade processes, whereas we analyze end-user
trades at a disaggregated level, i.e., six different segments.
5
  Osler (2002) also obtains data on FX customer trades directly from a private bank. Her focus is stop-loss and take-
profit orders. She shows that clustering of these orders at particular prices helps to explain two familiar predictions
from technical analysis, namely that (1) trends tend to be reversed at support and resistance levels and (2) trends tend
to gain momentum if support and resistance levels are breached.



                                                           3
importantly, the data are split into three customer-type categories: non-financial corporations—
henceforth “Corporations”, unleveraged financial institutions (e.g., mutual funds)—henceforth
“Investors”, and leveraged financial institutions (e.g., hedge funds)—henceforth “Traders”.6 At
Citibank over this period, the total end-user trading volume in USD/EUR across the three
categories is roughly equal (for additional detail on relative volumes across segments in these
data, see Lyons 2001). In addition to the three-segment breakdown by participant type, the dataset
also distinguishes customer trades that were executed with Citibank’s US-based marketmakers
versus those executed elsewhere within Citibank’s global trading operation (referred to as “non-
US”). Thus, the end-user transactions are partitioned into six non-overlapping segments,
corresponding to three participant types times two trade locations.
         Our announcement data are from International Money Market Services (MMS). These
include real-time data on both expected and announced macro variables, from which we construct
time series of macro news. Our sample includes 30 US and 13 German scheduled announce-
ments. (For a list, see the second column of Table 2.) The expectation for each announcement is
based on the median response from a survey of approximately forty money managers on the
Friday of the week before the announcement. These data have been used in many earlier studies
(see, for example, Urich and Watchel 1984, Balduzzi et al. 2001, and Andersen et al. 2003). We
follow this literature by constructing for each announcement a time series of standardized news.
Specifically, the standardized news in announcement i on day t is:

                                                            Vi ,t − Ei ,t
                                                  ni ,t =                                                          (1)
                                                                 σˆ i

where Vi ,t is the value announced for variable i, Ei ,t is the survey expectation of Vi ,t , and σˆ i is

the sample standard deviation of Vi ,t − Ei ,t across announcement days t.7 Both US and German

announcements are made on fixed days, so the daily timing of each announcement is known in
advance. We set ni ,t = 0 on days for which no announcement is scheduled.



6
  A natural question is where the trades of central banks appear. The source of these data is reluctant to disclose the
specifics. Though not addressed here, the source bank does maintain a fourth category of customer called “miscellane-
ous.” This fourth category is likely to include any central bank trades for which the source bank was the counterparty.
(Trading volume within this fourth category is quite small relative to volume in the three main categories, consistent
with the fact that central bank trades in the USD/EUR market were quite small over this period relative to private
trades.)
7 The Fed Funds Rate is one of our news items. Announcements about Fed Funds come from the series constructed by

Brandt et al. (2001), kindly provided by Kenneth Kavajecz. Expectations for the Funds rate come from the MMS
survey.

         Though the daily frequency of our transaction data do not permit intraday analysis, there
is an important advantage to daily analysis that deserves note. Daily data provide a solid
indication of price effects at lower frequencies (i.e., those more familiar to macroeconomists,
such as monthly) because the daily frequency is the highest at which the nominal exchange rate
can be reliably described as a martingale. Any empirical model that explains daily price incre-
ments is therefore relevant for explaining exchange rate levels at long horizons (i.e., one cannot
sensibly argue that daily price movements are rapidly dissipating). This martingale property at the
daily frequency does not apply to intraday prices, which exhibit mean reversion (see, e.g., Evans
2002).


Descriptive Statistics
         Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the main variables that we model below, spe-
cifically, the daily exchange rate return, the aggregate daily end-user order flow, and the six
disaggregated end-user order-flow segments. ∆pt denotes the difference between the log spot rate

($/€) at the end of days t and t-1, and ∆xtj denotes the order flow for euros from segment j during
day t. Note from row 1 that there is no evidence of unconditional serial correlation in daily FX
returns (p-values in parentheses). This means that if news is to have prolonged effects on prices, it
must come from conditioning on order flows. In contrast, there is evidence of autocorrelation in
the order flow segments; the autocorrelation coefficients are small, but many are highly statisti-
cally significant. From the correlation matrix, we see that order flow segments are not particularly
strongly correlated among themselves at the daily frequency. But order flows are strongly
correlated with returns (less so, however, than interdealer data; see Evans and Lyons 2002a).
         Figure 1 provides complimentary evidence on the relation between the different order
flow segments. Panel A shows that order flows executed at US and non-US locations diverge
quite significantly in the last two years of the sample. The origins of this divergence can be seen
in Panels B–D. Corporate order flows for the euro have been generally negative, but much more
so at non-US than US locations. By contrast, Investor order flows were generally positive, but the
rise in order flow from non-US Investors led US Investors by several years. (We shall refer to
investor flow executed outside the US as coming from non-US Investors, though strictly
speaking, we cannot distinguish the location of the Investor from the location of the trade
execution; similarly for the other segments.) Order flow originating from US and non-US Traders
diverge sharply after 1995. The message conveyed by Figure 1 is that the low daily correlations




                                                 5
between the different order-flow segments reported in Table 1 translate into sizable cumulative
differences over months and years.


2. Identifying News Effects on Trades and Prices
         One can think of the information in news as having two components. The first component
is a common-knowledge (or “mean”) part: all agents agree about the appropriate impact of this
first part on the exchange rate. In macro models of news in currency markets, this first part is the
whole story: it fully characterizes the instantaneous adjustment of exchange rates to news. The
second component is the part whose implication for the exchange rate is not common knowledge.
It is this second part that is impounded in exchange rates via induced trading. Suppose, for
example, that all agents do not have access to the same technology for transforming the macro
data into an exchange rate forecast. The resulting inferences drawn are not known by the
marketmakers a priori. How do marketmakers aggregate the information in these inferences? The
answer from microstructure theory is that they learn from the sequence of submitted orders over
time. In this case, price adjusts instantaneously to the marketmaker’s rational expectation of the
market’s interpretation (this is the first of the two components), and then goes through a period of
gradual adjustment caused by the sequence of transacted orders.8
         With respect to response time, remember that the announcements that we address here are
scheduled, so participants can plan their responses (conditional on realizations) in advance. This
is likely to lower response lags considerably relative to unscheduled news. In this sense, our tests
for whether market responses to news are protracted are conservative tests. Note, too, that the
model that we present below is capturing average responses (i.e., the total average response,
including the induced order flow effects). This is distinct from second-moment effects, i.e.,
effects on volatility. In fact, in response to news, order flow and price are also (jointly) more
volatile, which adds a dimension to the first-moment analysis that we do here. Addressing
directly these second-moment effects would take us too far afield from our central question, so
we do not take it on within this paper.


The Empirical Model

         Our aim is to study the impact of news announcements on spot rates and order flows in


8
  From our observations of how the FX market absorbs macro news in practice, some price adjustment by marketmak-
ers does indeed occur rapidly, though generally not a lot, and this initial adjustment involves little apparent role for
flow. But informal observation also makes it clear that news regularly induces follow-on trading by end-user
customers, whose trading responses are not instantaneous.

the days following the announcement. For this purpose, we model the daily dynamics of prices
and order flows as a 7-variable, kth-order VAR:

                        ∆pt      ∆pt −1     ∆pt − 2         ∆pt − k   et 

                                                                            

where ∆pt denotes the difference between the log spot rate ($/€) at the end of days t and t-1, and

∆xtj denotes the order flow for euros from segment j during day t. Daily innovations to the spot

rate and the 6 order flows are denoted by et and utj , respectively. These innovations are driven,
in part, by macro announcements according to:


                                           et = ∑ i =1 β i ni ,t + ξt ,
                                                     M
                                                                                                    (3)


                                          utj = ∑ i =1 βi j ni ,t + ζ t j
                                                     M
                                                                            j = 1, 2,…6,            (4)

where M is the number of announcement types (43 in our case) and ni ,t is the standardized news

arising from announcement i on day t. The ξt and ζ t j shocks represent the sources of spot rate
and order flow innovations that are uncorrelated with the news announcements. These shocks
may be correlated. For example, shocks to order flow during the day may lead marketmakers to
revise their quoted prices. Alternatively, unexpected price movements during the day may induce
a change in order flow (via feedback trading). Our model does not restrict the correlation between
the ξt and ζ t j shocks.

        The effects of announcements are identified by the β coefficients: βι identifies the

effect of news in announcement i on the log spot rate; while β i j indicates how the news affects the
jth order flow segment. Notice that none of the coefficients identify the intra-day transmission
mechanism through which the spot rate and order flow changes take place. For example, news
may affect the spot rate directly because it induces marketmakers to change their quotes. News
may also affect spot rates because marketmakers change their quotes in response to induced order
flow. Our model does not distinguish between this direct and indirect transmission channel (see
Evans and Lyons 2003 for a model that does distinguish them). The βι coefficient simply

identifies the total daily effect of the ith news item. Similarly, β i j coefficient indicates the total
daily effect of news on order flow.


                                                         7
         Our model enables us to focus on three issues: (i) If news affects order flow, do the
effects persist beyond the day of the announcement? (ii) If news affects spot rates, are all the
effects confined to the day of the announcement? (iii) Do news-induced order flows generate
price movements after the announcement day?
         All these questions can be readily addressed by computing impulse response functions.
Specifically, we can trace out the impact of the news in announcement i on the spot rate and order
flows using the estimates of βι and β i j , together with the VAR coefficients in the Ak matrices.

For example, let {Bˆ k }∞k = 0 denote the sequence of matrices that define the vector moving average

representation of the estimated VAR (with B̂0 = I ), and let bˆi ' = [ βˆi , βˆi1 ,… βˆi6 ] be the vector of
estimated β coefficients for the news in announcement i. The estimated impact of a one standard
deviation news shock on the exchange rate return k periods after the announcement is given by
                 ˆ ˆ , while the impact on the jth order flow is given by row j+1 of Bb
the first row of Bb                                                                  ˆˆ.
                    i                                                                  i

         To determine the statistical significance of our estimated impulse responses we conduct a
series of Monte Carlo experiments. Each experiment imposes a particular null hypothesis on the
β coefficients used in generating pseudo data samples. Let βˆ 0 denote the matrix of estimated β
coefficients under the null (specified below). We compute Monte Carlo p-values under the null as
follows: First we draw a sequence for {ξt , ζ t1 …ζ t6 }Tt =1 from N (0, Σˆ ) , where Σ̂ is the estimated

covariance matrix of { ξt , ζ t1 …ζ t6 } and T is the number of trading days in our sample. We then

combine these pseudo shocks with the actual data on news and βˆ 0 to compute a set of VAR
innovations under the null according to equations (3) and (4). From these innovations, we use
equation (2) together with the estimates of the VAR coefficients in Ak to generate a pseudo time

series for ∆pt and ∆xtj (the pre-sample estimates of ∆pt and ∆xtj are set equal to zero). With this
generated data, we next estimate the VAR and the β coefficients with the null hypothesis
imposed. From these estimates, we then compute the impulse response functions. The Monte
Carlo distribution under the null is constructed from the empirical distribution of the impulse
responses computed from 1000 pseudo data sets.


3. News Effects on Trades and Prices Beyond the Arrival Day
         Our main results are presented in a series of five tables, Tables 2-6. Table 2 reports our
estimates of the β coefficients from the model in equations (2)-(4), i.e., the coefficients that
determine the effects of news arrivals on innovations in our VAR. Table 3 describes the dynamics


                                                     8
of segment order flows over the days following news arrival (in the form of impulse responses).
Table 4 addresses the dynamics of segment order flows in a different way: it presents the variance
of order flow due to news as a percentage of the order-flow variance due to all shocks. Tables 5
and 6 parallel Tables 3 and 4: they describes return dynamics, first as impulse responses (Table
5), and then in the form of the ratio of return variance due to news relative to return variance due
to all shocks.


Effects of News Arrivals on VAR Innovations
        Table 2 reports the estimates of the β coefficients using innovations from a second-order
VAR (where the order of the VAR was determined using the BIC information criterion). The
column labeled #N shows the number of announcements over the 6+ year sample period. To
interpret the “Returns” column, note that a positive shock of one standard deviation to non-farm
employment (announcement 23) leads to a 24 basis point appreciation of the dollar (reduces the
dollar price of a euro). Beyond non-farm employment, which is the biggest coefficient in the
Return column, nine other news items have a significant impact on spot rates at the 5% level.
Andersen et al. (2003) also find that news concerning non-farm employment has the largest
impact of spot rates, but their intra-day estimate using a 5-minute sampling frequency is
approximately half the size found here. (One possibility for this discrepancy is that our estimate
also incorporates the impact on returns from news-generated order flows that occur the same
day.) As a rule, more news items have significant effects on order flows than on returns. For
example, news about non-farm employment has a large and statistically significant impact on
order flow from US traders. To interpret these “Order Flow” columns, note that a positive shock
of one standard deviation to non-farm employment induces sales of Euros (purchases of Dollars)
equal to approximately $29m.


Order Flow Dynamics Following News
        Table 3 describes the dynamics of segment order flows over the days following news
arrival (in the form of impulse responses). Since there are 6 flow segments and 43 news items, we
focus on those news items that have a significant impact (at the 5% level) on order flow on the
day of the announcement. For each news item meeting this criterion, the table reports the impulse
response of the order flow registering the largest initial impact. The table also reports the p-value
for the null hypothesis that the news item has no immediate impact on the order flow segment.
These p-values are computed from the Monte Carlo experiments described above with the




                                                 9
restriction that β i j = 0 for all i and j. (Note that while β i j = 0 under this null, news can still affect
order flows on the days following an announcement if the news affects spot rates and the effects
feed through to order flow via some form of feedback trading.) In all but two cases (Fed funds
news and Preliminary GDP news) news has a significant impact on order flow on at least one day
following the announcements. In most cases, the cumulative effect of the news on order flow
(shown in the last column) is also highly statistically significant.9
         Table 4 addresses the dynamics of segment order flows in terms of the ratio of order-flow
variance from news relative to order-flow variance from all shocks. Specifically, the table reports
how news shocks contribute to the variance of segment order flows over five days, starting with
the day of the announcement (i.e., one trading week). The set of news shocks and order flow
segments that we present are the same as those in Table 3. Announcement news is a non-trivial
source of daily variance in several of the order flow segments, particularly in the case of GDP and
consumption expenditures. The prolonged effects of news on some of the flow segments shows
up in the variance contributions 2–4 days after the announcement. To summarize, the evidence in
Tables 3 and 4 indicates that news does indeed affect order flows, and that the effects persist for
several days beyond the day of the announcement.


Return Dynamics Following News
         Do the news-induced order flows affect price? This question is addressed in Tables 5 and
6. These two tables parallel Tables 3 and 4: they describes return dynamics, first as impulse
responses (Table 5), and then in the form of the ratio of return variance due to news relative to
return variance due to all shocks. Specifically, Table 5 addresses the question of whether the
impact of news on returns persists beyond the day of the announcement. For perspective, recall
from Table 1 that there is no evidence of unconditional serial correlation in ∆pt , so one would not
expect to see any spot rate changes on days following announcements in the absence of order
flow effects on returns. Granger causality tests (unreported) show that lagged values of ∆pt have

no forecasting power for subsequent ∆pt (the p-value is 0.363). In contrast, order flows from US

Traders and US Investors do have forecasting power for ∆pt : the p-values are 0.002 and 0.079




9 These effects arise because order flows segments have forecasting power for other segments not because individual
segments are strongly autocorrelated (See Table 1). Granger causality tests (unreported) show eight cases of
statistically significant cross-segment Granger causality (i.e., order flow segment j Granger causes order flow segment
i).



                                                         10
respectively. This raises the possibility that news can have persistent effects on returns beyond
the day of the announcement via the long-lasting effects documented in Tables 3 and 4.10
         Table 5 focuses on the return dynamics induced by those news items whose immediate
impact is statistically significant at the 5% level. The table reports the impact of news on ∆pt on
the four days following the announcement (expressed as a percentage of the impact on the
announcement day). Thus, negative numbers reflect subsequent reversal over the days following
the initial news shock. For example, in the period following a positive shock of one standard
deviation in unemployment claims, the euro depreciated by approximately 17% of the initial
impact effect. The table also reports the p-value for the null hypothesis that the news item has no
immediate impact on any order flow segment. As above, these p-values are computed from the
Monte Carlo experiments with the restriction that β i j = 0 for all i and j. Under this null, news can
only affect returns on the days after an announcement via its impact on spot rates on the
announcement day.
         The last column reports the cumulative response over the four days following the an-
nouncement. In every case where the cumulative response appears significant at the 5% level, its
sign is negative. This indicates that the prolonged absorption of news identified by the model
tends to imply a systematic partial reversal of the initial price-impact. These reversals are largest
in the case of US news concerning unemployment claims and the trade balance.
         Table 6 reports how news contributes to the variance of daily returns over five days,
starting with the day of the announcement. As above, we report variance decompositions only for
the shocks studied in the spot rate impulse response functions. News about non-farm employment
makes a far larger contribution to the variance of daily returns on the day of the announcement
than news about the other items. Innovations to spot prices from all sources do not make a sizable
contribution to the variance of returns on the days that follow. (Recall from Table 1 that there is
little serial correlation in ∆pt .) However, insofar as they make some contribution, news shocks
account for a sizable fraction.


4. Conclusions
         This paper extends the literature on exchange rates and news in three main ways. First, no
other paper has addressed news using the trades of end-user customers. Indeed, most papers in
this area do not consider that prices and quantities are joint processes (i.e., they address the link


10This is not a violation of standard definitions of market efficiency: the market at a whole cannot condition on these
Citibank data—they are proprietary.



                                                         11
between news and price in isolation). Recent papers that do address these joint dynamics focus
exclusively on trades between marketmakers—i.e., interbank trades—rather than on trades of end
users (Carlson 2002, Danielsson, Love, and Payne 2003, Evans and Lyons 2003).11 This is
relevant for the question that we address because, relative to end users, marketmaker reactions to
news are unlikely to be as protracted. Second, on the methodological front, we introduce a novel
identification approach for isolating news shocks and their effects on trades and prices (specifi-
cally, our projection of the VAR innovations on news shocks). Third, our results provide forceful
evidence that currency markets are still absorbing news after several days. By “still absorbing”
we mean that end-user trades are still being induced, and these induced trades are having
persistent effects on prices.
         To understand how the market impact of news can be protracted, it is helpful to distin-
guish average news effects from total news effects. Average effects correspond to the direct (or
“rational-expectations”) channel for price impact, which one would expect to be reflected
immediately, i.e., more quickly than indirect, order-flow-driven effects. Even if average effects
from news are reflected in prices quickly, as found many past papers (e.g., Andersen and
Bollerslev 1998 and Cheung and Chinn 2001), this does not imply that total effects are reflected
quickly. Rather, participants’ macro views evolve continually, and trades induced by those
evolving views hit the market over extended periods. (Think, for example, of a mutual fund or
corporate treasury group that has a currency “strategy meeting” only, say, once per week.) This
idea links rather naturally to the analysis in Andersen et al. (2003): they find that the impact
effect of announcements—the average signed effect on price—is absorbed quite quickly, whereas
the initial effect on volatility is only partial, rising over time (and hour or more) and only later
decaying.
         What implications can be drawn from these results? First, the event-study approach to
measuring news effects, which is employed by virtually every paper in this large literature, does
not appear well-suited to capturing the total effect of news, given the protracted market absorp-
tion identified here. This under-estimate of total effects may be linked to what is arguably the
central puzzle in this literature—the puzzle of missing news effects, i.e., that past measures of
average news effects can account for only around 3 percent of total exchange rate variation
(Evans and Lyons 2003). Second, prices are affected by these protracted, news-related trades,
suggesting that markets are not treating them as inconsequential. (Put differently, the market is


11
  Moreover, these other micro-approach papers consider only aggregate trades processes, whereas we analyze end-
user trades at a disaggregated level, i.e., six different segments.




                                                     12
not identifying these induced trades as pure “animal spirits” and willingly taking the other side at
existing prices.) Third, we cannot rule out the possibility that the induced trades are in fact non-
rational. If the market as a whole is not large enough to absorb non-rational trades at existing
prices, or if the market cannot distinguish them from other trades that convey information, then
prices can be affected, despite the lack of any macro information content. Further work will be
needed to distinguish this non-rational interpretation from other possibilities. From our perspec-
tive, there are in fact three main hypotheses that further work will need to discriminate: (1) news-
induced trades are rational and convey incremental information about the true state of the macro-
economy; (2) news-induced trades are rational, but are motivated by risk management—e.g.,
portfolio rebalancing—rather than macro information; and (3) news-induced trades are non-
rational in some way, perhaps corresponding to the distinct cognitive biases identified within
behavioral finance. Distinguishing among these three hypotheses is an important frontier for
micro-based research on exchange rates.
