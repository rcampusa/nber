This paper studies the properties of a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model - a combination of a static two-good,
two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and a two-sector growth model - with infinitely lived consumers
where international borrowing and lending are not permitted. We obtain two main results: First, even
if factor prices are equalized, countries that differ only in their initial endowments of capital per worker
may converge or diverge in income levels over time, depending on the elasticity of substitution between
traded goods. Divergence can occur for parameter values that would imply convergence in a world
of closed economies and vice versa. Second, factor price equalization in a given period does not imply
factor price equalization in future periods.

1. Introduction

        In 2004, GDP per capita in the United States was roughly 40,000 U.S. dollars. Using
exchange rates to convert pesos to dollars, we calculate GDP per capita in Mexico in 2004 to be
roughly 6,500 U.S. dollars. In 1935, the United States had income per capita of about 6,600 2004
U.S. dollars. To predict what will happen in the Mexican economy over the next 70 years, should
we study what happened to the U.S. economy since 1935? Or should we take into account that, in
1935, the United States was the country with the highest income in the world, while, in 2004,
Mexico had a very large trade relation with the United States — a country with a level of income
per capita approximately six times larger? If we use a purchasing power comparison method to
calculate Mexican GDP per capita in 2004, we come up with 9,800 U.S. dollars, which was
roughly the U.S. level in 1941, but the qualitative nature of our question remains the same.
        Much of the discussion of convergence of income levels in traditional growth theory relies
on models of closed economies. (See, for example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2003.) In this paper
we ask: Do the convergence results obtained in closed economy growth models change when we
introduce trade? Specifically, we consider a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model — a combination of
a static two-good, two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin trade model and a two-sector growth model — with
infinitely lived consumers where borrowing and lending are not permitted. We find that
introducing trade into the growth model radically changes the convergence results: In many
environments where income levels converge over time if the countries are closed, for example, they
diverge if the countries are open. This is because favorable changes in the terms of trade for poor
countries reduce their incentives to accumulate capital.
        The model that we use is a special case of the general dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model
studied by Bajona and Kehoe (2006). There are n countries that differ only in their population
sizes and their initial endowments of capital. There are two traded goods that are produced using
capital and labor; one of the goods is more capital intensive than the other. Time is discrete, and
there is a nontraded investment good that is produced using the two traded goods. Consumers have
utility functions that are homothetic and identical across countries. They combine the two traded
goods to obtain utility in the same manner as firms combine these goods to obtain the investment
good in the sense that the period utility function has the form u (c1t , c2t ) = log f (c1t , c2t ) , where f is

the production function of the investment good. As we will see, this assumption allows us to


                                                       1
reduce the calculation of equilibria in which all countries produce both traded goods in every
period to the calculation of an equilibrium of an appropriately specified one-sector model.
        The model that we study is both a classic Heckscher-Ohlin model and a classic growth
model in the sense that the two factors of production are identified as labor and physical capital. A
country that is capital abundant in the terminology of Heckscher-Ohlin theory is rich in the
terminology of growth theory. It would be straightforward to redo the analysis for a model in
which the two factors of production were labor and human capital. It would be more complicated
to extend the analysis to a model with more than two factors of production. Nevertheless, even in
models with more than two factors, we would expect the central message of this paper to carry
over: Consider a model of closed economies in which countries become richer because they
accumulate a factor, or factors, of production. Suppose that convergence in income levels is driven
by returns to a factor being higher in countries that are poorer because they have less of the factor.
Opening the economies in this model to international trade will reduce the returns to the factor,
thereby reducing incentives to accumulate the factor and reducing the tendency towards
convergence.
        There is a large literature that is at least partially related to the topic studied here. Bardhan
(1965) and Oniki and Uzawa (1965) study the patterns of specialization and trade in a Heckscher-
Ohlin model in which consumers have fixed savings rates. Deardorff and Hanson (1978) consider
a model in which these fixed savings rates differ across countries and show that the country with
the higher savings rate will export the capital intensive good in the steady state. Stiglitz (1970) also
considers models with fixed savings behavior, in this case a Marxian specification where all labor
income is consumed and all capital income is saved. In addition, he considers a model in which
there are infinitely lived, utility-maximizing consumers with different discount rates in each
country. Stiglitz studies the pattern of trade and specialization in the steady state of this model and
studies dynamic equilibrium paths in a small open economy version of the model.
        Chen (1992) studies the long-run equilibria of two-country, dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin
models with utility-maximizing agents and identical preferences in both countries under the
assumption that both countries produce both goods. He finds that there is a continuum of steady
states in such models and that, unless initial capital-labor ratios are equal, there is trade in the
steady state. Chen also shows that cycles are possible in such models when one good is the
consumption good and the other is the investment good if the consumption good is capital

                                                    2
intensive. Baxter (1992) considers a model similar to Chen’s but in which tax rates differ across
countries. She shows that the pattern of trade and specialization in the steady state is determined
by these taxes. Brecher, Chen, and Choudhri (2002) consider a model with differences in
technologies across countries. Nishimura and Shimomura (2002), Bond, Trask, and Wang (2003),
Doi, Nishimura, and Shimomura (2002), and Ono and Shibata (2005) study dynamic Heckscher-
Ohlin models with endogenous growth or externalities.
       A number of researchers have studied dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models using the small
open economy assumption: Findlay (1970), Mussa (1978), Smith (1984), Atkeson and Kehoe
(2000), Chatterjee and Shukayev (2004), and Obiols-Homs (2005). Atkeson and Kehoe and
Chatterjee and Shukayev are of particular relevance to our paper. Atkeson and Kehoe study a
model in which the rest of the world is in its steady state and the small open economy starts with
either a lower or a higher capital-labor ratio. They show that, if the small open economy is outside
the rest of the world’s cone of diversification, then the country converges to the boundary of this
cone. If the small country starts inside the cone of diversification, then it too is in steady state and
stays there. This result is in sharp contrast to our result that, for certain parameter values and initial
conditions, even if all countries start in the cone of diversification, some necessarily leave it.
Contrasting our results with those of Atkeson and Kehoe shows how strong their assumptions are
that the rest of the world is in its steady state and that there are no general equilibrium price effects.
Chatterjee and Shukayev consider a model similar to that of Atkeson and Kehoe in which there are
stochastic productivity shocks and show that, over time, the comparative advantage conferred by
different initial endowments can disappear over time.
       The paper most closely related to ours is Ventura (1997), who studies trade and growth in a
dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model with utility-maximizing consumers and identical preferences
across countries. He assumes that there are two traded goods — one capital intensive and one labor
intensive — that are used in consumption and investment. Ventura abstracts away from studying
the patterns of specialization by assuming that each good uses only one of the factors in its
production process. Under this assumption, all countries produce both goods independently of
their relative factor endowments. Ventura studies the evolution of capital stocks over time. Our
paper differs from his in that (1) we use discrete time rather than continuous time because it makes
it easier to obtain analytical results, although we show how our results can be extended to a
continuous-time version of the model, (2) we study the evolution of income levels as well as of

                                                    3
capital stocks, (3) we obtain conditions under which countries remain in the cone of diversification
and under which they leave it in models with more general production structures, and (4) we study
the possibility of equilibria in which one or more countries have zero investment in some periods, a
possibility that is present in Ventura’s (1997) model, but which is ignored. It is also worth
mentioning the work of Cuñat and Maffezzoli (2004), who present numerical experiments using a
three-good, two-factor version of the Ventura model.
        In this paper we study the patterns of trade, capital accumulation, and income growth over
time as a function of the countries’ initial relative endowments of capital and labor. We find, as
does Ventura (1997), that, if both countries diversify over the entire equilibrium path, the elasticity
of substitution between traded goods is crucial in determining convergence behavior. This is no
longer true when one of the countries specializes in production in some period. For a given
elasticity of substitution, whether countries converge or diverge depends on the pattern of
specialization over time. We present an example in which countries’ income levels converge in
equilibria without factor price equalization for an elasticity of substitution that implies divergence
in income for equilibria with factor price equalization along the equilibrium path. We also present
an example in which corner solutions in investment cause our convergence results to break down.

2. The general model

        There are n countries, i = 1,..., n . Each has a continuum of measure Li of identical,

infinitely lived consumer-workers, each of whom is endowed with k0i units of capital in period 0

and one unit of labor in every period t , t = 0,1,... . There are three goods in the economy: an
investment good, x , which is not traded, and two traded goods, y j , j = 1, 2 , which can be

consumed or used in the production of the investment good.
        Each traded good j , j = 1, 2 , is produced with a constant returns to scale technology that
uses capital, k , and labor, A :

                                            y j = φ j (k j , A j ) .                                   (1)

We assume that good 1 is relatively capital intensive and that the technologies are such that there
are no factor intensity reversals. Producers minimize costs taking prices as given and earn zero
profits. The first-order conditions from the producers’ problems are


                                                      4
                                      r ≥ p jφ jK (k j , A j ) , =              if k j > 0                (2)

                                      w ≥ p jφ jL (k j , A j ) , = if A j > 0                             (3)

for each j , j = 1, 2 , where r is the rental rate, w is the wage, and p j is the price of good j ,

j = 1, 2 . Additional subscripts — φ jK ( k j , A j ) , φ jL (k j , A j ) — denote partial derivatives.

       The investment good is produced according to the constant-returns production function

                                                        x = f ( x1 , x2 ) .                               (4)

Letting q be the price of the investment good, the first-order conditions for profit maximization are

                                       p1 ≥ qf1 ( x1 , x2 ) , = if x1 > 0                                 (5)

                                       p2 ≥ qf 2 ( x1 , x2 ) , = if x2 > 0 .                              (6)

       In each period, consumers decide how much of each traded good to consume, c1t , c2t and

how much capital to accumulate for the next period, kt +1 . We assume that there is no international
borrowing or lending. Bajona and Kehoe (2006) argue that allowing international borrowing and
lending ensures factor price equalization but results in indeterminacy of production and trade in
equilibrium.
       The representative consumer in country i solves the maximization problem

                                                         ∑
                                                              ∞
                                              max             t =0
                                                                     β t u (c1it , c2i t )

                                      s.t. p1t c1it + p2t c2i t + qti xti ≤ wti + rti kti                 (7)

                                                    kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti ≤ xti

                                                        c ijt ≥ 0 , xti ≥ 0

                                                             k0i ≤ k0i ,

where β , 0 < β < 1 is the common discount factor and δ , 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1 , is the depreciation rate.
       The feasibility condition for good j , j = 1, 2 , is

                                         ∑          Li (c ijt + x ijt ) = ∑ i =1 Li y ijt .
                                             n                                    n
                                             i =1
                                                                                                          (8)



                                                                     5
Labor and capital are perfectly mobile across sectors within a country, but not across countries.
Therefore, the feasibility conditions in each country i , i = 1,..., n , are

                                                 k1it + k2i t ≤ kti                                  (9)

                                                 Ai1t + Ai2t ≤ 1 .                                  (10)

Likewise, the investment good is nontraded and the feasibility condition in each country i is

                                               xti = f ( x1it , x2i t ) .                           (11)

It is easy to show that allowing for trade of the investment good would only generate indeterminacy
of trade in this model, without otherwise changing the set of equilibria.
        Before analyzing the properties of the model described above, we list the main assumptions
of the model:

A.1. There are n countries, which are populated by infinitely lived consumers. Countries differ
only in their population sizes, Li > 0 , and their initial endowments of capital, k0i > 0 .

A.2. There are two traded goods, which can be consumed or used in the production of the
investment good. The production functions of the traded goods, φ j (k , A) , are increasing, concave,

continuously differentiable, and homogeneous of degree one.

A.3. Traded good 1 is relatively capital intensive, and there are no factor intensity reversals: For
all k / A > 0,

                                         φ1L (k / A,1) φ2 L (k / A,1)
                                                      <               .                             (12)
                                         φ1K (k / A,1) φ2 K (k / A,1)

A.4. Labor and capital are perfectly mobile across sectors but are not mobile across countries.

A.5. There is an investment good in each country, which is not traded. The production function
for the investment good, f ( x1 , x2 ) , is increasing, concave, continuously differentiable, and
homogeneous of degree one.




                                                          6
A.6. The period utility function u (c1 , c2 ) is homothetic, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and

twice continuously differentiable, and it satisfies lim c j →0 u j (c1 , c2 ) = ∞ .


Definition 1: An equilibrium of the world economy is sequences of prices, { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti } ,

consumptions, investments, and capital stocks {c1it , c2i t , xti , kti } , production plans for the traded

goods, { y ijt , k ijt , Aijt } , and production plans for the investment goods { xti , x1it , x2i t } , such that:

1. Given prices { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti } , the consumptions and capital stocks {c1it , c2i t , kti } solve the

     consumers’ problem (7).

2. Given prices { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti } , the production plans { y ijt , k ijt , Aijt } and { xti , x1it , x2i t } satisfy the

     cost minimization and zero profit conditions (2), (3), (5), and (6).

3. The consumption, capital stock, {c1it , c2i t , kti } , and production plans, { y ijt , k ijt , Aijt } and

     {x , x
        i
        t
             i
             1t   , x2i t } , satisfy the feasibility conditions (1), (4), (8), (9), (10), and (11).


            Notice that, since trade equalizes the prices of the traded goods across countries, the prices
of the investment good are also equal, qti = qt . Since the cost minimization problems are the same

across countries, this is true even if some country i does not produce the investment good in period
t . The homogeneity of the budget constraints in (7) and the cost minimization and zero profit
conditions (2), (3), (5), and (6) in current period prices allow us to impose a numeraire in each
period. We set

                                                          qt = 1 , t = 0,1,...                                                    (13)

            It is worth noting that the assumption of no international borrowing and lending implies that
trade balance holds:

                                        p1t ( y1it − c1it − x1it ) + p2t ( y2i t − c2i t − x2i t ) = 0 .                          (14)

This condition can be derived from the budget constant in the consumer’s problem (7) and the cost
minimization and zero profit conditions (2), (3), (5), and (6).



                                                                      7
Definition 2. A steady state of the world economy is consumption levels, an investment level, and

                      {               }                                                                      {           }

appropriate initial endowments of capital, k0i = kˆi . Here we set ν t = νˆ for all t , where ν
represents a generic variable.

            We say that a steady state is a nontrivial steady state if at least one of the countries has a
positive level of capital in that steady state: kˆ i > 0 for some i = 1,..., n.
            The steady state results for general dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models with infinitely lived
consumers derived in Bajona and Kehoe (2006) apply to the Ventura model. The following
propositions state them without proof.

Proposition 1: Under assumptions A.1-A.6, in any nontrivial steady state factor prices are
equalized.

Proposition 2: Under assumptions A.1-A.6, if there exists a nontrivial steady state, then there
exists a continuum of them, which have the same prices and world capital-labor ratio, k̂ . These
steady states are indexed by the distribution of capital-labor ratios across countries, kˆ1 ,..., kˆ n .

Furthermore, international trade occurs in every steady state in which kˆi ≠ kˆ for some i .

3. The integrated economy

            The characterization and computation of equilibrium of the model described in the previous
section is difficult in general, since it involves determining the pattern of specialization in
production over an infinite horizon. (See Bajona and Kehoe 2006 for some results on the
equilibrium of the general model.) Numerical methods are usually needed to compute equilibrium.
The characterization and computation of equilibrium becomes much easier, however, when the
model specification is such that we can solve for the equilibrium by disaggregating the equilibrium
of the integrated economy — a closed economy with initial factor endowments equal to the world
endowments — which is equivalent to a two-sector growth model. (See Dixit and Norman 1980

                                                               8
for a description of the methodology.) In this case, the equilibrium prices and aggregate
consumption, production, and investment of our economy coincide with the equilibrium prices,
consumption, production, and investment of the integrated economy.
          Consider the social planner’s problem

                                                                ∑
                                                                    ∞
                                                        max         t =0
                                                                           β t u (c1t , c2t )

                                                    s.t. c1t + x1t ≤ y1t = φ1 (k1t , A1t )                                                    (15)

                                                     c2t + x2t ≤ y2t = φ2 (k2t , A 2t )

                                                  kt +1 − (1 − δ )kt ≤ xt = f ( x1t , x2t )

                                                               k1t + k2t ≤ kt

                                                                A1t + A 2t ≤ 1

                                                              c jt ≥ 0 , x jt ≥ 0

                                                                   k0 ≤ k0 ,

where k0 = ∑ i =1 Li k0i / ∑ i =1 Li . Notice that assumption A.1 implies that k0 > 0 .

Proposition 3: Suppose that the allocation {c1t , c2t , kt } , { y1t , k1t , A1t } , { y2t , k2t , A 2t } , { xt , x1t , x2t }

solves the social planner’s problem (15). Then this allocation, together with the prices
{ p1t , p2t , qt , wt , rt } , is an equilibrium of the integrated economy where                      qt = 1 , p1t = f1 ( x1t , x2t ) ,

p2t = f 2 ( x1t , x2t ) , rt = p1tφ1K (k1t , A1t ) , and wt = p1tφ1L (k1t , A1t ) . Conversely, suppose that

{ p1t , p2t , qt , wt , rt } , {c1t , c2t , kt } , { y1t , k1t , A1t } , { y2t , k2t , A 2t } , { xt , x1t , x2t } is an equilibrium of the
integrated economy. Then the equilibrium allocation solves the social planner’s problem (15).
Furthermore, if the social planner’s problem has a solution, then it is the unique equilibrium
allocation of the integrated economy.

Proof: The first claim is just the second theorem of welfare economics, and the second claim is the
first theorem. In our setting, it is straightforward to prove these claims by showing that the first-
order conditions and transversality condition for the social planner’s problem are equivalent to the
equilibrium conditions in the definition of equilibrium where there is only one country, n = 1 . If
the utility function is bounded on the constraint set of the social planner’s problem, there exists a

                                                                           9
solution to this problem. Since the function u is strictly concave and the functions φ1 , φ2 , and f
are concave, the solution to the planner’s problem is unique, which implies that there is a unique
equilibrium to the integrated economy. ■

        Once we have the equilibrium of the integrated economy, to compute an equilibrium of the
world economy, we need to disaggregate the consumption, investment, and production decisions
across countries, to find, for example, c1it , i = 1,..., n , such that


                                            ∑          Li c1it / ∑ i =1 Li = c1t .
                                                n                  n
                                                i =1
                                                                                                       (16)

Whether an equilibrium can be solved this way is a guess-and-verify approach.
        First consider the disaggregation of production decisions. If capital-labor ratios are very
different across countries, assigning nonnegative production plans for both goods to all countries is
not consistent with their having the same factor prices, and solving for equilibrium using the
integrated approach is not possible. Figure 1, known as the Lerner diagram, shows the
endowments of capital and labor that are consistent with using the integrated economy approach to
solve for equilibrium for a static Heckscher-Ohlin model. Let p1 , p2 be the equilibrium prices of

the traded goods in the integrated economy. The rays k1 / A1 and k2 / A 2 represent the capital-labor
ratios used in the production of each good in the equilibrium of the integrated economy. The area
between both rays is called the cone of diversification. If all countries have endowments of capital
and labor in the cone of diversification, the equilibrium prices of the integrated economy are
consistent with nonnegative production plans for both goods in all countries.
        To find the cone of diversification, we solve the problem

                                        max p1φ1 (k1 , A1 ) + p2φ2 (k2 , A 2 )

                                                    s.t. k1 + k2 ≤ k                                   (17)

                                                         A1 + A 2 ≤ 1

                                                    kj ≥ 0 , A j ≥ 0.

If p1 and p2 are the equilibrium prices of the integrated economy, then, since c1it and c2i t are both

strictly positive by assumption A.6, the solution to this problem is such that φ1 (k1 , A1 ) > 0 and

φ2 (k2 , A 2 ) > 0 . Assumption A.1 implies that k1 / A1 > k2 / A 2 . The cone of diversification is

                                                              10
specified by these sector-specific capital-labor ratios, which depend only on the relative price
p2 / p1 , κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) and κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) . It is the set of country specific capital-labor ratios k i such that

                                        κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) ≥ k i ≥ κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) .                              (18)

        In our dynamic economy, the cone of diversification changes over time since the capital-
labor ratio and, consequently, the equilibrium prices of the integrated economy, change over time.
Therefore, to solve for an equilibrium using the integrated economy approach, we need to find a
way to disaggregate the investment decisions such that countries stay in the corresponding cone of
diversification for all time periods.
        Given that the period utility function is identical and homothetic across countries, factor
price equalization implies that we can use the integrated economy approach to solve for
equilibrium in a static model. In our dynamic economy, there is an additional possible
complication: If one of the countries has a corner solution in which it chooses zero investment in
some period while another country chooses positive investment, then we cannot disaggregate the
consumption and investment decisions of the integrated economy. Later, we will show how this
possibility makes it difficult to characterize equilibria.
        In the rest of the paper, we assume that consumers combine the two traded goods in
consumption in the same way that producers of the investment good combine these two goods in
production:

                                            u (c1 , c2 ) = v ( f (c1 , c2 ) ) ,                               (19)

where v is a strictly concave, strictly increasing function. This assumption simplifies the dynamics
of the model, since it makes the integrated economy equivalent to a one-sector growth model and,
therefore, cycles and chaos are ruled out as possible equilibrium behavior of the integrated
economy. To simplify the analysis we further assume, as does Ventura (1997), that the function v
is logarithmic.

A.7. The period utility function u takes the form u (c1 , c2 ) = log ( f (c1 , c2 ) ) .


        Consider the production function defined by solving

                                            F (k , A) = max f ( y1 , y2 )


                                                           11
                                                       s.t. y1 ≤ φ1 (k1 , A1 )                                                (20)

                                                         y2 ≤ φ2 (k2 , A 2 )

                                                           k1 + k2 ≤ k

                                                           A1 + A 2 ≤ A

                                                        kj ≥ 0 , A j ≥ 0.

Assumptions A.6 and A.7 imply that f is strictly quasi-concave, which, together with the
concavity of φ1 and φ2 , implies that for any (k , A) there is a unique solution to this problem. It is
straightforward to prove that F is increasing, concave, continuously differentiable, and
homogeneous of degree one. Like f , F is strictly quasi-concave.
         Assumption A.7 is useful because it allows us to solve the two-sector social planner’s
problem (15) by solving the related one-sector social planner’s problem

                                                            ∑
                                                                ∞

                                                                       β t log ct

                                                     s.t. ct + xt ≤ F (kt ,1)                                                 (21)

                                                      kt +1 − (1 − δ )kt ≤ xt

                                                         ct ≥ 0 , xt ≥ 0

                                                             k0 ≤ k0 .

         We state the following proposition without giving a proof because, first, the proof is just a
straightforward application of the maximum theorem, and, second, we will not employ the
proposition in its general form, but rather will only consider production functions for which we can
analytically solve problem (20).

Proposition 4. Let y1 (k , A) , y2 (k , A) , k1 (k , A) , A1 (k , A) , k2 (k , A) , A 2 (k , A) denote the solution to

(20). If {c1t , c2t , kt } , { y1t , k1t , A1t } , { y2t , k2t , A 2t } , { xt , x1t , x2t } solves the two-sector social planner’s

problem (15), then {ct , kt , xt } solves the one-sector social planner’s problem (21) where

ct = f (c1t , c2t ) . Conversely, if {ct , kt , xt } solves the one-sector social planner’s problem (21), then

{c1t , c2t , kt } , { y1t , k1t , A1t } , { y2t , k2t , A 2t } , { xt , x1t , x2t } solves the two-sector social planner’s problem

                                                                12
(15) where y jt = y j (kt ,1) , k jt = k j (kt ,1) , A jt = A j (kt ,1) , c jt = [ ct /(ct + xt ) ] y j (kt ,1) , and

x jt = [ xt /(ct + xt ) ] y j (kt ,1) .


          We first consider a version of the model in which the production function φ j for each

traded good uses only one factor of production. Under this assumption, factor prices equalize
along the equilibrium path independently of initial conditions. Since this is the assumption made
by Ventura (1997), we call this version of the model the Ventura model. By disaggregating the
equilibrium of the integrated economy, we derive results on the evolution of the world distributions
of income and of capital in the Ventura model. We also show by means of an example that, even
though factor price equalization holds in every equilibrium of the Ventura model, there may be
equilibria in which there is zero investment in some countries and in which our results for the
integrated economy do not hold.
          We then consider a version of the model in which the more general production functions φ j

have the same constant elasticity of substitution as does the production function for the investment
good f . In such models, factor prices need not equalize along the equilibrium path, but, if they
do, the equilibria have the same properties as those of the Ventura model. We refer to this version
of the model as the generalized Ventura model. In this model, we derive the cone of diversification
analytically, and give conditions under which, if countries are in the cone of diversification, they
stay there. We also derive conditions under which, even if countries start in the cone of
diversification, they leave it in a finite number of periods. Finally, for the special case of Cobb-
Douglas production functions, we analytically solve the model when there is factor price
equalization.

4. Ventura model

          Following Ventura (1997), we assume that the production function for each of the traded
goods uses only one factor of production:

                                                        y1 = φ1 (k1 , A1 ) = k1                                         (22)

                                                      y2 = φ2 (k2 , A 2 ) = A 2 .                                       (23)




                                                                 13
This assumption implies that the cone of diversification is the entire nonnegative quadrant,
independently of the prices p1t and p2t , and that factor prices equalize along any equilibrium path:

rti = rt = p1t and wti = wt = p2t . Notice that, in this case, F (k ,1) = f (k ,1) .
           Furthermore, we assume that the production function of the investment good has a constant
elasticity of substitution between the inputs of the two traded goods:

                                                  f ( x1 , x2 ) = d ( a1 x1b + a2 x2b )
                                                                                        1/ b
                                                                                                                                  (24)

if b ≠ 0 , and f is

                                                         f ( x1 , x2 ) = dx1a1 x2a2                                               (25)

in the limit where b = 0 . Here ai > 0 and a1 + a2 = 1 . The elasticity of substitution is σ = 1/(1 − b) .

In what follows, we can easily translate statements involving b into statements involving σ .
           It is worth pointing out that Ventura (1997) considers a continuous-time version of this
model. For completeness, we later sketch out our results for the continuous-time model.
           Suppose that we find the equilibrium of the integrated economy by solving the one-sector
social planner’s problem (21). To disaggregate consumption and investment, we solve the utility
maximization of the representative consumer i , (7):

                                                               ∑
                                                                   ∞
                                                       max         t =0
                                                                          β t log cti

                                                       s.t. cti + xti ≤ wt + rt kti                                               (26)

                                                        kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti ≤ xti

                                                           c ijt ≥ 0 , xti ≥ 0

                                                                k0i ≤ k0i .

If we solve (7), we can obtain a solution to (26) by setting cti = f (c1it , c2i t ) , and, if we solve (26), we

can obtain a solution to (7) by setting c1it = cti kt /( wt + rt kti ) , c2i t = cti /( wt + rt kti ) , x1it = xti kt /( wt + rt kti ) ,

x2i t = xti /( wt + rt kti ) .
           The necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence of consumption levels and capital
stocks to solve (26) are that

holds. If xti > 0 for all i and all t , then we are justified in using the integrated economy approach.
        We solve for the integrated economy equilibrium in the Ventura model by solving for the
equilibrium of a one-sector growth model. Notice, however, that the two sectors matter a lot for
disaggregating the equilibrium. In particular, we cannot solve for the equilibrium values of the
variables for one of the countries by solving an optimal growth problem for that country in
isolation. Instead, the equilibrium path of a specific country’s capital stock and its steady state
value depend not only on the country’s initial endowment of capital but also — through the interest
rate rt — on the equilibrium path of the world’s capital stock, and its steady state value.
        If there is positive investment in every period, then the equilibrium path for the integrated
economy is determined by the difference equations

        Standard results for one-sector models (for example, Rebelo 1991) say that the equilibrium
of the integrated economy has sustained growth for some values of the parameters. The existence

                                                            15
of steady state depends upon whether the rental rate of capital as a function of initial endowments,
r (k ) , can take the value 1/ β − 1 + δ for some k > 0 . If r (k ) < 1/ β − 1 + δ for all k , then kt

converges to 0. If, however, r ( k ) > 1/ β − 1 + δ for all k , then kt grows without bound. Consider
an economy without labor, where feasible allocations satisfy

                                           ct + kt +1 = ( da11/ b + 1 − δ ) kt                              (34)

This economy has a sustained growth path in which ct = (1 − β ) ( da11/ b + 1 − δ ) kt and

kt +1 = β ( da11/ b + 1 − δ ) kt .


Definition 3. We say that an equilibrium converges to the sustained growth path of the
corresponding economy without labor if

                                     limt →∞ ct / kt = (1 − β ) ( da11/ b + 1 − δ )                         (35)

                                       limt →∞ kt +1 / kt = β ( da11/ b + 1 − δ )                           (36)

         Standard results from, for example, Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989) provide the
following characterization of the equilibrium of the integrated economy.

Lemma 1: The behavior of the equilibrium of the integrated economy of the Ventura model
depends on parameter values:

1. If b < 0 and 1/ β − 1 + δ > da11/ b , the trivial steady state is the unique steady state, and the unique
    equilibrium of the integrated economy converges to it.

2. If b = 0 , if b < 0 and 1/ β − 1 + δ ≤ da11/ b , or if b > 0 and 1/ β − 1 + δ > da11/ b , there is a unique

    nontrivial stable steady state characterized by the solution of the equation r (kˆ) = 1/ β − 1 + δ ,
    and the unique equilibrium of the integrated economy converges to it.

3. If b > 0 and 1/ β − 1 + δ ≤ da11/ b , there is no nontrivial steady state, and the unique equilibrium
    of the integrated economy converges to the sustained growth path.

         In the case where b = 0 and δ = 1 , there is an analytical solution to the one-sector social
planner’s problem (21) for the integrated economy:

                                                          16
                                                 kt +1 = xt = β a1dkta1                                      (37)

                                                  ct = (1 − β a1 )dkta1                                      (38)

For other parameter values, we need to use numerical methods to solve for the equilibrium.
Nevertheless, we can derive analytic results on the evolution of the distribution of income levels
over time that depend on the values of variables in the integrated economy equilibrium.
Qualitatively characterizing the integrated economy equilibrium then allows us to qualitatively
characterize the evolution of income levels. In particular, we can find conditions under which
relative income levels converge and conditions under which they diverge. The next proposition
derives a formula that compares the level of income per capita in a given country measured in
current prices, yti = wt + rt kti , to the world’s average at any given period, yt = wt + rt kt , to the same
relative income position in the previous period.

Proposition 5. In the Ventura model, if xti > 0 for all i and all t , the income level of country i
relative to the world’s income level evolves according to the rule

                                    yti − yt   s ⎛ y i − y ⎞ s ⎛ y i − y0 ⎞
                                             = t ⎜ t −1 t −1 ⎟ = t ⎜ 0    ⎟.                                 (39)
                                        yt    st −1 ⎝ yt −1 ⎠ s0 ⎝ y0 ⎠

where st = rt ct −1 / yt , t = 1, 2,... , and s0 = r0 c0 / [ β (1 + r0 − δ ) y0 ] . When there is complete

depreciation, δ = 1 , st = ct / yt , t = 0,1,... .

Proof: Subtracting the first-order condition for the consumer’s problem in the open economy from
the same condition for the integrated economy, we obtain:

                                                 cti+1 − ct +1 cti − ct
                                                              =         .                                    (40)
                                                     ct +1         ct

It is here that the assumption of no corner solutions in investment is essential, allowing us to
impose the first-order conditions (27) and (30) as equalities. Manipulating the first-order
conditions (27) and the budget constraints (26), we obtain the familiar demand function for
logarithmic utility maximization:




                                                          17
                                          ⎡ ∞ ⎛ s                  1         ⎞                       ⎤
                           cti = (1 − β ) ⎢ ∑ s =t ⎜ ∏τ =t +1                ⎟ ws + (1 + rt − δ )kt ⎥ .
                                                                                                   i
                                                                                                                    (41)
                                          ⎣        ⎝          1 + rτ − δ     ⎠                       ⎦

Notice that, since we have factor price equalization,

                                         cti − ct = (1 − β )(1 + rt − δ )(kti − kt ) .                              (42)

The budget constraint (26) implies that

                                      cti − ct + kti+1 − kt +1 = (1 + rt − δ )(kti − kt ) .                         (43)

Combining (30), (42), and (43), we obtain

                                                                  ct
                                               kti+1 − kt +1 =         (kti − kt ) .                                (44)
                                                                 ct −1

The difference between a country’s income per worker and the world’s income per worker is

                                              yti+1 − yt +1 = rt +1 (kti+1 − kt +1 ) .                              (45)

Using the expression for kti+1 − kt +1 in (44), we obtain

                                          yti+1 − yt +1 rt +1ct / yt +1 ⎛ yti − yt ⎞
                                                       =                ⎜          ⎟.                               (46)
                                               yt +1     rt ct −1 / yt ⎝ yt ⎠

We can use the first-order condition (30) to rewrite this expression as

                                     yti − yt   s ⎛ y i − y ⎞ s ⎛ y i − y0 ⎞
                                              = t ⎜ t −1 t −1 ⎟ = t ⎜ 0    ⎟,                                       (47)
                                         yt    st −1 ⎝ yt −1 ⎠ s0 ⎝ y0 ⎠

where st = rt ct −1 / yt for t = 1, 2,... and s0 = r0 c0 / [ β (1 + r0 − δ ) y0 ] . When δ = 1, ct / ct −1 = β rt

implies that we can factor β out of the numerator and the denominator of (47) and set st = ct / yt .■

         The proof of this proposition relies on factor price equalization occurring in every period
and on there never being a corner solution in investment. If factor prices are not equal in some
period in the future, the demand functions (41) for each individual country and for the integrated
economy would have different prices in that period and, therefore, equation (42) would not hold.
Likewise, if a corner solution in investment occurs, equation (40) need not hold. We later provide


                                                               18
examples in which lack of factor price equalization and the lack of interior solutions for investment
cause the characterization of behavior of relative income in proposition 5 to fail.
        Equation (39) in the previous proposition compares a country’s income relative to the world
average. Whether countries converge or diverge in their income levels depends on whether the
ratio rt +1ct / yt +1 decreases or increases over time. If the ratio increases, countries’ incomes move
further away from the income of the integrated economy and, thus, there is divergence in income
levels. If the ratio decreases, countries’ income levels become closer to the average income level,
and there is convergence in income levels. If the ratio is constant, countries maintain their initial
income differences and, therefore, the distribution of income stays constant. We should stress that
here convergence means that countries’ income levels become more similar over time. It does not
mean that they converge to the same level of income: Although the absolute value of ( yti − yt ) / yt
can be strictly decreasing over time, it can converge to a constant different from 0.
        Using proposition 5, we can reduce the characterization of the convergence properties of
equilibria in the case with complete depreciation to a characterization of the behavior of st = ct / yt
in the solution to the one-sector social planner’s problem (21).

Lemma 2. In the unique equilibrium of the integrated economy of the Ventura model with
complete depreciation, the behavior of st = ct / yt depends on parameter values:

1. If b < 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , then st is a strictly decreasing sequence that converges to 1 − β .

2. If b < 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b , then st converges to [ f (kˆ,1) − kˆ] / f (kˆ,1) where k̂ is the unique

    nontrivial stable steady state. If k0 < kˆ , st is a strictly increasing sequence; if k0 > kˆ , st is a
    strictly decreasing sequence.

3. If b = 0 , then st = 1 − β a1 is constant.

4. If b > 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , then st converges to [ f (kˆ,1) − kˆ] / f (kˆ,1) . If k0 < kˆ , st is a strictly

    decreasing sequence; if k0 > kˆ , st is a strictly increasing sequence.

5. If b > 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b , then st is a strictly decreasing sequence that converges to 1 − β .




                                                        19
Proof: Since the result for the case 3, where b = 0 , follows trivially from equation (38), we
concern ourselves with the other cases, where b < 0 or b > 0 . Multiplying and dividing the Euler
equation, (30), by kt / yt and using the feasibility condition, (31), we obtain

                                                ⎛ 1       ⎞
                                             st ⎜      − 1⎟ = β ht ,                                       (48)
                                                ⎝ st −1 ⎠

where st = ct / yt and ht = (rt kt ) / yt . We define the function

                                                   r (k )k    a1k b
                                        h( k ) =           =           .                                   (49)
                                                   f (k ,1) a1k b + a2

Notice that h '(k ) < 0 if b < 0 and that h '(k ) > 0 if b > 0 . Notice that, in the limit where b = 0 ,
h(k ) = a1 and h '(k ) = 0 . We use the monotonicity of the sequence kt in any solution to the one-

sector social planner’s problem (21) to establish monotonicity properties for the sequence ht . The

theorem is then established by showing that the monotonicity properties for the sequence ht imply

the desired monotonicity properties for the sequence st .
        Consider the different cases enumerated in the statement of the theorem. In case 1, where
b < 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , kt is a strictly decreasing sequence that converges to 0, which implies that

ht is a strictly increasing sequence that converges to 1. In case 2, where b < 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b ,

and in case 4, where b > 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , kt is a strictly increasing sequence that converges to k̂

if k0 < kˆ and a strictly decreasing sequence that converges to k̂ if k0 > kˆ . In case 2, this implies

that ht is a strictly decreasing sequence if k0 < kˆ and a strictly increasing sequence if k0 > kˆ . In

case 4, however, ht is a strictly increasing sequence if k0 < kˆ and a decreasing sequence if k0 > kˆ .

In both cases, ht converges to a1kˆb /(a1kˆ b + a2 ) no matter what the initial value of kt . In case 5,

where b > 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b , kt is a strictly increasing sequence that grows without bound, which

implies that ht is an increasing sequence that converges to 1.

        We now argue that, if ht is strictly increasing along a solution path to (21), then st is

strictly decreasing and, if ht is strictly decreasing, then st is strictly increasing. We begin with the


                                                       20
case where ht is strictly increasing. Suppose, to the contrary, that, although ht is strictly

increasing, st is not strictly decreasing, that is, there exists T such that sT ≥ sT −1 . Since ht is
strictly increasing, equation (48) implies that:

                                                ⎛1   ⎞      ⎛ 1       ⎞
                                          sT +1 ⎜ − 1⎟ > sT ⎜      − 1⎟ .                               (50)
                                                ⎝ sT ⎠      ⎝ sT −1 ⎠

Since sT ≥ sT −1 , this implies that

                                                ⎛1   ⎞      ⎛1   ⎞
                                          sT +1 ⎜ − 1⎟ > sT ⎜ − 1⎟ ,                                    (51)
                                                ⎝ sT ⎠      ⎝ sT ⎠

which implies that sT +1 > sT . Iterating, we find that, for all t > T , the sequence st is strictly

increasing. Using equation (51), for all t > T , we obtain:

                                          st +1 ⎛ 1 ⎞ st ⎛ 1 ⎞ 1 − st
                                   ht =         ⎜ − 1⎟ > ⎜ − 1⎟ =     .                                 (52)
                                           β ⎝ st ⎠ β ⎝ st ⎠      β

In the limit, the sequences ht and (1 − st ) / β both converge to the same limit, (1 − sˆ) / β . Equation
(52) implies that

which contradicts our assumption that ht is strictly increasing. We prove that, when ht is strictly

decreasing, st is strictly decreasing, using the same argument and just reversing the inequalities.■

        The next proposition provides our main results for the Ventura model. It follows
immediately from proposition 5 and lemma 2.

Proposition 6. (Convergence in relative income levels) In the Ventura model with complete
depreciation, if xti > 0 for all i and all t :

1. If b < 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , then there is convergence in relative income levels.




                                                       21
2. If b < 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b , then there is divergence in relative income levels if k0 < kˆ and

   convergence in relative income levels if k0 > kˆ .

3. If b = 0 , relative income levels stay constant.

4. If b > 0 and 1/ β > da11/ b , then there is convergence in relative income levels if k0 < kˆ and

   divergence in relative income levels if k0 > kˆ .

5. If b > 0 and 1/ β ≤ da11/ b , then there is convergence in relative income levels.

       We have analyzed all of the cases enumerated in the statement of proposition 6 for the sake
of completeness. Case 1 and cases 2 and 4 where k0 > kˆ are less interesting than the others. The
contrast of the remaining results with the analogous results for a world of closed economies is
striking: In cases 2, 3, and 4, if the countries are closed to trade, we know that relative income
levels converge over time because all countries have equilibria that converge to the steady state of
the integrated economy. If we open the countries to trade, however, relative income levels diverge
if b < 0 and stay fixed if b = 0 . Notice that, if b > 0 , relative income levels converge, but not to
the same level as they do in a the world of closed economies. In case 5, if the countries are closed
to trade, we know that relative income levels diverge over time because growth accelerates over
time and countries that start with lower income levels because they have lower initial capital stocks
grow more slowly. If we open these economies to trade, however, income levels converge.
       The intuition for the results in proposition 6, at least for the cases where b < 0 and
1/ β ≤ da11/ b and where b = 0 , is obvious: In a world of closed economies, poor countries — that is,
countries with lower initial capital stocks — grow faster than rich countries because lower capital
stocks lead to higher returns on investment. Trade equalizes the return on capital in poor and rich
countries, eliminating the incentive for higher investment in poor countries.
         We are left with the question: When are there corner solutions in investment for
individual countries, which make the integrated economy approach and the characterization of
equilibria in propositions 3, 4, 5, and 6 invalid? The answer is found in the next proposition.

Proposition 7. In the Ventura model with complete depreciation, for the cases enumerated in the
statement of lemma 2 where the sequence st = ct / yt in the equilibrium of the integrated economy

                                                   22
is constant or strictly decreasing, there exists an equilibrium where xti > 0 for all i and all t . For

the cases where st is strictly increasing, let zt = ct −1 / kt , z0 = c0 / ( β r0 k0 ) , and

                                                                   ct −1
                                                    zˆ = limt →∞         .                             (54)
                                                                    kt

This limit is well defined. Let imin be the country with the lowest initial endowment of capital per

worker, k0imin ≤ k0i , i = 1,..., n . If

                                                 zˆ ⎛ k0imin − k0 ⎞
                                                    ⎜             ⎟ ≥ −1 ,                             (55)
                                                 z0 ⎝ k 0         ⎠

then there exists an equilibrium where xti > 0 for all i and all t . Otherwise, there is no equilibrium

where xti > 0 for all i and all t . When there exists an equilibrium with no corner solutions in
investment, it is the unique such equilibrium.

Proof: Notice that, since

                                                                st
                                                       zt =          ,                                 (56)
                                                              1 − st

the sequence zt has the same monotonicity properties as the sequence st . In the cases where st

converges to 1 − β , zt converges to (1 − β ) / β . In the cases where st converges to

⎡ f (kˆ,1) − kˆ ⎤ / f (kˆ,1) , zt converges to ⎡ f (kˆ,1) − kˆ ⎤ / kˆ . Equation (44) implies that
⎣               ⎦                              ⎣               ⎦

                                     kti − kt    zt ⎛ kti−1 − kt −1 ⎞ zt ⎛ k0i − k0 ⎞
                                              =       ⎜             ⎟= ⎜            ⎟.                 (57)
                                         kt     zt −1 ⎝ kt −1 ⎠ z0 ⎝ k0 ⎠

Since assumption A.1 implies that k0i > 0 , we know that (k0i − k0 ) / k0 > −1 . If zt is weakly

increasing, or if zt is strictly decreasing but condition (55) holds, then xti = kti > 0 for all i and all

t . If, on the other hand, if zt is strictly decreasing and condition (55) does not hold, then the
investment decisions in the integrated economy equilibrium cannot be disaggregated as in
proposition 5 to assign nonnegative investment to each country in every period.



                                                           23
       Uniqueness of the disaggregation of the integrated economy equilibrium, if it exists, follows
from the uniqueness of the solution to the one-sector social planner’s problem (21).■

       Uniqueness of the disaggregation of the integrated economy equilibrium is easy to establish
because this equilibrium solves a social planner’s problem. It is more difficult to say anything
about uniqueness of equilibria, if they exist, that involve corner solutions in investment or, in the
more general model in the next section, that involve lack of factor price equalization. In such
equilibria, Pareto improvements are possible if we allow international borrowing and lending.

5. Generalized Ventura model

       Consider a generalization of the Ventura model in which the production functions f , φ 1 ,

and φ 2 are general constant returns to scale production functions. Propositions 3 and 4 indicate
that we can find the integrated economy of the generalized Ventura model by solving the one-
sector growth social planner’s problem (21).
       In this generalized Ventura model, factor price equalization need not occur at any given
period of time. Countries can specialize in the production of one of the traded goods, factor prices
can differ across countries and, therefore, the equilibrium cannot be solved using the integrated
approach in general. In what follows, we characterize the cone of diversification for some specific
versions of the model and derive conditions under which factor price equalization in a given period
implies factor price equalization in every subsequent period. In such cases, the results of the
Ventura model on the evolution of the distribution of income apply to the generalized Ventura
model. For situations where factor prices do not equalize after a finite number of periods, the
analysis done in the Ventura model is no longer valid. Numerical experiments are needed to
determine the behavior of the countries’ distribution of income.

5.1. The C.E.S. model

        We first consider the model in which

                                                       (                       )
                                                                                  1/ b
                                y1 = φ1 (k1 , A1 ) = θ1 α1k1b + (1 − α1 )A1b                        (58)


                                                       (                          )
                                                                                   1/ b
                              y2 = φ2 (k2 , A 2 ) = θ 2 α 2 k2b + (1 − α 2 )Ab2                     (59)

                                                                (                    )
                                                                                     1/ b
                                              f ( y1 , y2 ) = d a1 y1b + a2 y2b             ,                                (60)

where b ≤ 1 , b ≠ 0 , and a2 = 1 − a1 . Notice that, since we have assumed no factor intensity

reversals in the production of the traded goods, the production functions φ j , j = 1, 2 , need to have

the same constant elasticity of substitution. Setting this elasticity equal to that of the production
function for investment good f allows us to analytically solve for the function F .
         We refer to this as the C.E.S. model. Here the parameter b determines the common
elasticity of substitution σ = 1/(1 − b) , and the production function F defined in (20) is also a
C.E.S. production function, with the same elasticity of substitution and with the share parameters
that are combinations of the share parameters of the production functions φ1 , φ2 , and f :

                                               F (k , A) = D ( A1k b + A2 Ab )

         To determine when factor price equalization occurs and when it does not, we need to
characterize the cone of diversification in the integrated economy and how it changes with the
world capital-labor ratio. One procedure would be to solve (17) to determine the sector-specific
capital-labor ratios as functions of relative prices, κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) and κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) , then use proposition

4 to determine the prices in the integrated economy equilibrium, p1 (kt ) = f1 ( y1 (kt ,1), y1 (kt ,1) ) and

p2 (kt ) = f 2 ( y1 (kt ,1), y1 (kt ,1) ) , and, finally, calculate κ1 ( p2 (kt ) / p1 (kt ) ) and κ 2 ( p2 (kt ) / p1 (kt ) ) . In

the C.E.S. model, the determination of the cone of diversification of the integrated economy is far
simpler than this. Solving the maximization problem that defines F , (20), we find that

                                          κ j ( p2 (kt ) / p1 (kt ) ) = κ j kt , j = 1, 2 ,                                  (64)

       The next propositions establish conditions under which, for the C.E.S. model, factor price
equalization in a given period implies factor price equalization in all subsequent periods. The first
proposition gives sufficient conditions for factor prices to equalize along the equilibrium path,
given that factor price equalization occurs in a given period T . The key parameter is, once again,
b . In particular, when b > 0 , factor price equalization at T ensures factor price equalization in any
subsequent period, at least for the economically interesting cases either where k0 ≤ kˆ and or where

kt goes without bound. The second proposition gives sufficient conditions under which factor

price equalization cannot hold forever. It states that, when b < 0 , and when 1/ β ≤ DA11/ b and

k0 < kˆ , if factor price equalization holds at a period T and the capital-labor ratio of one of the
countries is close enough to the boundary of the cone of diversification, factor price equalization
cannot hold for all subsequent periods. The intuition is simple. If factor price equalization were to
occur forever, the analysis in the Ventura model would apply, and the distribution of capital-labor
ratios would become more dispersed over time. Since the boundaries of the cone of diversification
for the integrated economy are linear functions of the world capital-labor ratio, however, if the
capital-labor ratio of one of the countries is close enough to the boundary of the cone, the
distribution of capital-labor ratios cannot become more dispersed if all capital-labor ratios are to
remain in the cone.

Proposition 8: In the C.E.S. model with complete depreciation, suppose that the sequence
st = ct / yt in the equilibrium of the integrated economy is weakly decreasing. Suppose that factor

price equalization occurs in period T . Then there exists an equilibrium in which factor price
equalization occurs at all t ≥ T . Furthermore, this equilibrium is the only such equilibrium.

Proof: Assume that all countries are in the cone of diversification at period T . Define kti , t > T ,
using the formula


                                                                26

where zt = ct −1 / kt and z0 = c0 /( β r0 k0 ) are defined as in the statement of proposition 7. We need to
show that disaggregating capital this way keeps countries in the cone of diversification and that it
solves the equilibrium of our model economy. To prove that the countries remain in the cone, we
need to show that, for all t ≥ T ,

                                                    κ 2 kt ≤ kti ≤ κ1kt .                              (67)

That is, for all t ≥ T ,

                                                       kti − kt
                                               κ2 −1 ≤          ≤ κ1 − 1 .                             (68)
                                                           kt

Since we have assumed that sequence st is weakly decreasing, we know from the proof of
proposition 7 that the sequence is weakly decreasing.
        To prove that these sequences of capitals, together with the equilibrium prices of the
integrated economy, are a solution to the model economy, we define

                                               ⎡ ∞ ⎛ s                  1     ⎞             ⎤
                                cti = (1 − β ) ⎢ ∑ s =t ⎜ ∏τ =t +1            ⎟ ws + rt kt ⎥ ,
                                                                                          i
                                                                                                       (69)
                                               ⎣        ⎝          1 + rτ − δ ⎠             ⎦

where ws and rs are equilibrium prices of the integrated economy, and show that consumptions
and capital stocks defined this way solve the equilibrium of our model economy.■

Proposition 9: In the C.E.S. model with complete depreciation, suppose that the sequence st is

strictly increasing. Again let zt = ct −1 / kt , z0 = c0 /( β r0 k0 ) , and

                                                                   ct −1
                                                    zˆ = limt →∞         .                             (70)
                                                                    kt

Let imin be the country with the lowest initial endowment of capital per worker, and let imax be the

country with the highest, k0imin ≤ k0i ≤ k0imax , i = 1,..., n . If




                                                             27
                                          zˆ ⎛ k0imin − k0 ⎞
                                             ⎜             ⎟ ≥ κ2 −1                                (71)
                                          z0 ⎝ k0          ⎠

                                         zˆ ⎛ k0imax − k0 ⎞
                                            ⎜             ⎟ ≤ κ1 − 1 ,                              (72)
                                         z0 ⎝ k 0         ⎠

then there exists an equilibrium with factor price equalization in every period. If, however, either
of the conditions (71) or (72) is violated, there is no equilibrium with factor price equalization in
every period. When there exists an equilibrium with factor price equalization in every period, it is
the unique such equilibrium.

Proof: This proof is an obvious generalization of the proof of proposition 7 using the definitions in
proposition 8.■

        Even though its proof is trivial given the machinery that we have developed, proposition 9
is a powerful result. Under some general conditions, even if factor price equalization occurs at a
given period, at some point in the future factor prices will differ across countries. In the case where
b < 0 and 1/ β ≤ DA11/ b , for example, the unique equilibrium of the integrated economy converges

to the nontrivial steady state, but, if initial endowments of capital per worker are sufficiently
different in the sense that either of the conditions (71) or (72) is violated, then there is no
disaggregated equilibrium that corresponds to it. Even if the world economy starts with all
countries diversifying in production and factor prices equalized, at some point at least one country
necessarily has its capital-labor ratio leave the cone of diversification.
        Abstracting away from the patterns of specialization, as Ventura (1997), Chen (1992), and
many others do, can cause us to miss out on some important dynamics precisely in the interesting
cases, the cases in which there is potentially divergence of income levels. In such cases, we cannot
use the integrated economy approach to solve for the equilibrium, and none of the analysis in
propositions 3, 4, and 5 applies. Instead, we need to use numerical methods to compute the
equilibrium. We briefly explain how to compute equilibrium for the generalized Ventura model in
section 6 and present examples of economies for which factor prices are not equalized along the
equilibrium path in section 7.

5.2. The Cobb-Douglas model

        In this section, we consider the limiting case of the C.E.S. model with complete
depreciation and with b = 0 , that is, with production functions that are Cobb-Douglas.

                                            y1 = φ1 (k1 , A1 ) = θ1k1α1 A11−α1                       (73)

                                           y2 = φ2 (k2 , A 2 ) = θ 2 k2α 2 A12−α 2                   (74)

                                                f ( y1 , y2 ) = dy1a1 y2a2 .                         (75)

In this case, the function F is also Cobb-Douglas:

                                                  F (k , A) = Dk A1 A A2                             (76)

                                          A1 = a1α1 + a2α 2 , A2 = 1 − A1                            (77)

                                                               a1                          a2
                              d ⎡⎣θ1a1α1α1 (1 − α1 )1−α1 ⎤⎦ ⎡⎣θ 2 a2α 2α 2 (1 − α 2 )1−α 2 ⎤⎦
                           D=                                                                 .      (78)
                                                        A1A1 A2A2

The constants that determine the cone of diversification in the Cobb-Douglas case are

                                                  ⎛ αj       ⎞ A2
                                           κj =⎜             ⎟⎟ , j = 1, 2 .                         (79)
                                                  ⎜ 1−α j
                                                  ⎝           ⎠ A1

Proposition 10: In the Cobb-Douglas model with complete depreciation, suppose that factor price
equalization occurs in period T . Then factor price equalization occurs at all t ≥ T . Furthermore,

                                                       kti = γ i kt ,                                (80)

where γ i = kTi / kT and kt +1 = β A1DktA1 for t ≥ T .

The proof of this proposition is a special case of the proof of proposition 8.
        Notice that, when all k0i are in the cone of diversification, we can use proposition 10 to

obtain analytic solutions for all variables. Let γ i = k0i / k0 , where κ 2 ≤ γ i ≤ κ1 .

6. Computation of equilibrium

        In characterizing the cone of diversification of the integrated economy as the set of capital-
labor ratios kti that satisfy κ 2 kt ≤ kti ≤ κ1kt , we have relied heavily, not just on the assumption of

specific functional forms for φ1 , φ2 , and f , but also on the assumption that all countries produce
both goods. Under these assumptions, we derive optimal capital-labor ratios in each industry as
functions of the world capital-labor ratio. If capital-labor ratios for all countries are inside the
cone of diversification, we are justified in using the integrated economy approach. If not, and at
least one of the countries specializes, p2t / p1t does not, in general, equal to its value in the

integrated equilibrium. Consequently, we cannot use κ j ( p2 (kt ) / p1 (kt ) ) = κ j kt to characterize the

cone of diversification and to determine the pattern of specialization. Instead, we must calculate
κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) and κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) by solving (17). In the next section, we provide an example that
illustrates how κ j ( p2t / p1t ) differs from κ j kt when one of the countries specializes.


                                                                      30

        If the integrated economy approach is valid because there are no corner solutions in
investment and all countries have capital-labor ratios that remain in the cone of diversification, then
we need only solve for the sequence of capital stocks for the integrated economy by solving the
one-sector social planner’s problem (21) to solve for equilibrium. Given this solution, we can then
use propositions 3 and 4 calculate the equilibrium prices and the formula

                                                      kti − kt zt ⎛ kTi − kT ⎞

                                                          kt   zT ⎝ kT ⎠

to disaggregate consumption and investment decisions. We disaggregate production decisions by
requiring that all countries use capital and labor in the optimal proportions, k ijt / Aijt = κ j kt , and

satisfy the feasibility conditions (9) and (10).
        If the integrated economy approach is not valid, the situation is far more complicated. To
keep our discussion simple, we ignore the possibility of corner solutions in investment and instead
focus on the case where complications arise because of specialization in production. The approach
that we take is to guess the sequence of capital stocks for all countries and the sequence of prices
for good 1. Given the price of good 1, we use the first-order conditions
                                                  f1 ( x1it , x2i t ) = f1 (c1it , c2i t ) = p1t                                          (94)



                                                                      31
to determine the ratio x1it / x2i t = c1it / c2i t . Given this ratio, we can determine the price of the second
good using the first-order condition

                                                 f 2 ( x1it , x2i t ) = p2t .                               (95)

Given the prices p1t and p2t , we can determine the cone of diversification by solving for

κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) and κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) . Given the cone of diversification, we can solve for the pattern of
production and the factor prices in each country. We can divide total income into consumption and
investment by fixing investment at the level needed to accumulate capital for the next period.
        For computation, we need to reduce the remaining equilibrium conditions to a finite number
of equations in the same finite number of unknowns, which are the sequence of capital stocks for
all countries and the sequence of prices for good 1 that we have guessed. We do this by truncating
the time horizon at some period T by assuming that the equilibrium approximately converges to a
steady state — or a sustained growth path, depending on parameter values — by that period.
Bajona and Kehoe (2006) argue that any steady state of the generalized Ventura model has factor
price equalization across countries. In addition, they show that factor prices equalize as countries
converge to a sustained growth path. They also argue that equilibrium cycles are not possible.
        In the appendix, we provide details on the algorithm that we use to compute equilibria in
the examples in the next section, including an example with corner solutions in investment.

7. Numerical examples

        In this section, we present three numerical examples that illustrate different equilibrium
patterns for the Ventura model when there are corner solutions in investment and for the
generalized Ventura model when countries are not in the cone of diversification along the entire
equilibrium path. In each of the examples, we consider a two-country economy. We set β = 0.95 ,

δ = 1 , and L1 = L2 = 10 .

Example 1. (Ventura model with b < 0 )

                                     f ( x1 , x2 ) = 10 ( 0.5 x1−0.5 + 0.5 x2−0.5 ) .
                                                                                 −2
                                                                                                            (96)

We contrast two different worlds. In the first world, k01 = 5 and k02 = 3 . Here there is an
equilibrium with no corner solutions for investment. The solid lines in figure 2 depict the

                                                           32
equilibrium paths for kti in this world. Proposition 5 says that relative income levels diverge over

time, and the solid lines in figure 3 depict this divergence, with ( yt1 − yt ) / yt increasing from
0.1531 in period 0 to 0.1707 in the steady state. (We show the relative income for country 1 only
because symmetry implies that ( yt2 − yt ) / yt = −( yt1 − yt ) / yt .) In the second world, there is an even

larger difference in initial capital stocks, k01 = 6 and k02 = 2 . In this world, the integrated economy
equilibrium is the same as in the first world, but it cannot be disaggregated because there is no
equilibrium without corner solutions in investment. The dashed lines in figure 2 depict the
equilibrium paths for kti in this world. Country 2 has xti = kti = 0 starting in period 3. Proposition
5 gives us no indication of what happens to the distribution of income across countries:
( yt1 − yt ) / yt increases from 0.3063 in period 0 to 0.3211 in period 1 and then steadily declines,
until it equals 0.2977 in the steady state. Notice that relative incomes converge between periods 1
and 2 even though investment is strictly positive in both countries in both periods.

Example 2. (Cobb-Douglas model)

                                              φ1 (k , A) = 10k 0.6 A 0.4                                   (97)

                                              φ2 (k , A) = 10k 0.4A 0.6                                    (98)

                                               f ( x1 , x2 ) = x10.5 x20.5                                 (99)

We assume that k01 = 4 and k02 = 0.1 . Figure 4 shows that the initial endowments of capital per
worker are different enough for factor prices not to equalize across countries in period 0. The labor
abundant country, country 2, specializes in the production of the labor intensive good, and the
capital abundant country, country 1, diversifies. This pattern of production is maintained along the
equilibrium path, with kt2 asymptotically converging to the boundary of the cone of diversification.

Notice that, even though the kt1 is outside the cone of diversification of the integrated economy,

kt1 > κ1 (kt1 + kt2 ) / 2 in periods 0, 1, and 2, it is inside the cone of diversification,

κ1 ( p2t / p1t ) > kt1 > κ 2 ( p2t / p1t ) . Notice too, in figure 5, that relative incomes converge even though
proposition 5 says that relative incomes would stay constant if both countries were to diversify.

Example 3. (C.E.S. model with b < 0 )

                                     φ1 (k , A) = 10 ( 0.8k −0.5 + 0.2A −0.5 )
                                                                                    −2
                                                                                                        (100)


                                     φ2 (k , A) = 10 ( 0.2k −0.5 + 0.8A −0.5 )
                                                                                    −2
                                                                                                        (101)


                                      f ( x1 , x2 ) = ( 0.5 x1−0.5 + 0.5 x2−0.5 )
                                                                                    −2
                                                                                                        (102)

We assume that k01 = 5 and k02 = 2 . Here both countries start inside the cone of diversification, but
one of them exits after a finite number of periods. As figure 7 — a blowup of the detail in figure 6
— shows, the labor abundant country, country 2, produces both goods in periods 0 and 1. In period
2, kt2 jumps outside the cone of diversification and country 2 specializes in the production of the
labor intensive good. (We could say that the boundary of the cone of diversification jumps over
kt2 .) Over time, kt2 converges back to the boundary of the cone of diversification. Since country 1
diversifies along the equilibrium path, factor prices are equalized in periods 0 and 1, but not
afterward. Figure 8 shows that relative incomes converge monotonically over time. This example,
again, illustrates the limited scope of proposition 5. Under the assumption that factor prices
equalize along the equilibrium path, the model reduces to a Ventura model with b = −0.5 and
proposition 5 stipulates divergence in income levels. As the example shows, however, even if
factor prices equalize in the initial periods, the opposite convergence result can hold if factor prices
do not equalize along the entire equilibrium path. The dashed lines in figures 6, 7, and 8 depict the

equilibrium of the Ventura model with f ( x1 , x2 ) = 5.7328 ( 0.5 x1−0.5 + 0.5 x2−0.5 ) , a model with the
                                                                                         −2




same integrated economy equilibrium as our C.E.S. model. Notice how different are the
convergence properties of relative incomes in the two equilibria.

8. Continuous-time Ventura model

        In this section, we derive the properties of convergence in income levels for the continuous-
time version of the Ventura model. The utility function becomes
                                                ∞

                                                             34
where ρ > 0 is the discount rate. As in the model with discrete time, the production functions of
the traded goods are

                                                           y1 = k1                                      (104)

                                                        y2 = A 2 ,                                      (105)

and the production function for the investment good is

                                                     x = f ( x1 , x2 )                                  (106)

where f is specified as in (24) and (25).
          We can find the integrated economy equilibrium by solving the social planner’s problem

                                                               e − ρt log c dt

                                                  s.t. c + x ≤ f (k ,1)                                 (107)

                                                     c≥0, x≥0
                                                       k (0) ≤ k0 .

Given that the cone of diversification is the whole nonnegative quadrant, factor prices equalize at
all equilibrium prices, and, if there are no corner solutions in investment, we can derive formulas
relating the equilibrium levels of capital and income to the levels of capital and income in the
integrated economy equilibrium. In particular, Ventura (1997) shows that the capital-labor ratios
satisfy

Figures 9-11 depict phase diagrams in (k , s ) space for different values of the parameter b . Notice
that the results we obtain are similar to the results obtained in section 4 for the discrete-time
version of the model. Figure 9 shows that, for b > 0 and da11/ b − δ > ρ , s decreases over time and

relative incomes converge. Figure 10 shows that, for b < 0 and da11/ b − δ > ρ , if k0 < kˆ , relative

incomes diverge initially for k0 small enough, but later converge. Divergence of income
everywhere along the equilibrium path is only obtained for very negative values of b and only for
cases where there is positive depreciation, where da11/ b − δ > ρ , and k0 < kˆ , as in figure 11.
        Examining equation (108), we see that the continuous-time model can have the same sort of
problems with corner solutions in investment as does the discrete time model. If z increases over
time, then there are initial endowments of capital per worker sufficiently different so that the
equilibrium will necessarily involve corner solutions in investment, making the integrated economy

                                                           36
approach — and the corresponding phase diagrams — invalid. As example 1 indicates, even if we
allow reversibility of investment and require only that k i ≥ 0 , we can still have corner solutions
where some countries have zero capital stocks..

9. Concluding remarks

          This paper presents results that some economists may find surprising.
          First, proposition 6 says that introducing international trade into a model that reduces to a
one-sector growth model can completely change the results on convergence of income levels. For
example, if b < 0 and δ = 1 , and if the economy is productive enough to converge to a nontrivial
steady state and capital starts below this steady state, there is convergence of income in a world of
closed economies but divergence in a world of open economies. This example illustrates the
danger of using closed economy models to study development in environments where trade may be
important. Not only do results change, but they may be completely the opposite of what the closed
economy analysis suggests.
          Second, proposition 9 says that factor price equalization in a given period does not imply
factor price equalization in the future. In fact, for some parameter values and initial conditions,
factor price equalization in a given period implies that factor prices cannot be equalized in the
future.
          Third, our numerical example 3 shows that, unless we can guarantee factor price
equalization in all periods, our characterization of equilibria — in particular, the convergence
patterns of relative incomes — is not useful even when there is factor price equalization in the
current period. In fact, in a situation where we would expect divergence of income levels if we
could somehow guarantee factor price equalization in the future, we can get convergence of income
levels even while we are in the cone of diversification. This example illustrates the danger of
ignoring the possibility of specialization in production. Not only can results change when we allow
for specialization, but they may be the opposite of what the analysis that assumes factor price
equalization suggests.
          There is another aspect of our convergence results worth commenting on. In the case where
b < 0 and δ = 1 , and where the economy is productive enough to converge to a nontrivial steady
state and capital starts below this steady state, k0 < kˆ , opening a closed economy that is poorer than
the world average to free trade slows down its growth and leads to convergence to a steady state

                                                    37
with a lower capital-output ratio than the country would have reached had it remained closed. It is
easy to show, however, that opening to trade leads to a gain in utility. Free trade guarantees higher
utility, not higher growth rates.

Appendix: Algorithm used in the numerical examples
        We first consider the case where the parameter values are such that the equilibrium of the
integrated economy converges to the nontrivial steady state. To solve the model, we choose a
truncation period T large enough so that the integrated economy equilibrium numerically
converges to this steady state. We solve the system of equations using Newton’s method as
follows.
1. Compute the steady state of the integrated economy by solving r (kˆ) = 1/ β − 1 + δ .
2. Given initial levels of capital in each country k0i , guess values for the (n + 1)T variables kti ,
   i = 1,..., n , t = 1,..., T − 1 , p , t = 0,..., T − 1 , kˆ i , i = 1,..., n .

       (89) and (90) or equations (91) and (92).
   •   For each country, compute the production of each traded good and the factor prices:
       If kti ≥ κ1t , k1it = kti , Ai1t = 1 , y1it = φ1 (kti ,1) , k2i t = 0 , Ai2t = 0 , y2i t = 0 , wti = p1tφ1L (kti ,1) ,
        rti = p1tφ1K (kti ,1) .
       If κ1t > kti > κ 2t , k1it = κ1pt (kti − κ 2pt ) /(κ1pt − κ 2pt ) , Ai1t = (kti − κ 2pt ) /(κ1pt − κ 2pt ) , y1it = φ1 (k1it , A1i t ) ,
        k2i t = κ 2pt (κ1pt − kti ) /(κ1pt − κ 2pt ) , Ai2t = (κ1pt − kti ) /(κ1pt − κ 2pt ) , y2i t = φ2 (k2i t , Ai2t ) wti = p1tφ1L (κ1pt ,1) ,
        rti = p1tφ1K (κ1pt ,1) .
       If kti ≤ κ 2t , k1it = 0 , Ai1t = 0 , y1it = 0 , k2i t = kti , Ai2t = 1 , y2i t = φ2 (kti ,1) , wti = p2tφ2 L (kti ,1) ,

4. If these functions are not all within some specified distance from 0, adjust the guesses for the
   (n + 1)T variables kti , p1t , kˆi using Newton’s method and go to step 3. Iterate until
   convergence.

        In the cases where kt converges to 0 or where kt grows without bound, we define
γ = β ( DA11/ b + 1 − δ ) . We replace k̂ and kˆi in the above algorithm with kˆT = γ ∑ i =1 Li kTi −1 and kˆTi ,
                                                                                        n


and we replace the functions (121) with
                                                f (kˆTi ,1) + (1 − δ + γ )kˆTi
                                                                               −γ                          (124)

If T is very large, the Jacobian matrix for Newton’s method will be ill conditioned because some
of the variables kti will be much larger than others. We can solve this problem by working with
the rescaled variables k i = k i / γ t , t = 1,..., T .

       A brute-force way to deal with corner solutions in investment is to guess the pattern of
corner solutions and to solve the resulting system of equations. We replace the functions
corresponding to first-order conditions,
                                           cti+1
                                                 − (1 − δ + rti+1 )                             (125)
                                           β cti
with
                                                           kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti .                           (126)
When we have solved this system of equations, we can check that the complementary slackness
conditions (27) are satisfied:
                                                        cti+1
                                                   −           + (1 − δ + rti+1 ) ≤ 0                      (127)
                                                        β ct i



whenever we have guessed that xti = 0 . If these conditions are satisfied, we can stop. Otherwise,
we provide a new guess for the pattern of corner solutions and try again.

                                                                      40
        There is a limitation to the algorithm that is worth noting: The functions involved in the
system of equations are not everywhere continuously differentiable. In particular, production plans
and factor prices change in a continuous, but not in a continuously differentiable, manner as
changes in prices cause a country’s capital-labor ratio to pass through the boundary of the cone of
diversification. This can cause Newton’s method to be less stable than it is when working with
continuously differentiable functions. Nonetheless, by keeping the step sizes in the Newton’s
method small, we can still compute equilibria.
