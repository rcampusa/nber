Do Value-Added Taxes Affect International Trade Flows? Evidence from 30 Years of Tax
Reforms

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper uses all Value Added Tax (VAT) changes across all EU Member States from 1988 to
2016 to estimate the effect of VATs on trade flows. We find small elasticities of trade flows with
respect to VATs, in spite of some of the VAT changes being substantial. We estimate
substantially smaller responses of trade flows to VATs compared to the responses of trade flows
to tariffs estimated in the trade literature. This finding holds across different time periods,
countries and types of reforms. Our results imply that VATs are unlikely to distort trade flows.

1       Introduction
Value-Added Taxes (VATs) have become the most common form of consump-
tion taxes in the world, rapidly replacing tariffs as well as sales and excise
taxes, so much so that more than 80% of the world's countries have adopted
a form of VAT. The academic consensus is that adjusting VATs at the border
­ by levying VATs on imports but exempting exports ­ does not distort trade
flows as long as imported goods are subject to the same VAT rate as domestic
goods. For this reason, VATs, as they are currently implemented, are con-
sidered to be trade neutral and the World Trade Organization (WTO) allows
border adjustment of VATs, but does not allow border adjustment of direct
taxes (i.e., payroll taxes, income taxes, etc.) and strictly regulates tariffs.
    This consensus, however, has been repeatedly questioned by policy mak-
ers.1 The trade neutrality of VAT adjustments has received a lot of attention
recently during the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, but the debate dates back
to at least 1971, when the U.S. exempted exports from corporate income taxes
on the basis that European countries are able to exempt their exports from
VATs.2 This legislation was challenged by the European Union (EU), and the
WTO disagreed with the U.S. on the grounds that subsidies to direct taxes
are not considered trade neutral.
    In spite of the WTO's position on the trade neutrality of the border ad-
justment of indirect taxes, there is limited empirical evidence on this question.
Grossman (1980) and Feldstein and Krugman (1990) provide theoretical argu-
ments in favor of VATs' trade neutrality: they show that changes in VATs will
be mitigated through changes in the exchange rate, leaving import and export

    1
     For example, when the differential treatment of direct and indirect taxes by the WTO
was decided in 1970, a number of countries disagreed and argued that exempting indirect
taxes is not trade neutral. See §8 of the Report by the Working Party on Border Tax Adjust-
ments (available at https://www.wto.org/gatt_docs/English/SULPDF/90840088.pdf).
The main reason put forward for allowing exemptions of indirect taxes was that these ex-
emptions have been in place for twenty years and "had proved fairly adequate and easy to
administer" and "no motive could be found to change them" (see §9).
   2
     In 1971, the U.S. Congress legislated the creation of a new corporate entity called a
Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC), which was exempt from U.S. corporate
taxes as long as most of its income was the result of exports.

flows unaffected. Their theory relies on plausible but also strong assumptions,
disregarding a number of practical issues associated with the implementation
and administration of VATs. First, VATs are often implemented as a substitute
to taxes that are likely to distort trade balances, such as corporate, income or
payroll taxes.3 If VAT changes are offset by changes in distortionary taxes, in-
ternational trade flows might be affected, as shown in Feldstein and Krugman
(1990). Second, while exports should qualify for full VAT rebates, this does
not often happen in practice due to administrative difficulties. Changes in
VATs can therefore hinder exports (Chandra and Long (2013)). Finally, a key
theoretical argument for the trade neutrality of VATs is that tax incentives
are mitigated through changes in real exchange rates: an increase in VAT
should generate an increase in the exchange rate of the domestic currency of
equivalent magnitude. However, since 1999 many European countries share a
uniform currency, the euro, yet impose different VATs. While efforts are made
to harmonize VATs, the process is yet to be completed, which implies that
at least from 1999 onward, exchange rates could not mitigate the incentive
effects of European VATs. While all three of these caveats are likely to exist,
the magnitude of the frictions they introduce is unknown and could possibly
be small enough that ­ in spite of their prevalence ­ VATs are still mostly
trade neutral, which calls for an empirical investigation of this question.
    In this paper, we empirically assess the trade neutrality of VATs by us-
ing all VAT changes that occurred in Member States of the European Union
from 1988 to 2016 and estimate their effect on trade flows with trade part-
ners. We find that changes in VAT rates have little to no effect on imports or
exports. We estimate upper bounds on trade flow elasticities with respect to
VAT rates that are substantially smaller than the previously estimated trade
flow elasticities with respect to tariffs. Our finding holds across different spec-
ifications, countries, time periods, both for small and large VAT changes, and
also for VAT increases and decreases. Importantly, our results do not suffer
from measurement errors due to timing, because VATs on imports are collected

  3
     For example, Buettner and Madzharova (2016) document that declines in tariffs in
developing countries were accompanied by increases in VATs.

                                         3
immediately at the border. Our results are also robust to price changes due to
passthrough of VATs because we consider trade flow measures in dollars and
in tons.
    To estimate the effect of VAT on trade we use two data sources. First,
we use historical VAT rates compiled by Benzarti et al. (2017) which contain
detailed information on VAT rates by commodity and country, and the exact
dates of the VAT rate changes. Second, we use information on export and
import flows from the European Commission's Eurostat database. This trade
data records monthly trade flows between members of the European Union and
their partners from 1988 to 2016, broken down by Combined Nomenclature
levels. We estimate the effect of VAT on trade using a fixed effects regression
similarly to Fuest et al. (2018). Our identification relies on plausibly exoge-
nous VAT rate changes across EU members, and allows for contemporaneous,
lagged and anticipatory effects of tax rate changes. Note that the trade liter-
ature has mostly focused on estimating the effect of specific trade agreements,
often restricted to a specific set of commodities. In contrast, we use all VAT
reforms and all commodities throughout a thirty year period. In theory, one
could collect information on all tariff changes and implement our approach to
tariffs (instead of VATs). However, in practice, this does not seem possible for
the following reason. Even if we could systematically collect tariff rates across
this thirty year period, we would still need to know the intermediate input
composition of final goods: while VATs do not apply to intermediate inputs,
this is not the case for tariffs. Suppose, for example, that a country imposes
a tariff on steel but not on cars. Then our approach would treat cars as a
control group, even though the policy is likely to result in increased imports
of cars. Increased steel costs would increase the price of locally produced cars,
which would lead to substitution for imported cars. Given this limitation, we
do not estimate the effect of tariffs on trade flows using our data, but instead
rely on estimates from the vast trade literature on the topic and implement
similar specifications to the ones they use.
     A potential concern with our approach is that the reforms we use could
be endogenous to economic conditions or could be contemporaneous to other


                                       4
tax changes. We address this concern in the following ways. First, using a
narrative approach, in the spirit of Romer and Romer (2010), we document
the underlying reasons for the VAT changes and select out any changes im-
plemented as part of stimulus packages or austerity measures and find similar
trade flow elasticities with respect to VAT rates. Second, we find no significant
pre-trends in trade flows prior to these reforms.
    Our findings are important for two reasons. First, in spite of the preva-
lence of VATs in the world, there is very limited work analyzing them. Our
paper helps further our understanding of how VATs affect the world economies.
This paper is most related to a literature that estimates the effect of VATs
on trade, such as Desai and Hines (2005), Keen and Syed (2006), Nicholson
(2010) and, more recently, Freund and Gagnon (2017). This literature finds
mixed results on the effect of VATs on trade flows. We contribute to this
literature by improving on identification: we use detailed tax rate information
across all EU member countries matched to detailed trade flow information on
various categories of products across all OECD countries to causally estimate
the relationship between tax rates and imports/exports. Our approach yields
different results, as we find that VATs have very little effect on trade flows.
    Second, our paper contributes to the broader Public Finance literature
by considering other margins of tax distortion beyond direct distortions to
the taxed commodity. Indeed, most estimates of the distortionary effects of
taxation focus on direct effects but do not consider fiscal externalities. Because
of their ubiquity, VATs could have far reaching effects beyond their direct effect
on prices. While other papers have focused on several indirect effects, such as
the effect of VATs on wages, on the cost of intermediate outputs or firm entry
and exit, few papers have considered the indirect effect that taxes can have on
trade.4

      Pomeranz (2015) and Naritomi (Forthcoming) study the effect of VAT on tax evasion;
while Carbonnier (2007), Benzarti and Carloni (2019) and Benzarti et al. (2017) explore the
effect of VATs on prices and firm behaviors.

2    Data and Institutional Background

Value Added Taxes: VATs are a form of indirect taxation that applies to
the value-added of goods and services sold. Sales taxes, excise taxes and VATs
are theoretically equivalent but there are a few differences in the way they are
implemented. First, intermediate inputs are subject to VATs but firms can
claim credits for the VAT that they pay on these inputs, which implies that
only value-added is ultimately taxed and the statutory incidence of VATs falls
on final consumers, similarly to sales taxes. Second, VATs in the EU are
included in consumer prices, while sales taxes in the U.S. are not. Third,
EU member countries have several VAT rates in place, including a standard
rate that applies to most commodities and reduced rates for food, heating and
passenger transport. There are also some commodities that are not subject to
VATs, such as commodities offered by not-for-profit institutions. For imports,
value-added taxes are due at the moment of import; this ensures that we are
able to correctly assign VAT rates based on the month of import.
    Importantly for this analysis, VATs, sales taxes and excise taxes in the EU,
the US and around the world are border adjustable, i.e., imports are subject
to these taxes while exports are not. The WTO makes a clear distinction
between sales taxes, excise taxes and VATs, on the one hand, and tariffs, on
the other; the latter are considered to be trade barriers.


Historical VAT Data: We use the data on historical VAT rates compiled
by Benzarti et al. (2017). The database contains detailed information on VAT
rates by commodity and country, and the exact dates of tax rate changes. The
data covers all commodities subject to VATs but does not contain informa-
tion on VAT re-classifications, i.e. commodities that are re-classified from the
standard to the reduced VAT rate and vice versa. These re-classifications are
relatively rare, as they are only allowed by the European Commission under
very special circumstances. VAT rate changes vary between 0.22 to 13.83 per-
centage points. Half of tax changes in our sample are under 2pp, and 75%
were under 4pp.

                                       6
Trade Data: The information on export and import flows was obtained from
the European Commission Eurostat database.5 The trade data records trade
flows between members of the European Union and their partners from 1988 to
2016. For this reason, the data availability depends on the year a given country
joined the EU or announced such plans: trade data is available starting from
1988 for Austria, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom; while data
for Belgium and Luxembourg is available from 1999; and data for Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia is available from 2000 on. Finally, trade flows
for Croatia are available starting from 2002. The detailed data is broken down
by the Combined Nomenclature levels (HS2, HS4, HS6 and CN8). For each
product category, Eurostat records monthly import and export flows in euros
and tons, as well as trade quantities in supplementary units for some goods,
separately for each partner country. Partner countries include all countries of
the world.


Matching the Trade Data with the Tax Data: Because VATs only apply
to final products, the first step in the matching process is to exclude categories
of goods that are likely to be used as intermediate products. To do so we rely
on the United Nations Broad Economic Categories (BEC) classification, which
divides products into four categories according to a given good's main use: (1)
intermediate, (2) consumption, (3) capital goods and (4) others. We exclude
categories 1 and 3 as they are not subject to VATs. Category 4 contains some
products that can be used both as a means of production or as consumption
goods by individuals, e.g. a car, which can be used by firms or individuals.
Our main analysis only includes consumption goods (category 3), however,
the results are robust to including goods that can be used both as a means of
production or as final goods (category 4). We then match the BEC categories
to the Harmonized System (HS) categories, which is the classification used in

3        The Effect of VATs on Trade
3.1        Empirical Approach
To estimate the effect of VAT rate changes on trade flows, we follow the ap-
proach of Evans et al. (1999), Serrato et al. (2016) and Fuest et al. (2018) by
running the following fixed effects regression and including leads and lags of
tax rates:
                       k =K
 ln (T radeicpt ) =            k ln(1 + ic,t+k ) + i + µc + p + t + Xct + Ypt + icpt, (1)
                       k =-K


where T radeicpt measures imports or exports in euros or kilos for commodity i
for declarant country c with partner p at time t, ict measures the VAT rate in
the declarant country c at time t for commodity i. Time is measured monthly
or quarterly, depending on the specification. Declarant's controls Xct include
declarant's GDP and whether the declarant is a member of the Eurozone. Ypt
measures the partner's GDP. The main coefficient of interest is 0 . It is the
elasticity of trade flows (imports or exports) with respect to the VAT rate at
the time of the VAT rate change: for example, if 0 = 0, then trade flows
do not respond to VAT changes, and if 0 = 1, then a one percentage point
change in VAT rates leads to a one percent change in trade flows.6 For k < 0,
the k coefficients estimate the lagged response of trade flows, k months after
the VAT rate change takes place. Conversely, for k > 0, the k coefficients
estimate anticipatory responses, k months before the VAT rate changes take
place.
    This fixed effects regression with leads and lags generalizes a difference-
in-differences specification with multiple periods, commodities and countries.
The main identification assumption is the same as that for difference-in-differences
regressions: absent the tax change, there would have been no change in trade
    6
        Under the assumption that log(1 +  )   for small values of  .

                                               8
flows of the treated relative to the untreated commodities. Figures 1 and 2,
which plot the leads and lags coefficients estimated using (1), show no pre-
trends in the response of trade flows to VAT rate changes, which supports this
identification assumption. The identification is obtained from within-country
specific-commodity variation in VAT rates over time.

3.2     Regression Estimates
To reduce the effect of measurement error and to ensure that our results are
not driven by unit, time or commodity aggregation, we run specification (1)
along three different dimensions of the data. First, we aggregate the data in
two ways: by trading partners and by commodities. When aggregating by
trading partners, we focus on trade flows at the HS4 level, using specification

                            k =K
        ln (T radeict ) =           k ln(1 + ic,t+k ) + i + µc + t + Xct + ict.        (2)
                            k =-K


When aggregating by commodities, we collapse by VAT rate type, and focus on
the following partner-countries: USA, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Korea,
Turkey, Australia, as well as every "eventual" EU country (i.e., all current 27
EU Member States). The rest of the trading partners are combined into one
observation.7 This results in specification:


                    k =K
 ln (T radecpt) =           k ln(1 + c,t+k ) +  + µc + p + t + Xct + Ypt + cpt, (3)
                    k =-K


where  denote VAT rate type fixed effects. Second, we use two different
measures of trade, which are volume (tons) and value (euros). And third, we
consider both monthly and quarterly trade flows. Overall, this amounts to
running eight different specifications.
    Figure 1 plots the results of running specification (2) on quarterly data,
for both tons and euros, aggregated by partner country. The corresponding
   7
    We do this because the data is extremely detailed and will include very small countries
with no or very little trade making the bilateral trade matrix very large.

                                              9
regression outputs are reported in Table 1. Similar results based on specifi-
cation (3) are available in Figure 2 and Table 2. Monthly level results are
reported in Appendix Figures A.1 and A.2 and Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2.
    Consistently across all specifications, we find that trade flows ­ be it ex-
ports or imports ­ are barely affected by changes in VAT rates. Our estimates
imply a 95% confidence bound of the elasticity of trade flows, 0 , in value
(euros), with respect to VAT rates of 1.76 and 2.47 for imports and exports,
respectively. The bounds on the estimates in tons are smaller and equal to
1.38 and 1.51 for imports and exports, respectively. Specifications in tons
control for possible price effects if VATs are passed through to prices. These
elasticities are smaller than trade flow elasticities with respect to tariffs, as
discussed in Section 4.
     Importantly for our identification strategy, we detect no evidence of pre-
trends, anticipatory or lagged responses, as can be seen in Figures 1 and 2.
This mitigates concerns that VAT changes are implemented as a response to
trade flow changes.


3.3     Robustness Checks
To ensure that our results are not driven by our choice of aggregation, specific
reforms or subsets of the data, we perform several robustness checks. For all of
six of the following specifications, we find coefficients of similar magnitudes as
the ones estimated using our main specifications (reported in Tables 1 and 2),
which mitigates our concerns that our elasticity estimates are spurious. First,
we run specification (1) on the disaggregated HS4 categories. Because of the
large number of product categories and partners, we perform this analysis in
differences.8 The results are available in Figure A.3. Second, we estimate
equation (2) separately for standard and reduced tax rates (Table A.1), and
equation (3) separately for within-EU trades and not (Table A.2). Third,
we run specifications (2) and (3) separately on VAT increases and decreases
in (Figures A.4 and A.5). We do so because the pass-through of VATs to
   8
    In addition, we run specifications (2) and (3) in differences. The results are very similar
and are available upon request.

                                              10
domestic prices is a key parameter in determining the responsiveness of trade
flows to VAT rates, and Benzarti et al. (2017) show that pass-through rates are
different for VAT increases and decreases. Fourth, to ensure that the absence
of response of trade flows to VAT rates is not due to the fact that the VAT rate
changes are small, we run specification (1) on the 25% largest VAT changes
(Figure A.6). Fifth, to ensure that our reforms do not occur at the same time
as recessions, which in turn could affect trade flows, we exclude any reforms
that are part of stimulus packages (Figure A.7). Sixth, we consider Eurozone
and non-Eurozone declarants separately (Figures A.8 and A.9), to account for
potential differences in exchange rate adjustments.
    Finally, to make our specifications more comparable to estimates from
the trade literature we consider two additional tests. First, instead of using
actual values of trade flows in dollars or in tons, we measure trade flows as a
share of all imports (exports) from a given declarant country (Figure A.10).
Second, in addition to quarter and country fixed effects we add year-declarant,
year-partner, and declarant-partner fixed effects (Figure A.11). Adding such
fixed effects significantly reduces our power, since identification relies on tax
changes that happen within the same year in a same declarant country for
different products, which are rare. Nonetheless, all results are similar to our
baseline specification.



4    Relation to Trade Cost Elasticities and Dis-
     cussion
The international trade literature estimates elasticities of trade flows with
respect to trade costs. Most of the estimates are derived using variation in
tariff costs. Comparing our VAT elasticity estimates to the tariff elasticity
estimates derived in the trade literature allows us to assess how close VATs
are to tariffs. Our estimated VAT elasticities are systematically smaller than
the tariff elasticity estimated by the trade literature.
    Our elasticity estimates are systematically smaller than 1, both for imports

                                       11
and exports, in euros and in tons. The implied 95% confidence upper bounds
from our estimates are all smaller than 2.5. The most recent elasticity estimate
of trade flows with respect to tariffs is from Caliendo and Parro (2015) who find
an average elasticity of 4.55 (0.35). As reported in Caliendo and Parro (2015),
there are several other estimates in the literature: Romalis (2007) also uses
tariff changes under NAFTA and finds a trade elasticity that ranges between 4
and 13; Eaton and Kortum (2002) report elasticity estimates ranging between
3.60 and 12.86, and their preferred estimate is 8.28; Hillberry et al. (2005)
find an average elasticity of 17; Broda and Weinstein (2006) find an average
elasticity of 17 at the seven-digit (TSUSA), 7 at the three-digit (TSUSA), 12
at the ten-digit (HTS), and 4 at the three-digit (HTS) goods disaggregation.
Clausing (2001) and Head and Ries (2001) find elasticities between 7 and 11.4.
Yi (2003) considers several trade models and shows that elasticities equal to
15 are needed to match the bilateral trade flows.
    Although our settings and approaches are different, we can reject that, for
any of our specifications, trade elasticities and VAT elasticities are equal. This
implies that VATs are unlikely to distort trade in the way tariffs do. As dis-
cussed in the introduction, we cannot implement estimate the effect of tariffs
on trade flows without having more detailed information on the intermedi-
ate inputs used in production of final goods. A tariff on steel, for example,
would affect the trade flow of canned goods even if tariffs on canned goods are
unaffected.
   A key prediction from Feldstein and Krugman (1990) is that exchange rate
adjustments could mitigate the real effects of VATs on trade. When consid-
ering European countries, this assumption is unlikely to hold, simply because
a large number of European countries have adopted a common currency but
impose individual VAT rates. If Italy, for example, increases its VAT rate, it
could have an effect on the euro, but it is very unlikely for the euro to fully
adjust in response to the VAT change, given that the level of the euro also
depends on the economies of France, Germany, etc.
    However, whether an exchange rate adjustment is necessary, depends on
the pass-through of VATs to prices. If the passthrough is 100%, no adjustment


                                       12
is necessary. To see this, suppose the economy is in equilibrium and the
domestic goods price pD equals the world price pW . Now consider a VAT 
that is imposed on domestic products and imports but not on exports. With a
100% passthrough, equilibrium is reached immediately both in domestic and
world markets: the tax-inclusive price of imported goods, (1 +  )pW , equals to
the tax-inclusive domestic price, (1 +  )pD , and the price of domestic exports,
pD , equals the world price, pW . The imposition of a VAT rate does not distort
the relative prices and therefore does not affect imports and exports. Compare
this to the case when the passthrough, , is less than 100%. For a small open
economy, the price of imports after the imposition of a VAT, (1+ )pW , is higher
than that of domestic goods, (1+  )pD , which leads to a reduction in demand
for imports. On the other hand, the price of exports, (1 +  )pD /(1 +  ), is
lower than the world price, pW , because exports are exempt from the VAT
but the passthrough is less than 100%. This results in increased demand for
exported goods. Therefore, with less than full passthrough, equilibrium must
be reached through an exchange rate adjustment: an increase in domestic
currency eliminates arbitrage opportunities and restores trade balance.
    These theoretical arguments thus suggest that trade neutrality of VATs
in the EU rely both on the ability of exchange rates to adjust in response to
VAT changes and on the VAT passthrough rates to prices. In recent work,
Benzarti et al. (2017) estimate the pass-through of VATs to prices in all EU
Member States from 1996 to 2015 and find that VAT increases (which rep-
resent the majority of our sample) are passed through to prices. While the
passthrough the authors find is not 100%, it helps explain our finding that the
effect of VAT rate changes on trade flows is limited.



5    Conclusion
This paper uses a large set of VAT changes to provide empirical evidence on
the effect of VATs on trade flows. We find that VATs have very little effect on
imports or exports and our elasticity estimates are substantially lower than the
tariff elasticities estimated in the trade literature. Our finding has important

                                      13
implications. First, it contributes to the international trade and public finance
literatures by providing empirical evidence that VATs do not distort trade.
Second, it helps settle a long-lasting debate mostly between the U.S., the
WTO and EU Member States as to whether VATs should be treated as tariffs.

     Notes : This figure presents the estimates of k and corresponding 95% confidence intervals from regression models (2) and (3), with
     12 quarters of leads and lags included. All specifications include year-quarter fixed effects and the following controls: declarant's
     and partner's GDP, whether declarant is a Eurozone member, whether a tax change is an increase. In addition, Panel A includes
     declarant and product category fixed effects, while Panel B includes declarant, partner, and tax rate type fixed effects. Outcome
     variable measures import and export flows in euros and tons. Only quarters with large tax changes (top 25th percentile ­ greater
     than 4pp) or no tax changes included.

     Notes : This figure presents the estimates of k and corresponding 95% confidence intervals from regression models (2) and (3), with
     12 quarters of leads and lags included. All specifications include year-quarter fixed effects and the following controls: declarant's
     and partner's GDP, whether declarant is a Eurozone member, whether a tax change is an increase. In addition, Panel A includes
     declarant and product category fixed effects, while Panel B includes declarant, partner, and tax rate type fixed effects. Outcome
     variable measures import and export flows in euros and tons. Tax changes motivated by austerity measures are removed.

     Notes : This figure presents the estimates of k and corresponding 95% confidence intervals from regression models (2) and (3), with
     12 quarters of leads and lags included. All specifications include year-quarter fixed effects and the following controls: declarant's and
     partner's GDP, whether a tax change is an increase. In addition, Panel A includes declarant and product category fixed effects, while
     Panel B includes declarant, partner, and tax rate type fixed effects. Outcome variable measures import and export flows in euros
     and tons. Observations are included if the declarant is part of the Eurozone in that quarter.

     12 quarters of leads and lags included. All specifications include year-quarter fixed effects and the following controls: declarant's and
     partner's GDP, whether a tax change is an increase. In addition, Panel A includes declarant and product category fixed effects, while
     Panel B includes declarant, partner, and tax rate type fixed effects. Outcome variable measures import and export flows in euros
     and tons. Observations are included if the declarant is not part of the Eurozone in that quarter.

     Notes : This figure presents the estimates of k and corresponding 95% confidence intervals from regression models (2) and (3), with
     12 quarters of leads and lags included. All specifications include year-quarter fixed effects and the following controls: declarant's
     and partner's GDP, whether declarant is a Eurozone member, whether a tax change is an increase. In addition, Panel A includes
     declarant and product category fixed effects, while Panel B includes declarant, partner, and tax rate type fixed effects. Outcome
     variable measures import and export flows as a share of all imports/exports of the declarant in euros or tons.

Notes : This table presents the estimates of 0 from regression model (2), with 36 months of leads and lags
included (estimates of k for k = 0 not shown). Columns (1) and (2) include all trade flows. Columns (3)
and (4) restrict the sample to product categories subject to the standard rate only, while columns (5) and (6)
include only reduced-rate products. All specifications include declarant, product category, and year-month
fixed effects, as well as the following controls: declarant's GDP, whether declarant is a Eurozone member,
whether a tax change is an increase. Outcome variable measures import and export flows in euros and tons.

Notes : This table presents the estimates of 0 from regression model (3), with 36 months of leads and lags
included (estimates of k for k = 0 not shown). Columns (1) and (2) include all trade flows. Columns (3)
and (4) look at the within-EU trade, where both declarant and partner are EU members. In columns (5)
and (6), either declarant or partner or both are non-EU members. EU membership is assigned based on
the official year of joining the EU. Separate trade flows recorded for all eventually-EU countries, as well
as Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Korea, Canada, Australia, China, USA. For all other partner countries, trade
flows are combined into one observation. All specifications include declarant, partner, tax rate type and
year-month fixed effects, as well as the following controls: declarant's and partner's GDP, whether declarant
is a Eurozone member, whether a tax change is an increase. Outcome variable measures import and export
flows in euros and tons.
