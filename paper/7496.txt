The Political Economy of the Budget Surplus in the U.S.
Alberto Alesina
NBER Working Paper No. 7496
January 2000


                                            ABSTRACT

       Current surpluses in the U.S. have been achieved by a combination of a strong economy, low
interest rates, and sharp cuts in defence spending. These surpluses follow a period (the eighties) of
rather exceptional budget deficits. This paper investigates the origin, size, and expected future
patterns of the U.S. budget balance. It discusses how different political forces may generate
alternative fiscal scenarios for the U.S. in the next decade.
