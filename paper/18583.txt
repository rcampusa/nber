                                               ABSTRACT

It is often asserted that consumers undervalue future gasoline costs relative to purchase prices when
they choose between automobiles, or equivalently that they have high "implied discount rates" for
these future energy costs. We show how this can be tested by measuring whether relative prices of
vehicles with different fuel economy ratings fully adjust to time series variation in gasoline price forecasts.
We then test the model using a detailed dataset based on 86 million transactions at auto dealerships
and wholesale auctions between 1999 and 2008. Over our base sample, vehicle prices move as if consumers
are indifferent between one dollar in discounted future gas costs and only 76 cents in vehicle purchase
price. We document how endogenous market shares and utilization, measurement error, and different
gasoline price forecasts can affect the results, and we show how to address these issues empirically.
We also provide unique empirical evidence of sticky information: vehicle markets respond to changes
in gasoline prices with up to a six month delay.

1        Introduction

In some situations, it appears that consumers choosing between products are less attentive to an-

cillary costs than to purchase prices. Consumers on eBay, for example, are less elastic to shipping

and handling charges than to the listed purchase price (Hossain and Morgan 2006). Mutual fund

investors appear to be less responsive to ongoing management fees than to upfront payments (Bar-

ber, Odean, and Zheng 2005). Senior citizens are two to …ve times more sensitive to a Medicare

Part D plan’s premium than to its out-of-pocket costs (Abaluck and Gruber 2011). Shoppers are

less elastic to sales taxes than to purchase prices (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009).

        Similarly, it is often asserted that gasoline costs are not fully salient to automobile consumers

when they choose between automobiles with di¤erent fuel economy ratings (e.g. Greene et al. 2005).

If this is true, consumers buy vehicles with lower fuel economy and higher resulting fuel costs than

they would in their private optima. In 2007, the median-income American household spent $2400

on gasoline, and consumers spent $286 billion in total (U.S. BLS 2007). Misoptimization over such

a large expenditure class could cause substantial welfare losses. The purported undervaluation

of future gasoline costs would also help explain what Ja¤e and Stavins (1994) call the "Energy

Paradox": consumers and …rms are puzzlingly slow to make seemingly high-return investments in

energy e¢ ciency.

        Externalities from energy use related to national security and climate change would add to

these potential private losses. Policymakers have long debated whether it is preferable to address

these externalities through gasoline taxes or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards,

which mandate an increase in the average fuel economy of new vehicles. In the absence of other

market failures or misoptimization by consumers, economic analyses typically conclude that CAFE

standards are highly ine¢ cient relative to gas taxes.1 If consumers undervalue fuel costs when they

choose between vehicles, however, CAFE standards can increase welfare, as they e¤ectively force

consumers to buy the energy e¢ cient vehicles that they would want if they were optimizing. This

"paternalistic" argument for energy e¢ ciency policies has long been employed by both academic
    1
    Jacobsen (2010), for example, shows that the CAFE standard has a welfare cost of $222 per metric ton of carbon
dioxide abated, compared to $92 per metric ton for an increase in the gasoline tax that reduces gasoline consumption
by the same amount.

economists (e.g. Hausman 1979)2 as well as the U.S. government.3 Put simply, while political

feasibility plays an important practical role, paternalism is a leading economic justi…cation for one

of the most important and costly public policies a¤ecting the U.S. automotive and energy industries.

However, one problem with the paternalistic justi…cation for fuel economy standards is that there

is not much solid evidence on whether automobile buyers are actually misoptimizing (Parry, Walls,

and Harrington 2007).

       The relevant null hypothesis is that consumers are willing to pay one dollar more to purchase

a vehicle with one dollar less in total forecasted future fuel costs, discounted to present value at

their intertemporal opportunity cost of funds. For expositional purposes, we say that rejecting this

hypothesis is evidence that consumers "undervalue or overvalue gasoline costs." This hypothesis is

related to a long literature, dating at least to the energy crises of the 1970s, that estimates con-

sumers’"implied discount rates" for energy e¢ ciency investments and compares them to benchmark

consumer discount rates.4 The typical empirical approach in this literature has been to exploit vari-

ation in the prices and energy e¢ ciency ratings of a cross-section of energy-using durable goods.

For example, our null hypothesis in a cross-sectional discrete choice framework would be that,

after conditioning on other observed product characteristics, a one dollar increase in a product’s

purchase price is associated with the same decrease in market share as a one dollar increase in

total discounted energy costs. Analogous cross-sectional approaches are used in a seminal paper

by Hausman (1979) on air conditioners, as well as analyses of other energy-using durables such

as houses (Dubin 1992), water and space heating (Dubin and McFadden 1984), and autos (e.g.
   2
     Hausman (1979) …nds that consumers implicitly use a discount rate of 15 to 25 percent per year when they
trade o¤ purchase prices and future energy costs of new air conditioners. He then argues that "this …nding of a high
individual discount rate does not surprise most economists. At least since Pigou, many economists have commented
on a "defective telescopic faculty." A simple fact emerges that in making decisions which involve discounting over
time, individuals behave in a manner which implies a much higher discount rate than can be explained in terms of
the opportunity cost of funds available in credit markets. Since this individual discount rate substantially exceeds
the social discount rate used in bene…t-cost calculations, the divergence might be narrowed by policies which lead to
purchases of more energy-e¢ cient equipment."
   3
     For example, the Regulatory Impact Analysis that justi…es the 2011-2015 increase in the CAFE standard argues
that about $15 billion per year in net bene…ts will ‡ow to consumers who undervalue the bene…ts of fuel economy
(NHTSA 2010).
   4
     The implied discount rate is simply a shorthand way of capturing how people appear to trade o¤ upfront costs
against an analyst’s estimate of future cash ‡ows. Many underlying factors other than consumers’actual discount rates
might a¤ect the implied discount rate, including time horizons, beliefs, and inattention. In our setting, as in many
others, these factors are empirically indistinguishable. We therefore prefer the "undervaluation or overvaluation"
language, as it is more explicitly agnostic. Regardless of the choice of language, the analyst must eventually take a
stand on consumers’actual discount rates in order to determine whether people’s decisions conform to the theoretical
prediction.


                                                         3
Dreyfus and Viscusi (1995), Espey and Nair (2004), and Goldberg (1998)).

    For the cross-sectional estimator to be unbiased, the functional form for how other observed

product characteristics enter utility must be correctly speci…ed, and any unobserved characteristics

must be uncorrelated with energy e¢ ciency. Especially with automobiles, these assumptions appear

problematic. Fuel economy is mechanically correlated with weight and horsepower, and it has often

proven di¢ cult to separately identify preferences for these di¤erent characteristics.5 Furthermore,

fuel economy is highly negatively correlated with price in the cross section, suggesting that larger

vehicles have more observed and unobserved amenities.

    This paper formalizes one potentially-promising alternative approach, which exploits the sig-

ni…cant ‡uctuations in gasoline price forecasts over the past …fteen years. The approach exploits

the fact that a vehicle’s future fuel costs vary as a function of both fuel economy and forecasted

gasoline prices, so changes in gas price forecasts should a¤ect the relative value of high- vs. low-fuel

economy vehicles. Indeed, media reports and academic analyses have documented that as gasoline

prices rise, the relative prices of low-fuel economy vehicles drop (Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer

2012, Langer and Miller 2012). The above null hypothesis, however, does more than predict that

gasoline price forecasts should a¤ect vehicle demand: it predicts exactly how much demand should

be a¤ected. Intuitively, if relative vehicle prices are not su¢ ciently responsive to changes in fore-

casted gasoline costs, this suggests that consumers undervalue gasoline costs when they purchase

vehicles. Conversely, if vehicle prices respond to gas price forecasts more than theory predicts, this

suggests that consumers overvalue gasoline costs.

    We begin from the primitives of a discrete choice utility function and show the empirical as-

sumptions required to test the null hypothesis. We then implement this test using data from

86 million transactions at both auto dealerships and wholesale auctions between 1999 and 2008.

For each month of this study period, these data are collapsed to the average price for each new

and used vehicle in consumers’choice sets.6 Each vehicle has a di¤erent present discounted value
   5
     At least since Atkinson and Halvorsen (1984), it has been pointed out that the high correlation between weight
and fuel economy makes it di¢ cult to separately identify demand for fuel economy. In fact, cross sectional estimation
of automobile demand in characteristic space sometimes gives a negative sign on fuel economy, which would imply
that consumers dislike fuel economy.
   6
     By "vehicle," we mean a model-by-age combination, where "model" is a highly disaggregated de…nition capturing
essentially all variation in make, nameplate, trim, body type, fuel economy, engine displacement, number of cylinders,
and design generation.

(PDV) of fuel costs, depending on its fuel economy rating, future survival probabilities, gasoline

price forecasts, discount rates, and annual vehicle-miles traveled. We condition on vehicle …xed ef-

fects, which sweep out all observed and unobserved characteristics, and test whether relative prices

move one-for-one with changes in the PDV of fuel costs.

   Under the assumptions that consumers’gas price forecasts match those of oil futures markets

and that consumers’ real intertemporal cost of funds is six percent, auto consumers appear to

be indi¤erent between one dollar in discounted future gas costs and 76 cents in purchase price.

The corresponding "implied discount rate," the discount rate for future gas costs that rationalizes

market behavior, is just under 15 percent. We show that the results are robust to a number of

potential confounding factors, such as endogenous changes in utilization patterns and market shares

in response to gas prices, changes in underlying preferences for "green vehicles," and changes in

characteristics over model years.

   However, some empirical issues are extremely important. We use the grouping estimator (Wald

1940, Angrist 1991) to address potential measurement error, and we show that failing to do so

would cause signi…cant attenuation bias. We show that the result that consumers undervalue gas

costs is largely driven by older vehicles: prices for vehicles aged 11-15 years appear to be highly

insensitive to gasoline prices, while prices for relatively-new used vehicles move much more closely

to the theoretical prediction. In addition, undervaluation appears to be more severe when current

gas prices instead of oil futures are used as a proxy for consumers’forecasts of future gas prices.

   The data also show clear evidence of sticky information. In models such as Mankiw and Reis

(2002), Sims (2003, 2010), and Woodford (2003), information about prices, in‡ation, and other

economic variables takes time to di¤use through the population of consumers and …rms, causing

delays in responses to news. In this context, sticky information would cause vehicle prices to adjust

with a delay to changes in gas price forecasts. Indeed, when the model is estimated using monthly

di¤erences instead of the demeaning estimator, vehicle markets appear to be highly insensitive to

the current month’s change in gas price forecasts. Four to six month lags of gas price changes

are conditionally associated with the current month’s change in vehicle prices, suggesting that

sticky information keeps vehicle markets from updating immediately. These results add a unique

microdata-based analysis to the limited set of empirical tests of the sticky information model,


                                                 5
which includes Coibion (2010), Khan and Zhu (2006), Klenow and Willis (2007), and Mankiw and

Reis (2003). Aside from being of interest in macroeconomics and …nance, sticky information also

has important implications for how the undervaluation hypothesis can be tested: identifying o¤ of

high-frequency gas price variation can cause the econometrician to falsely conclude that consumers

undervalue fuel economy as a product attribute when they are instead inattentive to changes in gas

prices.

   Before continuing, it is worth doing a simple calibration to demonstrate why it is di¢ cult

to overstate the importance of this question. Substantial volumes of academic research and policy

discussions have centered on the welfare losses from transport sector carbon emissions and the costs

and bene…ts of di¤erent policy responses. Using the U.S. government’s estimated marginal damage

of carbon emissions (Greenstone, Kopits, and Wolverton 2011), gasoline consumption imposes an

externality of $0.18 per gallon, or about …ve percent of the current gasoline price. Thus, if the carbon

externality is not internalized, consumers account for about 95 percent of the total social cost of

gasoline when they choose between vehicles with di¤erent fuel economy ratings. By comparison,

an implied discount rate of 15 percent, which is well within the range of Hausman (1979) and

other estimates in the literature, would suggest that consumers value only 75 percent of the cost of

gasoline when they choose between vehicles. Thus, while undervaluation and uninternalized carbon

externalities distort vehicle purchases in the same direction, inducing consumers to buy vehicles

that use more gas than in the …rst best, undervaluation could generate distortions several times

larger than the distortions from climate change externalities.

   The paper progresses as follows. In Section 1.1, we discuss related literature. Section 2 models

consumers’ utility functions. Section 3 presents our data, devoting particular attention to the

construction of each vehicle’s total discounted gasoline costs. Section 4 details our estimation

strategy. Section 5 presents empirical results and a long series of robustness checks. Section 6

details the evidence of sticky information, and Section 7 concludes.

1.1    Related Literature

Within the broader literatures on consumer choice of energy-using durables7 and the e¤ects of

gasoline prices on vehicle markets,8 our analysis is most closely related to four papers. Kahn

(1986) tests whether relative prices of used vehicles fully adjust to changes in the relative discounted

present value of relative gas prices caused by the gasoline price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s. A

working paper by Kilian and Sims (2006) builds on Kahn’s approach with updated data. The key

di¤erence between our analysis and these two papers is that we use transaction prices from auctions

and dealerships instead of data from used car price guides such as the Kelley Blue Book or the

National Auto Dealers’Association Used Car Guide. It is crucial to use transaction data because

used car price guides re‡ect the opinion of a small team of analysts who may or may not fully

adjust their price assessments for each vehicle to re‡ect current market conditions. Data from used

car price guides could cause us to falsely conclude that vehicle market prices do not fully adjust to

changes in gasoline prices.

    Sallee, West, and Fan (2009) exploit transaction data from used vehicle auctions to test whether

vehicle prices move one-for-one with the present discounted value of future gasoline costs. Their

identi…cation strategy is di¤erent and complementary to ours: they exploit the fact that autos with

di¤erent odometer readings have di¤erent remaining lifetimes, and an increase in gas prices has a

larger e¤ect on the remaining PDV of gas costs for autos with lower current odometer readings.

One bene…t of their approach is that it allows a more extensive set of …xed e¤ects than we use.

By construction, however, they are testing a di¤erent empirical hypothesis: they ask whether

consumers correctly value di¤erences in odometer readings within vehicle models when gas prices

change, while we ask whether consumers correctly value di¤erences in fuel economy across models

when gas prices change. Conceptually, our hypothesis is closer to the policy-relevant question of

   8
     Other work that examines how vehicle prices adjust in response to gasoline prices include Sawhill (2008), Langer
and Miller (2012), and Austin (2008). Verboven (1999) estimates the discount rates implied by di¤erences between
the prices of gasoline and diesel vehicles in Europe. Ohta and Griliches (1986) examine whether the 1970s gasoline
price shocks a¤ected consumers’valuations of vehicle characteristics. Edelstein and Kilian (2009) document how gas
prices a¤ect consumer expenditures, including demand for domestic vs. foreign automobiles. Li, Timmins, and von
Haefen (2009) and Klier and Linn (2010) test how the price of gasoline a¤ects sales of new vehicles with di¤erent fuel
economy ratings.

whether consumers undervalue energy e¢ ciency.

        Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2012) estimate how changes in gasoline prices a¤ect equilibrium

prices and quantities of new and used vehicles in di¤erent quartiles of the fuel economy distribution.

They then plug these estimates into an Excel spreadsheet which outputs the implied discount rates

at which the average prices of vehicles in each MPG quartile fully adjust to changes in gasoline costs.

Depending on their assumptions, they …nd implied discount rates ranging from negative 6.2 percent

to positive 20.9 percent. When using assumptions that correspond most closely to ours, they …nd

an implied discount rate for used vehicles of 13 percent.9 Our analysis di¤ers by being somewhat

more formal: for example, we specify the undervaluation hypothesis from the primitives of a utility

function, which helps in understanding the economic meaning of the identifying assumptions. We

also uncover additional empirical …ndings, such as the evidence of sticky information in Section 6.




2        Model

In this section, we specify a static discrete choice model. In Appendix A, we show that under

the assumption of stationarity, this simple model can be derived from a dynamic model in which

consumers buy and re-sell their vehicles. Consumers derive utility from owning a vehicle and from

consuming a numeraire good. We de…ne a "vehicle" as a model-by-age combination, where j indexes

models and a indexes age in years. Consumers also can choose an outside option, denoted j = 0,

which is to own no vehicle. The utility of this outside option is normalized to zero. Consumer i

has budget constraint wi .

        The purchase price of vehicle ja at time t as pjat . Gjat is the present discounted value (PDV) of

future gasoline costs over the vehicle’s remaining life. The average consumer’s utility from owning

and using vehicle ja over its remaining life is e jat ; we call this the "average usage utility." Individual

i’s usage utility also has an unobserved deviation from average usage utility, denoted                    ijat .   The

variable e ja captures the mean value of average usage utility for vehicle ja across all time periods,

and ejat       e

    9
    This 13 percent …gure is from Table 7 of Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2012). It is the mean of the implicit
discount rates for the three di¤erent quartile pairs for used vehicles when using vehicle-miles traveled and survival
probabilities from NHTSA, which uses the same underlying data as we do.

    Consumer i’s indirect utility from vehicle ja at time t is:



                            uijat = (wi       pjat        Gjat ) + e ja + ejat +            ijat                     (1)

    The marginal utility of money is . The "valuation weight" on fuel costs is : if consumers value

purchase prices and discounted fuel costs equally, then                  = 1. If consumers undervalue or overvalue

fuel costs, then   < 1 or    > 1, respectively. This framework is analogous to the attention weight

models in Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009), DellaVigna (2009, page 349), and other analyses. We

assume that both      and    are constant.

    In specifying the basic model, we assume that                   takes the extreme value distribution, giving

the traditional representative-consumer logit model. Integrating over the distribution of                        gives a

market-level relationship between prices and shares, which are denoted by s. Typically, this identity

is arranged to give the term ln sjat      ln s0t on the left:



                            ln sjat    ln s0t =        pjat             Gjat + e ja + ejat                           (2)

    Of course, this identity can also be re-arranged with prices on the left:


                                                  1
                            pjat =     Gjat           (ln sjat      ln s0t ) +     ja   +   jat                      (3)

                                                         e                     e
                                                             ja                  jat
    This equation includes new variables       ja                 and    jat           , which represent the dollar value

of the utility represented by e ja and ejat . Section 4 begins with this equation in presenting our

empirical strategy.




3    Data

Our dataset includes average prices, quantities, and characteristics of all used passenger vehicle

models registered in the U.S., in monthly cross sections from January 1999 to December 2008.

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics.

    Fuel economy data were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which



                                                             9
measures fuel use over a standardized laboratory drive cycle and then adjusts the results to account

for the typical consumer’s actual in-use fuel economy. For all model years, we use the EPA’s most

recent adjustment, which was calculated in 2008. Per Greene et al. (2007), we also assume that fuel

economy degrades over each vehicle’s life at 0.07 MPG per year. Vehicle class designations - pickups,

sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans, two-seaters, and …ve classes of cars based on interior volume

- are also taken from the EPA’s fuel economy dataset. All other vehicle characteristics, including

horsepower, curb weight, wheelbase, and Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), are from

Ward’s Automotive Yearbook. All dollar …gures in this paper are real July 2005 dollars, de‡ated

using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index series for "All Urban Consumers, All

Items Less Energy."

   Vehicle prices are based on microdata obtained from Manheim, a …rm which intermediates

approximately half of auto auction transactions in the United States. The principal sellers are

dealerships, rental car companies, and auto manufacturers re-selling o¤-lease vehicles. Buyers are

typically dealerships which then retail the used vehicles. We observe each of Manheim’s approxi-

mately 45 million transactions between 1999 and 2008. While only about one in four used vehicles

traded passes through an auction (Manheim 2009), the auction market is the largest source of

transaction price data. Furthermore, the Kelley Blue Book and other price guides, which are the

starting point for price negotiations in many of the non-auction transactions, are largely based on

auction prices. To get pjat , we simply collapse the data to the level of mean price for each vehicle

in each month, after excluding vehicles rated as low-quality or scrap quality.

   Some alternative speci…cations employ prices from the JD Power and Associates (JDPA) "Power

Information Network," which collects detailed microdata on approximately 31 percent of US retail

auto transactions through a network of more than 9,500 dealers. For each vehicle ja, we obtained

monthly mean prices adjusted for customer cash rebates and, if the transaction included a trade-in,

the di¤erence between the trade-in vehicle’s actual resale value and the negotiated trade-in price.

We use the Manheim used vehicle price data in our base speci…cations because these data include

more than twice as many observations at the jat level, while there are fewer than 1000 observations

in JDPA that are not in Manheim.

   We observe national-level registered quantities of each vehicle in each year from 1999 through


                                                 10
2008 in the National Vehicle Population Pro…le, a dataset obtained from market research …rm R.L.

Polk. The quantities represent all vehicles registered to private individuals and to ‡eets such as

taxi and rental car companies and corporate and government motor pools. These quantity data

are matched to the price data using vehicle-speci…c serial numbers called Vehicle Identi…cation

Numbers.

    We de…ne the choice set to include all "substitutable" used gasoline-fueled light duty vehicles

that have EPA fuel economy ratings and are less than 25 years old. By "substitutable," we mean

cars, pickups, SUVs, minivans, and other light trucks, but not motorcycles, cutaway motor homes,

limousines, camper vans, chassis cab and tilt cab pickups, hearses, and other unusual vehicles where

we expect the substitution elasticity to be very small. In our base speci…cation, we also exclude

cargo and passenger vans as well as ultra-luxury and ultra-high performance exotic vehicles10 due

to their low substitutability with the rest of the market. It turns out that including these vehicles

does not change the results.

    We de…ne a "model" j to capture all possible variation in fuel economy ratings and much of

the observable variation in prices. This is more disaggregated than a "nameplate," which refers to

a colloquial name such as "Ford Taurus" or "Honda Civic." We de…ne a "model" at the level of

make, nameplate, trim, body type, fuel economy, engine displacement, and the number of cylinders.

As a result, the average make and nameplate combination in our dataset includes seven di¤erent

"models." For example, there are 11 di¤erent con…gurations of model year 2004 cars called the

"Honda Civic" that appear in our dataset as separate "models," including coupe and sedan versions

of the DX, EX, and LX, the Si Hatchback, the Civic Hybrid, and several others.

    Vehicles with the same model name are typically o¤ered for several consecutive model years,

although some are o¤ered for many more. As extreme examples, the Ford F-150 and Honda Civic

have each been o¤ered in every model year since 1973. Of course, the 1973 and 2008 versions of

these models are very di¤erent. Every several years, auto manufacturers redesign their models and

de…ne a new "generation" of a vehicle. For example, Honda introduced new generations of the Civic

for the 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2012 model years. A "generation" is a well-

3.1     Discounted Gasoline Costs

The variable Gjat is the present discounted value of lifetime gasoline costs over future years y, for

the average driver of vehicle ja at time t:

                                         L
                                         X
                                Gjat =         y
                                                   gy mjay fjay1     jay                          (4)
                                         y=0


   L denotes the maximum possible lifetime of a vehicle, which we take to be 25 years. The

variable gy is the gasoline price forecast for year y, mjay is expected vehicle-miles traveled, fjay

is fuel economy in miles per gallon,     jay   is the probability that the vehicle survives to year y

conditional on surviving to its current age a, and       is the annual discount factor.

   Our parameter of interest      is the coe¢ cient on this variable, and decisions we make here

mechanically a¤ect the parameter estimates. For example, using a lower discount rate than con-

sumers actually face would in‡ate Gjat , thereby biasing b toward zero. Alternatively, understating

a vehicle’s expected lifetime or usage would de‡ate Gjat , biasing b away from zero.



3.1.1    Vehicle-Miles Traveled and Survival Probability

To estimate vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), we use publicly-available data from the 2001 National

Household Travel Survey (NHTS). This is a nationally-representative survey of approximately

25,000 households that includes the age, fuel economy, and vehicle class for each vehicle owned. As

part of the survey, about 25,000 vehicles in the national sample had their odometers read twice, with

several months between readings. These two readings were then used to estimate annualized VMT.

We regress annualized VMT on class dummies and vehicle age and use these estimates to …t mjay

for all vehicles in our sample. When we adjust for uncertainty in the …rst-step estimates of Gjat

(Murphy and Topel 1985), we use the Huber-White robust standard errors from this regression.


                                                    12
   Our base speci…cation assumes that this …tted mjay does not depend on the gasoline price

forecast in year y. Either of two separate arguments can justify this. First, empirical estimates of

VMT demand show that it is relatively inelastic (Hughes, Knittel, and Sperling 2007, Small and

Van Dender 2007, Gillingham 2010, Bento et al. 2009, Kilian and Murphy 2011, Davis and Kilian

2011b). Second, the Envelope Theorem can be used to show that since indirect utility uijat is a

function of an optimized value of VMT, changes in VMT caused by marginal changes in gasoline

prices have only second-order e¤ects on uijat and vehicle prices. In Appendix C, however, we derive

an alternative approach that makes mjay a function of gy and allows for non-marginal changes.

The results are very similar to the base speci…cation.

   We use an analogous approach to …t vehicle survival probabilities based on the NVPP registered

quantity data. We use a grouped data probit model, where the outcome variable is the number of

vehicles of a model and model year registered next year divided by the number of vehicles registered

today. We estimate coe¢ cients on vehicle age dummies, model year, and fuel economy, with robust

standard errors clustered by vehicle, and then predict survival probabilities   jay   for all vehicles in

our sample.



3.1.2      Discount Rate

                           1
The discount rate r =          1 is the intertemporal opportunity cost of money: the rate at which

a vehicle’s purchase price is amortized over future years or future gasoline costs are discounted to

the present. To implement this empirically, we calculate the weighted average     across used vehicle

buyers. For vehicle buyers whose marginal dollar comes from a loan or lease, the opportunity cost

of paying more to purchase a vehicle is the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). For consumers whose

marginal dollar comes from savings, the opportunity cost is the return that could be realized on

savings.

   Table 2 details the calculation. Using data from the 2001, 2004, and 2007 Surveys of Consumer

Finances (SCF), we estimate that 37 percent of used vehicles are …nanced, while 63 percent are paid

for in cash. We transform interest rates reported in the SCF from nominal to real by de‡ating by

in‡ation expectations implied by Treasury In‡ation-Protected Securities. In the SCF, the average

real interest rate for used vehicle loans is 6.9 percent. For vehicles purchased with cash, we assume

                                                 13
that the opportunity cost of funds is equity market returns, and the average real return on the S&P

500 between 1945 and 2008 (inclusive) was 5.8 percent. As shown in Table 2, averaging these two

discount rates weighted by their share of transactions gives a 6.2 percent discount rate, which we

round to six percent for our base speci…cation.

      While we think that this is the most reasonable and straightforward approach, it surely is

debatable. For example, the real average used vehicle loan APR reported by dealerships through

the JD Power Information Network is 8.9 percent, two percentage points higher than the average

value reported in the SCF. On the other hand, including years before 1945 or after 2008 would give

lower stock market returns. Furthermore, if we modeled consumers with declining marginal utility

of consumption, they would want to risk-adjust returns for covariance with the market. Because

annual changes in gasoline prices have very low correlation with market returns, risk adjustment

using the Capital Asset Pricing Model would give an interest rate close to the real risk-free rate:

about 1.6 percent. In the results section, we show the sensitivity of b to alternative discount rates.



3.1.3      Gasoline Price Forecast

We use three measures of vehicle consumers’ gasoline price forecasts: seasonally-adjusted retail

prices, oil futures prices, and beliefs elicited via surveys. The seasonally-adjusted retail price

measure is equivalent to assuming that consumers forecast that gasoline prices are a martingale

with seasonal trends. To construct this measure, we take the U.S. City Average Motor Gasoline

Retail Prices for all types of gasoline from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (2011)

Monthly Energy Review and convert to real July 2005 dollars.11 We then eliminate seasonal trends

by regressing the level of monthly gasoline prices on eleven month dummies, subtracting the …tted

values, and re-adjusting so that the mean monthly gasoline price is unchanged.

      Our second measure assumes that oil futures markets re‡ect vehicle consumers’gasoline price

forecasts. To construct this measure, we use Light Sweet Crude Oil spot prices from the U.S.

Energy Information Administration’s (2011) Monthly Energy Review and futures prices from the

New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). The oil futures

prices are transformed into current dollars using in‡ation expectations implied by Treasury In‡ation
 11
      Edelstein and Kilian (2009) and Kilian (2010) also use data on the real price of gasoline.


                                                           14
Protected Securities, then de‡ated into real July 2005 dollars, then transformed to dollars per gallon

of gasoline using the average historical relationship between oil and gasoline prices.12 Appendix

Table A1 reports annual average retail gas prices and futures-based gas price forecasts. In every

year of our sample, there are futures trades for settlement dates up to 6-7 years in the future, and

in later years, trades are observed for dates as far as 10 years out.13

       Our third measure is derived from the Michigan Survey of Consumers (MSC), which elicits

beliefs about future gasoline prices, in‡ation, and other economic variables from a nationally rep-

resentative sample. Respondents are asked whether they think the price of gasoline will go up, go

down, or stay the same during the next …ve years. Those who think it will change are asked how

much the price will increase or decrease. Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee (2011) analyze these data,

and interested readers should refer to their paper for more details. For our analysis, the authors

provided us with the mean real gasoline price forecast across all respondents for each month be-

tween 1999 and March 2008. Each respondent’s forecast is de‡ated to current dollars as of the date

of the survey using his or her own in‡ation expectation.

       Figure 1 plots seasonally-adjusted retail gasoline prices along with the gasoline prices implied

by oil futures at three di¤erent horizons. The …gure illustrates that futures prices di¤er from

retail prices in two important ways. First, the futures market does not believe that gasoline prices

are a martingale. Especially when spot prices spiked in mid-2008, the futures market expected

prices to eventually decrease at least slightly. As a result, G averages seven percent larger under

the martingale forecast than the futures forecast. This suggests that the b estimated under the

martingale forecast will be smaller than the b with the futures-based forecast. Second, while the

two series follow the same trends, retail prices are substantially more volatile from month to month.

This is not a spurious result of adjusting for seasonality: retail prices are also more volatile when we

do not condition on month-of-year e¤ects. As we shall see, this will cause b to di¤er substantially
  12
      Speci…cally, this average historical relationship is predicted with a simple linear regression of levels of the Motor
Gasoline Retail Prices on the levels of Light Sweet Crude Oil prices. The reason we transform oil futures prices into
gasoline prices instead of directly using gasoline futures is that gasoline futures are typically not traded for time
horizons longer than three years, while oil futures are traded, albeit with limited liquidity, at time horizons of up to
ten years.
   13
      To model expectations for periods beyond the last settlement date observed at each time t, our base speci…cation
uses a simple model of mean-reverting expectations, where deviations from a $1.50/gallon mean decay exponentially
using a mean reversion parameter calibrated using all futures data since 1991. The equation …ts the data very well:
it explains 85% of the variation in the observed futures prices over our 1999-2008 study period.

between the two forecasts when using a monthly di¤erence estimator.

   It is important to acknowledge several limitations of oil futures price data in light of recent work

in this area. First, Kilian (2010) has shown that in the short run, there can be important deviations

between crude oil and gasoline prices. Over our sample period, monthly oil spot prices predict 94

percent of the variance in monthly gasoline prices, not 100 percent. However, what matters for our

analysis is the expected future relationship between oil and gasoline: oil futures could be a good

measure of long-run gasoline price forecasts even if the short-run relationship does not have an R2

of one. Second, Alquist and Kilian (2010), Alquist, Kilian, and Vigfusson (2011), and Baumeister

and Kilian (2012) have shown that oil futures prices are typically not as good as current oil prices

at predicting actual future oil prices at both short-term horizons of 12 months and longer-term

horizons of up to seven years. This suggests that factors other than oil price expectations can a¤ect

futures markets, which would introduce noise in our estimates. Third, oil futures are only traded

with high liquidity for settlement dates less than two to three years in the future. While this is a

concern, it is not clear if this would bias the estimates in any particular direction.



3.2   Vehicle Price Trends

Three related facts about vehicle prices have important implications for our empirical strategy.

First, as Figure 2 illustrates, low-MPG vehicles are more expensive than high-MPG vehicles. The

…gure shows the results of a regression of Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price on a set of MPG

indicator variables, for all models of model years 1984 through 2008 in the Ward’s Automotive

Yearbook data. Between 15 and 30 MPG, which includes nearly all of our dataset, MSRPs decline

from $30,000 to $11,000. This …gure corroborates concerns about the traditional cross-sectional

approaches to estimating      : low-MPG and high-MPG vehicles are systematically di¤erent, and

some of these di¤erences may be unobservable. The …gure also means that we must control for

factors such as depreciation that di¤erentially a¤ect vehicles with higher price levels and might be

correlated with gas prices.

   Second, Figure 3 shows that vehicle prices have systematic seasonal patterns, and they tend to

decrease within each year. Because this systematic depreciation is approximately a percentage of

price and lower-MPG vehicles have higher prices, these patterns a¤ect the price levels of low-MPG

                                                  16
vehicles more than high-MPG vehicles. Since gas price forecasts rise on average during the study

period, failing to account for within-year trends that a¤ect low- vs. high-MPG vehicles di¤erently

could cause us to falsely attribute seasonality to adjustments caused by gas price forecasts.

    Third, there are other underlying shifts in seasonally-adjusted average prices that could a¤ect

low-MPG vs. high-MPG vehicles di¤erently. If correlated with changes in gasoline prices, such

shifts could bias our estimator. The double blue line on Figure 3 shows that after demeaning prices

within vehicles and removing seasonal trends using month dummies, prices declined somewhat from

1999-2003. The decline from 1999-2002 appears to be driven by a decrease in the absolute price

level for low-MPG vehicles. This may have been precipitated by an increase in the number of new

low-MPG vehicles sold during the mid- and late- 1990s, which appears to have caused their prices

to drop as they became available for resale as used vehicles. Manheim’s analysts attribute the

nadir in 2003 to the 2001 economic slowdown, during which both low- and high-MPG vehicles were

o¤ered at attractive lease terms and an unusually large share were leased instead of sold. When

this larger volume of vehicles came o¤ of lease two years later, this depressed resale prices. We

therefore document whether the estimates are sensitive to excluding the period before 2004.

    Demeaned and seasonally-detrended prices remained relatively steady from 2004-2007 before

dropping sharply as the 2008 recession took hold. It is possible that this recession di¤erentially

a¤ected low- vs. high-MPG vehicles, for example by di¤erentially a¤ecting people of di¤erent

income levels, who tend to buy di¤erent types of vehicles. We therefore eliminate from our base

speci…cation all data beginning with April 2008, when the recession began to a¤ect vehicle market

prices. Similarly, we would certainly not want to include data from 2009, when the Cash for Clunkers

program signi…cantly changed used vehicle markets, di¤erentially a¤ecting prices of low-MPG vs.

high-MPG vehicles.




4     Estimation

4.1   Empirical Strategy

We use vehicle …xed e¤ects and look within the same vehicle over time as gasoline price forecasts

change. The bene…t of a panel is that the …xed e¤ects soak up unobserved vehicle characteristics

                                                17
that may be correlated with MPG: formally, our estimator is still unbiased even if E[G ] 6= 0.

    We move from Equation (3) to our base speci…cation estimating equation in three steps. First,
                                                                                                  1
we de…ne an econometric error term that contains and the market share term: "                         ln sjat +   jat .

Second, we add time dummies           t,   which absorb the outside option share s0t and any shift in the

overall market price level. Third, we de…ne f 50 as the median of the MPG distribution, and we

include   jat ,   11 indicator variables for month-of-year interacted with 1(fja > f 50 ). As we shall

discuss momentarily, these control for the di¤erential seasonal trends in the prices of low- vs.

high-MPG vehicles. Our base speci…cation is:



                                   pjat =      Gjat +   t   +   jat   +   ja   + "jat                             (5)

    Equation (5) is quite intuitive: it tests whether the relative vehicle prices move one-for-one

with changes in the relative PDV of gasoline costs. If vehicle prices do not respond su¢ ciently to

gasoline costs, we conclude that the market undervalues gasoline costs. If vehicle prices respond

more than predicted to gasoline costs, we conclude that the market overvalues gasoline costs.14

    Figure 4 illustrates our identifying variation by graphing the average G for an example month

within age and fuel economy groups. Younger vehicles and lower-MPG vehicles have higher G.

Equation (5) is identi…ed by interacting this cross-sectional variation by the time-series variation in

gasoline price forecasts illustrated in Figure 1. As gasoline price forecasts ‡uctuate over time, the

bars in Figure 4 extend and contract proportionally. A given change in gas price forecasts has a

larger e¤ect on the level of G for younger and lower-MPG vehicles, and we test for whether relative

prices move correspondingly.

    Equation (5) is a consistent estimator of           if E[G"j( ; ; )] = 0. Because " contains both s

and , this actually contains two di¤erent economically-meaningful identifying assumptions:

    Assumption 1: E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0

    Assumption 2: E [G j( ; ; )] = 0
   14
      Although we derive it di¤erently, this is fundamentally the same estimating equation used by Kahn (1986) and
Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2012). The latter paper uses a slightly di¤erent con…guration of …xed e¤ects and
controls. Sallee, West, and Fan (2009) allow G to vary at the transaction level, instead of at the jat level, based
on the odometer reading of the speci…c auto being transacted. They can then insert jat-level …xed e¤ects. This
allows them to relax our two identifying assumptions and substitute an alternative assumption, which is that the
within-jat relationship between odometer readings and transaction prices is not a¤ected by unobserved factors that
are correlated with gas prices.


                                                        18
   In words, Assumption 1 is that gasoline costs are uncorrelated with market shares, conditional

on time dummies and vehicle …xed e¤ects. For new vehicles, this assumption would not hold:

sales of low-fuel economy vehicles decrease relative to high-fuel economy vehicles when gas prices

increase, as documented by Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2012), Klier and Linn (2010), and

Li, Timmins, and von Haefen (2009). This assumption might also not hold for older used vehicles,

whose scrappage rates respond most to changes in gasoline prices (Li, Timmins, and von Haefen

2009). Therefore, we limit our sample to used vehicles less than or equal to 15 years old. In

Appendix B, we show that weakening this assumption by allowing for endogenous market shares

does not signi…cantly a¤ect the estimates, largely because we have limited our sample to the ages

for which the conditional correlation between gasoline prices and market shares is insigni…cant.

   Assumption 2 states that changes in discounted gasoline costs are not correlated with changes

in preferences and unobserved characteristics that vary over the di¤erent model years within a gen-

eration of a vehicle. In Section 5, we discuss and test several potential violations of this assumption

and document that they do not appear to substantially a¤ect the results.



4.2   Measurement Error and the Grouping Estimator

Jerry Hausman’s (2001) "Iron Law of Econometrics" is that the magnitude of a parameter estimate

is usually smaller in absolute value than expected. This is due to attenuation bias that can occur

even in seemingly high-quality data. In most applications in which the null hypothesis is that a

parameter equals zero, this makes a test more conservative. By contrast, in our test of whether

b = 1, this "Iron Law" would make us more likely to falsely reject, meaning that we could falsely

conclude that consumers undervalue gasoline costs. One potential source of measurement error is

the EPA fuel economy ratings, as discussed by Sallee (2010). As in any other application, the use of

…xed e¤ects exacerbates attenuation bias, as even small amounts of measurement error in G worsen

the signal-to-noise ratio in Gj .

   We address measurement error using the grouping estimator, which is just Wald’s (1940) binary

instrumental variables (IV) estimator generalized to the case with many group indicator variables.

Wald’s (1940) original objective in developing the estimator was to address measurement error,

and Ashenfelter (1984), Angrist (1991), and others have used the grouping estimator for this same

                                                  19
purpose in various applications. In our base speci…cation, we place each jat-level observation into

one of 222 mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups: above- and below-median MPG vehicles for

each of the 111 months in the sample. This grouping retains the fundamental identifying variation,

which comes from how time-series changes in gas price forecasts a¤ect G for high- vs. low-MPG

vehicles. However, identifying     o¤ of group-level aggregates means that we average over any

observation-level measurement error.
                        u = 1(f > f 50 ) 1(t = u) as an indicator variable for whether observation

                                                                                    u variables
jat occurs at time u and has above-median MPG. We denote Zjat as the vector of 100 Zjat

for every month of the sample beginning with January 2000, and we instrument for Gjat with Zjat .

Between instruments Zjat , time controls     t,   and month-by-MPG group controls   jat ,   we have a full

set of indicator variables in the "…rst stage" for each of the 222 groups, and the "second stage"

…tted values of G are essentially group-level averages.

    We also present results for groups at di¤erent levels of aggregation. Aggregating observations

into fewer larger groups allows us to average over measurement error that is more severe or correlated

across observations. However, using fewer groups e¤ectively reduces the amount of identifying

variation, which increases the IV standard errors.

    We need not control for any variables that vary at a more disaggregated level than Zjat . For

example, consider our controls    jat   that soak up di¤erential monthly price trends for above- vs.

below-median MPG vehicles. The highest-MPG quartile also has di¤erent monthly price trends

than the second-highest MPG quartile. However, we do not need to control for this because the

…tted values of G do not vary between these two quartiles, and thus      is not identi…ed o¤ of these

di¤erential price trends. In alternative speci…cations where we de…ne Zjat by more disaggregated

MPG groups, we also control for di¤erential price trends for each separate MPG group.

above-median MPG vehicles over the months of the study period. The dotted blue line is the same

as the solid blue line, except that it uses the martingale forecast instead of the futures forecast. The

double black line is the di¤erence between average pj( ; ), the seasonally detrended and demeaned

transaction price, for above- minus below-median MPG vehicles. If        = 1, the blue and black lines

should move in parallel. From this …gure, it is again clear that relative prices are at least somewhat

responsive to relative gasoline costs. However, vehicle prices do not appear to respond very much

to the high-frequency volatility in retail gasoline prices. To test whether prices are as responsive

as theory predicts under the martingale and futures-based forecasts, we now turn to the formal

estimates.



5.2   Base Speci…cation

For our "base speci…cation," we estimate Equation (5) using the …xed e¤ects (demeaning) estimator

while grouping Zjat at the level of above- and below-median MPG by time, assuming a six percent

discount rate and using data from January 1999 through March 2008. To re‡ect the fact that pjat

is an average across varying numbers of transactions, we weight the jat-level observations by the

number of transactions. We are careful to call this our "base speci…cation," indicating that the

alternative speci…cations modify individual assumptions from this base, but we do not call it our

"preferred speci…cation." This is because di¤erent readers may prefer di¤erent sets of alternative

assumptions.

   Table 3 reports the estimated coe¢ cients on G from Equation (5), which correspond to         b. We

denote the futures-based and martingale gas price forecasts as Gf and Gm , respectively. Columns

1 and 2 show that the estimated b coe¢ cients are 0.76 and 0.55. The smaller b for the martingale

forecast is consistent with our earlier discussion of the fact that the martingale forecast implies

                                                  21
higher levels of G and more monthly volatility compared to the futures forecast.

   Using consumers’gas price forecasts elicited from the Michigan Survey of Consumers, Anderson,

Kellogg, and Sallee (2011) show that the average consumer believes that real gasoline prices in …ve

years will be the same as they are at the time of the survey. This suggests that the martingale-based

b will be very close to the MSC-based estimate. This is indeed the case: using the MSC-based gas

price forecast provided by Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee, b = 0:51 (SE=0.029), not statistically

distinguishable from the martingale-based b.

   One way to test whether it is more realistic to assume the futures-based or martingale gas price

forecast is to test which …ts the data better in a "horse race." Because Gm and Gf are highly

correlated, we do not include both in a regression. Instead, we estimate Equation (5) using Gf

and add [Gm     Gf ] as an additional explanatory variable. Column 3 presents the results of this

regression. Neither the futures nor the martingale assumption appears to fully capture consumers’

forecasts: conditional on Gf , [Gm     Gf ] is still associated with vehicle prices. (Mechanically, this

also means that conditional on Gm , [Gf       Gm ] is still associated with vehicle prices.) Of course,

these results are conditional on the model being correctly speci…ed. Because there appears to be

some evidence for both forecasts under this model, we present both sets of results in most of the

robustness checks that follow.

   One way of putting b in context is to compare the observed vehicle price adjustments to the

amounts predicted by theory. Consider a hypothetical set of used vehicles that have di¤erent fuel

economy ratings but would all be driven 12,000 miles per year over a remaining lifetime of seven

years. The double red line in Figure 7 re‡ects the change in vehicle prices that would be expected

in response to a $1 increase in the gas price forecast, relative to the price of a 25 MPG vehicle. The

blue "Predicted Price Change" line illustrates the change in relative prices predicted by b = 0:76

from the futures-based gas forecast.

   For example, b = 0:76 predicts that the price of a 20 MPG vehicle decreases by $506 relative to

a 25 MPG vehicle. In comparison,       = 1 predicts that the relative price should decrease by $670,

which is $164 more. As another example,       = 1 predicts that the price of a 30 MPG vehicle should

increase by $2230 relative to a 15 MPG vehicle. By contrast, b = 0:76 suggests that the relative

price adjusts by 72 percent of that amount, or $1690. The dollar values of the apparent mispricing


                                                  22
are certainly not trivial.



5.3     Standard Errors

Throughout the paper, we report robust standard errors, clustered at the level of model j by age

a. These standard errors are unbiased in the presence of serial correlation over time in the price of,

for example, a three-year-old Honda Civic DX sedan. Clustering at the level of "nameplate" by age

gives a standard error is 0.054. This standard error is unbiased in the presence of serial correlation

over time in the price of, for example, all three-year-old models of Honda Civic. Clustering at the

level of model j gives a standard error of 0.086. Analogously, this is unbiased in the presence of

serial correlation in the price of all Honda Civic DX sedans of any age.

   In addition, all standard errors can be adjusted to account for the fact that G is a generated

regressor estimated from …rst-step regressions that predict each observation’s vehicle-miles trav-

eled and survival probability. Murphy and Topel (1985) show that the true covariance matrix is

additively separable in the usual covariance matrix and an additional matrix that accounts for the

uncertainty in the …rst-step parameter estimates. We estimate this additional variance by boot-

strapping draws from the estimated distribution of …rst-step parameters and estimating b for each

draw. Using the base speci…cation with Gf as an example, the clustered, robust IV standard error

is 0.046. The standard deviation of the bootstrapped set of b estimates is 0.023. Adding together

these two variances and taking the square root gives an adjusted standard error of 0.052.



5.4     Alternative Speci…cations

5.4.1    Level of Grouping

Correcting for measurement error appears to be extremely important. Rows 1 through 3 of Table

4 present estimates of       using increasingly disaggregated grouping estimators, while Row 4 is the

ungrouped OLS estimator. As we disaggregate, the estimated values of           drop toward the OLS

estimate. This suggests that measurement error signi…cantly biases the OLS estimates, and even

some of the disaggregated grouping estimators. This pattern can arise either if the variance of the

measurement error is large or if it is correlated across observations.

                                                   23
5.4.2   Alternative Time Periods

As discussed earlier, vehicle markets changed over the study period. How sensitive is b to the

choice of time periods? Rows 11 and 12 in Table 4 repeat the base speci…cation for 2004 through

March 2008 and for 1999 through the end of 2008, respectively. In both cases, b is closer to one

than the 1999-March 2008 base speci…cation, although both are still statistically less than one for

both Gf and Gm . In row 11, the fact that excluding the early period does not signi…cantly change

the result mitigates our earlier concern that market-level trends during 1999-2003 could bias the

estimator. In row 12, including the gas price spike of 2008 increases b more under Gf than under

Gm . This is consistent with the fact that futures markets did not expect the high spot prices in

2008 to be sustained, which mechanically decreases G and thus increases b.

   There are two explanations for the fact that including the latter part of 2008 moves b statistically

closer to one under the futures-based gas price forecast. First, changes in vehicle markets unrelated

to changes in gasoline price forecasts could bias the estimated . Second, the true          may have

increased over this period as gas prices ‡uctuated substantially. This would be consistent with

models of endogenous or "rational" inattention in which consumers pay more attention to more

important attributes (Gabaix 2012, Sallee 2011). It would also be consistent with models in which

large changes cause consumers to update beliefs between coarse categories, for example from gas

costs being "inconsequential" to gas costs being "high" (Mullainathan 2002).



5.4.3   Alternative Discount Rates

Rows 21-25 of Table 4 show the sensitivity of b to the assumed discount rate. At a discount rate

just higher than 11 percent, we fail to reject   = 1 with 90 percent con…dence using the Murphy-

Topel standard errors and the futures forecast. The "implied discount rate," the discount rate that

rationalizes the data by giving   = 1, is just under 15 percent for the futures forecast and just over

24 percent for the martingale.




                                                 24
5.4.4   Changes in Characteristics

The identifying assumption that E[G j( ; ; )] = 0 would be violated if a model’s characteristics

change in ways that are correlated with G. For example, since gasoline price forecasts rise on

average during the study period, if characteristics improve more over model years for high-MPG

models, we would misattribute these vehicles’ increased desirability to changes in gasoline price

forecasts. Our policy of rede…ning a new generation of a model as a di¤erent j addresses the bulk

of these concerns. Even within a generation, however, there can be some variation in observable

characteristics (Knittel 2011, …gure 1).

   An additional suggestive test is to add controls for observable characteristics to the estima-

tion. Rows 31-35 re-estimate the base speci…cation with progressively more controls for observable

characteristics: horsepower, curb weight, wheelbase, anti-lock brakes, stability control, and trac-

tion control. The estimated b remains very similar. Although whether controlling for observables

a¤ects a parameter estimate does not directly tell us whether controlling for unobservables would

a¤ect the estimate, it is plausible that changes in observable and unobservable characteristics are

correlated, by logic similar to that of Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2005). Therefore, this suggests

that changes in unobservable characteristics might not bias our estimates.



5.4.5   Changes in Preferences

Aside from representing changes in vehicle characteristics, changes in   jat   can also represent changes

in preferences for a vehicle with the same characteristics. Since gasoline price forecasts rise on

average during the study period, di¤erential trends in preferences for low- vs. high-MPG vehicles

would violate the assumption that E[G j( ; ; )] = 0, which would bias b.

   One potential concern is that consumers became increasingly "green," or environmentally-

oriented, over the study period, resulting in increased preference for high fuel economy vehicles

independent of the …nancial savings. This would bias b upward, as it would increase the prices of

high-MPG vehicles over the study period as gasoline price forecasts rose. To test this, we exclude

hybrids and the top 60 most green vehicles ranked by Yahoo (2009). Rows 41 and 42 of Table 4

show that this does not a¤ect the results.


                                                 25
   An opposite concern is that preferences for particular classes of large vehicles, for example

SUVs or pickups, strengthened over the study period. This would bias b downward, as it would

increase the prices of low-MPG vehicles over time, attenuating the decrease in relative prices that

the model would expect as gasoline price forecasts rose. To test this, Rows 43 through 45 exclude

SUVs, minivans, and all cars, respectively, from the estimation. While the point estimates change

somewhat, the di¤erences are not statistically signi…cant, except for when excluding cars and using

the martingale gas price forecast.



5.4.6    Age-by-Time Controls

Rows 51-53 of Table 4 include age-by-time controls to account for potential changes in depreciation

patterns over time. These controls address bias that would occur if depreciation patterns changed

as gas prices rose over the study period and the age composition of above- vs. below-median MPG

groups changed. For example, older vehicles could have become systematically more valuable in

later years, and there could be increasingly more below-median or above-median MPG vehicles

on the road. The table shows that identifying b only o¤ of within-age variation in G does not

signi…cantly change the estimates.



5.5     Observation Weights and Heterogeneity by Vehicle Age

A natural question to ask is whether       might be heterogeneous across consumer groups. For

example, the types of consumers that buy newer or older vehicles might be more or less informed

about or attentive to fuel economy. In fact, there is signi…cant heterogeneity in b by vehicle age.

Column 1 of Table 5 displays estimates of Equation (5) for speci…c vehicle age groups. The b is

0.93 for vehicles aged 1-3, but it drops to 0.26 for vehicles aged 11-15. All estimates in Table 5

use the futures-based gas price forecast, but the martingale forecast similarly shows that b declines

with vehicle age.

   The di¤erences in b depend mechanically on the di¤erences in G. Returning to Figure 4, we

can see how G varies with age. In June 2004, the transaction-weighted average values of G for

above-median and below-median MPG vehicles aged 11-15 were $2620 and $4150, respectively.


                                                 26
These are about 37 percent of the values for vehicles aged 1-5. These …gures depend on underlying

data for survival probabilities and VMT. According to the registration data, the average vehicle

between 11 and 15 years old will survive for 6.1 more years. According to the National Household

Travel Survey odometer readings, the average vehicle between 11 and 20 years old will be driven

8980 miles per year, conditional on survival.

   Several factors could explain the di¤erences across ages. First, we could systematically over-

state G for the nationwide population of older vehicles by overestimating either VMT or survival

probabilities. This appears to be unlikely. Because vehicle registrations must be renewed every

year at some cost, it is unlikely that many vehicles would have their registrations renewed if not in

use. Thus, it seems most accurate to estimate survival probabilities from vehicle registration data,

and it is unlikely that this would overstate survival probabilities. However, we can also estimate

survival probabilities using the cross-sectional age distribution observed in the National Household

Travel Survey. There are fewer older vehicles observed in the NHTS than in the registration data,

suggesting that the NHTS might under-sample households that own the oldest vehicles, even after

weighting for national representativeness on other observables. As a result, using the NHTS to

calculate survival probabilities should make G smaller for new vehicles, thereby increasing . De-

pending on the shape of the survival functions, this could change the estimated      for older vehicles

in either direction. Column 2 of Table 5 presents estimates of      using the NHTS survival proba-

bilities. All of the point estimates increase, but none of them change signi…cantly, and the pattern

of decreasing   with vehicle age is unchanged.

   Second, even if our G is appropriate for the US population of older vehicles, the population of

vehicles going through auctions might have smaller G. This would happen if auctioned vehicles had

lower future VMT or survival probabilities, perhaps because they are low quality or being sold for

scrap. The data also do not support this. The average odometer reads for 11 to 15 year old vehicles

di¤er by only a few percent between Manheim auctioned vehicles and vehicles in the NHTS, so

auctioned vehicles have not been more heavily used. Furthermore, in constructing vehicle prices

pjat , we exclude transactions in which the auctioneers rated the auto as low-quality or scrap quality.

As a robustness check, column 3 presents these same speci…cations using JDPA retail prices, which

are for autos that are in good enough condition for retail sale. The signi…cant decrease in b for


                                                  27
older vehicles remains.

      Third, the identifying assumption that E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0 might be increasingly violated for

older vehicles. As gas prices rise, increased scrappage of older gas guzzlers would raise the prices

of these vehicles both because demand is downward-sloping and because selective scrappage of the

lowest-quality gas guzzlers would raise the average quality of remaining ones. However, while there

is a strong negative correlation between G and market share for vehicles older than 15 years (which

are excluded from our regressions), the correlation between G and s conditional on ( ; ; ) for

11-15 year old vehicles is not statistically signi…cant, and the point estimate is actually positive.

      Fourth, buyers of older vehicles may have higher intertemporal opportunity costs of capital, i.e.

higher discount rates r, compared to buyers of younger vehicles. If this were the case, our use of

the average discount rate still gives an unbiased estimate of the market average . However, it

would cause us to overstate      for younger vehicles and overstate    for older vehicles, and it would

give the pattern of decreasing       with age observed in Table 5. The SCF data do not support

this hypothesis: auto loan interest rates are not statistically signi…cantly di¤erent by vehicle age,

and the standard errors are tight enough to rule out that the average interest rate for 11-15 year

old vehicles is greater than 0.5 percentage points above the average rate for 1-5 year old vehicles.

However, Adams, Einav, and Levin (2009) analyze subprime auto loans with interest rates of 25-30

percent, and consumers buying older vehicles may have very high intertemporal opportunity costs

of capital because they cannot get any loan.

      One implication of the di¤erences in b across ages is that regression weighting matters. In

our base speci…cations, we weight jat-level observations by the number of observed transactions.

Column 5 of Table 5 shows that most vehicles that pass through auctions are less than …ve years

old, meaning that the jat-level observations for newer vehicles have more underlying transactions

and thus are weighted more heavily. The di¤erence in          coe¢ cients across ages means that the

estimated     for all ages should be smaller when weighting observations equally instead of by number

of transactions. The …rst row of column 4 con…rms this, showing that b = 0:62 for equal weights.

Comparing columns 1 and 4 shows that when the regressions are restricted to particular age groups,

the     coe¢ cient does not depend much on how observations are weighted.




                                                   28
6    Sticky Information

Mankiw and Reis (2002), Sims (2003), Woodford (2003), and others propose models of "sticky

information," in which macroeconomic news di¤uses slowly through the population of consumers

and …rms. This causes prices, savings, investment, and other decisions to respond to information

with a delay. Sticky information could explain the visual evidence in Figure 6 that vehicle market

prices do not respond to high-frequency ‡uctuations in retail gasoline prices.

    Interestingly, neither of the two surveys that have elicited consumers’ beliefs about gasoline

prices were structured to provide evidence on sticky information. The Vehicle Ownership and

Alternatives Survey analyzed by Allcott (2011) and Allcott (Forthcoming) asks consumers what

current gasoline prices are in their area, and shows that responses are very close to state-level

averages. However, the survey was carried out in October 2010, at a time when gas prices had not

‡uctuated by more than $0.10 per gallon for eight months. If the survey were repeated at a time

of more volatility, the sticky information model predicts that beliefs would lag current prices.

    The Michigan Survey of Consumers (Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee 2011) is a repeated cross

section that covers multiple periods of gas price volatility. However, it does not ask consumers

their beliefs about current gas prices. Instead, it only asks whether consumers believe that prices

will increase or decrease relative to "current prices." We do not know what consumers believe are

"current prices" in months when retail gasoline prices have changed signi…cantly.

    One prediction of a sticky information model is that      should be attenuated when using the

di¤erence estimator instead of the demeaning estimator. This is because the former is identi…ed

only o¤ of the variation at monthly frequency, while the latter is identi…ed o¤ of demeaned levels

over the entire period that the vehicle is observed. Table 6 tests this by estimating Equation (5)

using the di¤erence estimator instead of the …xed e¤ects (demeaning) estimator. In this table,

unlike Tables 4 and 5, we report the coe¢ cient on the G variable, which is      , instead of   itself.

Columns 1-3 use the futures-based forecast Gf , while columns 4-6 use the martingale forecast Gm .

Columns 1 and 4 show that the contemporaneous di¤erences in G are negatively associated with

contemporaneous di¤erences in vehicle prices, as would be expected. However, the estimates are

signi…cantly attenuated relative to the …xed e¤ects estimates, especially for the martingale forecast.



                                                 29
Column 2, 3, 4, and 6 add lags of the change in G. These results show that changes in vehicle

prices are strongly associated with changes in gasoline prices as far as three to four months in the

past. The association becomes smaller and statistically insigni…cant by the …fth or sixth monthly

lag.

   Table 7 builds on these results by estimating Equation (5) using more aggregated units of

time t instead of monthly time units used in the rest of the paper. For example, the "2-Month

Units" row presents estimates with prices and gasoline costs aggregated to the bimonthly level. The

…xed e¤ects estimates of   in the top panel do not change with this increased aggregation, as the

demeaning estimator identi…es    o¤ of lower-frequency variation. However, the estimates from the

di¤erence estimator move toward the …xed e¤ects estimates as we aggregate over more months. This

provides additional evidence that markets do not immediately adjust to high-frequency gasoline

price variation.

   Klenow and Willis (2007) use the data underlying the Consumer Price Index to document that

US retailers set prices based on information that is up to one year old. Our results complement

theirs by providing additional empirical support for the sticky information model in this particular

market. Table 6 suggests that changes in gasoline price forecasts take four to six months to be

full incorporated into vehicle market prices. This could either be because consumers are not aware

that gasoline prices have changed, or because they somehow do not incorporate this knowledge into

their willingness to pay when shopping for vehicles.

   These results also highlight the distinction between models of rational inattention in macroeco-

nomics and …nance, in which agents do not immediately update beliefs about time-varying decision

variables, and consumer choice models of static inattention, such as Gabaix and Laibson (2006) or

Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009). Energy e¢ ciency policies such as CAFE standards are moti-

vated by the latter form of inattention or some similarly static misoptimization, not by inattention

to high-frequency ‡uctuations in energy prices. While our strategy of exploiting time-series vari-

ation in energy costs allows us to sweep our unobserved product attributes using …xed e¤ects, it

is important to account for the fact that consumers appear to update gasoline price forecasts with

some delay. Using quarterly or higher-frequency variation and a di¤erence estimator could cause

an analyst to misattribute inattention to high-frequency ‡uctuations in gasoline costs to static


                                                30
undervaluation of fuel economy as a product attribute.




7      Conclusion

At least since the energy crises of the 1970s, economists and policymakers have been interested in

how consumers trade o¤ future costs of energy using durable goods with their purchase prices. We

propose a di¤erent and relatively plausible approach to estimating demand for energy e¢ ciency,

which exploits the interaction of time series variation in gasoline price forecasts with cross-sectional

variation in fuel economy ratings of di¤erent vehicles. In our base speci…cation assuming the futures-

based gas price forecast, consumers appear to be indi¤erent between one dollar in discounted future

gas costs and only 76 cents in vehicle purchase price. The parameter estimates are insensitive to

many factors, including the potential endogeneity of market shares and vehicle-miles traveled and

potential changes over time in consumer preferences or vehicle characteristics. However, assuming a

lower discount rate or using the martingale gas price forecast strengthen the qualitative conclusion

that    < 1. On the other hand, other speci…cations move b closer to one, including plausibly

higher discount rates and adding the 2008 recession to the sample. Although b is less than one in

most of our alternative speci…cations, it is not hard to imagine plausible combinations of alternative

assumptions that could generate this result. Importantly, the parameter estimates are very di¤erent

for subsamples of younger vs. older vehicles.

    Given the uncertainty in these estimates, it is worth returning to our calculation from the intro-

duction. Even if   is closer to one than our base speci…cations suggest, misoptimization distorts ve-

hicle markets more than the failure to internalize climate change externalities. Given the amount of

policy attention and academic interest surrounding climate change, this remarkable result suggests

that economists should be devoting signi…cant additional e¤ort to understanding how consumers

value energy costs and understanding the policy consequences of potential undervaluation.

A     Derivation from Dynamic Model

In Section 2, we derive the market share equation from a static discrete choice model. In this

appendix, we show how that static model can in turn be derived from a simple dynamic model.

This is also helpful in clarifying the nature of our econometric assumptions.

    In each period t, each consumer chooses one vehicle from a set of new and used vehicles, including

the vehicle that he or she already owns. Consumers expect to own the vehicle for a holding period

of h years, after which time it will be resold at price pja;t+h . The budget constraint wi should now

be interpreted as the budget constraint over that holding period. Individuals discount utility and
                                                                 1
cash ‡ows in future periods by discount factor             =    1+r .
                                                                                                   h
    The PDV of gas costs, Gjat , can be divided into two parts: Gjat = Gojat +                         Gja;t+h . The
                                                                                                   h
variable Gojat is the PDV of gasoline costs during consumer i’s holding period, and                    Gja;t+h is the
                                                                                                      o
PDV over the remainder of the vehicle’s life after it is resold, discounted to time t. The variable e jat

captures the average utility across consumers from owning and using vehicle ja over the holding

period.

    The indirect utility function in this model is:


                                                                                   o
                        uijat = (wi         pjat      Gojat +     h
                                                                      pja;t+h ) + e jat +   ijat                 (6)

                                                                                    o
    The variable e jat now captures average usage utility over the holding period e jat plus the

present discounted utility value of resale price plus remaining gasoline costs:


                                              o
                                e         = e jat +    h
                                                           (pja;t+h + Gja;t+h )                                  (7)
                                    jat


    In our estimation, we assume that e ja is constant within a vehicle ja over time up to an

idiosyncratic deviation which is uncorrelated with G. Why is this intuitively sensible? Consider the
                                                                         o
two elements of e de…ned by Equation (7). The …rst element, the utility e from using the vehicle

over a given holding period, is assumed constant for a given model of a given age, independent of

the time t when the holding period starts. For example, buying a three-year-old Ford Taurus in

1999 gives the same expected usage utility as buying a three-year-old Ford Taurus in 2000, up to



                                                           47
the idiosyncratic error term.

    The second element of e contains the total user cost for the next owner: the sum of the

vehicle’s resale price and remaining fuel cost, weighted by . In essence, we assume a weak version

of stationarity, a common assumption in dynamic analyses of durable goods markets, such as Rust

(1985) and Stolyarov (2002). Under this assumption, consumers believe that resale prices of the

same good are constant over time, after adjusting for changes in other user costs and allowing for

an idiosyncratic error. Continuing the above example, we assume that consumers believe that if

gasoline prices are constant, the resale price of an eight-year-old Ford Taurus in 2004 is the same

as the resale value of an eight-year-old Ford Taurus in 2005. If gasoline price forecasts change,

the vehicle’s resale price will change by the di¤erence in discounted remaining fuel costs Gja;t+h

multiplied by the valuation weight . This demonstrates why a consumer’s utility from choosing

a particular vehicle depends not just on the gasoline costs that he himself will pay, but on the

entire remaining fuel cost incurred by all future owners: the consumer expects that if gasoline price

forecasts increase, this will a¤ect both his own gasoline expenditures Go and also the resale value.




B     Endogenous Quantities

In deriving our base estimating equation in the body of the paper, we assume that the PDV of

gasoline costs G is uncorrelated with market shares. In this appendix, we relax this assumption.



B.1    Empirical Strategy

Our estimating equation for the endogenous quantity speci…cations simply adds time dummies           t

and model year dummies        at   to Equation (3):


                                               1
                           pjat =       Gjat       ln sjat +   t   +   at   +   ja   +   jat       (8)

    To control for seasonal depreciation patterns that might be correlated with MPG, we de…ne

…xed e¤ects   ja   at the level of model by age (in months), instead of model by age (in years). These

disaggregated controls are necessary instead of MPG group by month-of-year dummies             because


                                                       48
we now identify o¤ of all the variation in MPG. By contrast, the grouping estimator identi…es

using only variation in p and G between the two MPG groups.

   Even conditional on our …xed e¤ects, Equation (8) would su¤er from the usual simultaneity

bias: E[ s] 6= 0. In words, the model year-speci…c unobservable characteristic      jat   could still be

correlated with market shares if, for example, a feature that is speci…c to particular model year

a¤ects both price and market share. To address this, we need an instrument that generates variation

in market shares that is uncorrelated with unobserved quality.

   Our instrument for used vehicle market shares is the predicted lifetime gasoline costs of model

j at the time when it was new, which we denote G0;jat . More precisely, because a given model year

is typically manufactured between September of the year before the model year through August of

the model year, we use the average futures-based gasoline price forecast for those twelve months to

construct G0;jat . This instrument acts conditional on the model year dummy variables      in Equation

(8), meaning that vehicles that have high values of G0;jat relative to other vehicles produced in the

same year are expected to have lower sales.

   The instrument exploits the fact that new vehicle market shares respond to gasoline prices.

In particular, in years when gasoline prices are high, more high fuel economy vehicles are sold.

Appendix Figure A1 illustrates the identifying variation. As gasoline prices rose between 2004 and

2007, sales of vehicles with fuel economy greater than or equal to 20 MPG increased from 6.5 to

7.7 million, while sales of vehicles rated less than 20 MPG dropped from 8.1 to 6.6 million. This

di¤erence in quantities then persists over time. For example, there are more two-year-old high-

MPG vehicles on the road in 2008 than in 2006. This di¤erence in quantities is not due to changes

in quality ; instead, it is due to the di¤erent gasoline price forecasts at the time when the vehicles

were new.

   This allows us to relax Assumption 1 from Section 4: we can now allow the market share of

vehicle ja to be correlated both with gas costs G and unobservable characteristics . In its place,

we substitute the exclusion restriction: E[G0 j( ; ; )] = 0. We also note that for other empirical

studies of used vehicle markets during periods when there is variation in gas price forecasts, our in-

strument could be an appealing alternative to the Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) instruments,

which depend on assumptions about the nature of the supply-side price setting game.


                                                 49
       In theory, it might be possible to estimate Equation (8) using a grouping estimator, while

instrumenting with group dummies (primarily to predict G) and with group-level averages of G0

(primarily to predict ln s). However, the grouping estimator involves a large number of instruments,

of which only G0 has e¤ectively any correlation with ln s. This causes a many instruments problem

in …tting ln s. Thus, in this appendix, we cannot use the grouping estimator, and we therefore must

maintain the assumption that G is measured without error.

       As Appendix Figure A1 suggests, most of the variation in the instrument a¤ects model years

2004 and later. Thus, the IV parameter estimates are "local" to …xed e¤ect groups with at least

some observations of post-2004 model year vehicles. Including additional observations where an

instrument has no variation does not change the Local Average Treatment E¤ect but does reduce

the power of the instrument. To maintain su¢ cient power by the standards of Stock and Yogo

(2005), we therefore restrict our sample to transactions from 2004-March 2008.



B.2       Results

Column 1 of Appendix Table A2 presents estimates of Equation (5) for January 2004-March 2008

under the futures-based gasoline price forecast. Column 2 presents the "reduced form" estimates

of Equation (8), without instrumenting for s. The coe¢ cient on ln s is positive. This is the usual

apparently upward-sloping demand symptomatic of simultaneity bias, driven by the correlation of

equilibrium market share with the unobserved demand shifter . Column 3 instruments for s with

G0 .

       In the …rst stage of the IV estimates, the instrument G0 is negatively correlated with market

share, conditional on the vehicle …xed e¤ects and the model year dummies. The coe¢ cient estimate

implies that a 1000 dollar increase in lifetime gas costs relative to other vehicles of the same model

year reduces a vehicle’s market share by 0.0669 percent. For example, the average gas price forecast

for September 2004 through August 2005, the period when most 2005 model year vehicles were

manufactured, was $2.03 per gallon, while the gasoline price forecast for model year 2006 vehicles

was $2.40. Between those two years, the value of G0 for a Ford F-150 pickup went from $16,057 to

$19,362, while it went from $6865 to $8204 for a Honda Civic sedan. The di¤erence in G0 changed

by $1966 between the two years, and as a result, the Civic market share is predicted to decrease

                                                  50
by 13 percent relative to the F-150. The …rst stage Angrist-Pischke F-statistic is 11.76, meaning

that the estimates for this sample of years do not su¤er from a weak instruments problem (Stock

and Yogo 2005).

   Now consider the estimated IV coe¢ cients on ln s. The ln s coe¢ cient implies that if the

quantity available of a given new or used vehicle increased by ten percent, its equilibrium price

would decrease by $361. Conversely, this also implies that if the price of a given vehicle were

increased by $1000, its market share would decrease by 28 percent. Because we de…ne a vehicle at

a …nely disaggregated submodel level, there are many close substitutes for a given "vehicle," so a

high degree of price sensitivity is expected.

   Because these speci…cations do not use the grouping estimator, the estimated b is attenuated

toward zero due to measurement error. Therefore, the key point of this table is not the absolute

magnitudes of the b coe¢ cients. Instead, it is how the estimated coe¢ cients compare across

columns. Regardless of whether we instrument, using the logit model does not make any di¤erence

compared to the estimates of Equation (5) in column 1. This implies that our base speci…cation

assumption that E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0 does not generate statistically signi…cant bias.

   The basic reason for this is straightforward. Omitted variables bias requires both G and s as

well as p and s to be correlated conditional on the other controls. Appendix Table A2 shows that p

and s are indeed somewhat correlated: demand is downward sloping when we instrument properly.

However, G and s are not highly correlated for our sample of used vehicles between ages 1 and 15,

because once used vehicles have been sold, their stock is …xed until their value drops enough for

some to be scrapped. In fact, when we estimate Equation (5) in our sample but use ln s as the

left-hand-side variable instead of price, we cannot reject that E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0: the t-statistic is

-1.597. This is why we restrict the sample to ages 1-15. If we were to include new vehicles or very

old vehicles in our speci…cations, this assumption would not hold. For example, when we estimate

Equation (5) with ln s as the left-hand-side variable for vehicles aged 15-25 years, we resoundingly

reject that E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0: the t-statistic is -4.584.

   In summary, it would ideally be possible to both allow endogenous market shares and address

measurement error in the same speci…cation, but we cannot do this because the grouping estimator

requires a large number of instruments that only weakly predict ln(s). Appendix Table A2 shows


                                                  51
that endogenizing market shares does not signi…cantly change the estimated          , while we know

from the body of the paper that measurement error causes signi…cant attenuation bias. Therefore,

we focus on the grouping estimator in the body of the paper and can realistically maintain the

assumption that E [Gsj( ; ; )] = 0.




C     Endogenous Vehicle-Miles Traveled

C.1    Model

Our base speci…cation assumes that vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) is independent of gasoline prices.

In reality, demand for VMT is inelastic, but not fully inelastic, and the changes in g over the study

period could be large enough that the Envelope Theorem approximation might not hold. This

section presents an alternative speci…cation that endogenizes VMT.

    As illustrated in Appendix Figure A2, the change in VMT resulting from a change in gasoline

prices a¤ects utility through two channels. First, changes in VMT a¤ect gasoline expenditures

Gjat . The NHTS survey that measures VMT was carried out in 2001; at 2001 gas price g2001 , the

cost to drive vehicle ja one mile is g2001 =fja;2001 , and the consumer chooses VMT mja;2001 (g2001 ).

In future year y with higher gasoline price gy , the consumer reduces VMT to mjay (gy ). The annual

gasoline cost is now the shaded blue rectangle bounded by the gy =fjay and mjay .

    The second e¤ect is that usage utility e jat also decreases when an increase in gas price reduces

VMT. For example, the utility from owning a vehicle and driving it 12,000 miles per year is di¤erent

than the utility of owning a vehicle and driving it 11,500 miles per year. In Appendix Figure A2,

the consumer’s total willingness to pay for vehicle use is the area under the VMT demand curve. As

the gasoline price increases from g2001 to gy and the consumer’s utility-maximizing VMT decreases,

this total willingness to pay decreases by the solid green area.

    Of course, for a marginal change in mjay from mja;2001 , the change in usage utility equals the

change in gasoline expenditures, because consumers’observed choices must be such that marginal

cost of driving equals the marginal willingness to pay. This is the Envelope Theorem logic that we

used in the body of the paper to help justify the assumption that mjat is constant over t.

    To formalize these two e¤ects of a non-marginal change, explicitly denote Gjat (mjat (gt ) ; ) and

                                                 52
e
    jat (mjat (gt ))   as functions of mjat (gt ), where gt and mjat in boldface represent the vectors of

forecasted gas prices and utility-maximizing VMTs in each future period of the vehicle ja’s life

beginning at time t. The utility function in Equation (1) can be written as:



                                                                                           Z    gt   @ e jat (mjat (gt ))
 uijat = (wi           pjat    G(mjat (gt ) ; )) + e jat (mjat (g2001 )) +                                                dgt +   ijat   (9)
                                                                                             g2001            @gt

         The per-period dollar value of this new term with the integral is the solid green area in Appendix

Figure A2. It can be calculated under an assumed functional form of VMT demand. Here, we derive

this under the assumption of constant elasticity, denoted . The demand function intercept                                            ja    is

pinned down by the vehicle’s …tted VMT from the 2001 NHTS data and the gas prices from that

year.15 The dollar value of the usage utility changes over the vehicle lifetime is denoted Ijat (gt ):

C.2         Empirical Strategy

Using the same steps as in the derivation of the base speci…cation, we carry the Ijat (gt ) term

through from the utility function to an alternative estimating equation. Because Ijat and Gjat are
    15
    This can also be stated mathematically. Under constant elasticity of demand , we have VMT at any gasoline
price:


                                                       ln(mjas ) =       ln(gs ) +   ja                                                  (10)


  The constant ja is pinned down by mja;2001 , the …tted VMT from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey
data, and the gas prices at that time:


                                                      ja   = ln(mja;2001 )      ln(g2001 )                                               (11)




                                                                      53
highly correlated, we move Ijat to the left hand side. The estimating equation is:



                 pjat   Ijat (gt ) =   Gjat (mjat (gt )) +   t   +   ja (mja (g2001 ))   +   jat        (13)

   In this equation, Gjat (mjat (gt )) is calculated as before in Equation (4), except with VMT as

a constant elasticity function of gas price. The term        ja (mja (g2001 ))   is constant, and it thus can

represent a vehicle …xed e¤ect, as in the base speci…cation.



C.3    Results

Appendix Table A3 presents the results of the endogenous quantity speci…cations under the futures-

based gasoline price forecast. Row 0 of Appendix Table A3 repeats column 1 from Table 3, our

base speci…cation estimates of Equation (5) using Gf , for 1999-March 2008. Rows 1-4 estimate

Equation (13) for that same time period. We use both the linear and constant elasticity functional

forms. The point estimate of      hardly changes from the base speci…cation with an elasticity of 0.2,

which is larger than or equal to recent empirical estimates by Hughes, Knittel, and Sperling (2007),

Small and Van Dender (2007), and Gillingham (2010). Even with an elasticity of 0.5, which is even

larger than the empirical estimates of Bento et al. (2009), Kilian and Murphy (2011), and Davis

and Kilian (2011b), b is still very close to the base estimates.

   Row 10-14 and 20-24 present the same set of estimates for the late period (2004-March 2008)

and for the entire sample (1999-End 2008). As discussed in the body of the paper, the estimated

  from Equation (5) is sensitive to the time period. However, endogenizing vehicle-miles traveled

does not change the estimates in any time period. For this reason, the body of the paper focuses

on the simpler speci…cation that assumes that VMT is exogenous.
