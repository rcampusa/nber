Volatility and Informativeness

JEL No. D82,D83,G14

                                         ABSTRACT

We explore the equilibrium relation between price volatility and price informativeness in
financial markets, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the type of inferences that can be
drawn about price informativeness by observing price volatility. We identify two different
channels (noise reduction and equilibrium learning) through which changes in price
informativeness are associated with changes in price volatility. We show that when
informativeness is sufficiently high (low) volatility and informativeness positively (negatively)
comove in equilibrium for any change in primitives. In the context of our leading application, we
provide conditions on primitives that guarantee that volatility and informativeness always
comove positively or negatively. We use data on U.S. stocks between 1963 and 2017 to recover
stock-specific primitives and find that most stocks lie in the region of the parameter space in
which informativeness and volatility comove negatively.

1         Introduction
There is a long tradition in economics, commonly traced back to Hayek (1945), which emphasizes
the role of financial markets aggregating dispersed information. Under this view, prices not only
convey scarcity but they also reveal the dispersed information held by investors about the underlying
fundamentals of the economy.                   Within this paradigm, a key object of interest is the level of
price informativeness. Price informativeness, formally defined as the precision of the signal about
fundamentals revealed by asset prices, is a natural measure of the ability of financial markets to
aggregate information. Unfortunately, price informativeness is a complex equilibrium object that is
hard to measure directly, in particular at high frequencies. An alternative equilibrium object that
is easily computable and that is the subject of continuous scrutiny is price volatility. In this paper,
we explore the relation between both variables, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the type of
inferences that can be drawn about price informativeness by observing price volatility.1
        By relating both variables, our results allow us to determine the conditions under which observed
fluctuations on asset prices can be interpreted as a reflection of informative asset markets or vice
versa. Because price volatility and price informativeness are jointly determined in equilibrium, this
paper adopts a somewhat unconventional methodological approach. It initially explores the equilibrium
relation between both endogenous variables as the first step to subsequently shed light on conventional
comparative static exercises conducted within fully specified models.
        Our first main result shows that the equilibrium relation between price informativeness and price
volatility in financial markets for the class of models with linear asset demands and additive noise –
which we refer to as the fundamental relation – is uniquely characterized by i) the variance of the
innovation to the fundamental and ii) the signal-to-price demand sensitivity, which corresponds to
the ratio of investors’ demand sensitivities to private information and to asset prices. Exploiting this
relation, we identify two different channels through which changes in price informativeness that leave
the fundamental relation otherwise unchanged are associated with changes in price volatility.2 We
refer to the first channel as the noise reduction channel. Through this channel, an increase in price
informativeness is directly associated with a reduction in price volatility, since less noise is incorporated
into the price. We refer to the second channel as the equilibrium learning channel. Through this channel,
which is inactive when investors do not learn from asset prices, an increase in price informativeness
changes investors’ behavior by varying their equilibrium signal-to-price (demand) sensitivities. In
principle, the sign of the equilibrium learning channel can be positive or negative.
        To further characterize the behavior of signal-to-price sensitivities, we specialize our analysis to
a general CARA-Gaussian environment. The additional structure allows us to show that the signal-
    1
        The relevant definition of price volatility for our analysis corresponds to the conditional idiosyncratic volatility of asset
prices given past public information, as it will become clear in Section 2.
   2
     Since price informativeness is an endogenous object, considering changes in price informativeness that do not otherwise
affect the fundamental relation is only possible for a subset of all the model parameters. This type of changes is nonetheless
useful for definitional purposes. We eventually consider changes in parameters that at the same time change price
informativeness and shift the fundamental relation.


                                                                   2
to-price sensitivity is strictly increasing in the level of price informativeness, implying that the noise
reduction channel and the equilibrium learning channel operate in opposite directions. Intuitively, an
increase in price informativeness tilts investors’ demands toward putting more weight on the price as a
signal about the fundamental, increasing the sensitivity of prices to aggregate shocks and, consequently,
price volatility. The additional structure also allows us to express the fundamental relation between
price informativeness and price volatility exclusively as a function of a subset of primitives. The
only primitives that explicitly enter into the fundamental relation are i) the prior volatility of the
fundamental, ii) the precision of investors’ private signals about the fundamental, and iii) the ratio of
precisions of the signal contained in the price for an investor relative to an external observer.
   Our second main result shows that, under a simple and plausible parameter restriction that limits the
precision of the signal conveyed by the equilibrium price to be less than two times more informative for
an investor relative to an external observer, the fundamental relation between price informativeness and
price volatility has a positive (negative) slope whenever price informativeness is sufficiently high (low).
This result implies that any change in the subset of parameters that do not enter the fundamental
relation directly must induce a positive comovement between price informativeness and volatility
when prices are sufficiently informative and a negative comovement when price informativeness is
sufficiently low. This result also implies that any change in the subset of parameters that at the
same time shifts the fundamental relation upwards and increases price informativeness must also
induce a positive comovement between equilibrium price informativeness and volatility when prices are
sufficiently informative. Alternatively, we show that a change in the subset of parameters that shifts
the fundamental relation upwards and increases price informativeness induces a negative comovement
between informativeness volatility when prices are barely informative. When interpreted through the
lens of our two-channel decomposition, when prices are sufficiently informative, the equilibrium learning
channel becomes overwhelmingly important and dominates the noise reduction channel. Alternatively,
when prices are sufficiently uninformative, the noise reduction channel dominates.
   While the results derived in the general case provide interesting insights into the nature of the
relation between price volatility and informativeness, understanding the exact comovement between
both variables for any set of parameters and their independent behavior requires the study of fully
specified models. Therefore, we specialize our results to three applications that allow us to interpret
conventional comparative statics through the lens of the fundamental relation. First, we study a model
in which heterogeneity in investors’ priors provides the source of aggregate noise in the economy. Second,
we study a model in which the breakdown of the Law of Large Numbers caused by the interaction of
a finite number of strategic investors is the source of aggregate noise. Finally, we study a model in
which uncertainty about the aggregate level of hedging needs is the source of aggregate noise. These
applications illustrate the different values that the ratio of precisions of the signal contained in the price
for an investor relative to an external observer can take. For instance, in the first application, investors’
private trading motives are not useful to forecast the level of aggregate noise, which implies that price
informativeness is identical for investors in the model relative to an external observer. In the case of
strategic traders, price informativeness is higher for an external observer relative to investors in the

                                                      3
model, while in the model with stochastic hedging needs, price informativeness is higher for investors
in the model relative to an external observer.
       Our third main result shows that whenever prices are sufficiently informative (uninformative), it
is indeed the case that changes in any underlying parameter induce a positive (negative) comovement
between price informativeness and volatility across all applications considered. For instance, an increase
in the precision of investors’ private signals about the fundamental increases price informativeness and,
at the same time, shifts the fundamental relation upwards, since investors are more responsive to
their private signals for any level of informativeness. Alternatively, an increase in the precision of
investors’ priors about the fundamental decreases price informativeness and, at the same time, shifts
the fundamental relation downwards, since investors are less responsive to their acquired information.
In both cases, whenever the slope of the fundamental relation has a positive slope (informativeness
is high), informativeness and volatility positively comove, whereas if the fundamental relation has
a negative slope (informativeness is low), informativeness and volatility react in different directions.
Our results show that increases in price volatility are associated with increases (decreases) in the
informational content of asset prices when price informativeness is sufficiently high (low). Finding
an unambiguous positive or negative comovement between price volatility and informativeness after
changes in primitives, even for specific regions of the parameter space, may come as a surprise, since
no clear prior exists regarding the sign of the relationship.3
       Propositions 2 and 3 formalize the relation between volatility and informativeness depending on the
value of price informativeness, which, despite being a meaningful variable, is an equilibrium object. The
next natural question to ask is whether the region in which volatility and informativeness positively or
negatively comove can be characterized as a function of primitives. With that goal, we make use of the
results already derived to study comparative statics in all three applications. Several insights emerge
from the study of comparative statistics in each individual application. It is worth highlighting that,
when prices are sufficiently informative, consistent with our results, a reduction in the magnitude of
aggregate noise increases price informativeness and, perhaps surprisingly, price volatility. Intuitively, a
reduction in the amount of trading due to noise or in the variance of aggregate common beliefs or hedging
needs directly increases price informativeness. Therefore, when prices are sufficiently informative, the
equilibrium learning channel dominates the noise reduction channel and the fundamental relation is
upward sloping, guaranteeing that price informativeness and volatility positively comove. An increase
in the number of investors when there is a finite number of them also increases aggregate noise with
similar consequences.
       Subsequently, in Section 5, our final main result explicitly characterizes the positive and negative
comovement regions as a function of primitives. We show that positive and negative comovement
regions can be characterized as a function of ratios of primitives, in particular, ratios of precisions
of private signals, the fundamental, or the source of noise, among other primitives. Finally, in the
context of our leading application with heterogeneous priors, which is the most tightly parameterized,
   3
       We show that a region in which price volatility and informativeness positively comove always exists. However, we
show that the region in which price volatility and informativeness negatively comove may be empty in some applications.

we use data from U.S. stocks between 1963 to 2017 to recover stock-specific parameters that allow us to
determine whether the recovered primitives for a given stock are in the positive comovement region, the
negative comovement region, or in neither. We leverage the identification results developed in Davila
and Parlatore (2018) to provide a structural interpretation to regressions of asset prices on earnings. Our
empirical findings imply that most of the stocks in our final sample (roughly 60%) are in the negative
comovement region. For these stocks, our results imply that observed increases in price volatility
are associated with a decrease in price informativeness. Intuitively, the large amount of idiosyncratic
volatility unrelated to changes in earnings at the stock level suggests that price informativeness is low for
most stocks, which given our theoretical results implies that most stocks feature negative comovement
between price volatility and informativeness. Interestingly, we find that none of the remaining stocks
are in the positive comovement region.

Related Literature This paper is most directly related to the literature that studies the role played
by financial markets in aggregating dispersed information, going back to Hayek (1945), and following
Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Hellwig (1980), and Diamond and Verrecchia (1981), among others.
Biais, Glosten and Spatt (2005), Vives (2008), and Veldkamp (2011) provide recent reviews of this
well-developed body of work. Although price informativeness is a central object of study in many of
these papers, we provide, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of the relation between price
volatility and price informativeness. While the textbook treatment of Vives (2008) separately discusses
the comparative statics of price volatility and informativeness in a competitive model similar to the
one that we consider, it does not explore further the relation between both variables.4
       There exists a vast literature focused on the measurement of asset price volatility, including the
seminal contribution of Engle (1982), which spurred a large amount of work in Financial Econometrics.
Campbell et al. (2001) and Brandt et al. (2009) are well-known references within this vast literature.
While these studies emphasize the implications of price volatility for diversification, as well as its
relation with expected returns, these papers have not related their findings to whether prices are more
or less informative. Our results seek to broaden the impact of these studies, by showing how to draw
inferences for price informativeness from measures of price volatility. By modeling dispersed information
and learning, our results also contrast to the vast literature studying excess volatility and predictability
that follows Shiller (1981), mostly focused on a representative investor.
       A small recent literature seeks to empirically identify the behavior of price informativeness. In
particular, Bai, Philippon and Savov (2016) empirically test for the forecasting ability of financial
markets by running cross-sectional regressions of future earnings on current market prices. Their
measure has increased over the last decades. Farboodi, Matray and Veldkamp (2017) show that this
   4
       Since we consider a CARA-Gaussian setup, our results should be interpreted as a first-order approximation to more
general environments (Ingersoll (1987), Huang and Litzenberger (1988)). There is scope to further understand the relation
between volatility and informativeness in the context of non-linear models, as those studied by Barlevy and Veronesi
(2000), Albagli, Hellwig and Tsyvinski (2014, 2015, 2017), Breon-Drish (2015), Chabakauri, Yuan and Zachariadis (2015),
or Pálvölgyi and Venter (2015). There is scope to use a similar approach to the one developed in this paper to link
outcomes of alternative allocative mechanisms (e.g. auctions) to measures of information aggregation.

increase is due to increases in the forecasting ability of older and larger firms, despite finding decreases
in the forecasting ability of financial markets for younger and smaller firms. Davila and Parlatore (2018)
develop a new methodology to structurally recover stock-specific measures of price informativeness using
time-series regressions.
        Finally, we would like to highlight the high-level relation between our results and the work of
Bergemann, Heumann and Morris (2015). They show in an abstract linear-quadratic environment
that the information structure that yields maximal aggregate volatility is such that agents confound
idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, excessively responding to aggregate shocks. Their goal is to study
how alternative information structures affect the moments (e.g. volatility) of endogenous variables
in the economy. Instead, our goal is to understand the endogenous equilibrium relation between the
signal-to-noise ratio associated with asset prices, which is an unobservable variable that captures the
ability of financial markets to aggregate information, with the volatility of asset prices, which is an
endogenous outcome of financial market trading, with the aim of potentially using this relation to infer
the ability of financial markets to aggregate information.

Outline         Section 2 describes the general setup and presents the fundamental relation between
price informativeness and price volatility. Section 3 specializes our results to the CARA-Gaussian
environment, while Section 4 introduces three canonical applications and provides full comparative
statics on primitives exploiting our main results. Section 5 explicitly characterizes the set of primitives
that guarantee positive and negative comovement and uses stock market data to recover model
parameters and determine in which region different stocks lie and Section 6 concludes. The Appendix
contains derivations, proofs, and additional results.


2        Fundamental Relation: General Environment
In this section, we characterize the equilibrium relation between price informativeness and price
volatility when investors have linear asset demands and face additive noise.


2.1        General environment

Time is discrete, with periods denoted by t = 0, 1, 2, ..., ∞. There are two assets: A riskless asset in
elastic supply with gross return R > 1 and a risky asset in fixed supply Q, which is traded at a price
pt in period t. The risky asset has a random payoff given by

                                                 θt+1 = µθ + ρθt + ηt ,

where µθ is a scalar, |ρ| ≤ 1, and θ0 = 0, and where the innovations to the payoff, ηt , have mean
zero, finite variance, and are independently distributed.5 We often refer to the asset payoff as the
fundamental.
    5
        When ρ = 0, our model effectively becomes static, as in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). When ρ = 1, fundamentals
and prices are non-stationary and follow a random walk.


                                                            6
    A set of investors, indexed by i ∈ I, trade both assets in period t. Before trading in period t,
each investor i observes the already realized value of the fundamental θt and a private signal sit of the
innovation to the fundamental ηt . Moreover, investors have additional motives for trading the risky
asset that are orthogonal to the asset payoff. We denote by nit investor i’s additional trading motive in
period t. These trading motives are private information of each investor.
    We derive our first set of results under two assumptions.                   The first assumption imposes an
additive informational structure, while the second assumption imposes a linear structure for investors’
equilibrium asset demands. In Sections 3 and 4, we provide fully specified sets of primitives that are
consistent with Assumptions 1 and 2.

Assumption 1. (Additive noise) Each period t, every investor i receives an unbiased private signal
sit about the innovation to the payoff, ηt , of the form

                                                  sit = ηt + εist ,                                         (1)

where εist , ∀i ∈ I, ∀t, are random variables with mean zero and finite variances, whose realizations are
independent across investors and over time. Each period t, every investor i has a private trading need
nit , of the form
                                                  nit = nt + εint ,                                         (2)

where nt is a random variable with finite mean, denoted by µn , and finite variance, and where εint , ∀i ∈ I,
∀t, are random variables with mean zero and finite variances, whose realizations are independent across
investors and over time.

    Assumption 1 imposes a noise structure that is additive and independent across investors for the
signals about the innovation to the fundamental ηt as well as for other sources of investors’ private
trading needs nit . This assumption does not restrict the distribution of any random variable beyond
the existence of finite first and second moments. Our second assumption describes the structure of the
investors’ net demands for the risky asset ∆qti .

Assumption 2. (Linear asset demands) Investors’ net asset demands satisfy

                                  ∆qti = αsi sit + αθi θt + αni nit − αpi pt + ψ i ,

where αsi , αθi , αni , αpi , and ψ i are individual demand coefficients, determined in equilibrium.

    Assumption 2 imposes that the net asset demand for the risky asset for a given investor is linear in
his signal about the fundamental and his private trading needs, as well as in the asset price pt and the
realized fundamental θt . It also allows for an individual specific invariant component ψ i . This linear
structure arises endogenously under CARA utility and Gaussian uncertainty, as we show in Section
3. More broadly, linear asset demands can be interpreted as a linear approximation to general asset
demand functions, so the results in Proposition 1 are valid generally up to a first-order approximation.

vanish. Otherwise, these terms operate as additional sources of aggregate noise.
      The equilibrium price pt imperfectly reveals the innovation to the fundamental payoff of the asset
ηt . The sensitivity of the equilibrium price to the realization of the innovation is modulated by the
average weight that investors put on their private signals sit . However, investors’ demands also depend
on their private trading motives nit , which are uncorrelated with the fundamental payoff of the asset.
Since investors do not observe the common component of these additional trading motives, they cannot
distinguish whether a high price is due to a high realization of the innovation to the fundamental ηt or
due to a high aggregate trading need unrelated to the fundamental nt . In this sense, investors’ private
trading motives act as noise, since they prevent their signals about the fundamental from being revealed
by their quantity demanded and, consequently, they prevent the price from being fully revealing. In
our applications, we map the variable nt to random heterogeneous priors and hedging needs, which
become sources of noise in the filtering problem solved by investors.
      Finally, we denote the unbiased signal about the fundamental innovation ηt contained in the price
by p̂t . We make use of the unbiased signal pˆt in our definition of price informativeness. Formally, we

which guarantees that E [p̂t |ηt ] = ηt . The last three terms in Eq. (3) represent the noise contained in the
price. The first of these three terms is the realization of the common component of the investors’ private

(3) capture the sources of aggregate noise that arise from the imperfect aggregation of idiosyncratic
shocks when there is a finite number of investors. Note that our definition of p̂t allows us to write
        αs           αθ           αn               ψ                                         αs        ∂p
pt =    αp p̂t   +   αp θ t   +   αp E [nt ]   +   αp ,   which allows us to interpret       αp   as   ∂ p̂ .


2.3      Relating price informativeness and price volatility

Using the equilibrium price pt and the unbiased signal about the fundamental contained in the price
p̂t , we can formally define our two objects of interest as follows.
  6
      To accommodate a continuum or a finite number of agents, all integrals in the paper represent Lebesgue integrals.

                                                                              8
Definition 1. (Price informativeness) We define price informativeness as the precision of the
unbiased signal of the innovation to the fundamental payoff ηt contained in the asset price, pˆt , defined
in Eq. (3), from the perspective of an external observer. We denote price informativeness by

                                                      τp̂e = (Var [p̂t |ηt , θt ])−1 .                                               (4)

    Price informativeness is a variable that summarizes the ability of financial markets to disseminate
information through prices. It is the relevant variable that captures how precise the price is as a signal
of ηt from the perspective of an external observer who observes the realization of the fundamental
θt . When price informativeness is high, an external observer receives a very precise signal about the
fundamental by observing the asset price pt . On the contrary, when price informativeness is low, an
external observer learns little about the fundamental by observing the asset price pt .

Definition 2. (Price volatility) We define price volatility as the conditional variance of the asset
price, given the past realizations of the fundamental. We denote price volatility by

                                                               V ≡ Var [ pt | θt ] .

    For our purposes, price volatility is simply the idiosyncratic variance of asset prices conditional on
the current publicly observed realization of the fundamental. Our goal in this paper is to understand how
price volatility and price informativeness are related in equilibrium to be able to make inferences about
price informativeness, which is not directly observable and is hard to compute at high frequencies, from
idiosyncratic conditional price volatility, which is easily computable. Characterizing the equilibrium
relation between these two endogenous variables is the first step to understand how price informativeness
and price volatility react to changes in primitives.
    Our first set of results builds on the the Law of Total Variance, which is an elementary identity that
states that conditional price volatility can be decomposed into two components:

                               Var [ pt | θt ] = E [Var [ pt | ηt , θt ]] + Var [E [ pt | ηt , θt ]] .

The Law of Total Variance asserts that the total variation in the equilibrium price pt can be decomposed
into two components, after conditioning on the fundamental innovation ηt .                                           The first component
corresponds to the expectation over the different realizations of the fundamental innovation ηt of the
conditional variance of the equilibrium price pt , given ηt . The second component corresponds to the
variance of the conditional expectation of pt , after learning ηt . Intuitively, the first component captures
learnable uncertainty, captured by the best estimate of the residual error in pt after learning ηt , while
the second term captures residual uncertainty, which corresponds to the error from the best guess of pt
after learning ηt .
    Under Assumptions 1 and 2, we can express both components as follows
                                            A        B2                                                     A        B2
                                                αs        1          2−1                                        αs
               E [Var [ pt | ηt , θt ]] =                     τp̂e         and Var [E [ pt | ηt , θt ]] =                 τη−1 ,
                                                αp                                                              αp


                                                                           9
which allows us to establish the most general characterization of the relation between price
informativeness and volatility in Proposition 1. Intuitively, the variation in E [ pt | ηt , θt ] is driven by
the variance of the fundamental innovation τη−1 , while the average residual variance is modulated by
changes in price informativeness τp̂e .

         a) Given Assumptions 1 and 2, price volatility V and price informativeness τp̂e satisfy the following

         We refer to Eq. (5) as the fundamental relation between price informativeness and price volatility.
Part a) of Proposition 1 shows that this equilibrium relation features the exogenous primitive τη−1 ,
                                                                                                                                                   αs
which corresponds to the variance of the innovation to the fundamental, and the equilibrium object                                                 αp ,
which we refer to as the signal-to-price sensitivity and that in general depends on τp̂e . By                                            expressing ααps
as a function of τp̂e and potentially other primitives, we identify two distinct channels that determine the
relation between price informativeness and volatility at this level of generality in Part b) of Proposition
1.
         We refer to the first channel as the equilibrium learning channel.                                                   If a high level of price
                                                                                                                                      αs
informativeness is associated with a high (low) level of the signal-to-price sensitivity                                              αp ,   this induces
a positive (negative) relation between price informativeness and volatility. A high value of the signal-
                             αs
to-price sensitivity         αp   amplifies the sensitivity of asset prices to aggregate shocks.7 Intuitively, a high
αs
αp       implies that, on average, either investors react significantly to their private signals (high αs ), or
that they have very steep – under the traditional economics convention that uses quantities in the
horizontal axis – asset demand curves (low αp ), so investors barely adjust the quantity demanded even
for large price changes, implying that equilibrium prices substantially react to changes in the realization
                                                                                          αs
of aggregate fundamental shocks. Alternatively, a low                                     αp   implies that, on average, investors barely react
to their private signals (low αs ), or that they have very flat – under the traditional economics convention
– asset demand curves (high αp ), so investors significantly adjust the quantity demanded even for small
price changes, implying that equilibrium prices are barely responsive to the realization of aggregate
fundamental shocks.
         We refer to the second channel as the noise reduction channel. It is evident from Proposition 1
                      αs
that, holding         αp   constant, a high level of τp̂e is mechanically associated with a low level of V. In fact,
                                     1        22
     7
         Note that Var [ p| θt ] =       αs
                                         αp
                                                   Var [ p̂| θt ], since the variance of the unbiased signal about the fundamental can be
                                          ! e "−1
expressed as Var [ p̂| θt ] = τη−1 + τp̂              . We can thus interpret asset price volatility as the volatility of the unbiased signal
about the fundamental, corrected by investors’ endogenous responses through the signal-to-price sensitivity.

                                                                                 10
Eq. (5) implies that there exists an inverse relation between both variables. Intuitively, when prices
are very informative, the noise in the price is low and the conditional variance of the price for a given
realization of the fundamental is necessarily low.
    It is worth highlighting that part b) of Proposition 1 is not a comparative statics exercise, but
a characterization of a relation between two endogenous variables that must be satisfied in any
equilibrium, given the economy’s parameters. There are scenarios in which changes in some primitives
do not shift the locus defined in Eq. (5). In those cases, Eq. (5) can be interpreted as the possible
combinations of V and τp̂e that can arise in equilibrium for different values of those primitives. In those
scenarios, Proposition 1 implies that equilibria with high volatility are also equilibria with high (low)
                                        dlogV
price informativeness whenever         d log τp̂e   > 0 (< 0). However, changes in parameters that shift the locus
defined in Eq. (5) entail a shift of the fundamental relation and, in general, a movement along the
                                                                   αs
curve. Therefore, it is necessary to determine how                 αp   and τp̂e are related in equilibrium as a function
of the model’s parameters to further understand the relation between price informativeness and price
volatility.
                                                      αs
    Before we study the link between                  αp   and the model’s primitives in more detail, it is worth
emphasizing that the fundamental relation can only have a positive slope when investors learn from
asset prices. When investors do not learn
                                        1 2
                                             from prices, changes in the level of price informativeness do
                                         αs
not affect investors’ behavior, so d log αp /d log(τp̂e ) = 0. In this case, only the noise reduction channel
is active, and the relation between price informativeness and price volatility in Eq. (5) is monotonic
                                                                                           αs
and decreasing. However, as we show next, in the CARA-Gaussian case                        αp   is increasing in τp̂e , so the
equilibrium learning channel and the noise reduction channel operate in opposite directions.


3    Fundamental Relation: CARA-Gaussian Setup
In this section, we specialize our results to a canonical CARA-Gaussian environment, which
endogenously satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. This allows us to further characterize the relation between
                                  αs
the signal-to-price sensitivity   αp    and price informativeness τp̂e . In the next section, we provide several
fully specified models to completely characterize the fundamental relation between price informativeness
and volatility as a function of primitives. We specialize the environment described in Section 2 along
the following dimensions.
    Timing and assets. Time is discrete, with periods denoted by t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞. There are two
assets in the economy: A riskless asset in perfectly elastic supply with gross return R > 1 and a risky
asset in fixed supply Q, which is traded at a price pt in period t.
    Preferences. A new set of investors, indexed by i ∈ I, is born in each period t. Investors born
in period t trade in period t and consume their terminal wealth in period t + 1. Each generation of
investors lives two periods and has constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preferences over their last
period wealth. The expected utility of investor i born in period t is given by
                                                       1      2            i

                                                                       ′′
represents the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, γ ≡ − UU ′ .
       Fundamental process and signals. The payoff of the risky asset each period t is given by

                                                  θt+1 = µθ + ρθt + ηt ,

where µθ is a scalar, |ρ| ≤ 1, and θ0 = 0, and where the innovations to the payoff, ηt , have finite mean,
finite variance, τη−1 , and are independently and normally distributed. Before trading in period t, each
investor i observes the current realized fundamental θt . Each investor i receives a private signal sit
about the innovation to the fundamental ηt , given by
                                                                             1        2
                                       sit = ηt + εist    with εist ∼ N 0, τs−1 .

       Private trading needs. As before, the investors’ privately observed trading motives are sources of
aggregate noise in the economy that prevent the price from being fully revealing. In particular, every
investor i privately observes nit , which takes the form
                                                                             1        2
                                      nit = nt + εint ,   with εint ∼ N 0, τε−1 ,
                     !        "
where nt ∼ N µn , τn−1 , which can be interpreted as the aggregate sentiment in the economy, is
orthogonal to εint . We assume that the private trading needs of the investor are orthogonal to the
fundamental and that all error terms are independent of each other, of the common component of the
private trading needs, and of the innovation to the fundamental.
       In the CARA-Gaussian setup presented in this section, all equilibria in linear strategies satisfy
Assumption 2. As it is standard in this body of work, we focus on symmetric equilibria in linear
strategies.8 Investors in the model have more information than external observers because they receive
a private signal about ηt and they observe their private trading need. For example, investors could
learn about the aggregate noise in the price from their private trading need. If an investor’s private
trading need was perfectly informative about the aggregate trading need in the economy, the investor
could perfectly observe the fundamental by looking at the equilibrium price. Therefore, the amount of
information that is contained in the price from an internal investor’s perspective, which determines the
investors’ equilibrium learning, may differ from the informational content of prices from an external
observer’s point of view. To account for this discrepancy, we introduce the notion of internal price
informativeness.

Definition 3. (Internal price informativeness) We define internal price informativeness as the
precision of the additional information contained in the unbiased signal of the innovation to the
fundamental payoff ηt contained in the asset price, pˆt , defined in Eq. (3), from the perspective of
an investor in the model. We denote internal price informativeness by
                                                     1     è               é2−1
                                              τp̂ = Var p̂|ηt , θt , nit          .                                     (8)

       To ease the exposition, we describe our results in the text as if the model had a unique equilibrium, although we
consider the possibility of multiplicity in the Appendix. If there were multiple equilibria, our analysis would be valid for
locally stable equilibria as long as the economy does not jump from one equilibrium to another.

                                                               12
   The notion of internal price informativeness becomes relevant in models in which investors’ private
trading needs are informative about the aggregate noise in the price, and in strategic environments.
In the first case, internal price informativeness is higher than price informativeness for an external
observer, since investors have additional information about the noise. In the second case, internal price
informativeness is lower than price informativeness for an external observer. The new information
contained in the price aggregates the signals of all investors from an external observer’s perspective.
Since one of these signals is the private signal observed by the investor, the price contains one new
signal less for an strategic investor than for an external observer.
                                                                                                αs
   The following Lemma characterizes the equilibrium relation between                           αp   and τp̂ in the CARA-
Gaussian setup that we consider.

Lemma 1. (Signal-to-price sensitivity) In the CARA-Gaussian setup, the signal-to-price sensitivity
can be expressed as a function of internal price informativeness τp̂ and primitives τs , τη , and R−1 ρ as
follows
                                                αs       1      τs + τp̂
                                                   =       −1
                                                                           ,                                                (9)
                                                αp   1 − R ρ τη + τs + τp̂
where τp̂ is defined in Eq. (8).

   Given that investors have three sources of information about the asset payoff (their prior, their
private signal, and the price signal), the signal-to-price sensitivity corresponds to the share of
information acquired from the new signals at the disposal of investors, discounted by R−1 ρ. Therefore,
                                                                          αs
high values of τs and τp̂ are associated with high values of              αp ,   while high values of the prior precision τη
                                         αs
are associated with low values of        αp .   Similarly, if the process for the fundamental is highly persistent
                                                                                                                 αs
(ρ is high) or the investors’ discount rate is small (R is low), the signal-to-price sensitivity                 αp   is high,
since new information about the innovation ηt becomes more valuable.
                                αs
   It is useful to interpret    αp   as the sensitivity of the equilibrium price pt to a change in the realization
                                                   ∂pt       αs
of the innovation fundamental ηt , since           ∂ηt   =   αp .   Intuitively, a unit increase in the realization of ηt
increases the value of the signals received by investors, increasing aggregate demand by αs . This increase
in aggregate demand increases the equilibrium price, which endogenously changes investors’ demands,
                 1
according to    αp ,   for two reasons: i) a reduction in demand for purely pecuniary considerations, and ii)
an increase in demand for informational reasons, since a higher price leads investors to infer that other
investors received high signals about the asset payoff. Since substitution effects dominate in our model,
the first effect always dominates in equilibrium, so that asset demands are downward sloping (αp > 0).
   Figure 1a illustrates how the behavior of the signal-to-noise ratio varies with the strength of the
prior precision τη , for a given internal price informativeness τp̂ . If the fundamental is extremely volatile
                                                                                                                      αs
(τη → 0), investors exclusively rely on the signals about the fundamental at their disposal, and                      αp   → 1.
Alternatively, if investors’ prior information is extremely accurate (τη → ∞), investors exclusively rely
on their prior information, so changes in the realization of ηt barely move at all the equilibrium price,
      αs
and   αp   → 0. Intuitively, the more precise the prior information τη held by investors, the less sensitive
the asset price to the realization of ηt .

informativeness τp̂ for different values of τη and τs , respectively, when ρ = 0 and R = 1.04. This parameterization implies
that      1

(τs → ∞), investors trade one for one with their private signals, so                      αp   → 1. Alternatively, if investors’

signals are very inaccurate (τs → 0), investors exclusively rely on their prior information, so                      αp   →    τη +τp̂ .
For a given τs and τη , changes in τp̂ have the same effect as changes in τs given τp̂ .
                                                                                     αs
       Note that Lemma 1 expresses the signal-to-price ratio                         αp   as a function of internal price
informativeness, τp̂ , so we need to further understand the relation between internal and external price
informativeness to fully characterize the fundamental relation in Eq. (5). We do so in the following
Lemma.

Lemma 2. (Relating internal price informativeness and price informativeness for an
external observer) In the CARA-Gaussian setup, there exists a scalar λ > 0 that can be expressed
exclusively in terms of model primitives, such that

                                                           τp̂ = λτp̂e ,

where τp̂e and τp̂ are respectively defined in Eqs. (4) and (8).

       Lemma 2 shows that both notions of informativeness are related in this setup. Intuitively, when
there is a continuum of investors and investors private trading needs reveal information about the
aggregate noise, λ > 1 and τp̂e ≤ τp̂ . If investors do not learn about the aggregate sources of noise from
their own private trading needs, then τp̂ = τp̂e , as in the applications with heterogeneous priors and noise
traders in Section 4. Alternatively, when there is a finite number of strategic investors N , investors

                                                                 14
perceive the price to be less informative than an external observer, because the price aggregates N new
signals for an external observer, while for an investor in the model it only aggregates N − 1 new signals,
so λ < 1 and τp̂e ≥ τp̂ .
    Combining Lemmas 1 and 2, we specialize the fundamental relation between price volatility and
price informativeness to the CARA-Gaussian environment in the following Lemma.

Lemma 3. (Fundamental relation CARA-Gaussian setup) In the CARA-Gaussian setup, the
fundamental relation between price volatility V and price informativeness τp̂e is given by
                                 A                               B2 3
                                         1        τs + λτp̂e                       1          2−1 4
                            V=                                          τη−1   +       τp̂e           ,   (10)
                                     1 − R−1 ρ τη + τs + λτp̂e
            τp̂
where λ =   τp̂e .

    Lemma 3 represents the endogenous relation between V and τp̂e as a function of only three
(combinations of) primitives: τη , τs , and λ, which allows us to explicitly characterize the properties of
the fundamental relation. Note that the variance of the equilibrium price converges to the variance of
the fundamental when prices are infinitely informative. Alternatively, the equilibrium price is infinitely
volatile when prices are totally uninformative. Formally,

                                       lim V = τη−1     and       lim V = ∞.
                                      τp̂e →∞                    τp̂e →0


Note also that
                                        ∂V                                 ∂V
                                 lim          = −∞ and            lim            = 0.
                                 τp̂ →0 ∂τp̂e
                                  e                              τp̂e →∞   ∂τp̂e
Intuitively, for low levels of price informativeness, the noise reduction channel dominates the equilibrium
learning channel, since learning is ineffective. When prices are infinitely informative, the noise reduction
channel and the equilibrium learning channel perfectly cancel each other. These observations already
provide some structure to the fundamental relation. Combining both sets of limits with the continuity
of the relation, we conclude that the fundamental relation has an asymptote at τp̂e = 0 and that it
converges smoothly towards τη−1 when prices are sufficiently informative.
    Whether the relation between price volatility and price informativeness in Eq. (5) is monotonic
depends on the value of λ. In particular, when λ < 2, which encompasses the scenario in which internal
and external price informativeness are equal, the fundamental relation is non-monotonic. The variable
λ represents how much more new information is contained in the price for an investor relative to an
external observer. If λ > 2, the investor learns more than twice as much as an external observer by
using the price as a signal. Although one could argue that active investors may have better information
about the noise embedded in asset prices, hence learning more from the price than external observers,
it is not easy to argue why there should be a two-fold difference between both groups. In fact, most
models considered in the literature on learning in financial markets (e.g. Veldkamp (2011) and Vives
(2016)) implicitly adopt parameterizations that imply λ = 1. In two of our three applications, λ is also

dotted line depicts the limit τη−1 to which the fundamental relation converges when prices are perfectly informative.


weakly less than one. Therefore, in what follows, we focus on and state our formal results for the case
λ < 2.9
       We formally show that the fundamental relation is decreasing for sufficiently low values of τp̂e and
increasing for sufficiently high values of τp̂e . The following proposition formalizes this non-monotonicity.



Proposition 2. (Slope of fundamental relation) The fundamental relation between price volatility
and price informativeness is increasing (decreasing) if and only if price informativeness is high (low)
enough. Formally, there exists a threshold τ ⋆ > 0 such that
                         dV                                              dV

                             τ⋆ =                                                                     .                 (11)

       Proposition 2 shows that, regardless of the source of noise in the model, the slope of Eq. (10)
is positive when τp̂e is sufficiently large and negative otherwise. The threshold τ ⋆ , which determines
the lower boundary of the positive slope region, only depends on the precision of the fundamental,
the precision of the private signal, and the value of λ. Interestingly, the threshold τ ⋆ only depends
on the remaining model parameters indirectly through λ. In particular, the specific source of noise

       In previous versions of the paper, we also studied the case of classic noise traders, which also features λ = 1. The
results of the λ ≥ 2 case are available upon request.


                                                                  16
may only affect τ ⋆ through λ. Exploiting our two-channel decomposition, we say that when prices are
sufficiently informative, when τp̂e > τ ⋆ , the equilibrium learning channel dominates the noise reduction
channel. On the contrary, when τp̂e < τ ⋆ , the noise reduction channel dominates the equilibrium learning
channel. Figure 2 illustrates the shape of the fundamental relation between price volatility and price
informativeness in Eq. (5) and the threshold τ ⋆ when λ < 2.
    Proposition 2 implies that any change in the subset of parameters that do not enter the fundamental
relation directly must induce a positive comovement between price informativeness and volatility when
prices are sufficiently informative and a negative comovement otherwise. When interpreted through the
lens of our two-channel decomposition, when prices are sufficiently informative, the equilibrium learning
channel, which is driven by the change in investors’ equilibrium behavior induced by learning, becomes
overwhelmingly important and dominates the noise reduction channel, and vice versa. Proposition 2
also implies that to fully characterize the relation between price informativeness and price volatility
across equilibria whenever there is a change in the subset of parameters that at the same time shifts
the fundamental relation upwards or downwards and increases or decreases price informativeness, it is
necessary to look at fully specified models in which the source of noise is full specified. In the following
section, we consider three different ways of modeling noise: heterogeneous priors, hedging needs, and a
finite number of investors.


4    Positive and Negative Comovement Regions
While the results derived in the general CARA-Gaussian setup provide interesting insights into the
nature of the relation between price volatility and informativeness, understanding the exact behavior of
both variables across equilibria requires the study of fully specified models. In this section, we seek to
draw conclusions about the comovement of both variables by studying three representative applications
that illustrate the different values that the ratio of precisions of the signal contained in the price for an
investor relative to an external observer, λ, can take.
    First, we study a model with λ = 1, in which the aggregate source of noise in the economy is driven
by heterogeneity in investors’ priors. Second, we study a model with λ < 1, in which a finite number
of investors interact strategically. In this case, the Law of Large Numbers breaks down and there are
additional sources of aggregate noise coming from the average of the realized idiosyncratic realizations.
Finally, we study a model with λ > 1, in which uncertainty about the aggregate level of hedging needs
is the source of private trading needs.
    In the three models that we consider in this section, it is always the case that when price
informativeness is high enough, price informativeness and price volatility positively comove after any
parameter change. Moreover, it is also the case that when price informativeness is low enough, there
may exist a region in which price volatility and informativeness negatively comove for any parameter
change. Proposition 3 formalizes these results. It is worth highlighting that our results apply to
comparative static exercises that are valid for changes in any of the underlying model parameters,
including those that appear in the fundamental relation.

                                                     17
Proposition 3. (Positive and negative comovement regions) In all of the applications studied
in this section:
       a) [Positive comovement region] Price volatility and price informativeness positively comove across
equilibria if price informativeness is high enough. Formally, there exists a threshold τ ∈ [τ ⋆ , ∞) such
that, if τp̂e ≥ τ , V and τp̂e move in the same direction after any parameter change.
       b) [Negative comovement region] Price volatility and price informativeness negatively comove across
equilibria if price informativeness is low enough. Formally, there exists a threshold τ ∈ [0, τ ⋆ ] such that,
if τp̂e < τ , V and τp̂e move in opposite directions after any parameter change.

       Proposition 3 follows by combining Proposition 2 with the fact that price informativeness i) increases
with the precision of private information, τs , ii) decreases with the precision of the fundamental
innovation, τη , iii) increases with an increase in λ that leaves τn unchanged, and iv) increases with
the precision of aggregate noise, τn , if τp̂e > τ , in all applications.             Consequently, Proposition 3
implies that parameter changes that shift the fundamental relation upwards (downwards) are associated
with increases (decreases) in price volatility when price informativeness is high enough. Alternatively,
Proposition 3 implies that parameter changes that shift the fundamental relation upwards (downwards)
are associated with decreases (increases) in price volatility when price informativeness is low enough.
       Which economic forces underlie the positive comovement finding in the region in which prices are
very informative? For instance, an increase in the precision of investors’ private signals about the
fundamental shifts the fundamental relation upwards because investors are more responsive to their
information for any level of price informativeness, as we describe above when explaining Lemma 1.
As expected, price informativeness also increases when investors receive more precise signals. When
the equilibrium learning channel dominates, the upward shift in the fundamental relation and the
increase in price informativeness guarantee an increase in price volatility, which yields the desired
comovement. Alternatively, an increase in the precision of investors’ priors about the fundamental
shifts the fundamental relation downwards, since investors are less responsive to their information.
As expected, price informativeness decreases when investors rely more on their priors. When the
equilibrium learning channel dominates, the downward shift in the fundamental relation and the
decrease in price informativeness guarantee a decrease in volatility, which yields again the same
comovement. Similar arguments apply to changes in λ that do not involve τn , and to changes in
τn , which may or may not modify λ.10
       When price informativeness is sufficiently low, an increase in the precision of investors’ private signals
about the fundamental shifts the fundamental relation upwards while increasing price informativeness.
In principle, it may be that volatility increases or decreases with that change, since the fundamental
relation is downward sloping. However, exploiting the fact, illustrated in Figure 2, that the fundamental
relation has an asymptote at τp̂ = 0, it is possible to show that there may exist a region of the
  10
       Note that the only scenario in which the tighter threshold τ becomes relevant is when considering changes in τn
in cases in which investors partially infer the value of the aggregate trading need from their idiosyncratic realization,
as it occurs in our application with hedging needs. Otherwise, the threshold τ ⋆ , which defines the region in which the
fundamental relation is upward sloping in Proposition 2, remains the relevant threshold for part a) in Proposition 3.

parameter space such that volatility and informativeness comove negatively for any parameter changes.
Intuitively, when informativeness is sufficiently low, the noise reduction channel dominates for any
change in primitives. While the positive comovement region always exists, the negative comovement
region may or may not exist (that is, τ = 0) in specific applications, as we illustrate next.
     Finding an unambiguous positive or negative comovement between both variables for any change
in primitives, even for specific regions of the parameter space, may come as a surprise, since the prior
about the sign of the relationship should not be obvious ex-ante. To further explore the results already
derived, we formally introduce and perform comparative statics in all three applications. Subsequently,
in Section 5, we further characterize the positive and negative comovement regions as a function of a
subset of ratios of model primitives in all three applications. For our leading application, we eventually
recover from observables the required stock-specific parameters that determine whether a given stock
is in the positive or negative comovement regions.


4.1     Application 1: Disagreement

We consider a CARA-Gaussian setup as the one described in the previous section in which investors’
private trading motives are given by differences in their beliefs about the expected fundamental payoff.
This application yields a particularly tractable equilibrium characterization. More specifically, each
investor i has a prior belief over the distribution of the innovation to the payoff of the risky asset. In
particular, from an investor i’s perspective, the innovation to the asset payoff ηt is distributed according
to
                                                              1             2
                                                  ηt ∼i N η it , τη−1 ,

where η it denotes investor i’s prior expected payoff. We assume that investors’ prior expected payoff
innovations are random and distributed according to

                                                       η it = nt + εiut ,

where
                                           1       2                            1       2
                                    iid
                                εiut ∼ N 0, τu−1            and        nt ∼ N µn , τn−1 ,

with εiut ⊥ η it , εist ⊥ η it and εiut ⊥ εjst for all i, j ∈ I, i Ó= j, and nt ⊥ ηt for all t.
     This formulation implies that an investor’s prior mean has two components:                   an aggregate
component, nt , which can be interpreted as a measure of sentiment in the economy, and an idiosyncratic
component εiut , which reflects an individual investors’ beliefs. Investors know their own prior but they
cannot distinguish the market’s sentiment from their own idiosyncratic component.
     We assume that investors take their priors as given and do not use them to learn about the priors
of others investors. Consequently, they do not infer anything about nt from their own priors. However,
investors know the distribution of priors in the economy and use this knowledge to learn from the
price. The fact that the realized average prior mean nt is unknown introduces a source of aggregate
uncertainty in addition to the payoff of the risky asset.

Note: Figure 3 shows comparative statics of price informativeness τp̂e and price volatility V = Var [ pt | θt−1 ] as a function
of all five primitives of the model considered in Application 1. All plots feature two y-axis: the left y-axis corresponds
to the values of τp̂e , while the right y-axis corresponds to the values of V = Var [ pt | θt−1 ]. The five parameters of this
model are the following: τs , precision of private signals about the fundamental, τη , precision of the innovation to the
fundamental, τn , precision of the average prior, τu , the precision of investors’ dispersion of heterogeneous beliefs, and γ,
investors’ coefficient of absolute risk aversion. The reference values are τs = 1, τη = 3, τn = 1.5, τu = 1, and γ = 0.5.

   Consistently with our definition of λ in Lemma 2, the value of λ is unity in this application, so
τp̂e = τp̂ . Therefore, we can express the Fundamental Relation for this application as

In this application, we can explicitly compute the equilibrium values of price volatility and price
informativeness as a function of primitives. Formally, τp̂e and V are given by

   Figure 3 shows the comparative statics of τp̂e and V as a function of the five primitives of the model:
τs , τη , τn , τu and γ. Interestingly, in this application, both price volatility and informativeness are
independent of investors’ risk aversion, γ, and of the dispersion in investors’ priors, τu , although there
are other equilibrium variables that do depend on γ or τu , for example, the risk premium and trading
volume.
   Figure 3 illustrates the existence of positive and negative comovement regions, as established
in Proposition 2.        For instance, when investors have precise private signals (τs is high), price
informativeness   τp̂e   is high, and over that region volatility and informativeness comove positively.
Intuitively, an increase in τs increases equilibrium price informativeness and shifts up the locus defined in
Eq. (12). When price informativeness is high enough, which holds for high values of τs , the fundamental
relation in Eq. (12) is increasing, so volatility necessarily increases in equilibrium. Similarly, when
investors’ prior precision τη is low or the amount of aggregate noise is low (τn is high), τp̂e is in the
positive comovement region and any change in parameters moves the locus defined in Eq. (12) and
equilibrium price informativeness in the same direction, which implies that τp̂e and V positively comove.
Therefore, if price informativeness is in the positive comovement region, a change in any of the model’s
parameters leads to positive comovement between price volatility and price informativeness.
   Alternatively, when investors have imprecise private signals (τs is low), price informativeness τp̂e
is low, and over that region volatility and informativeness comove negatively. Intuitively, an increase
in τs increases equilibrium price informativeness and shifts up the locus in Eq. (12), which pushes
price volatility in an indeterminate direction. However, when price informativeness is low enough, the
slope of the fundamental relation is sufficiently negative that it is the case that price volatility goes
down, establishing the negative comovement. Similarly reasoning applies to the comparative statics for
τη and τn . It is worth highlighting that while price informativeness varies monotonically with all the
parameters, price volatility is non-monotonic on changes on primitives. This is a necessary feature of
the model in order to have both a positive and a negative comovement region.

4.2      Application 2: Strategic Traders

While the previous applications feature a continuum of price-taking investors, we now allow for strategic
behavior. We specialize the environment presented in the previous section to a finite number of investors,
N , who have heterogeneous priors over the value of the asset.11 In particular, from the perspective of
investor i, the asset payoff θ is distributed according to

                                                    θt+1 = µθ + ρθt + ηt ,

where θ0 = 0,
                                         1          2                              1                       2
                                                                         i.i.d
                              ηt ∼i N η it , τη−1 ,         and η it ∼ N 0, (N + 1) τn−1 ,

where the variance of noise increases with the number of investors to ensure the economy converges to
the competitive economy in Application 1. In a symmetric equilibrium in linear strategies, we postulate
net demand functions given by

                                         ∆qti = αs sit + αθ θt + αn η it − αp pt + ψ,

where αs , αθ , αn , and αp are positive scalars, while ψ can take positive or negative values. Market
clearing in the asset market implies that the equilibrium price takes the form
                                          A         qN         B                         qN
                                   αs                     i                                       i
                                                     i=1 εst            αθ      αη          i=1 η̄t       ψ
                              pt =           ηt +                  +       θt +                       +      .
                                   αp                   N               αp      αp          N             αp

In this case, the price is not fully revealing because the noise contained in the signals on which the
investors’ trade and the noise contained in the investors’ priors do not wash out in the aggregate. There
is aggregate uncertainty coming from the realized signals and priors. Consistently with our definition
of λ in Lemma 2, in this application,
                                                               N −1
                                                         λ=         < 1,
                                                                N
so τp̂ < τp̂e , and the fundamental relation can expressed as
                                    A                                            B2 3
                                            1        τs + NN−1 τp̂e                             1     2−1 4
                              V=                                                        τη−1 + τp̂e            .
                                        1 − R−1 ρ τη + τs + NN−1 τp̂e

      Note that when investors behave strategically, the price is more informative for an external observer
than for an investor inside the model. The price aggregates the N signals received by the active investors,
which is all new information for an external observer. However, since an investor already knows the
realization of his own signal, from the investors’ perspective the price conveys new information only
about N − 1 new signals.
      Figure 4 shows the comparative statics of τp̂e and V as a function of the five primitives of the model:
τs , τη , N , τn , and γ. As in the disagreement model with a continuum of agents, price informativeness and
volatility are invariant to the level of risk aversion γ. Figure 4 also illustrates the existence of positive
and negative comovement regions, as established in Proposition 2. The intuition behind the results is
 11
      The heterogeneity in beliefs introduces the additional motive for trading needed to escape the no-trade theorem.

                                                                   23
identical to the one provided in Application 1. Interestingly, changes in the value of aggregate noise τn
induce a positive comovement between volatility and informativeness when price informativeness is high
enough. On the other hand, when price informativeness is low enough and in the negative comovement
region, volatility and informativeness move in different directions.
   This application includes a new comparative static exercise on the number of investors. In this
model, price informativeness is increasing in the number of investors N . However, price volatility is
non-monotonic in the number of investors, initially decreasing in N in the negative comovement region,
and finally increasing with N once price informativeness is sufficiently high. Finally, as in Application
1, note that while price informativeness varies monotonically with all the parameters, price volatility is
non-monotonic on changes on primitives, which is consistent with the existence of positive and negative
comovement regions.


4.3     Application 3: Hedging Needs

In this application, we use aggregate hedging needs as an alternative formulation for investors’ private
trading needs. In particular, we assume that the fundamental payoff has both a learnable and an
unlearnable component. Formally, we assume that

                                             θt+1 = µθ + ρθt + ηt ,

where θ0 = 0,
                                                     ηt = ηtl + ηtu ,

and
                                         1           2                        1           2
                               ηtl ∼ N 0, τη−1            and ηtu ∼ N η, τu−1 .

ηtu and ηtl , which represent the unlearnable and learnable components of the innovation to the asset
payoff, are orthogonal to each other. The realized fundamental θt is observable in period t.
   We further assume that investors born in generation t have an endowment nit+1 which is potentially
                                                               u
correlated with the unlearnable component of the asset payoff ηt+1 and is independent of the learnable
component. Investors’ hedging needs, given by the correlation between the investors’ endowment and
the asset payoff, are given by a random variable hit , which is distributed as follows
                                   1                 -   2         1                  2
                                                     -
                         hit ≡ Cov θt+1 , nit+1 - θt = Cov ηtu , nit+1 = nt + εiht ,

where
                                        1            2                            1           2
                                                                        iid
                               nt ∼ N 0, τn−1             and εiht ∼ N θ, τh−1 .

Investors receive a private signal of the learnable component of the asset’s payoff
                                                                              1           2
                                                                   iid
                                sit = ηtl + εist ,       with εist ∼ N θ, τs−1 .

Depending on parameters, this model can potentially feature multiple equilibria, as described in detail
in Davila and Parlatore (2017). Consistent with our definition of λ in Lemma 2, in this application,
                                                         τh + τn
                                                λ=               > 1,
                                                            τh

of absolute risk aversion. The reference values are τs = 1, τη = 1, τn = 2, τh = 1, and γ = 0.5.

    Note that when investors are aware that the source of aggregate noise has a common component,
the price is less informative for an external observer than for an individual investor. In this case, an
individual investor can make use of the realization to his hedging need to partially infer the level of
aggregate hedging needs, which allows him to better filter the information conveyed by the price.
    Figure 5 shows the comparative statics of τp̂e and V as a function of the five primitives of the
model: τs , τη , τn , τh , and γ. In this model, all five primitives determine the equilibrium values of
τp̂e and V. As in the previous applications, and consistently with Proposition 3, Figure 5 shows that,
when price informativeness is high enough, changes in τs , τη , τh , τn , and γ move price volatility and
price informativeness in the same direction. Interestingly, a negative comovement region between price
volatility and informativeness does not exist in this application, that is, the threshold τ , defined in
Proposition 3, is equal to zero. Figure 5 shows that even when price informativeness is arbitrarily
small, changes in parameters other than τn and γ imply a positive comovement between volatility and
informativeness.


5     Comovement Regions: Characterization and Measurement
Propositions 2 and 3 are formalized in terms of price informativeness, which, despite being a meaningful
variable, is an equilibrium object.          Our theoretical results beget the question of which precise
combinations of primitives are consistent with a negative or positive comovement between volatility
and informativeness. To that end, we now show that it is possible to characterize whether a given
economy is in the positive or negative comovement regions as a function of a subset of model primitives
in all three applications. Subsequently, for our leading application, we recover from observables the
required stock-specific parameters that determine whether a given economy features positive or negative
comovement. We empirically find that most stocks are in the negative comovement region.


5.1   Explicit Characterization of Comovement Regions

For simplicity, we state Proposition 4 only for our leading application, which is the most tightly
parameterized, although we study the remaining applications in the Appendix.

Proposition 4. (Explicit characterization of comovement regions) Consider our leading
application, which features a continuum of investors with private trading motives based on differences
in beliefs, introduced in Section 4.1. In that case,
                                                                                                          τs
    a) Sufficiently large values of the “signal-to-prior” ratio of precisions,                            τη ,   and the “noise-to-

fundamental” ratio of precisions,    τη ,   guarantee that the economy is in the positive comovement region
and that volatility and informativeness positively comove for any change in primitives. Explicitly, the

and that volatility and informativeness negatively comove for any change in primitives. Explicitly, the

       Eqs. (13) and (14) provide an explicit characterization of conditions on model primitives that
guarantee a positive or negative comovement between price informativeness and price volatility.
Interestingly, our characterization can be expressed exclusively in terms of two ratios of precisions,
which allows us to provide a sense of the magnitudes implied by the model in a scale-invariant form. In
particular, both Eqs. (13) and (14) remain valid regardless of the values of investors’ risk aversion γ,
the dispersion of investors’ heterogeneous beliefs τu , or the supply of the risky asset. As we show in the
Appendix, the conditions that determine whether an economy features positive or negative comovement
in equilibrium can be expressed exclusively as a function of ratios of primitives in all applications.12

which measures the relative volatility of the innovation to the fundamental relative to the volatility
of sentiment, are sufficiently large, the economy features positive comovement. Intuitively, when τs
is high, investors receive precise signals and price informativeness is high, which puts the economy in
the positive comovement region. Similarly, when τn is high, aggregate noise is low, which also implies
high price informativeness, guaranteeing that the economy is in the positive comovement region. When
           τs         τn
either     τη    or   τη   are small, informativeness is small and the economy is in the negative comovement
region.

aggregate component of beliefs is greater than twice the variance of the innovation to the fundamental
( τ1n > 2 τ1η ), regardless of the value of the remaining parameters of the model. Moreover, our model
implies that when the variance of the innovation to the fundamental and the variance of the aggregate

possible combinations. In the next section, we recover these ratios of primitives at the stock level.


5.2   Comovement Regions in the Data
                                                                        τn             τs
In our final proposition, we recover stock-specific measures of         τη   and       τη ,   which allows us to determine
in practice if a given stock is in the positive or negative comovement region. To do so, we leverage the
methodology developed in Davila and Parlatore (2018), which provides formal identification results for
a class of models that includes those considered in this paper.
   It is well known, see e.g. Campbell (2017) for a recent discussion of the literature, that assuming
that measures of asset payoffs (dividends, earnings, etc.) are non-stationary is often perceived as a
better assumption. In what follows, we recover primitives under the assumption that the payoff is
                                                                                                               τn          τs
non-stationary, that is, ρ = 1. We formally describe the procedure to recover estimates of                     τη   and    τη   in
the following Proposition.

Proposition 5. (Recovering stock-specific primitives) Let β0 , β1 and β2 denote the coefficients
of the following regression of asset price changes on changes on fundamentals,

                                   ∆pt = β0 + β1 ∆θt + β2 ∆θt+1 + εt ,                                                     (R1)

where pt denotes the ex-dividend price at the beginning of period t and θt denotes the measure of
fundamentals realized over period t. Let ζ0 and ζ1 denote the the coefficients of the following regression
R2 of price changes on changes on lagged fundamentals

                                         ∆pt = ζ0 + ζ1 ∆θt + εζt .                                                         (R2)

Let τp̂R denote a measure of relative price informativeness, defined and computed as described in the
                                                     τn          τs
Appendix. It is then possible to find measures of    τη   and    τη   as follows

                                         3                              4−2
                                  τn               β2

                                                           − τp̂R             τp̂R ,                                       (16)
                                  τη         1 + R ζ1 − β2

where R corresponds to the risk-free rate.

   Proposition 5 shows that it possible to recover the desired ratios by using outcomes of regressions
                                                                                                        τn         τs
of price changes and changes on fundamentals. In particular, recovering the ratios                      τη   and   τη   involves
using the coefficients β1 and β2 from Regression R1, the coefficient ζ1 from Regression R2, and the
R-squared of both regressions to recover τp̂R , as shown in the Appendix. We describe the data used to
compute estimates of these variables next.

Data Description We conduct our analysis using annual data from 1963 to 2017. We obtain stock
price data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) to calculate stocks market values,
data on reported earnings, to use as a measure of fundamentals, from CRSP/Compustat Merged (CCM),
and a personal consumption deflator index from FRED.
    Table 1 shows summary statistics for our full sample of 21, 366 stock-year observations. Our sample
exhibits considerable variation in terms of market capitalization and total earnings. The distribution
of market capitalization across firms and periods has a mean of $7, 696 million, a median of $1, 074
million and a standard deviation of $25, 561 million. The minimum market capitalization in a given
quarter is $0.72 million and the maximum is $619, 962 million. The distribution of total earnings across
firms and periods has a mean of $832, 89 million, a median of $130 million, and a standard deviation
of $2, 866 million.
    Table 2 shows summary statistics at the stock level for the 466 stocks that form our final sample,
which is restricted to include stocks with more than 40 observations. In particular, this table summarizes
the differences in the distribution of earnings across stocks. The mean earnings across stocks have a
mean of $778 million, a median of $170 million and a standard deviation of $2, 038 million. The
median standard deviation in earnings is $136 million and it exhibits a standard deviation of $1, 771
million. These summary statistics show that there is significant heterogeneity in the earnings process
in the cross-section of firms as the mean and, more importantly, the volatility of the fundamental varies
considerably across stocks.
    The summary statistics presented in Tables 1 and 2 suggest that the process for earnings is different
across stocks. Moreover, the amount of information available is not uniform across stocks. Therefore,
our results about the comovement of volatility and informativeness are only meaningful when interpreted
at the stock level.

Recovering Primitives              We empirically implement Proposition 5 by running the following
specifications in differences for each of the stocks (indexed by j) in our sample:

                                      ∆Mtj = β0j + β1j ∆Etj + β2j ∆Et+1
                                                                    j
                                                                        + εj∆t                                            (17)
                                      ∆Mtj       =   ζ0j   +   ζ1j ∆Etj              +   ε̂j∆t ,                          (18)

where Mtj denotes a stock total market capitalization and Etj denotes total earnings. As shown in the
Appendix, we can recover relative price informativeness using the R-squareds of the regressions in Eqs.
                             2j               2j
(17) and (18), respectively R|∆θt ,∆θt−1
                                         and R|∆θt−1
                                                     . Therefore, by using the OLS estimates of β1j , β2j ,
and ζ1j , we can apply the results in Proposition 5 and make use of Eqs. (15) and (16) to recover ratios
τnj         τsj
      and         that determine whether for stock j price informativeness and price volatility positively or
τηj         τηj
negatively comove.
    Figure 6b illustrates the 3
                              main empirical
                                        4        findings of the paper. Figure 6b shows the non-negative
                                τnj τsj
estimated values of the pairs     j, j    for the stocks in our sample in conjunction with the positive and
                                     τη     τη
negative comovement regions defined in Proposition 4.13 It is evident from the figure that roughly 60% of
the final set of stocks are in the negative comovement region. For these stocks, our model implies that a
decrease (increase) in price volatility is associated with an increase (decrease) in price informativeness.
Interestingly, there are no stocks whose estimated primitives lie in the positive comovement region.
We recover ratios of primitives for the remaining 40% of stocks in the intermediate region between
the positive and negative comovement regions. For these stocks, our framework shows that it is
not possible to find an unambiguous prediction for how volatility and informativeness comove after
a change in primitives. Intuitively, the large amount of idiosyncratic volatility unrelated to changes in
earnings at the stock level suggests that price informativeness is low for most stocks, which given our
theoretical results implies that most stocks feature negative comovement between price volatility and
informativeness.
  13
       Our methodology does not impose that the estimates of the ratios must be non-negative. The fact that we find
some ratios with negative values is a symptom of model misspecification. The representation of the results in Figure 6b
implicitly disregards these observations.




                                                                     31
6    Conclusion
This paper has systematically characterized the equilibrium relation between price informativeness
and price volatility in models of financial market trading, identifying two different channels (noise
reduction and equilibrium learning) through which changes in price informativeness are associated
with changes in price volatility.    Our main results establish that whenever prices are sufficiently
informative (uninformative), changes in parameters induce a positive (negative) comovement between
price informativeness and price volatility in response to a change in primitives. We characterize simple
conditions in terms of primitives that identify whether volatility and informativeness positively or
negatively comove for a given stock for different applications of our general framework. In the context
our leading application, we use data on U.S. stocks to recover stock-specific estimates of such primitives.
This allows us to determine whether individual stocks are in the region of the parameter space in which
informativeness and volatility comove positively or negatively. Our empirical findings conclude that
most stocks feature negative comovement between price informativeness and price volatility. In practical
terms, our results imply that stocks with more volatility prices are likely to be less informative, and
vice versa.
    There is scope to extend the framework that we develop in this paper to explore in detail the
relation between price informativeness and volatility in more general environments that incorporate
multiple assets or richer wealth effects. The overall approach of relating easily computable statistics to
interesting unobservables that capture the ability of markets to aggregate information seems to be of
broader applicability to other contexts in which information dispersion is relevant, for instance, macro
environments or auctions.

to the fundamental after solving their filtering problem as

       Note that the term   τθ|s,p̂ αs

where τ̂ε is the precision of the investors’ private trading motive as a signal of the aggregate private trading need.
    An external observer does not have any private trading need from which he can learn about the aggregate
noise contained in the price. Hence, the unbiased signal about the innovation to the fundamental contained in
the price from the perspective of an external observer is
                                                                  αn

Lemma 3. (Fundamental relation CARA-Gaussian setup)
Proof. It follows by direct substitution of the result in Proposition 1a) and the results of Lemmas 1 and 2.



Proposition 2. (Slope of fundamental relation)
Proof. From Eq. (9) using Lemma 2 it follows that
                                         1 2
                                          αs

Therefore, from Lemma 3 it follows that

Note that, since λ < 2, the expression on the right hand side is a convex quadratic function of τp̂e with only one

In order to prove Proposition 3 in the text, we establish three propositions, one for each application.
Proposition 2. (Slope of fundamental relation)
Proof. It follows from Propositions 6, 7, and 8 below.


C.1     Disagreement
Characterization of equilibrium In a symmetric equilibrium in linear strategies, we postulate net demand
functions given by
                                         ∆qti = αs sit + αη η it + αθ θt − αp pt + ψ,

where αθ , αs , and αp are positive scalars, while ψ can take positive or negative values. This implies that the
equilibrium price takes the form
                                              αθ      αs      αη      ψ
                                         pt =    θt +    ηt +    nt +    .
                                              αp      αp      αp      αp
In this case, the asset price depends on both the aggregate sentiment in the economy nt , and the actual innovation
to the payoff realization ηt , which are both unobservable. Therefore, if an investor faces a high price in the asset
market, it can be because the sentiment in the economy is high or because the asset payoff is high. The price is
not fully revealing because the sentiment in the economy is random and not observed by the investors. However,
the price contains information about the innovation to fundamental value of the asset ηt . The unbiased signal of
ηt contained in the price is given by
                                       3                       4
                                    αp      αη      αθ       ψ           αη
                               p̂ =      p−    µn −    θt −      = ηt +     (nt − µn ) .
                                    αs      αp      αp      αp           αs
                                                         −1
Then, the variance of p̂, which we denote by (τp̂ ) and whose inverse we adopt as the relevant measure of price
informativeness, is given by
                                                3 42       3 42
                                                   αs        τs
                                          τp̂ =       τn =        τn .
                                                   αη        τη
Note that since investors do not learn about the aggregate sentiment in the economy from their own prior, they
have the same information that an external observer has. Then, λ = 1 and

                                                                 τp̂e = τp̂ .

   The equilibrium is characterized by Eq. (A.7), Eq. (A.8), Eq. (A.9), and Eq. (A.10). This characterization
                                                                    τη
maps to the model in Section 3 by setting λ = 1, τ̂ǫ = 0, and π = τη|s, p̂
                                                                           .

Proposition 6. (Comovement disagreement) a) Price volatility and price informativeness positively comove
(weakly) across equilibria if price informativeness is high enough. Formally, if τp̂e ≥ τ ⋆ , V and τp̂e move in the
same direction after any parameter change.
    b) Price volatility and price informativeness negatively comove (weakly) across equilibria if price
informativeness is low enough. Formally, there exists a threshold τ ∈ [0, τ ⋆ ] such that, if τp̂e < τ , V and τp̂e
move in opposite directions after any parameter change. Moreover, if τη < τn then τ > 0.



                                                                     40

where    ∂x     and   dx      can be obtained from Eq. (5) and Eq. (9) using the definition of τp̂e . Note that

                                                                       dτp̂                           ∂V

                                                                       dτu                            ∂τu

                                                                        dγ                            ∂γ
and
                                                                 dτp̂                                    ∂V
                                                                        = 0 and                                 > 0,
                                                              d (R−1 ρ)                               ∂ (R−1 ρ)
so the comovements in this proposition are weak.
    a) Positive comovement
    For changes in τs it follows that
                                                                              1 2

Since in equilibrium τp̂e =                   τη        τn , it follows that        dτs       =    τs     > 0. Moreover,

Proposition 7. (Comovement strategic traders) a) Price volatility and price informativeness positively
comove (weakly) across equilibria if price informativeness is high enough. Formally, there exists τ ∈ (τ ⋆ , ∞) such
that if τp̂e ≥ τ , V and τp̂e move in the same direction after any parameter change.
    b) Price volatility and price informativeness negatively comove (weakly) across equilibria if price
informativeness is low enough. Formally, there exists a threshold τ ∈ [0, τ ⋆ ] such that, if τp̂e < τ , V and τp̂e
move in opposite directions after any parameter change.

Proof. Note that
                                              dτp̂                                   dV
                                                     = 0 and                                > 0,
                                           d (R−1 ρ)                              d (R−1 ρ)
so the comovements in this proposition are weak. Moreover,
                                                  ∂τp̂e                           dV
                                                        <0            and             = 0.
                                                  ∂τn                             dτn
Hence, movements in τn will induce positive (negative) comovements between price informativeness and price
volatility if and only if τp̂e > (<) τ ⋆ .
    a) Positive comovement
    From Lemma 4 and using that

                                             αs       1        τs + NN−1 τp̂e
                                                =                               ,
                                             αp   1 − R−1 ρ τη + τs + NN−1 τp̂e

we have
                                          dτp̂e             dτp̂e                 dτp̂e
                                                > 0,              < 0,                  > 0 and,
                                          dτs               dτη                   dN
                                          ∂V                ∂V                     ∂V
                                                < 0,              < 0,                  > 0.
                                          ∂τs               ∂τη                   ∂Ns

Therefore, whenever τp̂e > τ ⋆ , price informativeness and price volatility positively comove.
   b) Negative comovement
   For changes in τs we have
                                                                         e

three). We adopt a conventional notion of stability. The function Ĥ ααns is defined such that if Ĥ (x0 ) > 0,
then J (x0 ) > x0 , which implies that if investors in the model expect the signal-to-noise ratio to be x0 , the realized
value of this ratio will be x1 > x0 . Let x∗ be a solution to Ĥ (x∗ ) = 0. Then, we will say that the equilibrium x∗
                                                                                ∞
is stable if for all x0 ∈ (x∗ − δ, x∗ − δ) for some δ > 0 the sequence {xm }m=0 where xm = J (xm−1 ) for m > 1
converges to x∗ . This sequence will converge only if J ′ (x∗ ) < 1, which is equivalent to Ĥ ′ (x∗ ) < 0. Hence, in all
stable equilibria, Ĥ ′ (x∗ ) < 0. Finally, note that when τs = 0, the only root of Ĥ (x∗ ) is at x∗ = 0.

Proposition 8. (Comovement hedging needs) a) Price volatility and price informativeness positively comove
(weakly) across equilibria if price informativeness is high enough. Formally, there exists τ ∈ (τ ⋆ , ∞) such that if
τp̂e ≥ τ , V and τp̂e move in the same direction after any parameter change.
      b) Price volatility and price informativeness negatively comove (weakly) across equilibria if price
informativeness is low enough for changes in τn and γ. For changes in τs , τh , and τη price informativeness
and price volatility always comove positively. Hence, there does not exist a negative comovement region.

Proof. Note that

D      Proofs: Section 5
Proposition 4. (Explicit characterization of comovement regions) Using Proposition 2 and the
characterization of equilibrium price informativeness in the previous section of this Appendix, we can write the
positive and negative comovement regions in terms of parameters for Application 1. In this case, price volatility
is given by

and price informativeness is given by
                                                                                    3        42
                                                                                        τs
                                                                         τp̂e   =                 τn .
                                                                                        τη
There are three parameters that determine price informativeness and price volatility in equilibrium, the precision
of private information, τs , the precision of the investors’ prior, τη , and the precision of the aggregate sentiment,
τn . The term R−1 ρ affects price volatility but leaves informativeness unchanged. All other parameters leave the
price distribution unchanged.
     The threshold τ ⋆ in Proposition 2 is given by
                                                                ñ

                                           τ⋆ ≡                              .
                                                              2
Since λ = 1, τ = τ ⋆ and, using the definition of τp̂e , the positive comovement region is characterized by τp̂e > τ ⋆ ,
which, in terms of primitives, is given by
                                                ò          1 22

                                             ≥               1 22          .

   Moreover, using the results in Eq. (A.11) and Eq. (A.12) in the proof Prop. 6 we have that the negative
comovement region is characterized by the following conditions: ττnη < 1,

Under the stated assumptions, we can therefore interpret the coefficients β1 and ζ1 as follows
                                                                                  αs                         αθ

Therefore, Equations (A.17) and Equation (A.18) imply that                                              τη   + τp̂R can be recovered as follows
