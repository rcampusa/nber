                                                ABSTRACT

We have assessed the determinants of the choice of integration, relational contracting (keiretsu sourcing)
and market sourcing by seven Japanese automobile manufacturers (OEMs) with respect to 54 components
in light of contract economics. Our major findings are the following. First, the specificity and interdependency
of a component significantly promotes vertical integration over keiretsu and keiretsu over market,
consistent with transaction cost economics. Second, interdependency is a more important consideration
for the former choice than for the latter choice, and the reverse is the case for specificity. This suggests
that the hold-up risk due to specific investment can be often effectively controlled by a relational contracting
based on keiretsu sourcing, while accommodating non-contractible design changes may often require
vertical integration. Third, while higher testability of a component makes the effects of specificity
significantly smaller, it also promotes the choice of keiretsu sourcing over market sourcing. One interpretation
of this last result is that while higher testability improves the contractibility of the component with
high specificity, it simultaneously enhances the advantage of keiretsu sourcing since it provides more
opportunities for the supplier to explore new information for a collaborative exploitation with an OEM.

1. Introduction

This paper empirically examines the determinants of the boundaries of the firm, focusing on the

Japanese auto industry. Since Coase’s (1937) seminal work, the boundaries of the firm have

long been one of most challenging issues for researchers, and the auto industry has been one of

the most investigated industries.1 A seminal paper based on a transaction cost view of the firm

boundary is Monteverde and Teece (1982), which demonstrated transaction cost, which was

measured by engineering efforts and firm-specificity to design components, mattered for the

vertical integration decision by OEMs (GM and Ford)2. This paper extends their analysis in

three directions. First, for the dependent variable, in addition to the two choices (make internally

or buy from the market), we introduce the third choice, “buy from affiliated (“keiretsu”)

suppliers.” This sourcing from keiretsu seems to be a good example of relational contracting,

which earlier literature on transaction cost economics does not pay much attention (see

Williamson (1975)), but the importance of which is now well recognized (see Williamson

(1985) and Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2002)). Since keiretsu sourcing accounts for a major

part of the component procurements by Japanese auto industry (more than 50% of the

procurements of the components under this study for Toyota, Nissan and Honda), the dataset of

the Japanese auto industry provide unique opportunities for us to examine the choice of

integration and relational contracting simultaneously.

         Second, for independent variables, we introduce a set of new variables on component

characteristics based on their detailed survey3, to measure multiple dimensions of contracting

environment (the specificity, interdependency and testability of a component) and to strengthen

controls on missing variables (the complexity, safety, customer-value, and firm-standard of a

component). The availability of these new variables allows us to inquire new questions, for an

example, as to whether higher testability of a component enables more contracting choice for

supplying a component with high specificity. Third, we use a set of time series data of the

Japanese auto industry, which we have built up to cover the make-or-buy decisions of 7 OEMs

on 54 types of components for almost two decades from 1984 to 2002.

         The organization of this paper is the following. Section 2 provides theoretical

framework for the organizational and contract choice for the efficient supply of a component in

the automobile industry. Section 3 describes econometric model and data, and section 4 presents

estimation results. Section 5 concludes.

2. Theoretical Framework

In this section we present a (reduced form) theoretical framework for the organizational and

contract choice for efficient supply of a component in the automobile industry, drawing on the

insights from the transaction cost economics (see Williamson (1975, 1985)) and the property

rights theory(see Grossman and Hart (1986)), so as to derive testable propositions. Efficient

coordination of design activities between an OEM and a component supplier, the quality

assurance of the components manufactured, and their low cost are the important determinants

for the efficiency of component supply. In the case of automobile industry, efficient

coordination with an OEM in design is a particularly important factor, since an automobile is a

system product, the performance of which depends critically on how much each key component

is designed in an integrative manner for a particular vehicle model. On the same ground, the

quality assurance in manufacturing is critical, since a failure of one key component can make

the entire automobile non-functional. To achieve efficiency in these terms, an OEM has the



                                              3
organizational choice between integration and non-integration as well as the contract choice

between non-keiretsu (short-term4) contracting and keiretsu (relational or long-term) contracting

(see Figure 1, which is based on Baker, Gibbons and Murphy (2002))5.

                                   (Figure 1)

           Formally, let us denote integration or make choice by the combination of y=1 and z=0,

keiretsu or relational contracting choice by y=0 and z=1, and the market (or non-keiretsu)

contracting choice by y=0 and z=0. We hypothesize that higher design specificity (s) of a

component as well as higher interdependency ( θ ) between the component and the other

components in design would increase the value of vertical integration of that component

production. High design specificity would involve the tangible or intangible investment specific

to the OEM by the supplier, which is subject to hold-up risk. High interdependency in design

would require frequent and extensive negotiations with a supplier when an OEM wishes to

change the design of its components, which would not be contractible ex-ante. Vertical

integration has advantages in promoting relation-specific investment and for accommodating

non-contractible design changes (see Bajari and Tadelis (2001) and Tadelis (2002)). Sourcing

from keiretsu would have a similar but attenuated effect on the value of the component, since

design change, for an example, will still involve negotiations between two firms. Thus, we

hypothesize that the value of a component net of design cost is enhanced by vertical integration

or keiretsu sourcing, the degree of which increases with the specificity and interdependency of

the component:

v ( y , z; s, θ , t ) = v 0 + a (1 + β 1 s + β 2θ + β 3 sθ )( y + μz ) + ε            (1)

4
  Most contracts with non-keiretsu suppliers are long-term (continues for more than 10 years), but
could be regarded as shorter-term (higher probability of discontinuity of transaction) in comparison
with those with keiretsu suppliers.
5
  There is a potential choice of spot employment. Although such possibility may also be important,
we do not consider this choice in this paper.



                                                         4
, where v0 > 0, a > 0, β 1 > 0, β 2 > 0 , 0 < μ < 1 and ε is a random variable. We may

expect β 3 > 0 , given that the marginal effect of interdependency is likely to be larger, the

higher the specificity of the component is.

           The cost function for the component supply consists of the manufacturing cost and the

quality assurance cost net of the value from quality improvement. The manufacturing cost is

given by

                                    c0 + c1 ( y + κz )                          (2)

, which is the highest when integration is chosen ( c0 + c1 ), reflecting the effect of the loss of

ownership interest in cost reduction (internal procurement is cost-based). Sourcing from a

keiretsu supplier would also provide smaller incentive for cost-reduction, compared to sourcing

from the market, due to limited competition ( o < κ < 1 ).

           The cost of quality assurance would matter especially when the testability of the

component is low and the component is specific to the OEM. We assume that as testability

improves (the cost of testing becomes lower), the cost of quality assurance declines to zero. For

a given level of testability, the cost of quality assurance would be higher for a spot supplier

which would have the motivation to reduce the quality of the component to be supplied when it

is effective for saving cost. A relational contracting could constrain the incentive for such

quality-degradation, since once such conduct would be uncovered, the rent from long-term

relationship would be lost (Shapiro (1983)). In vertical integration, the provision of a strong

incentive to an employee for cost-reduction would not be used, so as to avoid creating an

incentive for compromising quality due to multitasking (Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) for a

theory and Slade (1996) for an empirical analysis). Given these considerations, we can

hypothesize that the cost of quality assurance increases with specificity, declines with testability

and is reduced by vertical integration or relational contracting:



                                                  5
            c 2 (1 + λs ){1 − δ ( y + ρz )} / t                                  (3)

with δ , ρ > 0 , with ρ indicating the efficiency of keiretsu relative to vertical integration for

quality assurance.

            Finally, we take into account the quality improvement based on the collaboration

between a supplier (gathering information useful for quality improvement) and an OEM (its

implementation) 6. We assume that a vertically integrated supplier does not engage in voluntary

efforts for gathering information for quality improvement, due to its weak incentive for such

information exploration (the assignment of the patent right of an employee inventor to a firm in

Agion and Tirole (1994) and the absence of recourse when the upstream party reneges in Baker,

Gibbons and Murphy (2002)). A supplier external to the OEM would have an incentive to do

such information exploration. In addition, such information can be more easily shared with the

OEM when it is a keiretsu supplier than when it is an independent supplier, since relational

contracting enables non-contractible efforts being rewarded ex-post. In addition, we assume that

high testability of the component would create more opportunities for a supplier to discover

information useful for improving the quality of the component. Given these considerations, the

value of quality improvement enabled by the information discovered by a supplier is given by

            bt (1 − y + φz ) ,                                                                        (4)

with b, φ > 0 .

            The efficient organizational and contractual choice is given by

Maxy,z w = v ( y , z; s, θ , t ) − c( y , z; s, θ , t )

              = v 0 + a (1 + β 1 s + β 2θ + β 3θs )( y + μz ) + ε

                − [c0 + c1 ( y + κz ) + c2 (1 + λs ){1 − δ ( y + ρz )} / t ] + bt (1 − y + φz ) + η   (5)

  See Barzel (1982) for the effects of measurement cost on the choice of organizational or
contractual choice. Also see Baker and Hubbard (2003) for the effects of information availability on
the choice of organizational or contractual choice.

, where η is a random variable. The choices are over vertical integration, keiretsu and market:

(y,z)={(1,0),(0,1), (0,0)}. Given the above analytical framework, we can derive the following

three propositions on the effects of component characteristics on organizational and contractual

choice, using sourcing from keiretsu as the base.




Proposition 1 (Effect of Specificity)

We would observe more vertical integration relative to keiretsu sourcing and more keiretsu

sourcing relative to market sourcing for a component with higher specificity (s). These effects

decline with testability.

(Proof)   We have

          ∂ 2 w / ∂s∂y = a( β 1 + β 3θ ) + c 2 λδ / t > 0                              (6.1)


          ∂ 2 w / ∂s∂z = a( β 1 + β 3θ ) μ + c 2 λδρ / t > 0                            (6.2)

Subtracting, we have

          ∂ 2 w / ∂s∂y − ∂ 2 w / ∂s∂z = a( β 1 + β 3θ )(1 − μ ) + c 2 λδ (1 − ρ ) / t > 0   (6.3).

Proposition 2 (Effect of interdependency)

We would observe more vertical integration relative to keiretsu and more keiretsu sourcing

relative to market sourcing for a component with higher interdependency ( θ ).These effects of

interdependency would increase with specificity (s).

(Proof) We have the following results for the effect of interdependency ( θ ).

          ∂ 2 w / ∂θ∂y = a ( β 2 + β 3 s ) > 0                            (7.1)


          ∂ 2 w / ∂θ∂z = a( β 2 + β 3 s ) μ > 0                            (7.2)

Proposition 3 (Effect of Testability)




                                                    7
We would observe less vertical integration relative to keiretsu as the testability of the component

increases. We can observe more keiretsu sourcing relative to market sourcing as the testability

of the component increases if the quality improvement based on information sharing effect is

important.

(Proof) ∂ 2 w / ∂t∂y = − c2 (1 + λs )δ / t 2 − b < 0                                   (8.1)

          ∂ 2 w / ∂t∂z = −c 2 (1 + λs )δρ / t 2 + bφ                                    (8.2)

          ∂ 2 w / ∂t∂y − ∂ 2 w / ∂t∂z = −c2 (1 + λs )(1 − ρ )δ / t 2 − b(1 + φ ) < 0     (8.3)




          We can depict the choice for each combination of the component characteristics in the

parameter space. The dividing lines for choices are characterized in the following manner,

assuming their existence.

The dividing line between vertical integration and keiretsu (V-K line):

a(1 + β1 s + β 2θ + β 3θs)(1 − μ ) + c 2 (1 + λs){δ (1 − ρ ) / t} − bt (1 + φ ) = c1 (1 − κ ) (9.1),

The dividing line between keiretsu and market (K-M line):

a(1 + β1 s + β 2θ + β 3θs) μ + c 2 (1 + λs)(δρ / t ) + btφ = c1κ                                (9.2),

The dividing line between market and vertical integration (M-V line):

a (1 + β1 s + β 2θ + β 3θs ) + c2 (1 + λs )δ / t − bt = c1                                       (9.3)

          Figure 2 and 3 provide two examples of the patterns of choices with specificity and

interdependency represented by horizontal and vertical axes (assuming a given testability).

Since the specificity and interdependency of a component enhance the value of vertical

integration more than that of keiretsu over market sourcing (that is, 0 < μ < 1 ), we may expect

a monotonic change of the choices from market to keiretsu, and then to vertical integration as

the specificity and interdependency of a component increases. This would be indeed the case

when keiretsu’s relative advantage in enhancing the value of design is larger than its relative



                                                       8
manufacturing cost disadvantage ( μ > κ ) and the effects of organizational choice on quality

assurance and on sharing new information on quality improvement are negligible ( δ = b = 0 ).

In such case, the choices over three organizational choices are monotonically sorted by either

specificity or interdependency, as in Figure 2, since the two lines (V-K line and K-B line) are

parallel to each other.

                                (Figure 2)

          More generally, however, such monotonic relationship does not hold. We may observe

a jump from market sourcing to vertical integration as specificity or interdependency increases.

For simplicity, let us assume that quality assurance is important ( δ > 0 ) and keiretsu and

vertical integration can equally achieve the efficiency of quality assurance ( ρ = 1 ) and there is

no effect of information sharing ( b = 0 ). In this case the dividing line between vertical

integration and keiretsu (V-K line) does not shift as δ increases. However, the dividing line

between market and keiretsu (K-M line) rotates in the clock-wise in Figure 3. As a result, the

choice can make a “jump” from market sourcing to vertical integration in the region where

specificity is low and interdependency is high as either variable has a higher value.           As

testability increases, the keiretsu region may expand in both upward and downward directions,

due to increasing contractibility and increasing value of information sharing (see (8.3) and

(8.2)).

                                 (Figure 3)

3. Econometric Model and Data

In light of the above three propositions, we evaluate the choice of the three modes of component

transactions between 7 Japanese OEMs and their suppliers (including in-house divisions) with

respect to 54 major components (see Table A2 in the Appendix) for 7 every-three years from

1984 to 2002. The independent variables on the engineering characteristics of the components



                                                9
are constructed from a questionnaire survey of the automobile engineers at four Japanese OEMs

on the detailed characteristics of the components (see Table A3 in the Appendix).A detailed

description and the sources of the data are provided in Appendix 1, including how these variables

were measured.

            The basic econometric model we employ is the multinomial logistic model with the

dominant choice of each OEM firm i in procuring a component j in time t among the three

alternative transaction modes (vertical integration, keiretsu sourcing, market sourcing7) as the

dependent variable. We also report the results based on the ordinary least squares focusing on

the choice of two alternatives in terms of the difference of procurement shares (vertical

integration vs. keiretsu sourcing, and keiretsu sourcing vs. market sourcing) in Appendix 2. As

shown in Figure 4, a firm often combines two or even three modes in procuring a component.

For an example, 22% of the procurements involve both keiretsu sourcing and market sourcing,

and 3% of the contracts involve all three modes. However, we have specified only one of them

as the primary choice which is the transaction mode that supplies most, following Monteverde

and Teece (1982). We use the choice of keiretsu sourcing as the base and evaluate the

determinants of the choices of market sourcing and vertical integration relative to keiretsu

sourcing in our multinomial estimation, to be consistent with the above propositions.

                              (Figure 4)

            Firm i chooses one of the three organizational or contract choices for each component

j for year t, according to the following probability function:

Pr(choicei , j ,t ) = f ( specificity j , int erdependency j , testability j , crosstermsi ,
                                                                                               (10)

Since our data of the component characteristics are available for only recent years (survey was

    See Appendix 1 for the operational definition of keiretsu suppliers.

conducted in 2003 and 2004. Note, however, that these characteristics change only gradually

over time), the estimation is essentially cross-section, although we do have the variations of the

organizational or contract choices of each component and that of production volume of the

OEMs over time.

          Our primary explanatory variables are specificity, interdependency, and testability.

The variable specificity constructed from the questionnaire survey indicates how the design

criteria and the interfaces of the component is specific to the firm 8 . The variable

interdependency indicates the degree of relatedness with the other components in terms of

design, structure, function, and manufacturing. The variable testability represents how easily the

component can be tested as a stand-alone object, and whether it can be developed and

experimented on the stand-alone basis.

          Let us move on to control variables, which may affect the contractual or organizational

choice and have correlation with the above independent variables. We introduce four variables

indicating the characteristics of components as well as two variables indicating the scale and

stability of OEMs’ production, in addition to firm and year fixed effects (dummies). The

variable complexity indicates the level of technology used for the component, the speed of the

relevant technological changes, and the level of professional knowledge used for the design, and

the complexity of the component itself. The technologically sophisticated complex component

may be still outsourced if the OEM does not have the technological capability to design and

manufacture it (an example is car audio equipment). This variable controls such negative

correlation between the complexity and sourcing of a component, based on a division of labor.

The variable safety indicates how important the component is for the safety of the car, the

8
  The variable specificity is defined by (6 - the degree of industry-wide standardization). The latter
variable indicates how the interface of the component is clearly specified and how design
specifications are standardized in the industry as a whole, as shown in Appendix Table A3.



                                                 11
variable customer-value indicates the value of the component (price cost margin) and its

contribution to the marketability of the automobile. The variable firm-standard indicates the

level of standardization of the interface, technology, manufacturing method, and design

standards within a firm.

         In addition, we use the level as well as the change of the total volume of vehicle

production of the OEM. The former is included to examine how the degree of scale economy of

an OEM might affect the choice. The latter (annual change (%) in production volume on the

average over the previous three years) is included to examine how the OEM may use the choice

to adjust for the change of production volume. Finally, we use 6 firm dummies and 6 year

dummies to control firm level and year level fixed effects. We also introduce firm by year

dummies for robustness check.

         Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for these variables. Figure 5 depicts how the

choice evolved over time in the industry as a whole in terms of simple arithmetic average of the

choices over the entire sample components. The share of vertical integration as the dominant

choice was around 8.8% in 1984 and gradually declined to 5.6% in 2002. Keiretsu sourcing

accounted for around one third of the total procurements (35% in 1984 and 36% in 2002), and

market sourcing accounted for 55 % to 61%. Figure 6 shows the relations between the choice

and the three primary independent variables. It shows that the share of both vertical integration

and keiretsu sourcing increases with specificity and interdependency. The share of market

sourcing increases with testability, although this variable have significant negative correlations

with specificity and interdependency (see Table A4)9. Figure 7 shows the variation of these

choices among 7 sample OEM firms with the size of their production volumes. It is clear that


9 As will be later shown, the partial positive correlation between market sourcing and
testability is reversed in the regression model with multiple independent variables.

the share of keiretsu sourcing increases with the production volume, while such relationship is

not observed for the share of vertical integration.

                       (Table 1, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7)

4. Estimation Results

Table 2 presents two basic estimations, with or without the interaction terms between specificity

and testability and between specificity and interdependency. We use robust standard errors, to

address potential heteroskedasticity. As shown in Model 1, the coefficients of both specificity

and interdependency have expected signs and significant coefficients, consistent with

Proposition 1 and 2. Market sourcing is significantly less preferred to keiretsu sourcing for a

component with high specificity (s) or high interdependency ( θ ). Simultaneously, vertical

integration is preferred to keiretsu sourcing when interdependency or specificity is important

(although the latter effect is significant only at 10% level). In addition, the coefficient of

interdependency is more than five times larger for the choice between vertical integration and

keiretsu sourcing than the choice between market and keiretsu sourcing, while the coefficient of

specificity is more than two times larger for the choice between vertical integration and keiretsu

sourcing than the choice between market and keiretsu sourcing. Thus, specificity is a more

important consideration for the choice between market and keiretsu sourcing, while

interdependency is more an important consideration for the choice between vertical integration

and keiretsu sourcing. This suggests that the hold-up risk due to specific investment can be

often effectively controlled by a relational contracting based on keiretsu sourcing, while

accommodating non-contractible design changes may often require vertical integration.

         As for the variable testability, it does not have a significant coefficient for the choice

between vertical integration and keiretsu choice as implied by Proposition 3, but it has a

significantly negative coefficient for the choice between market sourcing and keiretsu sourcing,



                                                 13
implying that a firm prefers keiretsu sourcing to market sourcing significantly more, the higher

the testability of the component. One interpretation for this result is that an OEM firm may

prefer using keiretsu sourcing when the testability of the component is high, since the

procurement of such component can provide large opportunities for a supplier to obtain useful

information for promoting quality improvement and such information can be more easily shared

with a keiretsu supplier than with a non-affiliated supplier. A keiretsu supplier may have both

the incentive to gather information for quality improvement enabled by the high testability of

the component and to share the information with the OEM for its implementation.

         Let us turn to the coefficients of control variables. Complexity and safety promote the

choice of keiretsu sourcing over both integration and market sourcing, although the effect of

complexity on the choice between market and keiretsu is not significant. The quality of a

component important for safety can generate significant externality for the other components,

providing a reason for vertical integration. However, placing the supplier of such component

within an OEM may dilute an incentive for safety due to multi-tasking. In this regard, the

keiretsu supplier may have an advantage. On the other hand, customer-value promotes

integration over keiretsu sourcing, and market sourcing over keiretsu. Firm-standard promote

keiretsu sourcing over integration and over market sourcing, although the latter effect is not

significant. Since standardization within a firm would facilitate the development of the

documentations for specifications, it would enhance the contracting-out. Finally, the production

volume favors keiretsu sourcing over market sourcing, which indicates the importance of the

economy of scale for keiretsu production.

         As for firm dummies, a larger automobile manufacturer (Toyota, Nissan and Honda)

prefers keiretsu sourcing over market sourcing, even though the production volume is controlled.

This may indicate a non-linearity of the effects of the production volume or other firm-specific



                                              14
effects. As for the choice between vertical integration and keiretsu sourcing, Honda

exceptionally disfavors integration. As for time dummies, we observe tendency toward keiretsu

sourcing: increasing choice of keiretsu sourcing over both vertical integration and market

sourcing (except for the choice between market sourcing over keiretsu in year 200210).

         Let us turn to Model 2 with the interaction terms. Let us start with the interaction

between specificity and testability. What the coefficient of the interaction term suggests is that

while the specificity of a component favors vertical integration over keiretsu sourcing and

keiretsu sourcing over market sourcing when testability is low, such preference declines as the

testability of a component increases even though the relationship is not reversed. These results

are consistent with the view that higher testability enables outsourcing even if the component is

specific (see Proposition 1). As for the interaction between interdependency and specificity, it is

not significant for either choice. The signs of the coefficients suggest that the interaction term

tends to weaken the individual effects of specificity and interdependency, which is not

consistent with their complementary effects. These results may reflect non-linearity (decreasing

returns) of these individual effects. As for the control variables and the other variables, the

estimation results are very similar to those for Model 1.

         Models3 to Model 5 of Table 3 inquire the robustness of the basic findings of Table 2.

Model 3 uses only the cross section data of year 2002. Since our data on the engineering

characteristics of the components are available only for recent years, using these data for much

earlier years may cause biased estimates. The estimation results of Model 3, however, are highly

consistent with those of Model 1. Specificity and interdependency promotes vertical integration

over keiretsu sourcing, and specificity and testability promotes keiretsu sourcing over market


10
   In the late 1990s some OEMs, such as Nissan and Mazda, discontinued their keiretsu relations
with some suppliers by selling their stocks of the former keiretsu firms.



                                                15
sourcing. Model 4 introduces the firm by year dummies, so as to control time variant missing

variables at firm levels better, such as the potential changes of the engineering capability of an

OEM firm over time. The estimation results, including the sizes of the estimated coefficients,

are very similar to those of Model 1, suggesting that the combination of firm fixed effects, the

time dummies and the level as well as the change of the production volumes of the OEMs

effectively control the time variant missing variables at firm levels.

         Finally, Model 5 uses the sample of only three biggest OEMs of Japan: Toyota, Nissan

and Honda. These firms are different from the other smaller OEMs in the sense that they have

well developed keiretsu-supplier network (see Figure 7), so that they have more freedom and

flexibility to choose the best organizational and contractual mode of component procurements.

On the other hand, the other firms may have no choice but to use the keiretsu firms of three

biggest OEMs (market sourcing by these other firms) , since their supplier networks are limited.

The estimation results of Model 5 are, however，highly consistent with those of Model 1, with

respect to the effects of specificity, interdependency and testability. Specificity has become

insignificant for the choice between vertical integration and keiretsu sourcing, suggesting that

specificity does not matter for that choice by a firm with a well developed keiretsu network. The

variable interdependency remains highly significant and has larger coefficients. Appendix 2

shows the estimation results which focus on the choices in term of two alternatives and on the

difference of their procurement shares. That is, we use the difference of the share of vertical

integration and that of keiretsu sourcing as a dependent variable, focusing on the sample of the

procurements involving no market sourcing, and the difference of the share of keiretsu sourcing

and that of market sourcing as another dependent variable, focusing on the sample of the

procurements using no vertical integration. The results for three key variables are very similar

(See Table A5).



                                                 16
5. Conclusions and Discussions

We have assessed the determinants of the choice among vertical integration, sourcing from

keiretsu and sourcing from the market of 54 components by seven Japanese automobile

manufacturers (OEMs) in light of contract economics for 7 every-three years from 1984 to

2002.Our major findings are the following. First, consistent with transaction cost economics, the

interdependency and (much lesser degree) specificity of a component make vertical integration

preferred to keiretsu sourcing. Both of them also make the sourcing from keiretsu preferred to

market sourcing. Second, interdependency is a significantly more important consideration for

the choice between vertical integration and keiretsu sourcing than the choice between market

and keiretsu sourcing, while the reverse is the case for specificity. This suggests that the hold-up

risk due to specific investment can be often effectively controlled by a relational contracting

based on keiretsu sourcing, while accommodating non-contractible design changes may often

require vertical integration.

          Third, we have found that higher testability of a component significantly makes the

effects of specificity smaller, consistent with the view that high testability of an output enables

contracting of a component even with high design specificity. Separate from this effect, higher

testability of a component also makes a firm prefer keiretsu sourcing over market sourcing. One

interpretation of this result is that an OEM firm may prefer using keiretsu sourcing when the

testability of the component is high, since the procurement of such component can provide large

opportunities for a supplier to obtain useful information for promoting quality improvement and

such information can be more easily shared with a keiretsu supplier than with a non-affiliated

supplier. A keiretsu supplier may have both the incentive to gather information for quality

improvement in the environment of high testability of the component and to share the

information with the OEM for its implementation.



                                                17
         Our empirical analysis also indicates several other interesting observations on the

structure of supplier system. Larger volume production by an OEM and more standardization

within the firm promote keiretsu sourcing both over market sourcing and over vertical

integration, which may indicate the importance of the economy of scale and scope base for the

development of keiretsu network. In addition, the scale of an OEM does not affect the share of

the components supplied by in-house suppliers. Furthermore, safety concern promotes the

choice of keiretsu sourcing over both market sourcing and vertical integration.

         There are, however, several remaining issues. First, we do not consider the value of

multiple mode procurement policy. We have simply assumed that there is a single best mode of

procurement for each component, even though multiple mode procurement policy may be the

optimal policy. An OEM takes into account the importance of preserving procurement

competition in selecting suppliers. Second, we have assumed the exogeneity of the engineering

characteristics of the components, which are constructed from the surveys on the engineers of

four OEMs. However, we may expect that these characteristics are affected by the

organizational or contract characteristics, e.g. whether a supplier is vertically integrated or not.

Third, further analysis would be needed to search for the optimal boundary of firms, with

respect to creation of new information and innovation. Our analysis suggests a view that a

keiretsu system may have a certain advantage in generating the incentives for both autonomous

innovation and collaboration with an OEM. An interesting question would be how the keiretsu

system would survive in the environment of “open” innovation.

1. Sources

            The data on component transactions between Japanese OEMs and suppliers were

compiled from “Jidosha Buhin 200 Hinmoku Seisan-Ryutsu Chosa [Report on Production and

Transactions of 200 Auto Components]”, published every three years by IRC, a Japanese market

research company. The report provides the information on which OEMs purchased how much

(in volume) of each component from which suppliers, including in-house divisions, for their

domestic operation for the year (see Table A1 for an example), covering approximately 200

types of components. We analyze seven OEMs (Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki,

Daihatsu, and Fuji Heavy Industry), all of which have manufactured mainly passenger cars and

light trucks. Other Japanese OEMs that have manufactured heavy trucks are not included in our

analysis.

            Among about 200 components, we picked up 54 components that were covered by the

report throughout the period we analyzed (from 1984 to 200). Table A2 lists the components

included in the dataset.

            To measure the characteristics of these components, a questionnaire survey was

carried out with four Japanese OEMs (anonymous due to our confidential agreement). The

survey was conducted between winter 2003 and summer 2004 jointly by Kentaro Nobeoka

(Kobe University), Seiji Manabe (Yokohama National University), and Akira Takeishi. The

engineers from four firms answered for each of the 54 components the questions about various

dimensions of component characteristics mostly based on 5-point Likert-scale (See Table A3 for

the questions to measure each variable of component characteristics).

2. Definition of Keiretsu Suppliers

         As for the definition of keiretsu suppliers, we use the definition by IRC, whose report

shows if a particular supplier is a keiretsu supplier of a particular OEM. According to IRC,

while the financial tie (stock ownership) is the most important factor to define keiretsu

relationships, other factors such as sales dependency, director dispatch, and historical

relationships, are also taken into consideration. For example, even without financial tie, a

supplier is heavily dependent in sales for a long period upon a particular OEM and the industry

generally sees the supplier as a keiretsu supplier of the OEM, it is a keiretsu supplier of the

OEM in IRC’s definition. Although IRC does not have an objective, well-defined definition of

keiretsu suppliers, we think their definition captures well the actual perceptions shared by

practitioners in the industry, which should be relevant in the make-or-buy decisions by OEMs.

To define and use alternative, more objective definition is one of the next steps we would like to

take in the future (see, for example, Lincoln, Gerlach, and Takahashi 1992 for discussion of

Japanese keiretsu networks).

Appendix 2.        Estimation results focusing on the choices over two alternatives in terms of the

difference of procurement shares

This appendix reports the results of the estimations using the ordinary least squares model on the choice over

two alternatives: that between vertical integration and keiretsu sourcing and that between keiretsu sourcing

and market sourcing. The motivation for this exercise is that a firm may not have three alternatives for its

choice. In addition, we use the difference of the shares of two alternatives in procurements, rather than a

binary variable as dependent variables:

           There are two dependent variables: (1) the difference between the internal procurement share and

the keiretsu sourcing share by firm i in time t for the component j which does not use market sourcing

( VIKRi , j ,t ) and (2) the difference between the market procurement share and the keiretsu sourcing share by


firm i in time t for the component j which does not use vertical integration ( MRKRi , j ,t ):


VIKRi , j ,t / MRKRi , j ,t = g ( specificity j , int erdependency j , testatibility j , crosstermsi ,
                                                                                                         (a.1)
controlsi ,t , firmdummiesi , yeardummiest , ε i , j ,t )

           As shown in Table A5, the results are very similar to those in Table 2, as far as the coefficients for

three key variables are concerned.
