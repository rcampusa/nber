        Explicit deposit insurance has been spreading rapidly in recent years, even to countries with low
levels of financial and institutional development. Economic theory indicates that deposit-insurance design
features interact--for good or ill--with country-specific elements of the financial and governmental
contracting environment. This paper documents the extent of cross-country differences in deposit-
insurance design and reviews empirical evidence on how particular design features affect private market
discipline, banking stability, financial development, and the effectiveness of crisis resolution. This
evidence challenges the wisdom of encouraging countries to adopt explicit deposit insurance without first
stopping to assess and remedy weaknesses in their informational and supervisory environments.

1. Introduction

           During the last two decades, a wave of systemic banking crises has rolled back

and forth around the globe. The wave has struck developed and developing countries

alike, resulting in 112 episodes of systemic crisis in 93 countries and 51 episodes of

borderline crisis in 46 countries (Figure 1).1

           Proliferation of large-scale banking crises is disruptive and costly. Depositors

lose access to their funds, good borrowers can lose access to credit and even be forced

into bankruptcy, and some sound banks may be driven out of business. Would-be issuers

of debt and equity instruments find that markets have dried up. And taxpayers are

typically presented with a large bill for mitigating these disruptions. The full costs of

these crises go beyond direct fiscal costs to include such consequences as derailed

stabilization programs, growth slowdowns and increased poverty. Still, total fiscal costs

incurred in the 1997 Thai and Korean crises exceeded 30 percent of GDP, and in

Indonesia budgetary costs approached 50 percent of GDP.2

            When a crisis spreads beyond the banking sector, it triggers a full-fledged

financial crisis. The most recent example of this is Turkey where weaknesses in the

banking system triggered a crisis of confidence in other domestic financial institutions

and led to a large-scale flight of foreign capital and a severe currency crisis.

            Both to make systemic breakdowns less likely and to limit the disruption and

fiscal costs generated when they occur, in every country policymakers erect a financial

safety net. A country's safety net comprises a collection of disruption-mitigating

financial policies. These policies include implicit and explicit deposit insurance, lender-

of-last-resort facilities at the central bank, specified procedures for investigating and

resolving bank insolvencies, strategies for regulating and supervising banks, and

provisions for accessing emergency assistance from multinational institutions such as the

IMF.

           Among safety net policies, the use of explicit deposit insurance has spread rapidly

in recent years. Figure 2 shows that during the last 26 years the number of countries

offering explicit deposit insurance guarantees has almost tripled. Establishing a system

of explicit deposit insurance guarantees has become a principal feature of policy advice

on financial architecture that outside experts give to developing countries (see Folkerts-

Landau and Lindgren, 1997; and Garcia, 1999). In 1994, deposit insurance was

incorporated into the newly created single banking market of the European Union.

Today, most OECD countries and an increasing number of developing countries feature

some form of explicit depositor protection.

           It is not hard to see why explicit deposit insurance schemes appeal to

policymakers. In the short run, since no immediate budgetary expenditure needs to be

booked, they represent a seemingly costless solution to problems of bank runs or panics.

Besides stabilizing the financial sector, an insurance scheme offers political benefits:

protecting small depositors and improving opportunities for small banks to compete with

larger institutions for deposits.

           Mostly dismissed or denigrated by policymakers but long-recognized and

persistently emphasized by the academics, is the fact that explicit deposit insurance has

the potential to increase bank risk-taking. Because it reduces the incentive of depositors

to monitor banks, deposit insurance can encourage excessive risk-taking – i.e., create

moral hazard, and reward imprudent banking practices. But perhaps one of the most

persuasive arguments in favor of establishing explicit deposit insurance is that it can be

presented as a way to limit the government’s commitment to depositors. Lacking

coverage limits built into an explicit insurance system, depositors may expect to exert

enough political pressure to force taxpayers to supply unlimited deposit guarantees ex

post. Such expectations generate moral hazard too.

        The U.S. was the first country to introduce a national deposit insurance system.

Its goal was to restore confidence in the liquidity of bank deposits rather than to protect

small depositors (Golembe, 1960). Indeed, other means of protecting small depositors

had long been recognized. For example, in Europe, savings banks maintained liquidity

by investing in safe instruments. After decades of debate and largely adverse experience

with moral hazard in state-level schemes, federal deposit insurance was enacted in 1933,

in the midst of a banking crisis. For the first four decades after its establishment, the

absence of failures among large institutions fostered the illusion that deposit insurance is

a low cost way of preventing banking crises. But the ripening of the Savings and Loan

insurance mess in the 1980s dispelled this illusion, revealing how substantially deposit

insurance had exposed taxpayers to loss from risk-taking at insured institutions.

        Modern theorists view deposit insurance design as a multiparty principal-agent

contracting problem (Kane, 1995; Calomiris, 1996). Contracting parties consist of banks,

depositors, supervisors, politicians, and taxpayers. Events that generate losses for insured

institutions obligate taxpayers to supply risk capital only when weaknesses in supervisory

efforts at loss control allow an institution’s losses to surpass the value of its stockholder-

contributed net worth. To reduce the chances of future taxpayer losses, authorities in


crisis. See World Bank (2001).

                                               4
developed countries have since agreed to impose risk-based capital standards and to

recalibrate these standards when and as regulation-induced innovation undermines their

effectiveness. In the U.S., The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

Improvement Act of 1991 goes even further, imposing on U.S. regulators a duty to act

promptly to resolve violations of capital standards. In 1993, Congress offered U.S.

taxpayers additional protection by passing the Depositor Preference Act, which in future

bank liquidations subordinates the claims of non-deposit creditors to those of the FDIC.

        Whether to adopt an explicit deposit insurance system and how to design it

depend on the financial and supervisory environment in which it must function. Given

the potential trade-off between stability and moral hazard, empirical guidance from cross-

country experience promises to be very useful. Figure 2 indicates that the policymakers

are moving ahead at an alarming rate. All too often experts that recommend deposit

insurance either assume countries have an appropriate institutional infrastructure or

ignore the impact of imperfections in their contracting environments.

        Expert advice needs to be grounded in carefully interpreted cross-country

empirical evidence. However, an empirical database on which to test policy advice was

slow to emerge. A recent World Bank research project developed such a database for

researchers worldwide and answered questions about how explicit deposit insurance

affects financial stability, how markets discipline bank risk-taking, and the development

of the overall financial system.3

        The purpose of this paper is twofold: to challenge the wisdom of encouraging

countries to adopt deposit insurance without first remedying observable weaknesses in

their institutional environment and to buttress this challenge by reviewing cross-country

empirical evidence on the effects of deposit insurance. The next section characterizes the

data set and uses it to summarize the extent of cross-country differences in deposit

insurance design. Section 3 explains why cross-country differences in design are

appropriate and that differences in the informational and contracting environments of

individual countries are bound to affect the optimal design. Section 4 summarizes

empirical evidence on the impact of deposit insurance. Section 5 develops policy

implications.



2. Deposit Insurance Around the World

        Table 1 documents the many ways in which deposit-insurance design varies

across countries.4 An optimal worldwide blueprint is not likely to be found. For

example, account coverage varies from unlimited guarantees to tight coverage limits. On

the one hand, Mexico, Turkey and Japan promise 100 percent depositor coverage.

However, countries like Chile, Switzerland, and U.K. cover only an amount of deposits

that is actually less than their per capita GDP. Also, although many countries cover

deposits denominated in foreign currency, most schemes exclude interbank deposits.

Besides setting a maximum level of coverage, some countries insist that accountholders

"coinsure" a proportion of their deposit balances. Coinsurance provisions are still

relatively rare, but are more frequent in recently adopted schemes.

by Kyei (1995) and Garcia (1999).

                                                   6
       Deposit insurance obligations are typically advance-funded, most commonly from

a mixture of government and bank sources. To allow the insurer to build and maintain an

appropriate fund of reserves against its loss exposures, in such countries banks are

generally assessed an annual premium that is based entirely or in large part on the amount

of their insured deposits. Efforts to make these annual premiums sensitive to bank risk

exposure have begun in recent years.

       Insurance schemes are typically managed in a government agency or in a public-

private partnership. However, a few countries, such as Switzerland, Germany and

Argentina, manage their schemes privately. Finally, in almost all countries, membership

is compulsory for chartered banks. The most notable exception is Switzerland.

       Table 1 also records the establishment dates of each country’s scheme. A

number of countries adopted or expanded their deposit insurance scheme during crises.

For example, Thailand, Malaysia, and Korea moved to blanket coverage in response to

their recent crises. The 1990s saw a rapid spread in transitional countries – perhaps

partly motivated by their long-term interest in joining the EU – and in some African

countries. Countries that adopted deposit insurance in 1999 are Ecuador, El Salvador,

and as part of the Central African Currency Union, Cameroon, Central African Republic,

Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. Most of these new schemes

show generous coverage levels. For example, Central African Republic and Chad have

coverage ratios that lie between 13 and 15 times their GDP per capita.

       Precisely because the range of design features is so extensive, the data set can

permit analysts to compare and contrast how well different features work in different

circumstances. Section 4 of this paper summarizes the implications of research that uses

this database to make inferences about key deposit-insurance issues.

                                             7
3. Deposit Insurance Design: Can One Size Fit All?

       Figure 2 underscores the trend in adopting explicit deposit insurance. The identity

of the countries listed in Table 1 clarifies that the use of this policy instrument is growing

especially fast in developing countries. Whether this is a healthy trend depends on the

balance of deposit insurance costs and benefits in particular countries. In countries

whose governments have a strong system for collecting taxes or substantial access to

foreign credit, the primary benefit of establishing a deposit insurance scheme is to

eliminate the immediate threat of financial panic. Since all countries have a safety net,

where rigorous enforcement of coverage ceilings is feasible, deposit insurance can cap

the government’s future commitments to depositors of insolvent institutions. Similarly,

offering deposit insurance may allow a government to negotiate increased rights to

intervene in a timely fashion into the affairs of insolvent institutions. Protecting

unsophisticated small depositors and helping small banks to compete with large ones are

often categorized as secondary benefits.

       Besides the budgeted costs of running an insurance enterprise, adopting deposit

insurance generates unbudgeted indirect costs. The major indirect cost of deposit

insurance comes from its potential to subsidize inefficient types of bank risk-taking. The

danger that insurance will induce a willful increase in inappropriate risk-taking is called

moral hazard. The increase in risk-taking is described as willful because it responds to

the extent that a given scheme undermines pre-existing incentives of depositors to

                                              8
monitor and police bank risk-taking. To control taxpayers’ exposure to moral hazard, the

insurer must involve itself or surrogate parties in monitoring and disciplining banks. The

balance of benefits and costs engendered by individual deposit insurance features is

bound to vary with the character of insurer loss control and how this loss control interacts

with weaknesses in the informational and contracting environments of individual

countries.

        Kane (2000) emphasizes that controlling bank risk-taking requires transparency

and deterrency, and that assuring that an insurer acts efficiently requires accountability to

taxpayers for successes and failures. Complete transparency is obtained when institutions

disclose information that perfectly and costlessly informs either bank creditors or

supervisors about changes in a bank's financial condition and risk-taking. Perfect

deterrency describes a situation where individual creditors or supervisors can

immediately understand the implications of information flows and can protect themselves

completely and costlessly from any adverse consequences. Perfect accountability occurs

when taxpayers can identify the actions of government officials and hold them fully

responsible for the outcomes their actions engender.

        Transparency, deterrency and accountability are dimensions of a country's

institutional environment. High readings on these dimensions assure that counterparties

in private and public sectors can enforce appropriate bank behavior by evaluating bank

activities, disciplining their risk-taking, and resolving their financial difficulties promptly.

Around the globe, large differences exist in each of these contracting features. Across

countries and cultures, proxies for transparency, deterrency and accountability tend to

increase with per capita GDP (Kane, 2000), but other elements of social capital play a

role as well.

                                               9
       Safety nets seek to prevent social costs of financial disruption and government

intervention from exceeding the social benefits of damage mitigation. Safety-net design --

and deposit insurance arrangements in particular-- must address the particular weaknesses

that exist in the institutional environment of individual countries. Recognizing that

contracting environments tend to become more diverse as per capita income falls has two

consequences. First, it implies that recommending a single combination of "best-practice"

design features may generate counterproductive consequences in many developing

countries. Second, for countries in which transparency, deterrency and accountability are

very weak, implementing an efficient explicit deposit insurance scheme may simply be

impossible.

       Three central dimensions of every country's deposit-insurance system are: the

extent to which it relies on private management and/or private funding; the breadth of its

formal and informal coverages; and its susceptibility to hidden risk-shifting by insolvent

banks. In moving to a system of explicit guarantees, conscientious government officials

must adopt coverage, funding, and managerial structures that efficiently mitigate the

particular weaknesses in transparency, deterrency, and accountability that left their

country vulnerable to financial crises in the past.

       The harder it has been for depositors to observe the economic value of bank

capital and the character of bank risk-taking, the more important it becomes for regulators

to establish informative protocols for reporting the performance and financial condition

of insured banks. If the country's system of corporate governance previously gave

depositors few protections against risk shifting, officials must enact special deterrent

rights for the insurer. Finally, the less accountability the political system imposes on




                                              10
public officials generally, the more accountable deposit-insurance managers must be for

accurately measuring the incremental social value their activities produce.

       Historically, in environments that combine low transparency with low deterrency,

it has made sense to extend stockholder liability for bank losses beyond the amount of

paid-in capital in closely held banks (Kane and Wilson, 2001) and to make large

depositors and substantial nondeposit creditors effectively coinsure bank losses. In low-

accountability environments, deposit-insurance managers need contractual incentives to

optimize the degree of transparency and deterrency that they, minority shareholders, and

coinsuring depositors receive. In environments that are low in accountability and

transparency, private participation in funding and management can help to create the

incentives needed to discipline safety-net loss exposures. To the extent that insurer

performance can be measured meaningfully, it is useful to establish a fund of deferred

compensation for top managers with the payoffs tied to appropriate measures of deposit-

insurance performance during their particular term in office.

       As transparency, deterrency, and accountability evolve through time, so should

the design features of a country's safety net. To maintain efficiency over time, the system

must respond to fluctuations in private and government regulators' capacity for valuing

institutions, for disciplining risk-taking and resolving insolvencies promptly, and for

being appropriately rewarded or chastised for how well they perform these tasks.

       Kane (2000) also discusses the dangers of using blanket deposit guarantees as a

way of dealing with banking crises. In managing a crisis, the urgency of stopping a

panic must not be allowed to over-ride the need to identify hopelessly insolvent

institutions and cut off their opportunities to expand their risk-taking. To end a panic

efficiently, liquidity must be offered only to potentially solvent institutions.

                                              11
Indiscriminately issuing government guarantees and other forms of bailout support

rewards bad bankers and penalizes good ones. Because such a policy perverts market

discipline and risk-taking incentives and imposes unbooked obligations on the national

treasury, it promises new and deeper crises in years to come.



4. Deposit Insurance: Theory and Empirical Evidence

       An extensive theoretical literature analyzes the benefits and costs of deposit

insurance and explores the challenge of balancing these benefits and costs to produce an

optimal deposit-insurance system. This literature has been summarized by Kane (2000),

Calomiris (1996), and others.

       However, cross-country empirical evidence on the efficiency of real-world

deposit-insurance systems has been harder to come by. We begin this section by posing

four empirical questions whose answers indicate how effective an individual country's

deposit-insurance system happens to be. The four questions are:

•   How does deposit insurance affect bank stability?

•   How does deposit insurance affect market discipline?

•   How does deposit insurance impact financial development?

•   What role does deposit insurance play in managing crises?

We go on to identify pertinent literature bearing on each question and to review empirical

evidence on how the answer to each question varies across different countries and

contracting environments.



How does explicit deposit insurance affect bank stability?



                                            12
       In the midst of a systemic crisis, expanding or firming up depositor guarantees has

great appeal to policymakers as a crisis-mitigating device. However, the deferred costs

of treating a crisis myopically can be substantial. The best long-run way to incorporate

deposit insurance into a country's safety net is a matter of controversy among economists.

A classic paper by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) frames deposit insurance as an optimal

policy in a contracting environment where limited transparency allows bank stability to

be threatened by self-fulfilling depositor runs and runs on solvent banks are depositors'

only deterrent instrument for reducing their loss exposure. In Allen and Gale (1998),

greater transparency allows runs to be triggered only by an actual deterioration in bank

asset quality. In this higher-transparency environment, the optimal safety-net strategy is

to use central-bank loans to supply liquidity to the banking system.

       Precisely because safety nets are so effective in arresting runs, safety nets

generate moral hazard. This moral hazard comes both from banks and their regulators.

Opportunistic bankers can exploit weaknesses in supervisory transparency and deterrency

by taking inefficient risks and even engaging in fraudulent activity. In practice,

regulators and politicians who control the supervisory elements of the safety net often

have insufficient incentive to monitor and enforce prudential regulations. Kane (1989)

shows that regulatory activity encouraged risk-taking by insured thrift institutions during

the U.S. S&L debacle.

       Incentives for risk-shifting and looting by banks decline with bank capital and

with transparency, deterrency, and accountability. Transparency and bank capital tend to

decline in the face of adverse economic shocks (Merton, 1977 and Calomiris, 1990).

Looting often takes the form of bankers making loans to themselves or related parties at




                                             13
below-market terms. As a bank's capital becomes exhausted, the costs of corrupt lending

fall more and more on the safety net (Akerlof and Romer, 1993).

       Economic theory offers a mixed message. On the one hand, credible deposit

insurance contributes to financial stability by making depositor runs less likely. On the

other hand, unless insured institutions' capital positions and risk-taking are supervised

carefully, the insurer will accrue loss exposures that undermine bank stability in the long

run. Because deposit-insurance theory embraces good and bad outcomes, it is critical to

explore empirical evidence. Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2000) are the first to use

the cross-county database to study the link between deposit insurance and financial

crises. They use data from 61 countries for the period 1980-1997 to estimate a model of

banking crisis. After controlling for other determinants, they find that the presence of

poorly designed explicit deposit insurance tends to increase the likelihood that a country

will experience a banking crisis and that this result does not appear to be driven by

reverse causality.

       Recognizing that the design of explicit deposit insurance varies significantly

across countries, Demirgüç -Kunt and Detragiache (DKD) focus on whether and how

individual design features mitigate the adverse impact of deposit insurance on bank

stability. The regression experiment reproduced in Table 2 shows that deposit insurance

causes the most trouble in countries where coverage is extensive, where authorities amass

a large fund of explicit reserves and earmark it for insolvency resolution, and where the

scheme is administered by government officials rather than the private sector. These

findings underscore the importance of confronting squarely the moral hazard that deposit

insurance threatens to generate. DKD also show that the contribution of deposit

insurance to bank fragility is significant in countries where the institutional environment

                                             14
lacks transparency and deterrency, but is not significant in countries whose environment

is strong. These findings support the hypothesis that where the contracting environment

controls incentive conflict, effective prudential regulation and supervision can offset the

adverse incentives created by deposit insurance so that moral hazard need not be

worrisome.

       Eichengreen and Arteta (2000) find that DKD’s deposit insurance evidence is not

robust to the twin effects of omitting developed countries from their sample and

employing a single-dimensional dummy variable to capture the existence of explicit

deposit insurance. This finding is not truly inconsistent with DKD whose results are

significant when they incorporate deposit insurance design features and institutional

characteristics into their analysis. On average, the more a system embraces features that

intensify moral hazard, the more vulnerable it is to banking crisis. 5

       However, DKD only imperfectly control for the other components of the financial

safety net, particularly for variation in the quality of regulatory and supervisory

enforcement. DKD proxy the quality of regulation and supervision by institutional

indicators such as bureaucratic quality, bureaucratic delay, lack of corruption, and the

quality of contract enforcement and legal efficiency. Barth, Caprio and Levine (2001)

compile a comprehensive data base on regulation and supervision of commercial banks

and confirm DKD’s findings controlling for variation in the character of government

oversight.

         Policymakers should view the positive correlation between explicit deposit

insurance and banking crises as a wakeup call. Credible deposit insurance allows banks

to gather deposits regardless of the risks they take. We would expect a positive




                                             15
correlation if deposit insurance greatly reduces monitoring by private parties and replaces

it by ineffective regulatory and supervisory discipline. In countries with strong

institutions, we would expect most or all of this reduction in depositor monitoring to be

compensated by official monitoring, so that the impact of deposit insurance on bank

fragility would not prove significant. But is there any direct evidence of the impact of

deposit insurance on market discipline? We turn to this issue next.




How does deposit insurance affect market discipline?

           In high-transparency environments, depositors can discipline banks that engage in

excessive risk-taking by demanding higher deposit interest rates or by withdrawing their

deposits. However, to the extent that deposit insurance reduces the stake that depositors

have in monitoring and policing bank capital and loss exposures, it shifts responsibility

for controlling bank risk-taking to the regulatory system. Wherever deposit-insurance

managers displace more discipline than they exert, bank performance is undermined. To

understand this, we must investigate two questions:

•     How do depositors exert market discipline?

•     How does deposit insurance lessen depositor discipline?

           Evidence on market discipline as reflected in bank interest cost comes primarily

from U.S. experience. Flannery (1998) surveys research on how the interest cost of

uninsured bank deposits and other debt instruments in the U.S. responds to observable

measures of default risk. In the U.S., balances in excess of $100,000 are not insured.

5
    Indeed, Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache (2000)’s results with a simple dummy are also only significant at

                                                     16
Typically, researchers find that interest rates paid on these partially insured instruments

(certificates of deposits, CDs) increase significantly with bank riskiness (Baer and

Brewer 1986, Hannan and Hanweck 1988, and Brewer and Mondschean 1994). Linking

movements in CD rates to bank-specific news embedded in movements in stock prices,

Ellis and Flannery (1992) show that bank CD rates respond generally to market

perceptions of bank-specific risks.

         Cook and Spellman (1994) find that, even on fully insured deposits, risk

premiums at U.S. savings and loan associations (S&Ls) responded to individual-

institution risk factors in 1987. This sensitivity to risk emerged because the deep

economic insolvency of their federal guarantor was becoming clear at that time. These

premiums served simultaneously to rein in gambling by aggressive S&Ls and their

insolvent insurer. This evidence indicates that inadequacies in supervision and insurer net

worth can reduce the credibility of an insurer's guarantees.

         Moving beyond depositor reactions, Flannery and Sorescu (1996) study market

yield spreads between uninsured bank debentures and callable treasury bonds. These

spreads showed significant sensitivity to bank risk during the years 1989-1991 when the

mess was being cleaned up. This was also a time when doubts were emerging about

whether the FDIC could or would fully rescue creditors of insolvent bank holding

companies. The importance of variation in the credibility of implicit and explicit

guarantees is supported in a negative way by the behavior of spreads on bank derivatives

in the less stressful era of 1983-1984. Analyzing data from that era, Avery, Belton and

Goldberg (1988) and Gorton and Santomero (1990) failed to uncover any risk sensitivity.

Apparently, interest costs on insured deposits and uninsured instruments discipline

depository institutions ever more strongly when doubts arise about the insurer's ability to

cover its guarantees. Such doubts are endemic to developing countries and can accelerate

quickly.

        Evidence on whether the deposit growth of banks is retarded by default risk

premiums is available from a wide spectrum of countries and time periods. Gorton and

Pennacchi (1990) explain why we should expect deposit growth to slow at a troubled

institution. Statistical analysis uncovers similar patterns around the world. Martinez-

Peria and Schmukler (1998), find that deposits at banks in Argentina, Chile and Mexico

respond negatively to risk measures generated from accounting data. They also show that

in Chile, where deposit insurance appeared most credible, uninsured depositors were

effective monitors of bank risk.

        Examining a sample of New York City banks in the 1920s and 1930s, Calomiris

and Wilson (1998) show that depositors successfully discriminated among banks on the

basis of their riskiness and tended to shift funds to safer havens. Similarly, Kane (1987)

reports that when the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund (ODGF) fell into crisis in 1985, Ohio

depositors removed funds only from ODGF-insured institutions. Park (1995) and Park

and Peristiani (1998) show that, during the 1980s, deposit growth at individual U.S.

thrifts was negatively related to their estimated probability of default, so that riskier

thrifts experienced smaller deposit growth.

        Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (DKH, 2000) build a bank-level dataset covering

43 countries over 1990-1997, and study both dimensions of depositor discipline by

looking at interest rates and deposit growth. The evidence shows that explicit insurance

lowers banks’ interest expenses and makes interest payments less sensitive to bank risk

and liquidity. However, regardless of the character of a country’s safety net, some

                                              18
market discipline survives. Consistent with the U.S. evidence on interest sensitivity, the

market discipline DKH can observe responds to gaps in coverage, weaknesses in the

credibility of the guarantees, and delays and other costs entailed in recovering funds from

the guarantor.

       DKH particularly focus on how variation in design characteristics affect market

discipline. They find that market discipline is stronger in countries with higher levels of

institutional development. Nevertheless, even in countries whose institutional

development is strong, badly designed deposit insurance curtails market discipline.

Setting higher coverage limits, extending coverage to interbank deposits, establishing an

ex-ante fund of reserves, funding reserves from government sources, and insisting on

public management each displaces market discipline. On the other hand, market

discipline is enhanced by coinsurance provisions, covering foreign currency deposits, and

establishing private or joint management of the insurance enterprise.

       The value deposit insurance offers banks and their creditors can be measured by

the reduction it creates in required interest rates. Society pays for increases in the

perceived safety of deposits by accepting the administrative costs of supervising banks

and the consequences of any net reduction in market discipline. “Correct” pricing

through insurance premia could in principle eliminate risk shifting, but such pricing is

politically and administratively difficult, especially in developing countries. Leaven

(2001) extracts estimates of annual implicit subsidies to banks for a sample of 14

countries from market prices of bank stock. He finds that the cost of deposit insurance

is highly country-specific, being highest in countries with low per-capita GDP and poor

institutional environments. German banks take very low risks and accrue the smallest

gross subsidies from deposit insurance. This reinforces the conclusions reached by Beck

                                              19
(2001) in his case study of German deposit insurance. Beck finds that private

management, mutual liability and the anti-bankruptcy bias curb risk-taking incentives at

German banks.6

           Such individual-bank data provide direct evidence of the way in which deposit

insurance design can affect bank risk-taking incentives. Although deposit insurance

displaces market discipline even in advanced countries, the net effect may be improved

by strong regulation and supervision. These findings reinforce the evidence on deposit

insurance and banking crises. Countries with poor contracting environments are most

likely to suffer adverse consequences from deposit insurance.

           Some argue that in institutionally underdeveloped countries explicit deposit

insurance may have other advantages that offset its negative effects on market discipline

and systemic stability. Folkerts-Landau and Lindgren (1998) maintain that the principal

benefit of deposit insurance is to provide a risk-free asset to small savers. Critics of this

view point out that this benefit may be obtained without destabilization costs by issuing

assets such as postal savings or money market funds backed by government debt

(Calomiris, 1996, Stiglitz, 1992), or by insisting that banks issuing insured deposits could

be constrained to remain “narrow” banks. A second and specifically evolutionary view

maintains that in countries with underdeveloped institutions, deposit insurance may be

expected to create a launching pad for improving the banking system so that it performs

financial intermediation more efficiently. We examine empirical evidence on this

hypothesis in the next section.



How Does Deposit Insurance Impact Financial Development?

6
    The first two factors can also explain the good performance of the U.S. scheme for insuring credit unions

                                                       20
        Countries adopt deposit insurance for different reasons. However, a common

reason is to increase the flow of bank credit by increasing the confidence that the general

public has in the formal banking system without having to explicitly raise or expend

current fiscal resources. To the extent that deposit insurance bolsters depositors’ faith in

the stability of the banking system, it may mobilize household savings for use by the

financial system. The question is whether or not the funds mobilized go on to support

improved patterns of investment and sustainably higher aggregate economic growth.

        Recent adopters of deposit insurance have included African and Latin American

countries with low levels of financial development. To investigate whether and how

explicit deposit insurance contributes to financial development, Cull, Senbet and Sorge

(2000) examine time-series data for 58 countries. These authors find that explicit deposit

insurance favorably impacts the level of financial activity and its volatility only in the

presence of strong institutional development. If deposit-insurance arrangements do not

include a regulatory scheme that can overcome weaknesses in the institutional

environment, instability is fostered and subsequent financial development is harmed.

Examining a cross section of 49 countries, Cecchetti and Krause (2000) show that

deposit insurance retards the evolution of nonbank financing mechanisms. Countries

with more extensive bank deposit insurance tend to have smaller capital and financial

markets and a lower number of publicly traded firms per capita.

        Thus, in institutionally weak environments, deposit insurance appears to retard

rather than to foster financial development. Cross-country research underscores the long-

run danger facing countries that adopt explicit deposit insurance without stopping to

repair demonstrable inadequacies in their contracting environments. This evidence


(Kane and Hendershott, 1996).

                                              21
amounts to a caution flag for authorities considering whether to adopt deposit insurance.

Their decision making process should begin with an audit of the degree of transparency,

deterrency, and accountability present in their institutional framework. Good safety-net

design does not consist of merely copying what works in developed countries. Good

design adapts itself to the need to mitigate problems specific to a country’s framework for

financial contracting. Officials often act as if institutional audits and country-specific

adaptations may be set aside in times of crisis. According to this view, countries whose

creditors pressure them to adopt deposit insurance in the midst of a financial crisis have

little opportunity to think about longer-term consequences. It is fair to ask whether

provision of blanket deposit insurance is of much help in managing crises. Again, we

turn to empirical evidence.



What Role Does Deposit Insurance Play in Managing Crises?

       It is common practice to issue blanket guarantees to arrest a banking crisis.

Countries adopting this strategy include Sweden (1992), Japan (1996), Thailand (1997),

Korea (1997), Malaysia (1998), and Indonesia (1998). More recently, Turkey tried to

halt its financial panic by guaranteeing not just bank depositors, but all domestic and

foreign nondeposit creditors of Turkish banks.

       Advocates of using blanket guarantees to halt a systemic crisis argue that

sweeping guarantees can be helpful, even essential, in halting depositors’ flight to

quality. However, because blanket guarantees create an expectation of their future use in

similar circumstances, they undermine market discipline and may prove greatly

destabilizing over longer periods. Although some countries have managed to scale back




                                             22
formal insurance coverage once a crisis has receded, it is very difficult to scale back

informal coverage in a credible manner.

       It is clear that a policy of credibly extending blanket guarantees is sufficient to

stop a depositor run. However, for governments in developing countries, establishing

and subsequently maintaining the credibility of its guarantees is a costly matter.

Extensive government guarantees shift accrued losses and loss exposures from bank

stakeholders to taxpayers. The fiscal cost of making good on blanket guarantees is an

implicit government expenditure that generates an equal amount of implicit government

debt. This unbooked spending and unbooked debt subtly undermine the country's

foreign-exchange reserves. Hence, in countries whose fiscal capacity is weak, financially

sophisticated parties face continuing incentives to move wealth offshore. If this capital

flight begins soon enough, blanket guarantees may not work even in the short run without

extensive outside support.

       Even if successful in stopping an immediate crisis, introducing guarantees to stop

a crisis creates the expectation of similar bailouts in future crises. The more frequently

this remedy is used and the more enthusiastically it is approved by foreign and

multinational institutions, the harder it becomes for banks and their creditors to take

seriously post-crisis attempts to roll formal coverages back to less-disruptive levels.

Honohan and Klingebiel (2000) analyze the impact of blanket guarantees and other crisis-

management strategies on the ultimate fiscal cost of resolving banking-system distress.

Data covering forty crises around the world indicate that unlimited depositor guarantees,

open-ended liquidity support, and regulatory forbearance significantly increase the

ultimate fiscal cost of resolving a banking crisis. Moreover, these authors find no trade-

off between fiscal costs and the speed of economic recovery. In their sample, depositor

                                             23
guarantees and regulatory forbearance failed to significantly reduce either crisis duration

or the crisis-induced decline in aggregate real output. Providing liquidity support for

insolvent institutions appears to prolong a crisis by destabilizing bank-lending incentives

so extensively that healthy adjustments are delayed and additional output loss is

generated.

        Even in the midst of a crisis, it is inefficient to sacrifice long-term goals to resolve

immediate pressures. Efficient crisis management begins with triage. Hopelessly

insolvent institutions must be identified and their risk-taking brought under control.

Providing open-ended liquidity support to moribund institutions and extending blanket

guarantees to their creditors is apt to spawn new and more-virulent crises down the line.

Even when conceived entirely as a temporary emergency measure, blanket deposit-

insurance guarantees engender high fiscal costs. Incurring these costs is unlikely to help

the real economy to recover faster from banking crisis or to experience a smaller output

loss.



5. Conclusions and Policy Implications

        The empirical research reviewed here answers two main questions:

•   Whether some countries would do well to avoid explicit deposit insurance all

    together?

•   How should deposit-insurance design respond to cross-country differences in

    transparency, deterrency, and accountability?

Should every country adopt explicit deposit insurance?

        Cross-country empirical research on deposit insurance strongly supports the

hypothesis that in institutionally weak environments, poorly designed deposit-insurance

                                              24
arrangements tend to increase the probability of future banking crises. This finding is

statistically robust, in that it emerges using different data sets and two very different

research protocols. When researchers compare the incidence of observed banking crises

in different countries around the world, countries with poorly designed explicit deposit-

insurance systems are found to experience more crises. Moreover, the frequency of these

crises is worse in countries that have weak contracting environments. When researchers

focus instead on bank-level interest costs and deposit growth in different countries, net

private and government monitoring of banks proves decisively weaker in poorly designed

systems.

       The most plausible interpretation of these results is that governments should

address weaknesses in their transparency, deterrency, and accountability before adopting

explicit deposit insurance schemes. Improving banking regulation and supervision,

reforming the legal system such that property rights are protected and contract

enforcement is strengthened, upgrading accounting and disclosure rules so that accurate

information reaches the markets in a timely fashion exemplify the kinds of institutional

reforms that improve incentive structures and limit excess risk-taking.

           In poor contracting environments, risk-shifting is magnified because insurance-

induced reductions in private monitoring are intensified by deficiencies in the nature of

official monitoring. Banks are tempted to exploit monitoring weakness by issuing

insured deposits and using them to finance projects with substantial downside risks. As

the expanding value of unbooked guarantees subtly exhausts the fiscal capacity of the

government, the fragility of a country's financial system increases. Although government

officials have often been led to believe that deposit insurance helps to develop a robust

financial system, it cannot do this unless the contracting environment can support it.

                                              25
Poor supervision leads banks to lend on positively skewed, but negative present-value

projects. Such lending undermines bank solvency, destroys real economic capital, and

deters financial development.

       Cross-country empirical research verifies the importance of a nation's financial-

contracting environment. A country must prepare itself to support explicit deposit

insurance in an efficient manner. Governments that are thinking of adopting deposit

insurance must recognize that a strong contracting environment is a precondition. Indeed,

if a country's contracting environment is not characterized by a reasonable degree of

transparency, accountability and deterrency, an explicit deposit insurance scheme is

likely to do more harm than good. For countries with weak institutions, adopting explicit

deposit insurance promises at best to assist financial development only in the very short

run. Over longer periods, it is likely to undermine market discipline, aggravate moral

hazard and intensify financial fragility. This policy conclusion is distressingly relevant

because many of the countries recently adopting explicit deposit insurance have a

demonstrably poor contracting environment.



How should explicit deposit insurance be designed?

       Cross-country empirical research offers lessons for countries that have installed or

are in the process of adopting explicit deposit-insurance schemes. Even in favorable

circumstances, using explicit deposit insurance to increase depositor confidence threatens

to heighten financial fragility by reducing the degree of market discipline that banks

experience. However, appropriate design features can both control and offset these

effects to minimize social costs.




                                             26
       Empirical research supports the hypothesis that the following features enhance

market discipline and reduce moral hazard:

•   Credibly low coverage limits per account
•   Narrow coverage (e.g., excluding interbank deposits)
•   Coinsurance (and alternative private loss-sharing arrangements such as subordinated
    debt and extended stockholder liability)
•   Compulsory membership
•   Ex-post funding
•   Targeting surviving banks to cover losses (although taxpayers may be asked to assist
    banks in a truly systemic crisis)
•   Private-public joint management
       The advantages of credibly limiting insurance coverage and requiring compulsory

membership are obvious and not at all controversial. Limiting coverage in a believable

way ensures that identifiable groups of private individuals – large depositors,

subordinated debtholders or other banks –understand that their funds are inescapably at

risk. This exposure to loss gives them an incentive to monitor the behavior of both banks

and safety-net managers. Compulsory membership increases the size of the insurance

pool and prevents low-risk institutions from selecting out of the system. This means that

low-risk, well-managed banks can help officials to monitor and police high-flying

competitors.

       The preference for ex-post funding and private involvement in insurance design

and management is inevitably a harder sell. On the one hand, not having immediate

access to a pool of accumulated liquid reserves threatens to delay authorities from dealing

with insolvent institutions in a timely manner. However, cross-country evidence

indicates that in weak institutional environments the net economic value of deposit-

insurance reserves is routinely overstated by failing to account for the implicit liabilities


                                               27
that weak and insolvent clients implicitly shift onto these reserves. Indeed, an overvalued

fund tends to intensify moral hazard by leading depositors and competing institutions to

ignore evidence of individual bank insolvencies.

        Even if left unfunded, a country's deposit-insurance scheme could still be given

immediate access to a credit line either from its national treasury or from reinsurance

contracts written with reliable outside insurers. In weak contracting environments, it is

useful to assign additional decision-making units, such as the treasury or foreign

reinsurers, meaningful responsibility for overseeing design and management decisions.

Irrespective of whether net deposit-insurance losses are funded ex ante or ex post, it must

be made clear that funds to cover losses will come principally from surviving banks.

Otherwise, government backup threatens to reduce market discipline and increase

fragility.

        Empirical evidence also indicates that involving private parties in managing

deposit-insurance arrangements reduces moral hazard and fragility. While private

managers can also shirk their duties and even misappropriate funds, stakeholders in any

private scheme have strong incentives to monitor and police managerial actions.

        Finally, the importance of the research summarized here is to focus attention on

the need to identify institutional prerequisites for adopting deposit insurance and to make

a concerted effort to get system's design right. Cross-country research does not show that

deposit insurance is universally a mistake or that all countries with explicit systems

should abandon their scheme at the first opportunity. In countries where the contracting

environment is well developed, systemic problems are rare and correlations between

design features and crises are weaker and often insignificant.

Table 2. Deposit Insurance Design and Banking Crises
The dependent variable is a crisis dummy which takes the value one if there is a crisis and the value zero otherwise. A logit
probability model is estimated. Variables are defined as follows: Explicit coverage limit takes the value 0 if implicit insurance but
equals coverage limit divided by deposits per capita lagged one period. Funding variable takes the value 0 if implicit insurance, 1 if
explicit insurance with no fund, and 2 if explicit insurance with deposit insurance fund. Management variables take the value 1 if
private, joint, or official management and zero otherwise, respectively. The moral hazard index is the first principal component of
deposit insurance design features: coinsurance, coverage, scope of coverage, type of funding, source of funding, management, and
membership. Regression also includes the following control variables that are not reported below: growth, change in terms of trade,
real interest rates, inflation, M2/reserves, depreciation, past credit growth, and gdp per capita. Standard errors are given in
parentheses. Source: Demirguc-Kunt and Detragiache, 2000.
