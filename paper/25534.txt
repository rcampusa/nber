                                          ABSTRACT

We examine intergenerational mobility (IM) in educational attainment in Africa since
independence using census data. First, we map IM across 27 countries and more than 2,800
regions, documenting wide cross-country and especially within-country heterogeneity. Inertia
looms large as differences in the literacy of the old generation explain about half of the observed
spatial disparities in IM. The rural-urban divide is substantial. Though conspicuous in some
countries, there is no evidence of systematic gender gaps in IM. Second, we characterize the
geography of IM, finding that colonial investments in railroads and Christian missions, as well as
proximity to capitals and the coastline are the strongest correlates. Third, we ask whether the
regional differences in mobility reflect spatial sorting or their independent role. To isolate the
two, we focus on children whose families moved when they were young. Comparing siblings,
looking at moves triggered by displacement shocks, and using historical migrations to predict
moving-families' destinations, we establish that, while selection is considerable, regional
exposure effects are at play. An extra year spent in a high-mobility region before the age of 12
(and after 5) significantly raises the likelihood for children of uneducated parents to complete
primary school. Overall, the evidence suggests that geographic and historical factors laid the
seeds for spatial disparities in IM that are cemented by sorting and the independent impact of
regions.

1     Introduction
There is rising optimism about Africa, a continent with 1.2 billion opportunities, as the
Economist (2016) touted not long ago. The formerly “hopeless continent” is gradually
becoming the “hopeful” one (Economist (2000, 2011)). Educational attainment is rising,
health is improving, and the income of many Africans is growing. Some even speak
of an African “growth miracle” (Young (2012)). However, anecdotal evidence indicates
widespread inequalities, uneven progress, and poverty traps, suggesting that the “miracle”
may not be for all. A comprehensive assessment is lacking.
    We take the first step toward mapping, exploring, and explaining intergenerational
mobility across the continent. We look at educational attainment using census data cov-
ering more than 16 million individuals across 27 African countries and 2, 846 regions.
Reconstructing the joint distribution of parental and offspring education since the 1960s,
when most of Africa becomes independent, allows us to shed light on a variety of ques-
tions. Where is the land of educational opportunity? Are differences in intergenerational
mobility across countries and regions small, moderate, or wide? How large are gender
disparities? How big is the rural-urban gap? Which elements of a region’s history and ge-
ography correlate with educational mobility? Do regions matter for mobility or do districts
with higher mobility attract families more eager to climb the social ladder?

1.1   Results Preview
In the first part of the paper, we compile new country and regional-level measures of
educational opportunity. As recent works on intergenerational mobility in income (e.g.,
Chetty et al. (2017)) and education (Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2018)), we construct
measures of absolute upward intergenerational mobility (IM) defined as the likelihood
that children born to parents that have not completed primary schooling manage to do so.
Similarly, we map absolute downward mobility, defined as the likelihood that the offspring
of parents with completed primary education fail to do so. To account for “selection on
cohabitation”, we focus on ages between 14 and 18, as in this age range children have
largely finished primary school and still reside with parents or older relatives.
    We document large cross-country differences in upward and downward mobility. The
likelihood that children born to parents with no education complete primary schooling
exceeds 70% in South Africa and Botswana; the corresponding statistic in Sudan, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Malawi hovers below 20%. Most importantly,
there is substantial within-country variation. In Kenya, a country with a close-to-average
upward IM of 50%, the likelihood that children of illiterate parents will complete primary
education ranges from 5% (in the Turkana region in the Northwest) to 85% (in Westlands
in Nairobi). Upward IM is higher in urban as compared to rural areas. While there is
a gender gap in educational levels, intergenerational mobility is, on average, similar for
boys and girls, though there is a non-negligible gender gap in the Sahel and North Africa.
Spatial disparities in mobility exhibit inertia: Upward IM is higher in countries and regions
with higher literacy among the old. Variation in the latter accounts for roughly half of
the observed IM variability. Downward mobility is also linked to the literacy of the old
generation, but the association is weaker.


                                             1
   In the second part of the paper, we characterize the geography of IM in Africa by
looking at geographical and historical variables that have been linked to regional develop-
ment. Upward IM is higher and downward IM is lower in regions close to the coast and
the capital, with rugged terrains and low malaria. Among the historical legacies, colonial
transportation investments and missionary activity are the strongest correlates of mobil-
ity. These correlations are present when we exploit within-province variation and when we
estimate LASSO to account for multicollinearity and measurement error. While these as-
sociations do not identify causal effects, they suggest how historical contingencies, related
to colonization and geography, have influenced not only initial conditions (the literacy of
the old generation) but also the trajectories of regional economies.
   The observed differences in regional IM may be the result of two forces. On the
one hand, regions may exert a causal impact on mobility, for example, providing higher-
quality infrastructure, more and better schools. On the other hand, there may be sorting,
as families with higher ability and/or valuation of education move to areas with better
opportunities. In the third part, we assess the relative magnitudes of these two factors
employing the approach of Chetty and Hendren (2018a). The methodology exploits differ-
ences in the age at which children of migrant households move to distinguish “selection”
from “regional childhood exposure effects.” Both forces are at play. Selection is present;
families’ sorting into better (worse) locations correlates strongly with child attainment.
The analysis also uncovers sizable “regional exposure effects” both for boys and girls. An
additional year in the higher mobility region before the age of 12, and especially between
5 − 11, increases the likelihood that children of households without any education manage
to complete primary schooling.
   To advance on the identification of regional exposure effects, we conduct three exercises,
separately and jointly. First, we explore whether the educational attainment of siblings
whose family moved is proportional to their age difference interacted with differences
in mobility between the permanent residents in origin and destination districts. The
regional childhood exposure estimates from the household-fixed-effects specifications are
similar to the baseline ones. Second, we look at moves taking place in periods of abnormal
outflows, as these likely reflect displacement shocks exogenous to households. We continue
finding considerable regional exposure effects for moving children in the critical-for-primary
schooling age (5 − 11) and somewhat smaller before 5. Third, we use historical migration
to project -and account for- households’ endogenous destination choice. The regional
childhood exposure estimates remain significant.
   Overall, the analysis suggests that the vast spatial differences in mobility reflect both
sorting and regional exposure effects. The uncovered inertia, coupled with the strong
association between mobility (and old’s literacy) with historical and geographic traits,
suggests that these features have shaped regional dynamics post-independence.

1.2   Related Literature
Our work blends two strands of literature that have, thus far, moved in parallel. The
first is the growing research studying intergenerational mobility (see Solon (1999) and




                                              2
Black and Devereux (2011) for reviews).1 Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2018) use the
US population census of 1940 to map absolute educational mobility looking at children
residing with at least one parent. They document rising mobility during the first half of
the 20th century, which differs across race and states.2 Chetty et al. (2014) provide a
mapping of IM in income across US counties and explore its correlates. Chetty and Hen-
dren (2018a,b) use matched parents-children administrative tax records of moving families
to isolate the effect of neighborhood exposure on income IM from sorting. Our work re-
lates to Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020) and Geng (2018), who also map and study
educational mobility across Indian and Chinese regions, respectively. In parallel work,
the World Bank compiles measures in intergenerational mobility in education and income
for many countries using survey data (Narayan et al. (2018)). Our main contribution to
this research is to compile new statistics and characterize the educational mobility for
many African countries and regions, distinguishing also between gender and rural-urban
residence. Moreover, we estimate regions’ independent influence on mobility, showing at
the same time that bidirectional sorting (from higher to lower opportunity regions and
vice versa) is considerable.
        The second strand is the research on the origins of African development that provides
compelling evidence of historical continuity as well as instances of rupture in the evolution
of the economy and polity (see Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2020) for a review). An
open question is whether the correlation between deeply rooted factors and current out-
comes reflects the one-time effect of the former on initial conditions or if historical shocks
have altered the transmission of opportunity across generations. By building data on IM
across African regions and exploring its correlates, we begin answering such questions.
Moreover, by isolating the role of regions on mobility from sorting, we start unbundling
the mechanisms linking geography-history to contemporary development.

        Structure In Section 2, we present the census data on educational attainment and
detail the construction of the intergenerational mobility measures. Section 3 describes IM
across African countries and regions. Section 4 explores the geographic, historical, and
at-independence correlates of educational mobility. In Section 5, we exploit differences in
ages-at-move among migrant children to isolate regional childhood exposure effects from
sorting. In Section 6, we summarize and discuss avenues for future research.


2        Data and Methods

2.1       Why Education?
We focus on education for several reasons. First, income data are available for a tiny share
of the African population and a handful of countries. For instance, Alvaredo et al. (2017)
report that for Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Uganda, income data encompass
    1
     Early studies on intergenerational mobility in education include Bowles (1972), Blake (1985), and
Spady (1967). Hertz et al. (2008) estimate country-level IM coefficients across 42 countries. Hilger (2017)
studies trends in educational IM in the United States over the 20th century, while Chetty et al. (2017) and
Davis and Mazumder (2020) study the dynamics of absolute IM in income in the US.
   2
     A strand of the US-focused literature looks at racial differences in mobility (e.g., Chetty et al. (2020b),
Davis and Mazumder (2018), Derenoncourt (2018)). These studies relate to our companion work Alesina
et al. (2020b,a), where we explore ethnic and religious differences in educational mobility across Africa.


                                                       3
less than 1% of the adult population, while for most African countries tax records do
not exist. Moreover, consumption data are noisy and cover small samples. In contrast,
education is available at a fine geographic resolution. Second, measurement error in ed-
ucational attainment is a lesser concern compared to that of reported income, wealth, or
consumption. Third, education is useful in mapping intergenerational mobility, as people
tend to complete primary schooling, which is the key educational achievement across most
of Africa, by the age of 12−14. Hence, unlike lifetime earnings, the analysis can start when
individuals are early in the life cycle. Fourth, parental investment in children’s education
is at the heart of theoretical work in intergenerational linkages (e.g., Becker and Tomes
(1979), Loury (1981)). Fifth, a voluminous research in labor economics shows that edu-
cation causally affects lifetime income (e.g., Card (1999)). Individual returns to schooling
are sizable in low-income (African) countries.3 Sixth, in the Appendix (section C.2), using
geo-referenced Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Afrobarometer Surveys, we
present evidence of a strong correlation between educational attainment and various prox-
ies of well-being in Africa, including living conditions, child mortality, attitudes toward
domestic violence, political and civic engagement.

2.2     Sample

2.2.1    Countries & Regions

We use individual records, retrieved from 694 national censuses from 27 countries: Benin,
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho,
Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
We obtain the data from IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) International,
hosted at the University of Minnesota Population Centre, that reports harmonized repre-
sentative samples, typically 10%.5 As of 2015, the sample countries were home to about 850
million people, representing around 75 percent of Africa’s population and GDP. IPUMS
also reports residence, allowing us to assign individuals to “coarse” and “fine” adminis-
trative units. Our sample spans 367 provinces (admin-1) and 2, 846 districts (admin-2 or
3 units) of a mean (median) size of 5206 (1578) sqm.6
   3
     Most studies suggest higher returns to education in low income countries, as compared to the “con-
sensus” estimate of 6.5% − 8.5% in high income countries (e.g., Psacharopoulos (1994), Caselli, Ponticelli,
and Rossi (2014)). Young (2012) estimates Mincerian returns of about 11.3% (OLS) to 13.9% (2SLS)
across 14 Sub-Saharan African countries using DHS data, higher than in 11 non-SSA low income countries
[range of 8.7% (OLS) - 10.4% (2SLS)]. Montenegro and Patrinos (2014) estimate Mincerian returns of
about 12.4% in Africa, compared to 9.7% for the rest of the world. Four of the top-5 countries are in
Africa. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) document a mean increase in wages for those with completed
primary of 37.6% across 15 Sub-Saharan African countries in the 1980s and 1990s, as compared to 26.5%
for secondary and 27.8% for tertiary.
   4
     We start from 74 censuses. We discard Burkina Faso (1985), Kenya (1979), and Liberia (1974), as
they lack identifiers to match children to older relatives. We also remove Togo (1960 and 1970), as they
do not cover all regions.
   5
     In Nigeria data come from household surveys conducted in consecutive years between 2006 and 2010.
As the number of observations is small, we aggregate the survey waves and count them as one census-year.
   6
     For Botswana, Lesotho, and Nigeria, IPUMS reports one level of administrative units. In Ghana after
1984, Burkina Faso in 1985, Ethiopia in 1984, Malawi in 1987, and South Africa after 1996, districts
change, as administrative boundaries are redrawn. We have harmonized these countries’ boundaries.

2.2.2      Education

IPUMS records education for around 93 million individuals. Dropping those younger
than 14 to allow for primary school completion leaves about 66.8 million observations.7
Appendix Figure A.1 portrays the evolution of the pan-African distribution of educational
attainment across cohorts. Education rises, mostly reflecting increasing completion of
primary schooling. The share of Africans with tertiary education is minuscule even for
the 1980s-born, while secondary education has increased modestly.8 We need to observe
education for children and at least one individual of the immediately older generation.
This requirement brings the sample to 25.8 million. Appendix table B.1 gives details on
sample construction.
       For a first look at the data, we construct 4 × 4 attainment transition matrices for
individuals older than 25 years. Figure 1 (a) shows the Africa-wide transition matrix using
all censuses, while figures 1 (b) and (c) zoom in Mozambique and Tanzania, respectively.
The vertical axis indicates the likelihood that the child has the respective education,
conditional on the older generation attainment, depicted on the horizontal axis. 81.5%
of the “old” generation across the continent has not completed primary schooling. 19%
of African children, whose parents have not completed primary schooling, manage to do;
9.5% finish high-school, and 2.5% get a college degree. The figure also illustrates the
sharp differences between the two Eastern African countries. In Tanzania, 47% of children
whose parents have not finished primary school manages to do so; in Mozambique, the
corresponding share is 12%.

2.3      Methodology
We construct measures of absolute IM that reflect the likelihood that children complete
a strictly higher or lower education level than members of the immediately previous gen-
eration in the household (parents and/or extended family members, such as aunts and
uncles). For the education of the “old”, we take the average attainment of individuals one
generation older in the household, rounded to the nearest integer (results are similar if we
take the minimum or maximum).9 As the relevant dimension for Africa during this period
regards the completion of primary schooling, we focus on this aspect.10
   7
     We validated the IPUMS data across country-cohorts with the Barro and Lee (2013) statistics and at
the regional level using DHS; correlations exceed 0.9 (Appendix Section C)
   8
     There are four attainment categories: (i ) no schooling and less than completed primary; (ii) completed
primary (and some secondary); (iii) completed secondary (and some tertiary); and (iv ) completed tertiary
(and higher). We use attainment, rather than years of schooling, for many reasons. First, the attainment
data have wider coverage than years of schooling. In the raw IPUMS data, there are about 25.5 million
records with attainment, but without years of schooling. The latter is missing altogether for four countries
and several censuses. Second, there is likely less noise on completion data as compared to schooling years,
which are often inferred from the former. Third, looking at children, whose parents have not completed
primary schooling, allows for a common across countries, simple to grasp baseline.
   9
     Some studies use data that match children to either mothers or fathers (e.g., Asher, Novosad, and
Rafkin (2020). Others, like we do, take the average (e.g., Hilger (2017)), while some take the highest value
(e.g., Geng (2018)). Taking the mean, maximizes coverage (see also Davis and Mazumder (2020)).
  10
     The intergenerational mobility literature has employed various measures (see Black and Devereux
(2011). Many studies focus on (one minus) the intergenerational coefficient obtained from a regression of
children on parental schooling (e.g., Hertz et al. (2008)); others work with rank-rank correlation coefficients
and intergenerational rank movements (e.g., Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020), Geng (2018), Chetty et al.
(2014)). While rank-based measures isolate the relative movement of children in the distribution compared
to the older generation from the overall increase, they may be sensitive to measurement error (see

                                   The figure shows the transition matrices for four educational attainment categories for Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania. The
                                   sample consists of individuals aged 25 and older, co-residing with at least one individual of an older generation.




                                               To construct absolute IM measures, we first define the following indicator variables:

                                               • lit paribct equals 1 if the parent of individual i born in birth-decade b in country c
                                                 and observed in census-year t is literate and zero otherwise. We label “illiterate”
                                                 those who have not completed primary education and “literate” those who have.

                                               • IM upibct equals 1 if a child i born to illiterate parents in birth-decade b in country
                                                 c and observed in census-year t is literate and zero otherwise.

                                               • IM downibct equals 1 if a child i born to literate parents in birth-decade b in country
                                                 c and observed in census-year t is illiterate and zero otherwise.
                                           Mogstad et al. (2020)). Other studies (e.g., Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2018), Davis and Mazumder
                                           (2020) and Chetty et al. (2017)) focus, as we do, on absolute transition likelihoods. Gottschalk and
                                           Spolaore (2002) provide a theoretical exploration of different mobility measures. The absolute IM measures
                                           correlate strongly with the IM coefficient across both countries and regions. The correlation of the absolute
                                           IM statistics with the intergenerational correlation is though small.



                                                                                                                                                         6
       Then, we estimate the following specifications, pooling observations across all censuses
and countries:


                                   lit paribct = αco + [γbo + δby + θt ] + ict                          (1)

                           IM up/downibct = αcy + [γbo + δby + θt ] + ict ,                             (2)


       For parental literacy (equation (1)), we compute means among all individuals for whom
we observe their parents’ (older generation relatives) attainment, netting birth-decade
fixed effects for the “young”(δby ) and the “old”(γbo ) and census-year fixed effects (θt ).
For upward IM, we estimate equation (2) for children whose parents have not completed
primary education; thus the country fixed effects (α̂cy ) reflect the conditional likelihood
that children of illiterate parents become literate, netting cohort and census effects. For
downward IM, we estimate (2) for children whose parents have completed at least primary;
so α̂cy measure the conditional likelihood that children of literate parents do not complete
primary schooling netting census-year and cohort effects.
       For the regional analysis, we run similar specifications at the district level, country-
by-country, and extract the demeaned literacy of the old generation, upward IM, and
downward IM (conditioning on cohort and census fixed-effects).


                                  lit paribcrt = αro + [γbo + δbo + θt ] + ibcrt                        (3)

                          IM up/downibcrt = αry + [γbo + δbo + θt ] + ibcrt .                           (4)


2.4      Cohabitation Selection
Estimating the IM of individuals who reside with at least one older family member (usually
a biological parent) raises cohabitation-selection concerns, as the transmission of education
may differ between children living with older family member(s) and those that do not. This
issue is less pressing for young children, as almost all of them cohabitate with their parents.
The younger the child, however, the higher the risk of misclassifying her attainment as
“less-than-primary” when in fact she would complete primary education a few years after
we oberve her in the census. Hence, following Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2018), we
focus on “children” aged 14 − 18 years, as by then primary education is mostly completed
and cohabitation rates are still high (see also Hilger (2017)).
       We use census information on the “relationship to household head” to recover the
“old” generation and take the average of their educational attainment. Appendix Section
D provides details, discussing also how we deal with heterogeneity in family structure
(e.g., nuclear families, presence of young wives). The Appendix reports statistics for each
census, as their detail differ. On average, cohabitation with any relatives for children
aged 14 − 18 is around 94.5%. However, the “relationship to household head ” variable is
coarsely documented in some censuses.11 To maximize coverage and avoid misclassifying
  11
    An extreme example is the Togo 2010 census, which classified 92.9% of individuals 14 − 18 years as
cohabitating with some relative. Due to the census’ sparse categorization of the relationship to family
head, about half of the children are classified as residing with “other relatives.” Some censuses distinguish
between biological, adopted, and step-children (e.g., Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia), but most do not.



                                                     7
coresidence with older family member(s) due to census coarseness, we assign “other rel-
atives (not elsewhere classified)” to the “ old” generation if they are at least 15 and less
than 40 years older than the child. [This imputation affects about 10% of the sample and
does not affect the results.]
         For individuals aged between 14 and 18 years, the coresidence rate across all censuses
with an older generation relative is 84% (see appendix table D.2). Cohabitation rates
with an older family member exceed 90% in 11 censuses; it is between 85% − 90% for 15
and between 80% − 85% for 17. The lowest coresidence rate is recorded in Kenya in 1969
(63.3%), in Malawi in 1987 (68.9%), and in Botswana in 1991 and 2011 (around 70%). As
a reference point, Card, Domnisoru, and Taylor (2018) report coresidence rates for African
Americans and whites in the US 1940 census of about 78% and 89%, respectively.
         We also work with individuals aged 14-25, as this increases the sample considerably,
including also high-school and college graduates, while cohabitation is still reasonably high
(around 70%). The Appendix (Section D) gives details and also reports the distribution
of district-level cohabitation rates; the mean (median) is 82% (82.5%). Cohabitation rates
have slightly risen, though this most likely reflects improvements in census details.

sample. (The series are strongly correlated, ρ > .97). On average, less than forty percent
of children of illiterate parents have managed to complete primary education. Downward
IM is considerable, as approximately one out of four children born to literate parents does
not complete primary education.
         The pan-African mean masks sizable variation. The likelihood that children of illiterate
parents will complete at least primary education ranges from an abysmal 4% in South
Sudan and 11% in Mozambique to 80% in South Africa and 70% in Botswana. The lowest
upward IM is in the Sahel (Sudan, Burkina Faso and to a lesser extent Mali and Senegal)
and the highest in Southern Africa (Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa) with
Western and Eastern African countries in the middle. Downward mobility is negatively
correlated with upward mobility. Downward IM is the highest in countries plagued by long-
lasting conflicts, such as Rwanda (0.47), Liberia (0.54), Mozambique (0.51), and South
Sudan (0.77). Downward IM is below 10 percent in more stable ones like Botswana, South
Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria. The uncovered cross-country heterogeneity in absolute IM
across Africa is considerably larger than the cross-Indian state and cross-Chinese province
variability in relative IM documented by Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020) and Geng
(2018), respectively.12
    12
    Geng (2018) documents a province range in IM rank-rank coefficients of 0.25 to 0.5 in the 2000 Chinese
Census. The range across (340) prefactures is between −0.033 to 0.661. Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020)
estimate a range of relative educational mobility of 0.17 to 0.72 across 124 Indian districts and 0.26 to
0.60 across 25 states. Yet, as our statistics reflect absolute rather than relative changes of children’s

Columns (1) and (2) give upward-IM estimates. They reflect the likelihood that children, aged 14-18 and 14-25,
whose parents have not completed primary schooling to complete at least primary education. Columns (3) and (4)
give downward-IM estimates. They reflect the likelihood that children, aged 14-18 and 14-25, whose parents have
completed primary schooling or higher fail to complete primary education. Columns (5) and (6) give the number of
observations (children whose parental education is reported in the censuses). Countries are sorted from the highest
to the lowest level of upward IM in the 14-18 sample (column (1)). “Mean” gives the unweighted average of the 27
country-estimates.




    Given heterogeneity in family structures across the continent, we estimated different IM
statistics for children co-residing with biological parents, other older generation relatives,
and both. Appendix E.1 reports the cross-country measures. Upward IM is somehwat
higher and downward IM lower for children co-residing with biological parents. However,
the various measures are strongly correlated (0.95) and the country rankings not much
affected by family structure.

3.1.2     Rural-Urban Residence

We compiled IM separately for rural and urban households. Appendix Table E.2 reports
the statistics across countries. The correlation between rural and urban IM is 0.85 for
both the upward and downward measures. Setting aside South Sudan, an outlier, upward
IM in urban places ranges from 0.21 in Mozambique to around 0.85 in Zimbabwe and
South Africa (mean 0.53 and st. dev. 0.2). The variability in rural upward IM relative
to the mean is wider (mean 0.33 and st. dev. 0.22), hovering around 0.06 in Mozam-
bique, Ethiopia, South and North Sudan but exceeding 0.6 in Nigeria, Egypt, Zimbabwe,
Botswana, and South Africa. Overall, the rural-urban gap in mobility is the highest in poor
position in the educational distribution, the estimates’ ranges are not directly comparable. The variability
of educational mobility across the US is lower than the pan-African one illustarted here. Fletcher and Han
(2018) report IM schooling coefficients ranging from 0.3 till 0.6 across US states (median 0.45) using survey
data in 1982, 1992, and 2004. Hilger (2017) reports a coefficient of variation of around 0.3 for educational
mobility across US states.

countries (Appendix Figure E.2 (b)). In Figure 2 we explore the evolution of rural-urban
gaps. Upward IM is on average 18% higher for urban, as compared to rural households, for
all cohorts and countries, but Egypt in the 1960s and 1970s. The rural-urban gap is the
highest in countries with low levels of mobility and literacy. For example, there is a gap
of about 40 percentage points between rural and urban places in Ethiopia and Burkina
Faso; the rural-urban gap is below 10 percentage points in South Africa and Botswana.

The figure plots the difference in upward IM between individuals aged 14-18 residing in urban and rural locations by
country and birth decade. The criteria for the rural-urban classification vary. In some countries, statistical agencies
rely solely on population cutoffs, while others use localities’ economic activity. In a few instances, the statistical
codebook does not provide precise information. Rural-urban status is not reported for Morocco.




3.1.3                                    Gender

We also estimate IM separately for boys and girls. Appendix Table E.2 gives the country
means. The correlation of the IM measures for boys and girls exceed .90 and, as such, the
cross-country ranking is similar. Figure 3 shows the evolution of male-female differences
in upward-IM. There is a gender gap for the 1960s cohorts (especially when we exclude
Botswana) that disappears for the 1980s and the 1990s cohorts. To be sure, there are
countries where boys fare much better than girls: the gender gap is salient in North Africa
(Morocco and Egypt) and the Sahel (Senegal, Togo, Mali, and Ethiopia). However, girls
born to illiterate parents in many Southern and Eastern African countries, like Lesotho,
Botswana, Tanzania, and South Africa, enjoy a small edge in completing primary schooling
over boys. Gender differences in mobility are not related to GDP per capita (Appendix
Figure E.2 (a)).

This table shows summary statistics for district level esimates of IM. “Total” shows the unweighted summary
statistics across all districts.




    Table 2 reports summary statistics by country. The district-level (unweighted) average
and median for upward (downward) IM across the 2, 846 regions are 0.40 (0.34) and 0.375
(0.294), respectively, close to the cross-country values.13 As an example of the large
within country variation, Figures 5 (a) and (b) portray upward and downward IM across
110 regions in Ghana. While average upward IM is 0.58, regional IM ranges from 0.18 to
0.82 with rates below 0.4 in the Northern regions and above 0.7 in the South. The mean
downward mobility is 0.20, but it varies from 0.08 to 0.50. This north-south gradient
mirrors both the country’s religious geography as well as colonial-era missionary activity
and transportation investments, topics we return to below.
    IM varies greatly across regions in many countries.14 In Burkina Faso, for example,
the average upward-IM of 0.132 masks a regional range from 0.03 to 0.50. In Uganda, the
upward-IM range is wider [0.015 − 0.69]. Spatial differences in IM are wider in countries
with lower levels of mobility, a pattern that adds to the literature showing that underde-
velopment moves in tandem with regional inequalities (see Kanbur and Venables (2005)
for review).
  13
     As in some countries, like Nigeria, districts are large, the map misses within-region spatial variation
in IM that is likely non-negligible.
  14
     For some districts mobility is either zero or one. These extremes reflect the small number of obser-
vations. The mean (median) district estimate is based on 1, 936 (891) children (st.dev = 3, 287). The
patterns are similar if we restrict to regions with many observations.

3.3      Trends
In Table 3 we examine how average IM evolves for Africans born in the 1960’s, 1970’s,
1980’s and 1990’s.15 The within-country and within-district estimates show a mild increase
in upward IM in the 1970s and 1980s. Upward IM is about 12 percentage points higher
for the 1990s-born as compared to those born in the 1960s. Downward IM is falling over
time, though at a weaker and more heterogeneous pace.16

The table reports OLS estimates associating cohort-level upward IM (in columns (1) and (3)) and down- ward IM
(in (2) and (4)) across countries (in (1)-(2)) and across regions (in (3)-(4)) with cohort indicators; the 1960s cohort
serves as the omitted category. Specification (2) includes country constants (not reported) and specification (4)
includes region constants (not reported). Standard errors clustered at the country- level are reported in parentheses.

      Appendix E.3 portrays the distribution of regional IM across cohorts. The standard deviation of
upward IM is roughly constant though the distribution becomes less skewed over time. The standard
deviation of downward IM falls slightly.
   16
      There is some relation of these patterns with the ones that Hilger (2017) presents for the US. He
finds that the share of children with strictly higher educational attainment than their parents increased
for the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s born cohorts, but started falling after. The increase was acute for African
Americans, though the decline applied to both whites and blacks.

                               cohorts. There is an almost one to one link with a strong fit. The slope decreases to .67

                               3.4        Literacy of the Old and IM
                               Motivated by evidence from the recent research agenda on intergenerational mobility (e.g.,
                               Chetty et al. (2020a)) showing that upward mobility is higher in regions with better
                               outcomes (wealth, education, income) and research on African growth stressing poverty
                               traps and slow convergence (e.g., Gunning and Collier (1999)), we examine the association
                               between IM and literacy rates of the “old generation”. While these correlations do not
                               have a causal interpretation, they allow us to explore inertia.

                               3.4.1           Cross-Country Patterns

                               Figure 7, panel (a), plots the relationship between country-level IM across cohorts and the
                               literacy rate of the old generation of the respective cohort. A strong positive association
                               emerges. In Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, North, and South Sudan, where for
                               all cohorts the share of literate “old” is less than 20%, the likelihood that children from
                               illiterate parents will complete primary school is below or close to 20%. The analogous
                               statistic for Botswana and South Africa, where the old-cohorts’ literacy rate exceeds 50%,
                               hovers around 70%. A one-percentage-point increase in the literacy of the old is associated
                               with a .89 percentage points increase in upward IM; and variation in the former explains
                               56% of the cross-country-cohort variation in upward IM. Figure 7 Panel (b) uncovers a
                               similar though attenuated relationship between the literacy of the “old” generation and
                               downward IM. A one percentage point increase in the “old” generation’s literacy maps
                               into a 0.4 decline in downward IM; the old generation’s literacy explains about a fourth
                               of the variation in downward IM. Compared to upward IM, downward IM appears more
                               sensitive to cohort-specific civil conflict (e.g., Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone).

                  The figures plot upward-IM and downward-IM across country-birth-cohorts against the share of the “old” generation that has
                  completed primary education. The figures also report the unweighted OLS regression fit.




                         3.4.2         Regional Patterns

                         Figures 8 (a) and (b) plot the district-level association between upward and downward
                         IM and mean literacy of the “old” generation, netting country-cohort and census effects.
                         We observe a strong association between the literacy of the “old” and upward IM across
                         African regions. Likewise, there is a negative -but less steep- correlation between downward
                         IM and the literacy of the old. A 10 percentage points increase in the literacy of the
                         “old” is associated with a roughly 7 percentage points increase in the likelihood that
                         children of illiterate parents will complete primary and a 4.5 percentage points lower
                         chance that kids of literate parents will fall below parental literacy. The estimates retain
                         statistical significance and decline modestly when we replace the country constants with
                         admin-1 fixed effects to account for relatively local features. This pattern is similar to
                         Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020) that a state’s/region’s mean education is the strongest
                         correlate of upward educational mobility in India. Similarly, Güell et al. (2018) document
                         a significantly positive correlation between IM in well-being and education across Italian
                         regions.
                                 Hence, disadvantaged (from non-educated) families children are more likely to complete
                         primary school in regions with relatively higher literacy. Path dependence can reflect
                         various mechanisms. First, poverty trap dynamics that are especially salient in subsistence
                         agriculture rural Africa. Second, sunk costs in large-scale investments and infrastructure.
                         Third, persistent spatial disparities in schools may be a contributing factor. Fourth, inertia
                         may result from internal migration and spatial sorting. Fifth, the estimates may partly
                         reflect human capital externalities (as Wantchekon (2019) shows in Benin).

                         3.4.3         Heterogeneity

                         We explored heterogeneity in the old’s literacy-IM association in terms of the child’s gender
                         and the rural-urban household residence. The analysis, reported for brevity in Appendix
                         E.4, reveals two noteworthy patterns. First, the association between IM and the share of


                                                                                                        15

                       The figures plot district-level upward IM (left panel) and downward IM (right panel)against the share of the “old” generation
                       with completed primary education (α̂ocr ) net of census and cohort effects. The figures also show the unweighted linear regresion
                       line fit, net of country fixed effects; α̂ycr = αc + β × α̂ocr + cr . Dots are color-coded by African region.




                            literate old applies to both genders though it is somewhat stronger for girls. Second, while
                            inertia is present for both rural and urban households, the educational fate of the young
                            generation appears more sensitive to the old’s heritage in rural places.

                            3.5       Summary
                            The mapping of the spatial distribution of educational opportunity across Africa reveals
                            new regularities. First, there are wide differences in IM across countries. Second, within-
                            country regional disparities in IM are large, especially in low education/income countries.
                            Third, upward mobility is higher and downward IM lower for urban households. Forth,
                            gender disparities are, on average, small, but in the Sahel and North Africa, it is harder for
                            girls of uneducated parents to complete primary schooling. Fifth, upward IM is strongly
                            linked to the average parental education in the region. Likewise, downward IM is negatively
                            correlated to the literacy of the old generation, though this association is less strong. Sixth,
                            inertia is more substantial for rural, as compared to urban households. These patterns
                            suggest slow convergence,                 17    as improvements in educational attainment among illiterate
                            households are larger in regions with relatively higher human capital levels. Persistence
                            may stem either from regions’ independent impact on educational mobility or from spatial
                            sorting. We return to this question in section 5.


                            4         Correlates of Intergenerational Mobility
                            In this Section, we explore the correlates of regional IM, aiming to characterize its ge-
                            ography. We run univariate specifications linking IM to geographical, historical, and
                            at-independence variables, discussed in the research on the origins of African development
                            and studies on mobility outside Africa. [Appendix F provides variable definitions and
                                17
                                In Alesina et al. (2020b) we show that terms typically estimated in education-growth-convergence
                            regressions have a natural connection to absolute upward and downward IM. Our approach therefore
                            connects to studies on educational convergence.


                                                                                                           16
        sources.] As the literacy of the old generation correlates strongly with IM, we also re-
        port specifications conditioning on it. The correlational analysis, albeit simple, is useful
        to illustrate whether the geographic and historical factors are associated with contempo-
        rary IM only through their correlation with initial conditions (education of the old) that
        still matter due to inertia, or whether they correlate with the rate at which educational
        endowments are transmitted intergenerationally above and beyond their association with
        the initial conditions. Figures 9 plot the (unweighted) within-country standardized corre-
        lation (”beta”) coefficients between upward and downward IM with the various features.
        Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The Appendix reports permutations:
        (i ) adding province constants to condition on more localized, time-invariant features. (ii )
        dropping North African countries, as their historical development differs from Sub-Saharan
        Africa; (iii ) excluding regions with cohabitation below 80%.

4.1    Development At Independence
We commence examining the association between IM and proxies of economic development
in the 1950s-1960s when most African countries turn independent. Figures 9 (a)-(b)
plot the correlations. We first explore how IM relates to (the log of) population density
in 1950, that we take as a proxy for local development. Population density correlates
positively and significantly with upward IM and negatively with downward IM. This result
may not be surprising, as population density and the literacy of the “old” generation are
strongly correlated. Coefficients decline once we account for the latter, though they retain
significance. Population density correlates more strongly with upward -as compared to
downward- IM (“beta” coefficients of 0.074 and −0.04). A similar pattern obtains when
we look at urbanization.
    Motivated by the literature on structural transformation in Africa (e.g., McMillan,
Rodrik, and Verduzco-Gallo (2014)), we explore the correlation between IM and the em-
ployment shares across broad economic sectors.18 Agricultural employment is negatively
correlated with upward mobility and positively correlated with downward mobility; these
patterns hold when we condition on the literacy of the “old”. The specifications using the
labor share in services or manufacturing on the RHS yield a “mirror” image.19

4.2    History
Figures 9 (c)-(d) plot the correlations between IM and historical variables.

    Colonial Roads and Railroads                Colonial railroads and roads have played an impor-
tant role in African countries’ post-independence development (e.g., Jedwab and Moradi
(2016)). Log distance to colonial railroads is significantly related to both upward and
downward IM, even conditional on the old’s literacy. Districts that are one standard de-
viation closer to colonial railroads have, on average, 0.08 standard deviation higher levels
of upward and lower levels of downward mobility. The estimates are virtually unchanged
when we explore within-province variation.

    Colonial Missions           Earlier studies uncover positive effects of Christian missionary
activity on education (e.g., Wantchekon, Klašnja, and Novta (2015)). We examine the
correlation between IM and proximity to colonial missions using data from Nunn (2010)
and Cagé and Rueda (2016). There are 1, 321 (361 Catholic, 933 Protestant, 27 British and
Foreign Bible Society) and 723 (Protestant only) missions in these datasets, respectively.
Proximity to Christian missions correlates significantly with “old’s” literacy rates (results
not shown). The Figures illustrate a significantly positive (negative) association between
proximity to missions with upward (downward) IM. When we condition on the literacy of
the “old”, the distance coefficient declines in absolute value but retains significance (beta
0.07). While data on missions are coarse (Jedwab, zu Selhausen, and Moradi (2018)), the
  18
     We use data for individuals born before 1960. To abstract from migration, we focus on individuals
residing in their birth district (the results are similar if we use all individuals). As we lack migration data
for Lesotho, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe, the sample spans 24 countries.
  19
     These results square with the concurrent analysis of Asher, Novosad, and Rafkin (2020), who document
higher relative upward educational mobility rates in urban -manufacturing-service-oriented Indian districts
as compared to those specializing in agriculture.

analysis suggests that investments by Christian missions have lasting consequences, both
by shaping initial literacy which in turn increases educational mobility and by directly
influencing mobility.

   Precolonial Political Centralization We then explored the correlation between
IM and pre-colonial political centralization that correlates with regional contemporary
development (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013)). We associate IM with log distance
to the centroid of the nearest pre-colonial kingdom/empire using data from Brecke (1999)
and to pre-colonial states using Murdock (1967) (though data are missing for parts of the
continent). Distance to pre-colonial states is not a robust correlate of IM.

4.3   Geography
Figures 9 (e)-(f) plot the within-country correlations between IM and geographic, location,
and ecological features.

   Distance to the Capital         Much evidence documents the limited ability of African
states to broadcast power outside the capitals (e.g., Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
(2014)). During colonization, the limited public goods were confined to the capital and a
few urban hubs. The literacy of the “old” is much higher in the capital than the hinter-
lands; similarly upward IM also declines further from the capital city. The standardized
coefficient drops, once we condition on the literacy of the “old”, from −0.29 to −0.094,
though it remains precisely estimated. The patterns are similar with downward mobility.

   Distance to the Border         African borders appear unruly and conflict prone, as they
often partition ethnic groups (e.g., Alesina, Easterly, and Matuszeski (2011). Nevertheless,
there is no systematic association between IM and distance to the border.

   Distance to the Coast Economic activity in Africa is concentrated along the coast-
line. Thus, literacy falls once one moves inland (results not shown). Proximity to the
coast relates to the presence of Europeans and associated investments during coloniza-
tion, but also to the intensity of slave raids. Upward (downward) educational mobility is
significantly higher (lower) in coastal areas. The coefficient retains significance when we
condition on the literacy of the old.

   Malaria     We associate IM with an index reflecting a district’s malaria ecology that
has been linked to Africa’s underdevelopment (e.g., Gallup and Sachs (2001)). Malaria
correlates strongly with IM; the association operates above and beyond initial differences
in literacy (that correlate with malaria).

   Land Quality for Agriculture Upward IM is somewhat higher and downward
IM is lower in regions with high-quality land, but the correlations do not pass standard
statistical significance thresholds.




                                             19
       Ruggedness We then examined the association between IM and ruggedness that
correlates positively with cross-country economic performance in Africa, as rugged terrain
shielded regions from slave raids (Nunn (2008)).20 Moreover, as malaria is pervasive in the
lowlands, populations in mountainous terrains are less affected. There is a positive and
significant association between terrain ruggedness and the literacy of the “old” generation.
Upward IM is significantly higher and downward IM is lower in rugged regions. The
correlations remain significant when we control for the old generation’s literacy, which is
higher in regions with rugged topography. These results add to Nunn and Puga (2012)
that across African countries ruggedness correlates positively with output.

       Natural Resources The “natural resource curse” literature links conflict and un-
derdevelopment to oil, diamonds, and precious minerals (e.g., Berman et al. (2017)). The
association between IM and the presence of oil fields or diamond mines is weak and never
passes significance thresholds. This most likely reflects opposing mechanisns, as natural
resource wealth also spurs human capital accumulation and structural transformation in
Africa (Hohmann (2018b)).

4.4      LASSO Estimates
We also employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), a simple
machine learning method that is useful in detecting robust predictors in the presence of
multi-collinearity and measurement error. The LASSO analysis -reported in Appendix
F.2- reveals some interesting patterns that complement the univariate correlations. First,
distance to colonial railroads and distance to the capital are the most important fea-
tures predicting IM; this result suggests that colonial transportation investments, though
overall small and mostly connecting ports with mineral rich interior areas, had lasting
consequences. Second, proximity to natural resource and precolonial states have minimal
power predicting IM. Third, terrain ruggedness, distance to the coast, and malaria ecology
lie in-between, carrying some modest power predicting regional IM. Fourth, proximity to
Protestant missions is a robust predictor of IM, while proximity to Catholic missions drops
out of the empirical model once regularization increases.

4.5      Summary
Colonial railroads, proximity to the capital, and to (Protestant) missions correlate strongly
with mobility. Geographic aspects, terrain ruggedness and malaria ecology are also rele-
vant in characterizing educational mobility. In contrast, natural resources, proximity to
borders and precolonial statehood do not seem to play a role. As these variables also cor-
relate with the old generation’s literacy, which is the most influential covariate of mobility,
when we condition on it, the coefficients drop roughly by two-thirds. These patterns sug-
gest that geography and history mostly matter by shaping at-independence development
  20
    We also run specifications using regional proxies of slave trade intensity using data from Nunn (2008)).
The data are, however, not well-suited for our analysis. First, the data are at the ethnicity rather than the
region level. Assigning them to contemporary regions overlapping historical homelands using ethnographic
maps introduces error. Second, the ethnicity data do not cover the Trans-Saharan and the Red Sea slave
trades that are relevant for Ethiopia, North, and South Sudan, Mali, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal.

5         Regional Childhood Exposure Effects
Does the environment “cause” mobility? To answer this question, we follow the approach
of Chetty and Hendren (2018a) and exploit differences in the timing of children’s moves
across districts to isolate regional childhood exposure effects from sorting. This approach
compares the educational attainment of children whose families moved to a better/worse
region -in terms of average mobility- at different ages to identify the rate at which their
attainment converges to that of permanent residents. If regions affect individual mobility,
this effect should be stronger, the longer the exposure to the new environment.
         We first describe the semi-parametric specification, discuss the identifying assumptions,
and report the results. Second, we present parametric estimates, explore heterogeneity,
and summarize the sensitivity checks. Third, we isolate moves due to displacement shocks
in the origin and use past migration destinations to “instrument” for the location of moving
families to advance on causation.

5.1         Baseline Semi-Parametric Estimates

5.1.1        Specification

For children who moved from place of birth o to destination region d at age m, their
attainment can be expressed as follows:


                                                           18
                                                           X
                  IM upihbmcod = [ψh + ] αob + αm +              βm × I(mi = m) × ∆odb
                                                           m=1
                                        B
                                        X
                                    +          κb × I(bi = b) × ∆odb + ihbmcod ,                     (5)
                                        b=b0


         The dependent variable equals one if child, i, born in cohort b in country c to illiterate
household h, completes primary education (or higher) and zero otherwise (upward IM).
The variable of interest, ∆odb , denotes the difference between upward educational mobility
of permanent residents in the destination minus origin for children born in cohort b:
                                            c upnm − IM
                                     ∆odb = IM       c upnm .
                                                bd       bo


         Average region-cohort upward IM, computed among non-movers (individuals residing
in their place of birth at the time of census), is a sufficient statistic summarizing the eco-
nomic and social environment that shapes educational decisions. We estimate a different
slope, βm , for each age of move (years 1 to 18) controlling for any direct effect via age
of move constants, αm ; these capture disruption effects and any other age-specific un-
observed feature that affects the education trajectory. Origin-region×birth-decade fixed
effects, αob , account for unobserved factors of the child’s birthplace at the time of birth.
    21
   Two caveats apply here. First, these correlations do not imply causal effects. Second, the correlations
may reflect differential measurement error across the various regressors and the education of the old.




                                                      21
We add interactions of destination-origin differences in cohort-specific IM with cohort ef-
fects, to partly account for potential differential measurement error across cohorts and
other trends (this has no effect). The intuition of the above specification is that if children
move from regions with worse to places with better educational opportunities (∆odb > 0),
and exposure matters, the earlier the move, the greater the effect of the region. Since
the specification includes (3, 231) origin-cohort fixed effects, variation comes from children
born in the same place in the same decade, who move to regions with different mobility.22
Modeling exposure effects in proportion to years spent in destination follows Chetty and
Hendren (2018a), who derive a similar parsimonious relationship from a generic setting of
exposure effects.
    The age-specific slopes, βm , are identified even in the presence of sorting; i.e., parents
without primary schooling, but with a higher propensity to educate their children, are
more likely to move to regions with better opportunities. The identifying assumption is
that the timing of the move is uncorrelated with latent children’s ability. In other words,
parents more likely to invest in their children’s education can move from worse to better
environments, on average; but the more “ambitious” parents should not move earlier. Since
this is a restrictive assumption, we relax it estimating a household fixed-effects variant of
equation (5), with ψh . In these models, the age-specific slopes, βm , reflect the extent to
which educational attainment differences between siblings relate to the regional gap at the
age of move, interacted with differences in the mobility of permanent residents between
origin and destination, (m1 − m2)∆odb . The identifying assumption is that households
who move to places with higher (lower) upward mobility do not do so to favor some of
their children. We return to this issue below.

5.1.2    Sample and Descriptive Statistics

In this section, we work with a sample of 16 countries (11, 169, 357 matched-to-parents
children, aged 14 − 25, whose household moved before 18) where IPUMS records the cur-
rent and birth region, and years in the current residence.23 Overall, the average (median)
migrant outflow share [number of migrants leaving a region divided by total residents]
during census years (where we observe total population) is 0.081 (0.038), while the cor-
responding mean (median) inflow share is 0.058 (0.038). These statistics are broadly in
line with the survey evidence in FAO (2017) and United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (2018). Hohmann (2018a) uses IPUMS data to estimate migration gravity
equations within African countries. He documents distance elasticities of about 1, quite
close to the estimates of migration flows across U.S. states 2005-2016.24
   22
      The only difference vis a vis Chetty and Hendren (2018a) is that we are not interacting the origin-
cohort effects αob with age-at-move m. Doing so would require adding more than 100, 000 fixed-effects,
1, 084 (regions) × 5 (cohorts) × 18 (age at move).
   23
      The countries (number of observations) [number of regions] are Benin (28,076) [76], Cameroon (38,415)
[230], Egypt (81,525) [27], Ethiopia (16,340) [87], Ghana (20,259) [10], Guinea (8,718) [34], Kenya (21,177)
[177], Morocco (27461) [58], Mali (22,256) [47], Malawi (10,986) [30], Rwanda (11,687) [103], Sudan (24,276)
[25], Togo (7,616) [36], Uganda (28,764) [56], South Africa (13,483) [9], and Zambia (45,136) [72]. For some
countries, birth is at admin-1 level, whereas residence is at admin-2 level. In other countries, region of
residence and birth are at the same level. We harmonized residence and birth region at the finest level and
end up with 1, 084 “birth/current residence regions”.
   24
      The literacy rate of the old generation for households moving to regions with higher mobility exceeds
that of the non-moving households by 21 percentage points. Moving households in destinations with lower
than the origin IM also have an old-generation literacy edge over non-moving households of 0.07. As our

                                                  odb . Panel (a) looks across the entire sample of mov-
ing children (406, 175); panel (b) looks at children of moving families that we consider in
the within-household specifications (226, 739). The mean and median are positive, .05 and
.034, respectively; on average, families move to regions with higher levels of upward mobil-
ity, though migration flows both ways. Roughly 58% move to regions with higher upward
IM. These statistics complement Young (2013) who documents substantial bidirectional
urban-rural migration flows across African regions with survey data.

Panel (b) plots the distribution for migrant children, aged 14-25, residing in a household with at least two children
of different ages at the time of the move. µ = 0.048, p50 = 0.034, σ = 0.214.




5.1.3                      Results

Figure 11 plots the age-specific exposure effects, β̂m , against the child’s age at the time
of the move. The figure uncovers two regularities: “regional exposure effects” that are
particularly strong for children aged 5 − 11 and “selection effects.” First, the slopes
are significantly positive for children moving at all ages. This applies even for children
who move at the age of 13 − 18 (β̂m ≈ 0.40). Since the destination is rather unlikely
to have a causal effect on primary school completion for children moving after the age
of 14, the estimates reflect selection. Households moving to regions with higher (lower)
IM have unobservable characteristics translating into a higher (lower) propensity that
children complete primary school. The degree of selection does not vary with children’s
age after the age of 13−14. Children who move to regions where permanent residents have
one percentage point higher upward IM have a 0.4 higher likelihood to complete primary
education purely due to spatial sorting.
                Second, the estimates reveal regional exposure effects, since moving to a better (worse)
district early in life, roughly before the age of 12, translates into a higher (lower) likelihood
of upward educational mobility. The estimates are around 0.65 for children whose family
moved before they turn 5 years old; the likelihood to complete primary schooling is 30
percentage points higher if parents move to regions with 0.5 higher levels of IM (mean
analysis focuses on children of households where the old generation has not completed primary education,
we effectively condition on such differences.

IM = .6, standard deviation = .49). As the pure selection effect is around 0.4, regional
exposure effects total around 0.25 for children moving shortly after their birth. The
relationship between age at move and exposure effects is negative, but not very steep for
children moving before 5 − 6; moving to regions with higher mobility yields almost equally
large benefits (likelihood to complete primary schooling) for children who are between 1
and 4 years old. The age at move estimates for children moving between ages 5 − 12
decline approximately linearly, revealing that the differential impact of moves in high
mobility regions is especially large for younger kids. Chetty and Hendren (2018a) define
the regional exposure effect as γm = β̂m+1 − β̂m . Regressing the slopes on the age at
move for ages 5 to 11, we obtain an estimate of about −.03. That is, for every additional
year spent in this age bracket, a child of illiterate parents sees her chances for completing
primary increase by roughly 3 percentage points. If instead we run a regression pooling
across ages 1-11, we obtain a slope of −0.022 (0.002).

5.1.4   Household Fixed-Effects Estimates

We then add to regression equation (5) family-specific constants, ψh , to exploit variation
among children belonging to the same household, who moved at different ages. Doing so,
we relax the assumption that latent family characteristics are orthogonal to the move.
   Figure 12, panel (b) plots the age-specific exposure effects, β̂m , obtained when com-
paring siblings that moved at different ages; panel (a) omits them to allow comparability
of the cross-sectional and the within-household estimates in the same sample (226, 739
children from 90, 022 households with more than one child in-between 14 − 25). First, the
selection/sorting effect, captured by the slopes after age 12, drops significantly, once we
account for unobserved family features, from 0.40 (panel (a)) to 0.078 (panel (b)). The
90% confidence intervals (not shown) include 0 for all age-of-move slopes after 12. Family

   Instead of origin-cohort fixed effects, αob , equation (6) includes birth-cohort constants
interacted with a linear-in-origin-IM term. The equation also imposes a piecewise linear
structure, allowing the regional exposure effects to differ for pre-school years (ages 1 − 4),
the ages relevant for primary school (5 − 11), and post-primary education years (12 − 18).

5.2.2   Results

Table 4 reports the results. Column (1) shows that the marginal exposure effect for
children whose families moved when the children were more than 12 years old is zero and
statistically insignificant. The marginal exposure effect for children moving before 5 is
0.019 and weakly significant. Exposure to areas with higher mobility is especially strong
for children whose (illiterate) parents move when they are in the ages critical for primary
school, roughly between 5 and 11. Reassuringly, the estimate (0.031) is similar to the semi-
parametric estimates (obtained in two steps). Column (2) shows that the coefficients for
the three age-of-move brackets are similar in the smaller sample of individuals included in
the household-fixed-effects specifications, reported in column (3). The marginal exposure
for children whose families moved when they were older than 12 is zero. The slope for
moves before 5 years is 0.006, statistically indistinguishable from zero. The slope is 0.0305,
tightly estimated for children moving between 5 and 11.

The dependent variable in all specifications is an indicator variable that takes the value of one for children of parents
without completed primary education who have completed at least primary education and zero otherwise (upward
IM). The independent variables comprise a linear origin-average-IM (calculated for the birth-cohort relevant to the
individual among non-movers) term, age-at-move indicator variables, birth-decade×destination indicators interacted
with destination-minus-origin differences in upward IM, all of which are not reported, and three linear terms for
destination-minus-origin differences in the relevant-birth-cohort-non-mover average IM for moves taking place when
the child moves, ages 1-4, 5-11, and 12-18. Double clustered at the origin and at the destination district standard
errors are reported in parentheses. ∗p < 0.1, ∗ ∗ p < 0.5, ∗ ∗ ∗p < 0.01.




5.2.3     Heterogeneity

We examined heterogeneity across children moving to regions with higher (lower) IM
than their place of birth and heterogeneity across gender, augmenting equation (6) with
interactions between the linear-in-age-at-move regional exposure effects for the three age-
of-move brackets with the respective indicator variables. For brevity we report these
results in the Online Appendix Table G.1.
    There is not much heterogeneity on regional exposure effects between moves to higher
and lower IM regions. The estimates are small and statistically insignificant for moves
after 12 or during ages 1 − 4 for both sets of children. Regional exposure effects are
around 0.03 for moves to either worse or higher IM regions. The educational loses for
children moving to worse regions before the age of 12 are roughly equal to the gains of
children moving to regions with higher IM.
    Regional exposure effects for both boys and girls moving before the age of 5 and after
the age of 12 are unstable. The regional exposure effect for primary school age for boys is
around 0.023, somewhat smaller than the baseline of 0.03. The interaction of ∆odb with
the female indicator for ages 5 − 11 is 0.01, suggesting that girls benefit (lose) somewhat
more when moving to higher (lower) mobility regions.

5.2.4     Sensitivity Analysis

The uncovered regional exposure effects and sorting are robust to various permutations
(Appendix Table G.2). These include: (i ) dropping multi-generational households; (ii )
looking only at children matched to biological parents; (iii ) dropping North Africa.




                                                          27
   Measurement Error We considered the possibility of measurement error in ∆nm
                                                                            odb
that is not unlikely. First, we miss multiple moves, as censuses just report birth and
current region. We also lack information on temporary migration. Second, as districts
are large and there is likely within-district variation, IM captures imperfectly the relevant
environments at birth and current residence. Third, as Chetty et al. (2020a) argue, the
“noise to signal ratio is likely amplified since it is identified purely from residual variation
in ∆nm
    odb , controlling for origin quality” (with the origin-cohort constants). To account for
classical measurement error in differences in regional IM we employed a 2SLS estimator
based on a sample split (see Appendix Figure G.2). The estimates increase by about 10%.
In line with error-in-variables, we obtain somewhat larger estimates when we drop regions
with few observations.

   Household Income Shocks We also looked solely across rural households, where
the old generation works in agriculture to assuage concerns that the uncovered regularities
reflect income shocks triggering the move and, at the same disproportionately, affecting
younger children. While we cannot control for household income at the timing of the
move, as we do not observe it, such income effects are likely to be at best moderate for
rural African households often engaged in subsistence farming. Appendix Table G.3 shows
that an extra year in regions with higher than the origin IM increases the likelihood that
children of rural/agriculture households will complete primary schooling in the 5 − 11 age
bracket; the marginal effect of moving after 12 is tiny, as is for moves before 5.

5.3     Endogeneity
While the inclusion of household constants accounts for time-invariant family features
that affect investments in education, time-varying factors may jointly drive household
moves and children’s educational investments in proportion to exposure to the region with
higher mobility. We address this -and related- concerns exploiting “push shocks” and
using historical migration to predict the destination of moving households.

5.3.1    Displacement (Push) Shocks

As a starting point, we look at moves that are more likely to reflect (push/displacement)
shocks exogenous to household decisions. To pinpoint anomalous periods of outflows from
the origin, we first construct an origin-district-year migration panel for each country that
covers roughly the period from 1965 until the last census year. Second, for each district,
we regress outflows on a constant and a linear time trend and obtain residuals. Third, we
sort the (standardized) residuals from highest to lowest. High (positive) residuals indicate
years of abnormally large out-migration from a given district, while low (negative) residuals
denote below trend outflows. The latter are more likely to reflect a household’s choice to
move, while the former capture irregular district out-migration shocks that are more likely
to be exogenous from the household’s viewpoint.
   Figures 13 (a)-(c) plot the parametric regional exposure effects for the three age groups
(1 − 4; 5 − 11; 12 − 18). Conservatively, we report the within-household specifications
(results are similar when we use all data and omit the household constants). In the
within-household estimates, looking at moves in years of unusually large outflows mitigates

                                              28
                                               concerns that the timing-of-move is chosen to favor some of the siblings. As we move from
                                               left to right, we successively drop observations focusing more narrowly on children whose
                                               families move in abnormal years. The left-most observation for each panel reports the
                                               benchmark estimates. The 50th percentile looks at moves that took place in years when
                                               flows have been above the historical district-specific median. The estimates of the 90th
                                               percentile look at moves that occurred during the two to five years with the highest
                                               outflows. This is because for most countries, we have outflow data for roughly 40 years.

                                      The figure shows parametric regression estimates of childhood regional childhood exposure effects concentrating, successively,
                                      on district-years that experienced increasingly larger migration outflows. Each point reports the marginal effect of an additional
                                      year of exposure in the relevant age-at-move range (with ∆odb =1). Panel (a) shows the marginal effect for ages-at-move between
                                      1 − 4, panel (b) for 5 − 11, and panel (c) for 12 − 18. The left-most point for each graph shows the baseline estimates, where no
                                      observations are dropped. The next observation uses observations from district-years with studentized outflow residuals above
                                      the 10th percentile, etc. All regressions include household fixed effects. 90% confidence bands are constructed from double
                                      clustered standard errors at the origin and destination district.



                                                        The marginal effects for moves before the age of 5 (panel (a)) and after 12 (panel
                                               (c)) are small and statistically insignificant. The marginal exposure effect is significantly
                                               positive for moves when kids are between 5 and 11. γ retains economic and statistical
                                               significance when we look at moves that most likely reflect origin-specific shocks, even
                                               when we drop 90% of the sample. These results suggest that the baseline estimates reflect
                                               regions’ independent impact on children’s educational attainment rather than unobserved
                                               time-varying household factors. Moreover, the estimates hint that the effects of moving are
                                               similar for families who decide to move for idiosyncratic reasons and displaced households
                                               (Chetty and Hendren (2018a) present similar patterns in the US).

                                               Moving households even when they relocate due to exogenous reasons, decide where to
                                               settle. If a household’s endogenous choice of destination also relates to differential invest-
                                               ments into some children, then the estimates may be biased. While the household fixed
                                               effects partially account for such concerns, the choice of destination may still be correlated
                                               with unobserved child features. We use past migration destinations from each origin to
                                               predict where moving households will settle with a “shift-share” design. The idea behind
                                               this approach is that migrants tend to settle in regions where earlier migrants from their

    Figure 14 shows a binned scatterplot of actual and historical-predicted migration. The

(3), report the “reduced-form” estimates, while columns (4)-(6) report 2SLS that combine
the “reduced-form” estimates with the “first stage”. Columns (1)-(4) and (2)-(5) report
cross-sectional estimates in the full sample of moving children and in the sample where
we compare siblings, respectively. Columns (3) and (6) report household fixed-effects esti-
mates. As the first-stage slope is approximately one, the reduced form and 2SLS estimates
are similar. The marginal impact of an additional year in the region with higher (lower)
mobility in the critical for primary schooling age is significantly positive; the estimate
is somewhat larger than the OLS, most likely because instrumentation reduces classical
measurement error (see Section 5.2.4). The corresponding to column (4) OLS estimate (in

IM of non-migrants in the migrating children’s birth decade in origin and destination. σody depends on
the number of people who moved from o to d up to w years prior to year y.

     In these specifications, Guinea and Egypt (1986) drop, because the residence tenure variable has a
maximum of 10 years and we cannot therefore construct the historical migrant share.

The dependent variable in all specifications is an indicator that takes the value of one if the child of parents
who have not finished primary education has completed at least primary schooling and zero otherwise (upward
IM). The independent variables comprise a linear origin-average-IM (calculated for the birth-cohort relevant to the
individual among non-movers) term, age-at-move indicator variables, birth-decade×destination indicators interacted
with destination-minus-origin differences in upward IM, all of which are not reported, and three linear terms for
destination-minus-origin differences in the relevant-birth-cohort-non-mover average IM for moves taking place when
the child moves, ages 1-4, 5-11, and 12-18. Columns (1)-(3) report “reduced-form” estimates, using differences in
upward mobility between origin and destination district projected by past migration. Columns (4)-(6) report 2SLS
(two-stage-least-squares) estimates, where actual differences in upward IM between origin and destination district for
moving children is “instrumented” with differences in upward IM projected based on historical migration. Standard
errors double clustered at the origin and at the destination district level are reported in parentheses below the
coefficients. ∗p < 0.1, ∗ ∗ p < 0.5, ∗ ∗ ∗p < 0.01.




5.3.3     Blending “Push” Shocks with Expected Destination

In a demanding test that blends the two approaches, we replace (or instrument) actual
differences in IM between origin and destination (∆odb ), with those predicted from his-
torical migration (E[∆odb |t−10 ]) and sequentially keep observations of moves taking place
in anomalous origin-district years. Figures 15 (a)-(c) plot the “reduced-form” estimates
for the marginal exposure effects from the parametric specification (6) for the three age
brackets. The regional exposure effect for moving children after the age of 12 is zero and
tightly estimated. The estimate for moves before the age of five is also centered around
zero, although the standard error bands are wide. The regional exposure estimate for kids
moving in-between 5 and 12 is positive, around 0.045. The coefficient retains significance
even when we drop 90% of the observations, effectively looking at children whose families
moved in the two-five most abnormal years of out-migration from their place of birth.
These estimates – that jointly account for the endogeneity of the move from district o, by
looking at years of abnormal outflows, and households’ choices of destination d, by using
historical (lagged by 10 years) migration – advance the causal intepretation of regional
childhood exposure effects.
    Sensitivity Analysis Appendix, Section G.3, reports additional results and sensitiv-
ity checks focusing on the more demanding approach that focuses on moves in years of
displacement shocks and projects households’ choices of destination with historical migra-
tion. First, the 2SLS estimates are similar to the reduced-form ones, as the first-stage is
approximately 1. Second, we obtain similar results when we omit the household constants

                                               we define “large outflows” at the country- rather than at the region-level. The regional

                                               before the age of five are positive, but statistically insignificant. The regional exposure
                                               estimate for kids moving in-between 5 and 12 hovers around 0.045.

                                               5.4             Summary
                                               This Section reveals two results: First, sorting is considerable. Second, regions matter.
                                               Children who move earlier in life to regions where residents have higher intergenerational
                                               mobility are more likely to complete primary schooling. This pattern also applies when
                                               we compare siblings. Regional childhood exposure effects are present, even when we look
                                               at moves triggered by displacement shocks at the origin and when we account for the po-
                                               tentially endogenous destination using past migration. Compared to the US evidence on
                                               region’s impact on relative (rather than absolute) intergenerational income (rather than
                                               education) mobility of Chetty and Hendren (2018a), sorting in Africa appears higher.
                                               However, regional exposure effects are similar. We also explored differences across rela-
                                               tively rich and poor African countries, finding similar in both groups selection and regional
                                               exposure effects (Appendix Figure G.3).


                                               6            Conclusion
                                               We conduct a systematic exploration of intergenerational mobility in education across
                                               African countries and districts since independence.
                                                        In the first part, we compile new estimates of absolute intergenerational mobility in
                                               educational attainment across African countries and regions, distinguishing by gender and
                                               rural-urban residence. Opportunities for upward mobility vary substantially across the
                                               continent and regions in the same country. The literacy of the “old” generation is a strong


                                                                                                                                                                                   32
predictor of both upward and downward mobility, pointing to inertia and slow conver-
gence. Persistence is more substantial for rural than urban places. Second, we explored
the geographic and historical correlates of regional mobility. Upward mobility is higher
and downward IM is lower in regions with colonial investments in railroads and those
close to Christian, mainly Protestant missions. Distance to the coast and the capital
and an ecology favorable to malaria correlate negatively with upward IM and positively
with downward IM. Upward mobility is higher in regions that were more developed at-
independence, with higher urbanization and employment in services-manufacturing. In
the third part, we distinguish between spatial sorting and regions’ independent influence
on educational mobility. We find that both sorting and regional childhood exposure effects
are at play. Boys and girls whose families move to regions with higher (lower) upward mo-
bility have a significantly higher (smaller) likelihood to complete primary schooling when
the move takes place before the age of 12 (and after 5). This pattern also applies when we
compare siblings, look at moves triggered by regional displacement shocks, and use histor-
ical migration patterns to predict moving households’ destination regions. Thus, regions
matter crucially for education in Africa, both because households with a latent propen-
sity to invest in their children’s future move to high mobility (high literacy) places and
because the environment exerts an independent impact on educational mobility. Regional
disparities are wide and unlikely to disappear unless policies specifically target them.
   Our analysis here -as well as in our companion papers Alesina et al. (2020b,a) where
we study ethnic and religious differences in educational mobility- opens several avenues
for future research. A first avenue is to examine the causal effects of historical factors
on educational mobility. Such work could combine the newly compiled IM statistics with
quasi-experimental variation to explore the economic mechanisms underlying path de-
pendence, including colonial-era investments. A second avenue is to examine the role of
nationwide educational policies, like laws on compulsory primary education, and school
construction programs (like Figueiredo Walter (2020)) for social mobility, topics largely
unexplored in the context of Africa. A third avenue is to construct measures of each re-
gion’s impact on IM following the approach of Chetty and Hendren (2018b) and explore
regional heterogeneity. Fourth, future work should investigate how the diverse set of fam-
ily structures across Africa mediate the transmission of education from one generation to
the next. It is also important to examine differences in the transmission of human capital
from mothers, fathers, and other relatives, distingusihing between boys and girls. Fifth,
as data on income start to become available, future work could study interconnections
between education and income mobility. Sixth, using finer resolution data on income,
consumption, and education one could examine their inter-relations and isolate the rela-
tive change in children’s position in the distribution from the general increase that most
African countries have experienced (using for example the bounds approach of Asher,
Novosad, and Rafkin (2020)). Finally, one could link the regional statistics to political
variables (e.g., electoral competition and participation) and leaders’ characteristics, to
study jointly regional, ethnic, and religious favoritism and discrimination.

                                             Abstract
           The Online Appendix provides additional evidence and sensitivity checks. Sec-
       tion A shows the distribution of schooling by country-birth-decade. Section B details
       the sample construction process. In Section C we report validation checks of the
       IPUMS data on education with alternative cross-country and regional statistics. We
       also explore the relationship between educational attainment and various proxies of
       well-being across African regions using all available Demographic and Health as well
       as Afrobarometer Surveys. Section D provides details on family structure and cohab-
       itation patterns across the millions of African households in our dataset. In Section
       E we report and discusses intergenerational mobility (IM) statistics, distinguishing
       between gender and rural-urban household residence. In Section F we present vari-
       able definitions and LASSO estimates for the correlational analysis where we associate
       educational mobility to at-independence, historical, and geographical features. In sec-
       tion G we describe sensitivity checks and additional results pertaining to the regional
       childhood exposure estimates.

       Keywords: Africa, Development, Education, Inequality, Intergenerational Mobility.

 A                  Education Data and Statistics
 This section presents the distribution of years of schooling by birth-cohort in Africa without
 imposing any sample restrictions, related to observing younger and older generation in the
 same household. We include all individuals aged 25 and older at the time of the census,
 using all available censuses for a given country.

                                       years of schooling
 This figure shows the cumulative distribution function for years of schooling for four birth decades since 1950 for
 ages 25+. Note that the sample is unbalanced in the sense that not all countries in the sample have a census such
 that each country is represented in every birth decade.

    The table shows how we proceed from the raw IPUMS data to the sample employed in our analysis. Columns (1) and (2) give the country and census year, respectively. Column (3) reports coverage,
    the fraction of the census obtained by IPUMS. Column (4) gives the total number of observations in the IPUMS data. Column (5) gives the number of observations with information on individual’s
    age. Column (6) gives the number of observations for which IPUMS reports both the age and education. Column (7) gives the number of observations/individuals, older than 14 years old with
    available information on age and education. Column (8) gives the number of observations/individuals in the 14-25 age range with available information on age and education, while column (9)
    reports the corresponding number for individuals in the 14-18 age range. Columns (10)-(12) are similar to (7)-(9), but also require that IPUMS reports the age and education of at least one member
    of the older generation. Columns (13)-(15) are similar to (10)-(12), but omit individuals residing in multigenerational households.

dummy, and an urban location indicator.

D         Household Structure and Cohabitation Selection
In this Section we describe the estimation of cohabitation rates and, alongside, we provide
an overview of the household structure across countries and censuses. We estimate inter-
generational mobility (IM) for boys and girls (“children”) between ages 14 and 18. We
choose this age interval because children in this age range (i) have most likely completed
primary schooling –the relevant educational cutoff for Africa in the period we study (Fig-
ure A.1)– and (ii) still largely cohabitate with their parents and other older generation
relatives. We also compile IM statistics for (young) individuals aged 14-25, as this doubles
the sample size, while cohabitation rates remain still reasonably high.

D.1        Household Structure
To estimate IM we need to observe the educational attainment of the young generation
(14 − 18 or 14 − 25-year-old) and that of the immediately older generation in a given
household.
        The starting point for the intergenerational matching is census information for each
individual’s “relationship to household head ” (we denote the head’s generation as G(0)).
Across the different censuses this variable can take as many as three dozen distinct values
including: children, parents, grandparents, nieces and nephews, grandchildren, siblings,
in-laws, etc. Some censuses provide fine classifications, distinguishing between biologi-
cal children, adopted, foster, and step-children, as, for example, the post-1995 censuses
in South Africa, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Botswana, and Zambia. However, most cen-
suses have a single “children” category. Likewise, some censuses distinguish clearly be-
tween nieces/nephews, uncles/aunts, cousins, sibling in-laws, in-laws whereas others report
a composite “other relatives (not elsewhere classified)” category that subsumes various
family relationships.1 Illustrative examples include the 1976 and the 1987 Censuses in
Cameroon that, beside the household head, only identify clearly the spouse, children, par-
ents, and then all other possible family relationships appear in a single “other relatives”
category. In an even more extreme case, the 1991 census in Botswana and the 1988 census
in Senegal report a single category of “other relatives and non relatives”.
        Using the “relationship to household head ” we assign household members to genera-
tions.

        • G(−2), that we rarely observe, consists of the household head’s grandparents and
          grand-uncles/aunts.

        • G(−1) consists of the household head’s parents, parents-in-law, and uncles/aunts
          (in-law).

        • G(0) consists of the household head, typically male, as well as his spouse, siblings,
          cousins, siblings and cousins in-law (in the censuses with fine disaggregation).

        • G(1) consists of children (biological, adopted, etc.) as well as nieces and nephews.

        • G(2) consists of the head’s grandchildren (and in a few occasions grandnephews/nieces).
    1
    The level of disaggregation also differs among non-relatives who are part of the household. These
individuals cannot be matched and so count as not co-resident.


                                                 6
   Individuals classified as “other relatives” cannot be unequivocally assigned to genera-
tions; the prevalence of this category depends (partially) on the census-specific detail. One
extreme case is that of the 2010 Census in Togo, where half of 14−18 year old are classified
as “other relatives”. To avoid misclassification due to differences in census coarseness, we
use the age of those classified as “other relatives” to assign them to generations. Specifi-
cally, we count individuals as being one generation apart if they are in-between 15 and 40
years older.

D.2    Household Arrangements for 14-18 Year Old
Table D.1 reports the relationship to household head for all 14 − 18 years old individuals
in each census. In total there are 13, 005, 949 individuals. The first column reports the
percentage of those between 14 and 18 years of age that we can assign to a generation using
only censuses’ classification on “relationship to household head ”, i.e., without using their
age. The remaining columns give the breakdown across generations (G(0), G(1), G(2)),
further distinguishing by the main categories of “relationship to household head ”. The
last row gives the pan-African averages (across 13 million observations). The following
patterns emerge.
   First, about 70% are children of the household head, and so belong to generation G(1).
An additional 1% are nieces or nephews (of the household head).
   Second, 4.8% are grandchildren of the household head, G(2); approximately half of
them cohabitate with one of their parents, who is the son or daughter of the household
head (not reported). Some of the grandchildren also reside with an uncle, aunt, or another
relative of the older generation, G1.
   Third, a few, around 2%, of 14 − 18 year old, almost exclusively men, appear as
household heads. An additional 4.8% are spouses, reflecting the low age of female marriage
in some countries, such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Cameroon, and Guinea. For
about 10% of these individuals (who are in G(0)), at least one of their parents lives in the
household, (G(−1)).
   Fourth, 10% are classified as “other relatives”. As such we cannot directly assign them
to generations; they could, for example, be nieces/nephews or son/daughter in laws, but
also young cousins, siblings, etc.
   Fifth, around 2.5% are unrelated to the household head. 1% are “friends”, “employ-
ees”, “visitors”, or live in “group quarters”. 1.5% are assigned to a catch-all “non-relatives”
category.

D.3    Cohabitation Rates
We then estimate cohabitation rates for each country-census. Table D.2 gives the esti-
mates. Column (1) reports the number of observations. In total, we have about 13 million
14 − 18 year old across the 68 censuses spanning 26 countries plus the 5 household sur-
veys from Nigeria. The sample jumps to 28, 154, 990 for the sample of 14 − 25 years old.
Column (2) shows that 94.5% of 14 − 18 year olds cohabitate with some relative(s); the
corresponding share is 92.6% in the larger sample.
   Column (3) shows the share of 14−18 year old individuals, who cohabitate with at least



                                              7
one relative of the immediately older generation (assigned either with the “relationship
to head” classification or using the age of “other relatives”). 83.8% of 14 − 18 year olds
cohabitate with an older generation relative. Coresidence rates exceed 90% in Egypt,
Morocco, and Nigeria. For most censuses cohabitation rates hover between 80% and
90%. As the quality of census information is worse in the early decades, the lowest
cohabiting rate is in Kenya in 1969 (63.3%); in the 1989, 1999, and 2009 Kenyan censuses
cohabitation rates hover around 80%. For all other censuses cohabitation rates exceed
69%. Cohabitation rates in the 14 − 25 sample are, unsurprisingly lower, on average 69%.
Setting aside the Kenyan census of 1969, cohabitation rates for 14−25 year old individuals
range from about to 55% to 85%.
   Appendix Figures D.1 (a)-(b) zoom on the family arrangements of young individuals
who reside with at least one relative from an older generation, i.e., the sample on which
IM rates are constructed. Roughly half (51% and 47%) cohabitate with both their mother
and father and an additional 8%−9% coreside with both parents and other relatives of the
immediately older generation (e.g., uncles and aunts). 25% cohabitate with one parent,
mostly the mother, though often other older generation relatives are present. About
16% − 20% live with other relatives only.
   Appendix Figure D.2 (a) reports the distribution of cohabitation rates across the 27
countries for the 14 − 18 age sample. Cross-country cohabitation rates average 82.5%;
the standard deviation is quite small. The countries with the highest cohabitation rates
are Egypt (96.5%) and Morocco (94.5%) while the countries with the lowest cohabitation
rates are Zimbabwe (70.5%) and Botswana (72.9%).
   Appendix Figure D.2 (b) plots the distribution of cohabitation rates across 2, 846
districts (mostly admin-2 units), pooling across all censuses. The mean (median) is 82.6%
(82.5%). The standard deviation is less than a tenth of the mean, 0.09. While there are
some outliers, mostly in regions with limited coverage, the p10 − p90 range is 0.71 − 0.95.
   Appendix Figure D.2 plots the evolution of cohabitation rates across districts for the
1970, 1980, and 1990 cohorts. Panel (a) looks at an unbalanced sample of districts. Panel
(b) looks at a balanced sample of 1, 760 districts from 17 countries for which we have
data for all three cohorts. The average coresidence rate increases slightly from 0.804
for the 1970 cohort, to 0.82 for the 1980 cohort and to 0.855 for the 1990-cohort. The
increase in the median is smaller (from 0.82 to 0.855), as in the earlier cohorts there are
some outliers. The standard deviation of cohabitation rates also falls and over time the
distribution becomes less skewed.

This table gives an overview of the values of the “relationship to household head” classification for individuals
aged 14-18 across all censuses. The table groups the values classifications across “generations” within the
household: “G(0)” refers to the head’s generation (e.g., spouse, siblings); “G(1)” to the generation of the
children of the head (some censuses distinguish explicitly biological and other children); and “G(2)” to the
generation of the grandchildren of the head. The table also reports the fraction of individuals who cannot be
placed on the “generation-ladder” [“G(none)”]; these consist of “relatives (not elsewhere classified)”, “employ-
ees”, and “non-relatives”. The table sorts the censuses by the fraction of observations that can be “assigned”
to a generation using solely the “relationship to household head” classification.

                  E     IM Across Countries and Regions
                  This Section reports additional measures of intergenerational mobility (IM), distinguishing
                  across gender, rural-urban residence, and family structure. It also gives further descriptive
                  evidence.

                  E.1    IM by Household Structure
                  We compute upward IM and downward IM for the 1990s cohort, which has the broad-
                  est country-coverage, for individuals who cohabitate with “older” generations of different
                  types. In particular, we compute IM for children cohabiting (i) only with biological par-
                  ents, (ii) only with older relatives other than biological parents (e.g., aunts, uncles), and
                  (iii) with biological parent(s) and other older generation relative(s). For comparability,
                  figure E.1 below also reports the baseline IM measure, estimated for young individuals
                  residing in all types of households. Table E.1 gives the cross-country correlations of IM
                  statistics across the different types of family structure.

                                     and those living in urban and rural locations aged 14-18. Columns (1) and (2) give the estimates for upward IM for
                                     boys and girls, respectively. They reflect the likelihood that children, whose parents have not completed primary
                                     schooling will manage to complete at least primary education. Columns (4) and (5) give the corresponding estimates
                                     for individuals residing in urban and rural locations at the time of the census. Columns (5) shows the mobility
                                     gap, subtracting the female from the male estimate and column (6) shows the urban minus rural gap. Countries
                                     are sorted from the lowest to highest male-female IM gap (column (5)). “mean” gives the simple average of the 27
                                     country-estimates.

        The figures plot the gap in upward IM between boys and girls (panel (a)) and individuals growing up in urban and rural
        households (panel (b)) against the logarithm of real GDP per capita in 2008 using World Bank data (2008 is the earliest year
        for which data for all countries, including South Sudan, is available).

                         Balanced sample of 17 countries for which we have data for 1970, 1980, and 1990 birth cohort. The number of
                         districts is different for the two directions since not every region in every cohort has recorded in the census an
                         individual with the required configuration (right age range, literate or illiterate parents).




                         E.4     Heterogeneity. IM and Literacy of the Old Generation
                         Appendix Table E.4 reports un-weighted within-country regression specifications associ-
                         ating upward and downward IM with the old generation’s literacy distinguishing between
                         rural and urban households. The table also reports a Chow test of coefficient equality.
                         The old’s literacy - upward-IM correlation is considerately stronger for rural, 0.75 (in (2)),
                         as compared to urban 0.525 (in (1)) households. Columns (5)-(6) replace the country
                         fixed-effects with province constants to account for more localized features. The estimate
                         in the urban sample is 0.40, while in the rural sample it is 0.62, a significant difference.
                         The specifications with downward IM in columns (3)-(4), (7)-(8) yield similar patterns.
                         The slope is twice as large in rural as compared to urban households (0.27 versus 0.53).

    Appendix Table E.5 associates – again in an unweighted manner – upward and down-
ward IM to the literacy of the “old” generation at the regional level, distinguishing across
boys and girls. The country (province) fixed-effects coefficient in the upward IM specifi-
cation for boys is 0.66 (0.53), while for girls it is 0.78 (0.62). A Chow test of coefficient
equality suggests that the difference is statistically different than zero. Likewise, the down-
ward IM - “old” generation literacy association is somewhat steeper for girls, as compared
to boys. The difference is 0.12 in the country fixed-effects estimation, but it drops to 0.047
in the province fixed-effects specifications.

F     Correlates of IM
This Section complements the correlational analysis (Section 5 of the paper). First, we
provide variable definitions and sources for all correlates of regional mobility. Second, we
discuss and present LASSO estimates.

F.1    Variable definitions
ln(distance to the capital) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from the
district centroid to the national capital. Computed using GIS software.
ln(distance to the border) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from the
district centroid to clostest point on the national border. Computed using GIS software.
ln(distance to the coast) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from the dis-
trict centroid to clostest point on the coastline. Computed using GIS software.
ln(1+malaria stability) The natural logarithm of 1 + mean stability of malaria trans-
mission in the district. The latter variable is computed, using GIS software, as the within-
district zonal statistic of a raster provided by Kiszewski et al. (2004), which we resample
to a resolution of 30 arc-seconds prior to computing the statistic.
ln(1+agricultural suitability) The natural logarithm of 1 + mean agricultural suit-
ability in the district. The latter variable is computed, using GIS software, as the within-
district zonal statistic of a raster provided by Ramankutty et al. (2002), which we resample
to a resolution of 30 arc-seconds prior to computing the statistic.
ln(terrain ruggedness) The natural logarithm of terrain ruggedness. The latter is com-
puted using cell-level data on elevation at 30 arc-second resolution from Survey (1996).
Given the grid cell data, picture a 3×3 block of 9 cells and let er,c be the elevation of
the cell in rowqr, column c of the grid. Following Nunn and Puga (2012), we compute
                 P           Pc+1                 2
ruggedness as       i=r−1r+1  i=c−1 (ei,j − er,c ) , that is, the square root of the sum of all
the squared differences in elevation between the middle cell and the surrounding 8 cells.
oil field dummy A dummy = 1 if the district is intersected by an oil field, and zero
otherwise. Data on oil fields come from Lujala, Rød, and Thieme (2007)
diamond mine dummy A dummy = 1 if the district is intersected by a diamond mine,
and zero otherwise. Data on oil fields come from Lujala, Gleditsch, and Gilmore (2005)
ln(population density 1950) The natural logarithm of mean population density in the
district in 1950. The latter variable is computed, using GIS software, as the within-district
zonal statistic of a raster provided by Klein Goldewijk, Beusen, and Janssen (2010), which
we resample to a resolution of 30 arc-seconds prior to computing the statistic.
ln(distance to railroad) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from the district
centroid to clostest point on a colonial railroad. Computed using GIS software. Data on
colonial railroads come from Jedwab and Moradi (2016).
ln(distance to road) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from the district
centroid to clostest point on a colonial road. Computed using GIS software. Data on
colonial roads come from Jedwab and Storeygard (2018).
ln(distance to Catholic mission) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from
the district centroid to the closest Catholic Mission. Computed using GIS software. Data
on missions come from Nunn (2010).


                                              16
ln(distance to Protestant mission) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance
from the district centroid to the closest Protestant Mission. Computed using GIS soft-
ware. Data on missions come from Nunn (2010) and Cagé and Rueda (2016).
ln(distance to precolonon. empire) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance
from the district centroid to the closest pre-colonial empire. Computed using GIS soft-
ware. Data on pre-colonial empires come from Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014).
ln(distance to precolonon. state) The natural logarithm of the geodesic distance from
the district centroid to the closest pre-colonial state. Data on pre-colonial states are ob-
tained combining maps of pre-colonial ethnic homelands with the levels of jurisdictional
hierarchy beyond the local community level in Murdock (1967). Societies with 3 or 4 levels
are classified as states.
urban share (born < 1960) The share of the (non-migrant) district population born
prior to 1960 classified as urban. IPUMS census data.
agri. empl share (born < 1960) The share of the (non-migrant) district population
born prior to 1960 and working in agriculture. IPUMS census data.
manuf. empl share (born < 1960) The share of the (non-migrant) district population
born prior to 1960 and working in manufacturing. IPUMS census data.
serv. empl share (born < 1960) The share of the (non-migrant) district population
born prior to 1960 and working in services. IPUMS census data.

F.2       LASSO
Many of the variables that we consider in Section 5 to characterize the spatial distribution
of educational mobility contain measurement error and are correlated with each other.
We thus apply LASSO, a machine learning method that via regularization selects the
variables (shrinkage) most predictive of upward and downward IM (Tibshirani (1996)).
Before presenting the results, we should stress that LASSO does not aim to identify causal
effects nor provide unbiased estimates of linear regression coefficients. The objective is
providing parsimonious empirical models that predict well regional IM.
       We compute the LASSO path using Least Angle Regression (LAR, Efron et al. (2004)),
allowing λ to range from 0 (OLS) to infinity (all coefficients are set to zero).2
       Figures F.1 (a)-(b) plot the entire LASSO path for upward and downward IM, looking
at the role of the geographic and historical features. The vertical axis plots the coefficients
of the standardized variables. The vertical axis gives the ratio of the sum of the absolute
vales of the coefficients for a given λ to the OLS sum (that takes the maximum value). The
graphs should be read from right, no regularization (OLS), to left (regularization results
in all parameters to be zero). Moving from right to left, more variables drop from the
model; the last variables that drop out are the “strongest” predictors of mobility.




   2
    We also computed the “optimal” degree of regularization through K-fold cross-validation. We split
the data into 10 (5) equal size bins of districts; for a given value of λ we fit (train) the model in 9 (4)
bins, then take out-of-sample fits in the remaining bin, and compute the forecast accuracy with the mean
square error criterion. Repeating this process for a grid of 100 values of λ, we take the value that yields
the lowest error. The cross-validation routine yields β/ max |β| around 0.8.

                             While the number of observations is quite small for “machine learning” type algo-
                      rithms, LASSO is useful pinpointing the relatively more important predictors of mobility.
                      The LASSO analysis with upward IM yields some noteworthy features. First, in line with
                      the univariate correlational analysis, natural resource indicators and proximity to pre-
                      colonial states are the variables with the least explanatory power. Second, proximity to
                      colonial railroads is the most important predictor of upward mobility, hinting that these
                      investments, though overall small, had sizable lasting consequences. Third, proximity to
                      the capital is also an important predictor of upward IM. Fourth, proximity to Protes-

                                                                             18
tant missions is a robust predictor of upward IM, way more than proximity to Catholic
missions that drops out of the empirical model once regularization increase. While these
results do not have a causal interpretation, they add to the literature assessing the legacy
of Protestant and Christian missions. Note that the univariate correlations are quite simi-
lar, showing the usefulness of complementing OLS with LASSO. Fifth, ecological features,
malaria stability, terrain ruggedness, and distance to coast are in-between suggesting some
non-negligible explanatory power.
    The patterns when we run LASSO on downward IM are similar. Distance to colonial
railroads and the capital carry the highest prediction power, while natural resources, soil
suitability for agriculture, and distance to precolonial states are the least robust predictors
of downward IM. The graph also illustrates the difference Protestant and Catholic missions;
the former being among the most important predictors of downward IM, the latter the
(second) least important.


G       Exposure Effects
This Section’s results complement the analysis in Section 5 of the paper. The sub-sections
of this appendix follow the sub-sections of the main paper. In particular, section G.1
reports tests of coefficient equality for the age-specific regional effects and some sensitivity
checks of the semi-parametric estimates in section 5.1. Section G.2 complements the
parametric estimates of section 5.2, presenting the heterogeneity analysis with respect to
gender and the direction of the move and further sensitivity checks. Section G.3 reports
additional results that exploit displacement shocks and use historical migration to predict
moves supporting the evidence in section 5.3.

This figure visualizes p-values of pairwise coefficient equality F -tests for all coefficients in the household fixed effects
specification in Figure 12 (tests for the observational estimates in the full and household-fixed effects samples yield
similar results (not reported)). Cells are shaded according to significance level:          p < 0.01,    0.01 < p < 0.05,
0.05 < p < 0.1, p > 0.1.

              This figure is based on the same specification as Figure 11 except that instead of using ∆odb , we split the sample
              of non-movers in every cohort-district in two at random and construct two measures of ∆odb , one per sample split.
              We then re-estimate the specification using all terms involving ∆odb from one of the halves as in instrument for the
              other half.

              This figure plots the estimates from the baseline semi-parametric exposure effects specification estimated, separately
              for “rich” and “poor” countries. The left column shows the estimates for rich countries, the bottom two those for
              poor countries. We use World Bank data for real GDP per capita in 1986 (the earliest year for which data for all
              countries in sample used for the exposure effects analysis are available) and use the median to make the rich/poor
              split. Accordingly, rich are, from least to most, Sudan, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Egypt, Morocco, Cameroon, South
              Africa. Poor are, from least to most, Benin, Togo, Guinea, Mali, Rwanda, Malawi, Uganda, Ethiopia.

The dependent variable in all regression is a dummy = 1 if the child has completed at least primary, and zero
otherwise (i.e. a dummy for IM). The independent variables comprise a linear origin-average-IM (calculated for the
birth-cohort relevant to the individual among non-movers) term, age-at-move dummies, birth-decade×destination
dummies interacted with destination-minus-origin opportunity differences (to capture differences in measurement
error across locations and cohorts), all of which not reported, as well as three linear terms for destination-minus-

The dependent variable in all regression is a dummy = 1 if the child has completed at least primary, and zero
otherwise (i.e. a dummy for IM). The independent variables comprise a linear origin-average-IM (calculated for the
birth-cohort relevant to the individual among non-movers) term, age-at-move dummies, birth-decadeimesdestination
dummies interacted with destination-minus-origin opportunity differences (to capture differences in measurement
error across locations and cohorts), all of which not reported, as well as three linear terms for destination-minus-
origin differences in relevant-birth-cohort-non-mover average IM for move-ages 1-4, 5-11, and 12-18. The first
two columns focus on children of agricultural workers defined by industry (column (1)) or occupation (column

residence of the household (column (3)) or by a greater than sample median rural share (column (4)). Columns
(5)-(8) focus more narrowly on the intersections of these two types of sample restrictions: Children of parents
working in agriculture (as defined by industry) and having migrated to rural areas as defined by household (column
(5)) or greater than median rural resident share (column (6)); and children of parents working in agriculture (as
defined by occupation) and having migrated to rural areas as defined by household (column (7)) or greater than
median rural resident share (column (8)). Standard errors clustered at origin- and destination-levels in parentheses.

                                      This figure shows point estimates from parametric regression estimates of exposure effects concentrating, successively, on
                                      district-years that experienced anomalously larger and large migration outflows and instrumenting the treatment ∆odb with
                                      the predicted treatment ∆ ˆ ob from the shift-share instrument (reduced form regressions). Each point represents the marginal
                                      effect of one additional year of treatment (in the relevant age-at-move range) with ∆   ˆ ob =1. Panel (a) shows the coefficient
                                      estimates for ages-at-move 1-4, panel (b) those for 5-11, and (c) those for 12-18. To identify outflow-years as anomalous, we
                                      contruct a district-year migration outflow panel. For each district, we then regress these migration outflows on a constant and
                                      a linear time trend and obtain the studentized residuals from the regression. We then rank these residuals, within a district,
                                      from lowest to highest. District-years with high positive residuals experienced migration outflows above trend, and those with
                                      negative residuals experienced outflows below trend. We then run the baseline parametric regressions but successively focus
                                      on only those district-year observations that have a minimum percentile rank of at least X. The left-most observation for each
                                      graph shows the baseline estimates where no observations are dropped. The next observation requires the observations to
                                      come from district-years with studentized outflow residuals ranked at least at the 10th percentile within a district etc. All
                                      regressions include household fixed effects. 90% confidence bands contstructed from standard errors clustered at origin- and
                                      destination-levels are shown.

                                      This figure shows point estimates from parametric regression estimates of exposure effects concentrating, successively, on
                                      country-years that experienced anomalously larger and large migration outflows and instrumenting the treatment ∆odb with
                                      the predicted treatment ∆ ˆ ob from the shift-share instrument (reduced form regressions). Each point represents the marginal
                                      effect of one additional year of treatment (in the relevant age-at-move range) with ∆  ˆ ob =1. Panel (a) shows the coefficient
                                      estimates for ages-at-move 1-4, panel (b) those for 5-11, and (c) those for 12-18. To identify outflow-years as anomalous, we
                                      contruct a country-year migration outflow panel (we sum, country-by-country, for each year, the migration outflows from all
                                      districts). We hen regress these migration outflows on a constant and a linear time trend and obtain the studentized residuals
                                      from the regression. We then rank these residuals, within a country, from lowest to highest. Country-years with high positive
                                      residuals experienced migrant movements above trend, and those with negative residuals experienced movements below trend.
                                      We then run the the baseline parametric regressions but successively focus on only those country-year observations that have
                                      a minimum percentile rank of at least X. The left-most observation for each graph shows the baseline estimates where no
                                      observations are dropped. The next observation requires the observations to come from country-years with studentized outflow
                                      residuals ranked at least at the 10th percentile within a country etc. All regressions include household fixed effects. 90%
                                      confidence bands contstructed from standard errors clustered at origin- and destination-levels are shown.
