                                            ABSTRACT

We estimate the effects of hospital competition on the level of and the variation in quality of care

and hospital expenditures for elderly Medicare beneficiaries with heart attack. We compare

competition's effects on more-severely ill patients, whom we assume value quality more highly, to

the effects on less-severely ill, low-valuation patients. We find that low-valuation patients in less-

competitive markets receive more intensive treatment than in more-competitive markets, but have

statistically similar health outcomes. In contrast, high-valuation patients in less-competitive markets

receive less intensive treatment than in more-competitive markets, and have significantly worse

health outcomes. Since this competition-induced increase in variation in expenditures is, on net,

expenditure-decreasing and outcome-beneficial, we conclude that it is welfare-enhancing. These

findings are inconsistent with conventional models of vertical differentiation, although they can be

accommodated by more recent models.

Introduction

        Recent studies have emphasized the importance of vertical differentiation in markets for

hospital services. Yet, most analyses of how hospitals compete do not investigate competition’s

effects on hospitals’ strategic choice of quality of care. In this paper, we estimate empirically

how conventional measures of hospital market competitiveness affect the distribution across

patients of health outcomes and medical expenditures. This contributes to the existing literature

in at least three ways.

        First, different theoretical models offer opposing predictions of how competition affects

vertical differentiation. Thus, empirical evidence can be used to test such models against one

another. Second, estimates of the effect of competition on vertical differentiation are important

for policy making. For example, understanding whether competition benefits all patients equally,

or benefits some patients at the expense of others, improves the targeting and coordination of

antitrust and other health care quality regulatory policies. Third, many researchers have argued

that the substantial variation in the cost of medical care across geographic areas is socially

wasteful (see Fisher et al. 2003 for a comprehensive cataloguing of this work). Estimates of the

effect of competition on area variation in quality and cost can therefore indicate whether at least a

portion of this variation is socially constructive or harmful.

        In particular, we investigate how competition in hospital markets, as measured by a

Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI), affects the health care utilization and outcomes of essentially

all nonrural elderly individuals enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare who suffered a

new heart attack (AMI) between 1985 and 1996. We estimate the extent to which the HHI has

different effects on patients with prior year hospital utilization and those without it, holding


                                                  3
constant 5-digit-zip-code fixed effects and other characteristics of individuals and hospital

markets.     Because the health outcomes of prior-year-hospitalized AMI patients are substantially

worse (and their utilization substantially higher), we describe them as “high-risk” and their prior-

year-non-hospitalized counterparts as “low-risk.” Consistent with previous research (e.g., Capps,

Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003)), we assume that high-risk patients have a higher willingness-

to-pay for quality than low-risk patients. By examining how the HHI affects each of these two

group’s subsequent outcomes and expenditures, we explore both how competition affects

variability in quality and how this competition-induced change in vertical differentiation affects

social welfare.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section I briefly summarizes the previous research on

this subject. Section II outlines our data and models. Section III presents our results. Section IV

concludes.



I. Previous Research

       Eliminating an independent competing hospital from a market changes neighboring

hospitals’ strategic incentives, thereby changing the types of treatment, prices, and qualities that

they offer. According to this reasoning, the welfare effect of a change in competitiveness, such

as a proposed merger, is determined by comparing the quality of and expenditures on treatment

in competitive and uncompetitive markets, holding all other observed factors constant (e.g.,

Kessler and McClellan 2000).

       Yet, as Tay (2003) shows, such an analysis is not a complete description of how hospitals

compete. Quality may not be wholly endogenous. For example, if some hospitals are


                                                  4
permanently high-quality and others permanent low-quality, then the effects of mergers may not

be accurately predicted by a model that fails to account for vertical differentiation. In addition,

even if quality is endogenous, simply knowing the average or total effect of a change in

competition leaves many important issues unresolved. Changes in competition may benefit

patients in aggregate but still harm some subgroups.

        Theoretical models of vertical differentiation illustrate how this can happen.

Conventional models (e.g., Gabszewicz and Thiesse 1980 and Shaked and Sutton 1982)

emphasize how oligopoly increases quality variation at the expense of social welfare: firms try to

relax price competition though differentiation (see Tirole 1989 section 7.5.1. for an excellent

exposition of these models). In markets for hospital services, these models imply that oligopoly

hospitals lower the quality of care for low-risk (i.e., low-valuation) patients in order to be able to

charge their high-risk (i.e., high-valuation) counterparts more. In the terms of our empirical

models, less-competitive markets should have greater variation in quality and expenditures,

higher rates of mortality and cardiac complications for low-risk patients, and higher expenditures

for high-risk patients.

        In more recent work, however, Acharyya (1998) shows that without restrictions on cost

functions, uncompetitive markets may or may not have more quality variation. Indeed, in an

oligopoly model incorporating both horizontal and vertical differentiation, Anderson and De

Palma (2001) show that under certain assumptions the unique equilibrium has all firms choosing

a single (suboptimal) quality. In the terms of our empirical models, more recent work allows

less-competitive markets to have higher rates of adverse outcomes and lower expenditures for

high-risk patients, or low-risk patients, or both.


                                                     5
        In this paper, we empirically test the hypotheses of these models. We separate patients

into two groups: those with a low- versus a high valuation of quality based on a measure of their

health status at the time of onset of illness. By estimating the effect of concentration on the

mortality, cardiac complications, and medical expenditures of low- and high-valuation patients,

and for patients overall, we investigate the extent to which conventional models of vertical

differentiation explain behavior in hospital markets. In addition, these estimates allow us to

identify the welfare consequences of competition-induced variation in quality. If an increase in

variation leads to lower expenditures and better outcomes, then we conclude that it would

increase welfare. If it leads to higher expenditures and worse outcomes, then we conclude that it

would decrease welfare. If it leads to lower expenditures and worse outcomes (or higher

expenditures and better outcomes), then we calculate the implied cost per life saved to determine

its welfare effects.



II.     Data and Models

Data

        We use data from three sources. First, we use comprehensive individual-level

longitudinal Medicare claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

on the medical utilization of virtually all non-rural elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries

with a new occurrence of a heart attack (AMI) in 1985-1996. We determine whether the

individual had acute care hospital utilization in the year prior to his or her AMI as a measure of

the severity of his/her illness. We calculate several measures of utilization in the year after the

individual’s AMI, including the following: total acute and non-acute (mostly skilled nursing)


                                                  6
Medicare expenditures (including deductibles and copayments) and total acute and nonacute days

in the hospital in the year following their admission for the study illness. Measures of utilization

include all inpatient reimbursements (including copayments and deductibles not paid by

Medicare) from claims for all hospitalizations in the year following each patient’s initial

admission. Measures of the occurrence of cardiac complications were obtained by abstracting

data on the principal diagnosis for all subsequent admissions (not counting transfers and

readmissions within 30 days of the index admission) in the year following the patient’s initial

admission. Cardiac complications included rehospitalizations within one year of the initial event

with a primary diagnosis (principal cause of hospitalization) of either subsequent AMI or heart

failure (HF). Treatment of AMI patients is intended to prevent subsequent AMIs if possible, and

the occurrence of HF requiring hospitalization is evidence that the damage to the patient’s heart

from ischemic disease has serious functional consequences. Data on patient demographic

characteristics were obtained from CMS’s HISKEW enrollment files, with death dates based on

death reports validated by the Social Security Administration. The CMS HISKEW enrollment

files include demographic information on virtually all elderly Americans (including those

enrolled in Medicare HMOs) because of the extremely high rate of take-up in the Medicare

program.

       Second, we use data on U.S. hospital characteristics collected by the American Hospital

Association (AHA). The response rate of hospitals to the AHA survey is greater than 90 percent,

with response rates above 95 percent for large hospitals (>300 beds). Third, we use a hospital




                                                 7
system1 database constructed from multiple sources (see Madison 2001 for a detailed discussion).

The AHA survey contains extensive year-by-year information on hospital system membership

status. Our validity checking indicated that the universe of systems and system hospitals, and the

timing of hospitals’ system membership, as defined by AHA did not conform to discussion of

hospital systems in the trade press such as Modern Healthcare. We therefore created our own

system database based on a combination of the AHA and other sources.



Models

         We model the effect of competition on the level and the dispersion between high-risk and

low-risk patients of quality and medical expenditures. We identify the effect of competition with

an HHI that is a function of distances from each patient to his hospital choices and other

exogenous characteristics of patients and hospitals. To do this, we use a three-stage method.2

         First, we specify and estimate patient-level hospital choice models as a function of

exogenous determinants of the hospital admission decision. We do not constrain hospital

geographic markets based on a priori assumptions. We allow each individual’s potentially-

relevant hospital market for cardiac-care services to include all nonfederal, general medical

/surgical hospitals within 35 miles of the patient’s residence with at least five admissions for

AMI, and any large, nonfederal, general medical/surgical teaching hospital within 100 miles of

the patient’s residence with at least five AMI admissions. We model the extent to which


         1
         We define hospitals as members of a system if they are owned or controlled, in whole or
in part, by a common entity.
         2
        The following explanation follows the explanation in Kessler and McClellan (2000); that
paper also contains a formal derivation of these methods.

                                                  8
hospitals of various types at various distances from each patient’s residence affect each patient’s

hospital choice, and we also allow each patient’s demographic characteristics to affect her

likelihood of choosing hospitals of one type over another. The results of these models of hospital

demand provide predicted probabilities of admission for every patient to every hospital in his or

her potentially-relevant geographic market. We then estimate the predicted number of patients

admitted to each hospital in the U.S., based only on the geographic distribution and other

observable, exogenous characteristics of patients and hospitals.

        Second, we calculate measures of competitiveness that are a function of these predicted

patient flows (rather than actual patient flows or capacity), and assign them to patients based on

their probabalistic hospital of admission (rather than their actual hospital of admission). Thus,

the measure of competitiveness that we assign to each patient is uncorrelated with unobserved

heterogeneity across individual patients, individual hospitals, and geographic hospital markets.

We also calculate measures of the geographic density of the size distribution, teaching status,

system-membership status, ownership status, and bed capacity per patient using predicted patient

flows matched to each patient’s area hospital characteristics.

        Third, we use these unbiased indices of competitiveness, and interactions between these

indices and a measure of patients’ health at the time of onset of illness, to estimate the impact of

competition on the level and dispersion of adverse health outcomes and utilization, holding other

patient and area characteristics constant. In these models, observational units in our analysis

consist of individuals i=1,. . ., Nzt (in zip code z and state s during year t = 1,. . ., T) who are

initially admitted to the hospital with a new occurrence of heart attack. Each patient has

observable demographic characteristics Xizt: four age indicator variables (70-74 years, 75-79


                                                    9
years, 80-89 years, and 90-99 years; omitted group is 65-69 years), gender, and black/nonblack

race; plus a full set of interaction effects between age, gender, and race; and interactions between

year and each of the age, gender, and race indicators. Each patient has health status Aizt, where

Aizt = 1 if the patient was high-risk (i.e., had an acute care hospital utilization in the year prior to

his/her AMI). The patient then receives treatment of aggregate intensity Rizt, where R is one of

five measures. The patient has a health outcome Oizt, possibly affected by the intensity of

treatment received, where a higher value denotes a more adverse outcome (O is binary in all of

our outcome models).

        We match to each patient by zip code and year several measures of the hospital market

environment that have been shown to affect treatment and quality of care: the competitiveness of

zip code z’s hospital market at time t (HHIzt = whether z was in the top or middle quartiles of the

distribution of HHIs of predicted patient flows), and whether z had above the median density of

patients admitted to large hospitals, teaching hospitals, hospitals that were members of

multi-hospital systems, for profit versus nonprofit hospitals, and public versus nonprofit hospitals

at time t (Jzt). To measure market size and isolate the effects of competition-induced dispersion

from the effects of market-size-induced dispersion, we calculate each zip code’s bed capacity and

population at time t (Kzt and Pzt). In the presence of fixed costs, larger markets support a greater

number of firms, which can lead to an observed positive correlation between variety and

competitiveness even in the absence of any causal effect (see Berry and Waldfogel 1999 for

discussion of these models).

        We estimate linear models of outcome and utilization effects as a function of 5-digit

zip-code and year-fixed-effects (   z   and t); demographic characteristics (Xizt); health status (Aizt);


                                                     10
competitiveness (HHIzt); size, teaching, system, and ownership status distribution of area

hospitals (Jzt); and bed capacity and population at time t (Kzt and Pzt). We allow the effect of

market environment to vary depending on the individual’s health status Aizt:

               ln(Rizt)
               Oizt     =     z   +      t+ Xizt + Aizt + I(Aizt = 0)*(HHIzt + Jzt + Kzt + Pzt )
                                        I(Aizt = 1)*(HHIzt A + Jzt A + Kzt A + Pzt A) + izt,                     (1)

where Rizt is total hospital expenditures, acute care hospital expenditures, nonacute care hospital

expenditures, acute care hospital days, or nonacute care hospital days; Oizt is readmission for

AMI within 1 year, readmission for heart failure within 1 year, or mortality within 1 year; I(.) is

the indicator function; and       izt   is an independently-distributed error term, with E(   izt   |...) = 0.



III.   Results

       Table 1 presents trends in the distribution of Medicare expenditures and health outcomes

for high-risk and low-risk patients. The fraction of patients whom we classify as high-risk ranges

from 31.3 percent in 1985 (= 49441 / (108626 + 49441)) to 28.5 percent in 1996 (=44337 /

(111370 + 44337)). Our proxy for health is strongly positively correlated with age and

subsequent rates of adverse outcomes. High-risk patients are older, almost twice as likely to be

readmitted with heart failure in the year after their AMI, and fully 14.7 percentage points more

likely to die in the year after AMI (on a sample average mortality of 36.6 percent).

       Although variation in utilization between high-risk and low-risk patients has risen over

time in some dimensions, it has fallen in others. In particular, although the gap between the

number of days spent in an acute care hospital in the year after AMI by high-risk versus low-risk

patients rose from 21.3 to 27.1 percent, the gap between the total expenditures for a high-risk


                                                         11
versus a low-risk patient fell from 12.5 to 8.3 percent. This shrinking of the high-risk versus

low-risk expenditure gap is composed of a shrinking of the gap between the acute care

expenditures of high-risk versus low-risk patients (in dollar terms, from $1,615 (=$15,270 -

$13,655) to $908 (=$20,375 - $19,467)) and an expansion of the gap between the nonacute care

expenditures (in dollar terms, from $80 (=$179 - $119) to $848 (=$2,452 - $1,604)) of the high-

risk versus the low-risk.

       Table 2 presents estimates of equation (1), the effects of competitiveness and other

market characteristics on treatment intensity and health outcomes, allowing the effect of market

environment to vary depending on the individual’s health Aizt. The first row of Table 2 confirms

that prior-year acute care hospital utilization is strongly positively correlated with subsequent

intensity of treatment and rates of adverse outcomes. Holding constant their demographic

characteristics, area fixed-effects, and other market characteristics, high-risk AMI patients have

approximately 8.3 percent higher inpatient expenditures, 9.8 percent more inpatient days, 1.4

percentage points higher rates of readmission for AMI, 4.8 percentage points higher rates of

readmission for heart failure, and almost 11 percentage points higher one-year mortality in the

year after their AMI than their low-risk counterparts.

       The top panel of Table 2 shows that less-competitive markets have higher expenditures

for low-risk patients but not significantly better quality of care. Among the approximately 70

percent of patients who are low-risk, total hospital expenditures in the year after AMI were

approximately 1.3 percent higher in the least-competitive as compared to the most-competitive

hospital markets; living in a moderately-competitive market (the middle two quartiles of HHIs)

leads to almost as large of an effect on expenditures. The effect is present in both acute and


                                                 12
nonacute care settings, although substantially larger in percentage terms in nonacute care.

Effects of competition on outcomes are extremely small and statistically insignificant.

       The bottom panel of Table 2 shows that less-competitive markets have lower

expenditures on and lower quality of care for high-valuation patients. Total hospital

expenditures in the year after AMI were approximately 1.2 percent lower in the least-competitive

quartile of hospital markets, as compared to all other markets. This effect is exclusively due to

an decrease in acute care; providers in the least-competitive markets actually supply slightly

more nonacute care. In addition, competition has large and statistically significant outcome

consequences. Patients in the least-competitive hospital markets experience .82 percentage

points higher one-year mortality than do patients in the most-competitive markets; this effect is

smaller but still significant for patients in moderately-competitive markets.

       These effects are substantial. In competitive markets, the difference in expenditures

between high-risk and low-risk patients is approximately 2.5 percent higher (=1.235 - (-1.274))

than in uncompetitive markets; competition, then, expands the high-risk versus low-risk

difference in expenditures by almost one-third (on a base of 8.3 percent in 1996, table 1B). In

competitive markets, the difference in mortality between high-risk and low-risk patients is .60

percentage points lower (= -.822 - (-.221)) than in concentrated markets. In this context,

competition shrinks the high-risk versus low-risk difference in mortality by approximately 4

percnet (on a base of 14.7 percentage points in 1996, table 1B). However, these extra survivors

may be in marginal health: rates of readmission with cardiac complications are significantly

higher in more-competitive hospital markets. This qualification should be interpreted with some

caution, since readmission rates measure health outcomes only imperfectly: they represent a


                                                13
combination of the effect of competition on health and the effect of competition on hospital

utilization conditional on health.

       Other market characteristics affect both quality and expenditures. Most importantly,

patients from areas with a high density of teaching hospitals have better health outcomes,

regardless of their health status on admission. Low-risk patients from high-teaching-hospital

areas have .37 percentage points lower mortality, and no higher rates of readmission with cardiac

complications; high-risk patients from these areas have approximately the same mortality

advantage, although they do suffer from higher complications rates. For low-risk patients, this

quality advantage is achieved without any increase in expenditures; for high-risk patients, it is

associated with an approximately 1.6 percent increase in total expenditures.

       Hospital ownership affects medical expenditures, but not quality of care. For both high-

risk and low-risk patients, areas with an above-median density of public hospitals provide more

acute but less nonacute care; conversely, areas with an above-median density of private for-profit

hospitals provide more nonacute but less acute care.

       Areas with a high density of large hospitals provide more acute care to low-risk patients,

but less acute (as measured in days) and less nonacute care to high-risk patients. For high-risk

patients, this hospital-size-induced reduction in care has important outcome implications -- .44

percentage points higher mortality. Areas with a high density of system hospitals provide both

less acute and less nonacute care to low-risk patients, but less acute and more nonacute care to

high-risk patients. For low-risk patients, this hospital-system-induced reduction in care has small

but statistically significant outcome implications – .15 percentage points higher rates of

readmission with heart failure.


                                                 14
       These estimated effects of competition and other market characteristics are not simply

due to market size. The models underlying the estimates in table 2 control for both area bed

capacity and population. Estimates of the effects of capacity and population are consistent with

earlier work (Kessler and McClellan 2000), which finds that higher levels of bed capacity per

patient (approximately equal to the difference between the coefficients on capacity and

population from table 2) lead to significantly higher levels of expenditures, lower rates of cardiac

complications, and higher rates of mortality.



III.   Conclusion

       Assessing the role of vertical differentiation in markets for hospital services is an

important special case of a difficult general problem in industrial organization. Economic

theorists have developed numerous models of the effects of competition on the distribution of

qualities in a market, but the conclusions of these models are extremely sensitive to their

underlying assumptions. More recently, empirical researchers have begun to investigate the

consequences of competition for variety generally (see the literature review in Berry and

Waldfogel 2003), but data limitations have made explicit welfare conclusions difficult (with

some important exceptions, such as Berry and Waldfogel 1999). Because objective measures of

health outcomes, such as mortality, are available in observational data bases, markets for health

care provide an ideal case for study of this issue.

       In this paper, we investigate the effects of competition on the level and dispersion of

quality and expenditures with longitudinal data on virtually all non-rural elderly fee-for-service

Medicare beneficiaries with a new occurrence of a heart attack (AMI) in 1985-1996. Our


                                                  15
measure of dispersion is the difference in quality and cost between patients who have different

severities of illness, and hence different valuations of quality, but are otherwise demographically

and locationally similar. We separate patients into a low-risk or low-valuation and a high-risk or

high-valuation group based on the presence of acute care hospital utilization in the year prior to

AMI (approximately 30 percent of elderly AMI patients have prior-year hospital utilization); we

control for patient characteristics, the characteristics of area hospital markets, and area fixed-

effects.

           We find that low-risk patients in less-competitive markets receive more intensive

treatment than in more-competitive markets, but have statistically similar health outcomes. In

contrast, high-risk patients in less-competitive markets receive less intensive treatment than in

more-competitive markets, and have significantly worse health outcomes. Since this

competition-induced increase in variation in expenditures is, on net, expenditure-decreasing and

outcome-beneficial according to the estimates in Table 2,3 we conclude that it is welfare-

enhancing.

           These findings are inconsistent with conventional models of vertical differentiation,

although they can be accommodated by more recent models. In conventional models, firms try to

relax price competition though differentiation. This implies that oligopoly hospitals lower the

quality of care for low-valuation patients in order to be able to charge their high-valuation

counterparts more, leading less-competitive markets in general to have greater variation in



           3
         Based on 1996 average total hospital expenditures of (Table 1B), more concentrated
markets lead to expenditure increases (decreases) of approximately $274 per low-risk (high-risk)
patient (274 = .013*21,070 = .012*22,827), which implies an aggregate expenditure increase of
approximately $110 per patient (110 = .7*274 - .3*274).

                                                   16
quality and expenditures. But empirically, oligopoly hospitals offer a lower quality of care for

high-risk patients at lower cost, and offer their low-risk patients roughly the same quality at

higher cost, leading less-competitive markets to have less variation in quality and cost.

       The intuition in Anderson and De Palma (2001) explains how oligopoly could lead to

lower levels of quality without an increase in its dispersion. Suppose that all hospitals were

high-quality, and that this were optimal. If one hospital switched to being low-quality, both its

revenues and costs would decline, but the remaining high-quality firms would raise their prices in

the sub-game equilibrium, because of the decrease in competition. This secondary effect

increases the low-quality hospital’s profits since low- and high-quality goods are substitutes.

Because the private decline in the profits of the switcher would be smaller than the social loss, it

may be profitable to switch, even though it is not optimal. Since the same argument applies to all

remaining firms, the level of quality could decline without an increase in its dispersion.

       We find no evidence of a welfare downside to competition through increased wasteful

treatment variation, as some theoretical models suggest. In addition to confirming that

competition is socially beneficial on average (e.g., Kessler and McClellan 2000), we find no

evidence that competition generates aggregate benefits at the expense of a subsample of patients.

       If anything, bias due to endogeneity in our measure of illness severity – whether the

patient had prior-year utilization – would lead us to the opposite conclusion. To the extent that

competition affects utilization before the onset of illness the same way it affects post-onset

utilization, higher levels of utilization in uncompetitive markets would lead marginally low-risk

patients to be re-classified as high-risk (because they would be more likely to experience

utilization in the year prior to their AMI). In this case, both low-risk and high-risk patients


                                                 17
would appear to have better outcomes in uncompetitive markets.

       Other market characteristics also affect variation in treatment, and in turn welfare, in

hospital markets. The presence of for-profit hospitals in a market, for example, leads to market-

wide reductions in various measures of the average level of treatment intensity, but no significant

aggregate or differential (between high-risk and low-risk patients) increases in rates of adverse

health outcomes. How competition and other market characteristics interact to affect variation in

cost and quality, in a model with both horizontal and vertical differentiation, is an important

topic for further study.
