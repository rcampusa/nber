                                              ABSTRACT

Many developing countries would like to increase the share of modern or formal sectors in their employment.
One way to accomplish this goal may be to encourage the entrance of foreign firms. They are typically
relatively large, with high productivity and good access to foreign markets, and might therefore be
better at creating jobs than domestic firms are. However, previous research on the issue has been limited
by the paucity of long data sets for firm operations.

We examine employment growth in Indonesia in a large panel of plants between 1975 and 2005, and
especially in plants taken over by foreign owners from domestic ones. Employment growth is relatively
high in foreign-owned establishments, although foreign firms own relatively large domestic plants,
which in general grow more slowly than smaller plants. For plants that change the nationality of ownership
during our period, we find a strong effect of shifts from domestic to foreign ownership in raising the
growth rate of employment, but no significant effects of shifts from foreign to domestic ownership.

The faster growth of employment in the foreign-owned plants in general is concentrated in the takeovers,
especially in the year of acquisition. Foreign takeover of a domestically-owned plant, on average, brings
a large immediate expansion of employment.

1. Introduction

        One of the possible consequences of inward foreign direct investments (FDI) for

developing countries, and one that is of particular interest to their governments, is the

extent to which the investment creates new jobs in the industrial, or “modern” sector, to

help in the transformation of the economies. Lewis’ (1954) notion of a need to move

people out of agriculture and into the modern sector is still a goal for many developing

countries (Asian Development Bank, 2005). There are several ways in which inward FDI

might play this role.

        There is considerable evidence that foreign-owned firms are relatively efficient,

and may for that reason have access to foreign markets that would not be within the reach

of domestically-owned firms. They may also have wider contacts and knowledge of

world markets and better access to financing, all advantages that should provide a

positive effect on their employment.1 On the other side, the foreign-owned firms may

compete with domestically-owned firms for some markets, so that the losses of

employment by domestically-owned firms may offset, to some extent, the gains in the

foreign-owned firms. In addition, the foreign-owned firms may tend to be more capital-

intensive than domestically-owned firms, and more intensive in the use of imported

intermediate products, so that an increase in their sales adds less to employment than

would a corresponding increase by domestically-owned firms.

        In this paper, we use Indonesian manufacturing plant level data between 1975 and

2005 to analyze the effect of FDI on employment. We first compare rates of employment

                                                                                                       2
growth in foreign-owned and domestically-owned plants.             Second, we examine

employment growth after foreign acquisitions of domestically-owned establishment and

domestic acquisitions of foreign-owned establishments. These observations hold constant

the identity of the individual establishment, although not its characteristics. If foreign

ownership provides superior technology or better access to world markets, establishments

should tend to raise their employment after foreign takeovers. If these advantages require

continued foreign ownership, there may be employment losses when a foreign-owned

establishment is acquired by a domestic firm. On the other hand, if the technological or

other gains from foreign ownership are retained in the establishment, its level and growth

of employment may continue after a domestic acquisition.

       Acquisitions may not be random with respect to the prospects for the target

establishment. In order to control for unobservable firm characteristics that could involve

selection bias in foreign acquisitions, we combine propensity score matching techniques

with the more general difference in differences estimator. To test whether any effects are

due to changes between foreign and domestic ownership, we examine both domestically-

owned establishments that are acquired by foreign owners and foreign-owned

establishments that are acquired by domestic owners.




2. Foreign plants in Indonesian manufacturing


       We analyze Indonesian manufacturing data supplied by the Indonesian Statistical

Office for the period, 1975 to 2005 for all manufacturing plants with more than 20




                                                                                         3
employees. A plant identification code enables us to construct a panel and follow

individual plants over time.


       Employment in manufacturing plants with more than 20 employees increased

from fewer than seven hundred thousand in 1975 to about 4 million in 1997 and later

years (Figure 1). That growth was driven mainly by a strong increase in employment in

domestically-owned private plants, which remained close to three quarters of all plants

during the entire period. Foreign establishments have played an increasing role in

Indonesian manufacturing employment. Plants with some foreign ownership, accounting

for less than 10 percent of manufacturing employment in 1975, employed around 20

percent in 1997, at the time of the Asian crisis. After that the share declined slightly, but

then recovered to 20 percent again in 2005. The share of government-owned plants, much

larger than that of foreign plants in 1975, shrank steadily after the late 1980s, and was

only 5 percent of manufacturing employment in 2005.

       The industry sectors and the ownership groups differed in some important aspects.

One extreme difference was in size: government-owned plants were far larger than

domestically-owned private plants, five times as large, on average, in 1975 and still over

three times as large in 2005. They were much larger also within the industry groups, with

a few exceptions (Table 1). Foreign-owned plants were also much larger than

domestically-owned private plants, about three times as large in both beginning and end

years. In 2005, the foreign-owned plants were larger than domestically-owned private

plants in every group. The size disparity may be an element in the frequency and success

of takeovers.




                                                                                           4
       To the extent that we can associate the share of blue-collar workers in total

employment with the average skill level in an establishment, it appears that foreign firms

tended to use a slightly higher skill labor force than private domestic firms in the same

industry. Government-owned plants operated with the lowest proportions of blue-collar

workers consistently across almost all industries. Only government-owned plants

employed work forces made up to the extent of 30 percent or more of white-collar

workers, almost 40 percent in a few cases, while private domestic plants employed more

than 20 percent white-collar workers in only one industry group in one year.

       The changes in the share of Indonesian manufacturing employment in foreign-

owned plants, discussed above, came about in several different ways.            One was

takeovers of domestically-owned plants by foreign firms, offset by takeovers of foreign-

owned plants by Indonesian owners. Another was the establishment of new plants by

foreign owners and the demise of existing plants A third source of change was any

differences in average rates of growth in employment between locally-owned and

foreign-owned plants.


       These different sources of growth of employment in foreign owned plants are

shown in Table 2. Up through 1989, foreign takeovers accounted for a large part of total

growth in employment in foreign-owned manufacturing establishments, but they were

offset by declines in such employment from local takeovers of foreign-owned plants.

After 1989, the foreign takeovers added more to the foreign-owned share than the

domestic takeovers took away.


       The path of takeover activity between foreign and domestic owners, in terms of

numbers of takeovers, is described by Figure 2. The numbers of takeovers had been


                                                                                        5
fairly similar in the two directions until the 1990s, but since then, foreign takeovers have

been more numerous, except in 1997, during the Asian crisis. However, the net effect of

foreign and domestic takeovers was less important as a source of employment growth in

foreign-owned establishments than the combination of the establishment of new foreign-

owned plants and their more rapid growth.




3. Econometric approach

         We begin the econometric analysis by treating growth in employment as a

function of various plant characteristics:


         Δln Lit  ln Lit  ln Lit1  α  λPlantit1   βwOwnership
                                                                    i   t Year_ dummy 
                                                                                             ,   (1)
                βind Ind _ dummyj   R Reg_ dummy εit

where i indexes firms, and t indexes year.


         The variables included in the model are:


L:                  Employment.

Plant:              A vector of lagged plant characteristics, i.e. plant size measured by

                    employment, energy intensity (quantity of energy per employee), which

                    is a proxy for physical capital intensity, and inputs of intermediate

                    goods, defined as raw materials, fuel, and lubricants, per employee

Ownershipi :        Ownership dummy variables indicating three ownership categories,

                    private domestically-owned, private foreign-owned, and government-

                    owned.



                                                                                                  6
Dummy variables for year, industry (two-digit ISIC), and region (provinces aggregated

                 into 5 regions).


The plant control variables might be endogenously determined and we try to control for

this possibility by lagging them one period. Hence, we assume that growth in

employment between period t and t+1 is caused by, for instance, the size in period t.

Labor productivity, as measured by value-added per employee, was included in some

experiments, but it added nothing to the equation and was dropped.


       Ownership is divided into foreign, government-domestic and private-domestic.

Foreign establishments are defined as plants with any foreign ownership. Government-

owned establishments are defined as plants without foreign ownership but with any

government (central or local) ownership. The remaining plants are defined as private-

domestically owned. In some later estimations, ownership is instead a dummy on foreign

acquisitions of domestically owned plants and a dummy on domestic acquisitions of

foreign owned plants. The universe we examine in the estimations on takeovers includes

all firms except those that experience multiple ownership changes. Firm-specific effects

and time dummies are included in the regressions. The ownership dummy variables are

one when an ownership change is recorded and thereafter.

       Acquisitions may not be random with respect to factors that determine future

growth.   This means that estimates on employment growth may be biased if non-

randomness is not taken into account. We therefore use propensity score matching (PSM)

combined with the more general difference-in-differences technique, as suggested by e.g.

Blundell and Costa Dias (2005), Heyman et al. (2007), and Arnold and Javorcik (2009).




                                                                                        7
The matching procedure aims to find a group of non-acquired plants that display the same

characteristics as the group of acquired plants. For foreign takeovers, the control group is

taken from the plants that are always domestic, while for domestic takeovers, the control

group is taken from the plants that are always foreign. Matching techniques are used to

construct samples of non-acquired plants that are twins to acquired plants and, thus,

approximate the non-observed counterfactual event: what would have happened to these

plants if they had not been acquired.

       The probability of takeover, the propensity score, is obtained by fitting a probit

model. The model specification is similar to the OLS regressions above but adds

variables such as plant age and log productivity, lagged one year. Table A1 shows that

young and large domestically-owned plants with high productivity and energy intensity

are relatively likely to be acquired by foreign owners. By contrast, foreign-owned plants

that are small, with low productivity and energy intensity, are relatively likely to be taken

over by domestic owners. Hence, foreigners acquire what seem to be relatively good

domestic plants (cherry picking) and domestic actors acquire relatively poor foreign

owned plants. By constructing a matched sample based on the probability of takeover, the

selection problem is reduced.

       We employ a nearest neighbor matching technique with replacement to construct

our matched sample of plants. In case of foreign takeover, each domestic plant that would

be acquired later by foreign owners is matched to an always domestic plant that has the

closest propensity score. The same approach is used for domestic takeovers. Moreover,

the matched treated and control units are from the same year and same industry.




                                                                                           8
       Of the 1,037 foreign takeovers, 390 are in the treatment group. The loss in the

number of foreign takeovers from the treatment group is mainly due to the fact that there

are 475 foreign takeovers reported to have taken place in the second year after the plant

starts operation, and thus there is no employment growth in the pre-acquisition period to

compare with. Another 108 takeovers are dropped because there are some missing values

in the observed characteristics used to estimate propensity scores. Of 652 domestic

takeovers, 291 are included in the treatment group. 233 domestic takeovers are dropped

because they are reported to have taken place in the second year of operation, and another

128 domestic takeovers are dropped because of missing values. It is a cause for concern

that so many takeovers are dropped because they are reported to take place in the second

year of existence. However, the regression analyses were carried out on samples with and

without takeover in the second year, and the results were robust.

       Tests are conducted to make sure that our matched sample is balanced in the sense

that the treated and control units have similar pre takeover values on the control variables

(Tables A2 and A3). In the matched sample, the differences in means of the control

variables are not significant between treated and control units.

       Having obtained a control group of firms, we combine propensity score matching

with the difference-in-differences estimator to estimate the impact of acquisitions on

employment. The difference-in-differences approach compares employment growth for

the treated group of acquired plants with the relevant control group of plants that are not

acquired.

4. Econometric results


5.1. Determinants of the rate of plant employment growth


       We start in Table 3 with simple OLS analyses on the whole universe of

manufacturing plants. The equations include the ownership variables, Foreign and

Government, and the reference group is therefore domestic-private firms. The coefficient

for Foreign is positive and statistically significant, indicating a rate of growth in

employment 6 percent higher in foreign-owned than in domestic-private plants. The

coefficient for government is statistically significant, but only 2 percent.


       The equation includes plant characteristics that might affect employment growth.

Large firms have comparatively low growth rates, as has been found in previous studies

(e.g. Karlsson et al., 2008). Plants that are more energy intensive and use more raw

materials are associated with higher employment growth rates in general.


       The last two columns examine growth of the numbers of blue- and white- collar

workers. The positive effect on the employment of blue-collar workers is substantially


                                                                                         10
larger than the effect on white-collar workers: 6 percent compared to 3.6 percent. The

effect of government ownership is also higher for blue- than for white- collar workers but

both effects are small compared to the effect of foreign ownership. Finally, the negative

effect of size and the positive effect of input per employee on employment growth

primarily affect blue-collar workers, as is also the case for the positive effect from energy

intensity.


        The evidence of Table 3 is that foreign-owned plants tend to increase their

employment 6 percent faster than private domestically-owned plants over the years of

their existence, given the other characteristics of the plants.




5.2. Foreign takeovers and employment growth

        In Table 4, we separate the effects of foreign takeovers from those of foreign

ownership in general. The OLS estimate of the effect of foreign ownership aside from

foreign acquisition effects is about 5 per cent per year faster growth in employment. The

effect of foreign acquisition is subsequent growth in employment at a rate 9 per cent

faster than in domestic plants.

        The fixed effect approach looks at growth in employment within a firm before

and after the acquisition and removes the time-constant unobserved plant characteristics

that could confound the explanation of acquisition effects. Only firms that change

ownership are included. Fixed effect estimates raise the foreign acquisition effect to 11

percent. The effect on blue-collar workers is about twice as large as the effect on white-

collar workers. Moreover, the results indicate that domestic acquisition reduces the



                                                                                          11
subsequent rate of employment growth, although only the effect on white-collar workers

is statistically significant.

             The effect of FDI on employment might differ between trade regimes

(Balasubramanyam et al., 1996). FDI flows drawn to a developing country to take

advantage of cheaper labor costs would respond to an export-oriented policy by

expansion. By contrast, FDI induced by import substitution policy is limited by the size

and income level of the host-country market.

             To test for the possible impact of differences in trade regimes, suggested above,

we divide Indonesia’s history since 1975 into three periods, which we think of as an

import substitution period 1975-1985; a trade liberalization period 1986-1996; and the

crisis and post-crisis period 1997-2005.2 The results, shown in Table 5, support the idea

that the effects of FDI on host countries are affected by trade regimes. During the trade

liberalization period 1986-1996, the employment growth rate effect of foreign acquisition

was as high as 19 percent.3 In contrast, foreign takeovers had no significant effects on

employment growth rates during the earlier, import substitution, period 1975-1985.



5.3. Matched comparisons of domestic and foreign takeovers

             We test these results for possible biases from the selectivity of acquisitions by

using propensity score matching. The results are shown in Table 6. Foreign takeovers

raise the growth rate of employment by 10 percent on average during the acquisition and

post-acquisition period, after correcting for the pre-acquisition differences between

policy regimes, and for similar distinctions in different periods.

acquired and non-acquired plants. This is similar to the fixed effect estimate. Domestic

takeovers, according to the matched comparison, do not affect employment growth rates.

       While the employment growth rates in foreign takeovers do not differ

significantly from those of plants remaining domestically-owned in the first and second

years after the takeover, the impact of the foreign takeovers continues, because the

acquired plants grow so much in the year of takeover that the same growth rate after

takeover implies a considerably larger absolute growth in employment in the following

years in the acquired plants, relative to domestic plants, as is shown in Table 7. There are

no similar effects in absolute terms from domestic acquisitions of foreign plants. The

concentration of employment growth rate change in the year of acquisition and the

consequent carryover of absolute employment growth into the following years are vividly

illustrated by Figures 3 and 4.

       One implication of this concentration in the year of acquisition is that the usual

assumption that “Greenfield” investment adds resources to the recipient country, but

acquisitions only change ownership is wrong. Acquisitions can be associated with very

substantial additions to resources, quite apart from any gains that might arise from

transfers from less-skilled to more-skilled management.



5. Conclusions

       Foreign owned Indonesian manufacturing plants grew more rapidly in

employment than plants that remained in Indonesian ownership during 1975-2005, given

the other characteristics of the plants. The more rapid growth is confirmed by several

tests of the data including a close examination of takeovers of locally-owned plants by

foreign-owned throughout our period grew, on average, about 5 percent faster than in

plants that were always domestically owned. Plants that were acquired by foreigners

grew about 10 percent faster according to fixed effect estimates. Considering that foreign

plants are on average considerably larger than domestic plants, the difference in the

number of jobs created was large.

        The propensity score matching consistently confirmed the advantages of foreign

ownership for employment growth. There is also some indication that the employment

growth effects of foreign ownership are sensitive to host country trade policy, with

liberalization encouraging the expansion of employment through foreign takeover.

There were indications in several tests that there was a decline of employment growth in

shifts from foreign to domestic ownership, although that result is not statistically

significant.

        Most of the employment effects of foreign takeovers took place in the year of

takeover. There was relatively little effect on growth rates in the following years, but the

absolute additions to employment in the years after takeover were larger than they would

have been under continued local ownership because the base was much larger.

        The negative or insignificant effect of domestic acquisition on foreign-owned

plants, as in the fixed effects estimate and the difference-in-differences estimate from a

matched sample, shows that the advantages of foreign-owned plants that accounted for

more rapid growth required continued foreign ownership. They are apparently lost if the

plant returns to domestic ownership.




                                                                                             14
       One possible implication of the concentration of growth in the year of acquisition

is that the distinction between “Greenfield investments” and acquisitions is not as sharp

as is often assumed. Many of the acquisitions apparently involve major changes in the

size and possibly other dimensions of the target firms.

Note:
1. For foreign takeovers, the average number of years after acquisition for both treated
   and control group is approximately 6 years. For domestic takeovers, both treated and
   control groups have on average 6 years after acquisition.
2. The pre-acquisition for this calculation uses information at one year before
   acquisition. It would not change the story if the average from all the years before
   acquisition is used instead.
3. Standard errors are bootstrapped.
