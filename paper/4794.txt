                                         ABSTRACT


       In this paper we explore the relationship between crime and work using data for a cohort

sample of young men. We find that working and going to school significantly decrease the

probability of committing criminal acts and by virtually identical amounts. Parochial school

education and higher IQ are also significantly associated with lower criminal proclivities, but a

high school degree has no significant effect. These findings. in conjunction with other research,

suggest that participation in legitimate activities (employment or school) per se has a greater

effect on criminal behavior than does the higher income associated with employment or

educational attainment.

        In this   paper, we consider the     legitimate and criminal     activitie, of
young men. We  are interested primarily in the relationship between young
men'. criminal activity and their employment. We us. data for a ''rth cohort
sample that contain information of the activities of a representative sample
of young men      over    a seven—year period.
        Beginning with thrlich's (1973) extension of Decker's (1968] pioneering

work,    economists have sought to mod.l the         nature   of the relationship between
employment and crime. These economic models generally see               crime   as   like
employment in that it takes time and producee income. The simplest of these
models predicts that crime and work are substitutes. The implication is that
increasing the availability of jobs and improving wages lowers the level of

criminal activity. Empirical researchers have been unable, however, to
provide strong, consistent and convincing evidence in support of this

theoretical proposition.
         In light of these findings, we stepped back and surveyed empirical work,

including    ethnographic.,      on crime. This work provides important stylised

facts. First and foremost, crime is a young man's game.                In 1990, seventy
percent of the individuals arrested in the United States were between 16 and

34 and over 80 percent of those arrested were male, Second, during their

prime crime       years   (the late teens and early twenties), young men are          often
actively involved in educational pursuits. Only forty—five percent of the
population between 16         and                           in 1990. Third,
                                    19 years of age was employed

ethnographic       studies find that many criminal activities require relatively
little    time    and   are often combined with employment or education. In addition,
participation       in criminal activities ha. many distinctive attributes (e.g.,
flexible    hours, imediate gratification rather than a weekly paycheck,
independence, excitement, flashy life style) that makes it attractive to young

males.




                                                 1
      In thi. paper, we develop a model that reflects the above stylized facts
and use a date set that has a number of unique elements. Our data contains
information on the criminal, work and educational activitie, of a
representative sample of young males in a large U.S. urban area. The study
traced the activities of the young men from ages 19 to 25. This is the period

during which there is the greatest eixing of work, schooling, and criminal

activity.
         Our work differs from moet previous research            in that we wee data for a
general population group, control               for deterrent effect. and consider
educational as well as employment               activities of young men. Most work on the
relationship between employment and crime ha. used data for thigh riek
population. such as prison releasees. The work either ignores deterrent
effecte or considers only specific (the effect of punishment on the individual
punished) and not general (the effect of puniehoent on individuals without

contact with the criminal justice system) deterrent effects. Much of the work
consider, employment but not educational activitiee.
         The organization of the remainder of the paper is a. follow..               In the

next    section, we review the empirical literature. In Section II, we               present
the model that structures our empirical work and in the following section we
describe the data and the empirical model. Section IV contains our empirical

results and the final section our conclusions. To preview briefly our
results, we find evidence that both employment and going to school are
a.eociated with          lees   crime.   The   effects of schooling and employment   on crime

are    virtually identical.
I. The Literature
      Most theoretical models of crime are single—period individual choice
models.' These models generally see the individual as deciding how to
allocate time with criminal activity a. one possible time use. Criminal

activity                  being similar to employment in that ic require.
               ie represented a.
tim, and produces income. For convenience, we refer to such model, as crime
as work        models.

                                                    2
         The bulk of empirical work     by   economists has used aggregate data on
crime rate., usually data obtained from the 781's Uniform Cr1... Resort.

(tIC?.), to   estimate crim. as work     .od.ls.' Thi.      work has   been severely
criticized    for aggregation bias, arbitrary identifying restrictions, and poor
data.'

         Beginning in 1980, a small, but increasing, number of etudie. used

individual, generally cross sectional data, to estimate economic models of
crime (e.g., Good, Pirog—Good        and Sickles,   1986;   Montsarqustte and Herb,.,
1985: Myers, 1983; Viscusi, 1986a, 1986b; Schmidt and witte, 1984; Witte,
1980). since this work relat.. most closely to our own, we concentrate our
review on this literature. For completene.s, we sl.o discuss briefly some
relevant work by       sociologists (e.g.,   Ros.i, Berk and Ianihan,      1980; Thornberry
and Christenson, 1984) and psychologists (e.g., Farrington, et .1., 1986;

Gottfr.d.on, 1985).
         In the fir.t half of the 1980., a number of economists used data for
prison relsasses to estimate models of criminal activity (e.g., Witts, 1980

and Myers, 1983). This work often had limited information on employment
activities and no information on educational activities. For example, Mitt.
uses the length of time required for release.. to find a job and the wage on
the first job after release to ref l.ct work activities. She has no
information on    educational    activities. Further, studies using cross sectional
data for prison release.. cannot reveal how legitimate activities affect the
decision to coemence criminal activity. It can only reveal the effect of
employment on the resumption of such activities.

         Recent work   using   individual data has attempted to overcome some          of   the
difficulties outlined above. )4ontmarquett. and Nerlove 11985) and Thornberry
and Christenson (1984) use data for general population groups. Farrington, et
al   (1986), Good, et al. (1986], Gottfredson (1985] and Thornb.rry and
Christenson 119841 use data that        contain observations for at least two time
periods. Only     Farrington, et     al. (1986) and Thornberry and Christenson (1984]

have panels that extend over a number of years (four years in each instance).


                                               3
These studies, however,   not use panel data estimation techniques. In
                            do
addition, many of the studies fail to take account of the qualitative or
limited nature of measureu        criminal activity.
                                 of

      Turthermore, existing      work with individual data does not control for
possible deterrent effect, arising from th. actions of the criminal justice
sy.tem. Indeed, some studies (e.g., Rossi, St al. 1900$ Thornberry and
Christenson, 1984) contain no deterrence variables. Other studio address
specific but not general deterrence issues by including variables that reflect
the individual's perceptions or past experience with the criminal justice
system (e.g., Montmarquette and Nerlove, 1985; Myers, 1983; Schmidt and Witte,
19B4; Viscusi, 1986a, l986b; Witte, 1980).

II.   Concptualizstion
      As   is   usual, we assume      a   von Neumann—Morgenstern decision maker.            In
contrast to existing work, we             see   the individual as choosing a level of

criminal activity, denoted c, rather than the time                 to   allocate to crime, We
choose this approach because studies indicate that most criminal acts are

unplanned' and that crime cocnission does not take much time                   (e.g..   Hirschi,

1969; Crowley, 1981). we allow for the                   possibility   of nonmonstary gains from

crime by entering the gain, from crime, denoted R(c), directly into the
utility function. This reflects the fact that many offenses yield no direct

monetary gain (e.g., assault, drug use) and that even major property crimes

produce surprisingly low     monetary           returns (Petersilia, Greenwood,      and   Lavin,

1977; Swanson and Tabbush, 1988; Viscupi, 1986a].' Pormally, the individual's
utility with income from legal ak,tivities I, offense level c, and sanctions e

is



                         U(I,R(c), s;A')

where a° denotes a vector of exogenous variable, systematically related to
preferences.

                                                     4
        To reflect substantial evidence that criminal justice system ctions
depend on the number and type          of of tenses,'   we posit function. that relate
the probability that an individual is arrested and              the   sanctions to the extsnt
of the persons criminal activity. The.e functions may shift because of
differences in individual abilities to avoid arrest and to mitigate

punishment, denoted a1, and because of exogenous changes in the criminal

justice •ystem (e.g., the availability of resources, administrative policy,
and the legal code), denoted b. Let P(c;a',b) denote the probability of

arrest and S(c;a',b) the level of sanctions.

        Our    conceptualization of    criminal justice actions differs from      that   in
most economic models of crime          by   seeing such actions as dependent on both     the
individuals criminal activity and exogenous shift factors. This has
important implications for empirical work. For example, consider the
implications of the model for how to measure the arrest probability in
empirical work. As represented in the model above, an individual

contemplating a criminal        act does not face a single probability of arrest.
Rather,       the individual faces a schedule or function that relates each possible
level    of criminel activity to a probability of arrest. As pointed out by Cook
          and Poterba (1987), it is possible to estimate the effect of the

probability       schedule on    crime only if there are exogenous shifts in the
schedule. Under the model developed above, such exogenous shifts occur
because of       differences    in individual abilities to avoid arrest and because of

differences in police resources, police administration and the legal code.
Variables reflecting such shifts and not the probability of arrest enter the

crime equation.
        For notational simplicity, we ignore the possibility of multiple arrests
and assume that in any time          period the   individual is either arrested once or

not   at all.' The individual chooses the level of criminal activity to
maximize expected utility given by


                ZtJ — P   U(t,R(c),S(c;a',b);a') +    (1—F) U(X,R(c),O;a').

                                                  S
With this     model, the optimal    level   of criminal activity, c, depends on total
income      from legal   activities, the    preferences   of the individual, and   exogenous
factors     that   cause the probability or sanction, functions to shift. We do not
view   criminal activities and employment           as being jointly determined. Crime
and employment are not necessarily substitute time             uses.   This is consistent
with findings that crime and work are often combined (e.g., Bolaman,               l9B2
Phillips and Votey, 198$).

III. The Data and Emoirical Model
       Our primary data     are for a 10 percent random sample of males born        in    1945
and residing in Philadelphia between          their 10th and 18th birthdays. We
combine this individual information with data on the total number of offenses,
police budgets, macroeconomic indicators and neighborhoods i.n Philadelphia.
Information was collected from school records, draft registration records, the

Philadelphia Police Department, the FBI, a compendium on city government
finances, the Philadelphia Coemunity Renewal Program, and interviews carried
out in 1970—1971.

       Using this data, we created two panels, one a seven—year panel that
traces cohort members' activities from 1964 through 1970 and the other an

eight—year panel       that ends in 1971. since       almost half of the interviews were
conducted     in 1970, the seven—year panel contains approximately twice the
number of observations as the eight—year panel. The results discussed in the
paper are for the seven—year panel. Results for the eight—year panel and more
details on     the   data are available in    Tauchen,    et at. (1988].
       To   estimate our model, we require measures of the total income from legal
activities, the preferences of the individual, and exogenous factors that
cause the probability or sanction functions to shift. There are two primary
measurement issues for this        study,   namely how to measure the level of criminal
activity and how to reflect the criminal justice system actions. We use two
measures of criminal activity. The first is a binary measure for whether or
not the individual was arrested during the year. Although this is one of the

most coanonly used measures of criminal activity, it is well—recognised that
                                                6
such binary variables do not reflect the seriousness of the crime. coemitted
or even the frequency of arrests. Given the difference, in the type. of
crimes cnitted         by our sample members', we also      used Scum      and Wolfgang's
119641 crime •eriousness index to measure the level of criminal activity.
Their index assigns a seriousness score to each crime for which the individual
was arrested, and the seriousness scores for all arrests during the year are
sunned    to   obtain the crime index for     the   year.
         second measurement issue relates to criminal justice system actions
        The

and general deterrence. Both our lodel and empirical evidence indicate that
criminal justice system actions depend on the level of criminal activity, on
the individual's ability to avoid arrest and on exogenous factore related to
the   criminal justice system. Since the actions of the criminal justice system
depend on      an individual's criminal decision., the individual's own experience
with the criminal justice system cannot be used as a general deterrence
variable. Most of the observed variation in individuale' experiences with                   the

criminal justice system results from differences in crime seriousness and

crime    frequency    not from exogenous criminal justice system actions.
Appropriate measures of         general deterrence are numerical representations of
exogenous changes in the criminal justice system. These variables must
reflect variation that does not          depend on the type and      extent of criminal

activity. Appropriate measures include changes in criminal justice resources

and policies.        Since there were no major changes in criminal justice system
policies       in Philadelphia   during the study period, we use a number       of variables
related       to the level of resources available       (e.g., the   real police budget per

offense       and per capita)   as   our measures of general deterrence.

        We are not    able   to measure the income from     legal    activities directly

since there are no income         or wage variables     in our data set. We have

information, however, on the time          allocated to work and on factors generally
correlated       with wages (i.e., IQ    and a binary for whether or not the individual

received a high school degree) and incorporate these variables to reflect

income from legal activities. Our            data   set also contains information on the


                                                7
time allocated     to school    during   each year    and we incorporate this variable in
order to control. f or educational activities.

       The   variables related to preferences are of         thr.e types; (1) variables

that   reflect family and cunity backgrounds (i.e., a binary equal                   to   one if
both   parents were born in the U.S., a measure of   occupational status of
                                                             the

the household head when the boy was in high school, a binary equal to one if
the boy attended primarily parochial schools, the number of addresses during

the school years, average income in the neighborhood of residence during high

school); (2) variables reflecting personal characteristics (i.e., IQ, a binary
equal to one if the individual is white)j (3) variables reflecting activities
that occurred during the juvenile or young adult years (i.e., thre. variables
indicating the type of charge at first arrest, the number of police contacts
as a juvenile, the percent of juvenile police contacts resulting in formal
criminal justice system proce.sing, a binary equal to one if the individual i.
married, and a binary equal to one if the individual was a member of a                    gang as

a juvenile). Finally, we include a variable for the year of the panel                     to

reflect      the aging   of the cohort and other trend factors.

       Mostvariables likely to reflect differing abilities to avoid arrest
(e.g., intelligence or like—minded friends) are also likely to be related                      to

differences in the individual's taste for crime. To reflect this

confounding of effects, we           interpret   the coefficients on such variables as

reflecting some mixture of preference and deterrence effects.

       We    estimate    the model, for the binary measure of criminal activity using
a random effects probit model. The two—factor random effects probit model                       is
an extension of      the   usual probit model.        Xn the two—factor random effects

models, the disturbance terms are correlated across time               for   any   individual
but not across individuals.            The component of the disturbance term that is
correlated      across time    for   any individual reflects unmeasured, persistent

individual effects. lithe error is               uncorrelated   with the explanatory

variables, the parameter estimates of the error              component probit model       are

consistent and asymptotically efficient (chamberlain, 1984).


                                                  8
IV. !mirical Result.
     Table I contains empirical results for the binary measure of criminal
activity. The first column is f or a specification including only variables
that are unaffected by an individual's criminal or time allocation decision.
(e.g., police resource., family background and neighborhood characteristics).
Th. second column   contain,   results for a specification that also includes

predetermined variable, related to the juvenile criminal record. The last
column is for a specification including variables related to activities that

occurred in the current year (e.g., fraction of the year employed) or previous
years, possibly during the sample period (e.g., high school graduation). We
estimate three specifications as a partial check of the robustness of results.
The implications of the Tobit models are similar to those of the probit model,
the estimated coefficient, are not reported. The results are available in
Tauchen, et al. (1988).
    The probit and Tobit models are significant in all specifications and the
eetimated coefficients, when significant, are of the same sign in all models.
The estimated coefficients on the variables of primary interest are stable in
sign and magnitude across specifications for a given estimation technique.
We find greater time working, greater time in school and higher IQ to be
significantly related to lower probabilities of criminal activity. The
receipt of a high school diploma, however, has no significant effect on
offending for any specification or panel. Upon considering only the results
for the time allocated to work and IQ, we could interpret our findings as
indicating that a lower level of criminal activity is associated with greater

income." In light of the results for the high school degree binary and the
time allocated to school, the interpretation is less clear cut.

     The coefficients on the proportion of time working and the proportion of
time school are not significantly different from one another. Other studies
(e.g., Farrington, et al., 1986; Gottfredson, 19851 Viscuei, 1986a) obtain the

same results." The standard economic explanation for this finding is based
on a dynamic, human capital model of criminal behavior (e.g., Flinn, 1986).

     Our findings for high school graduation, however, do not indicate

a model    of criminal   activity that conceive, of legitimate time      use.   and social

association. (e.g., participation in church activities, white collar

employment)  as shaping or revealing preference. concerning illegal
activities. Such a model might be developed by allowing the parameters of the
utility function to depend on how an individual uses time or on an
individual's associate. (Theil, 1980; Phlips, 1983; Becker, 1992)11. Note
that this approach would not be inconsistent with standard economic models.
Further,    such an approach might addres.       the criticism   that economic models   of




                                            10
crime art    not   applicable for teenage offenders, particularly young teenager.,
few of whom are in the      labor market (Felson, 19931.
    The negative coefficient on the binary for whether the individual was
whit." i. consistent with the coon finding that nonwhite, have far higher
crime participation rates        than whites (e.g., Blumatein, et al., 1986).     Xn our
sample, though this    finding could be partly attributable to characteristics         of
the   criminal justice system. A study that uses the same data set (Collins,
1905] reports      that blacks   were more likely to be arrested given the crime
coaxuitted   than were   whites. Since   we use   arrest to measure criminal   activity,
the estimated coefficient on the binary for whether the individual was white

reflects differences in police arrest practice. as well as differences in
criminal behaviors acrois racial groups.

      As in other studies that use official crime data, we find that the

probability of arrest is higher for young men whose         household head   during high
school   had a relatively low      statue occupation. In light of this result, it
may seem   surprising that young men     who   grew up in higher income heighborhoods
were more likely to be arrested in their early adult years. This is a con
result, however, in studies that use neighborhood or other aggregate measures
of income. In previous studies, researchers interpret the average cunity
income as measuring the opportunities for crime and often find this variable
to be positively related to the crime rate". The findings related to the
young mans juvenile criminal record and to the other family background
variables are aleo consistent with the previous literature.

      We find robust and significant general deterrent effects from greater

criminal justice system resources. For the results reported in Table I, the
criminal justice resource variable is measured as        real   police resources per
offense for the city of Philadelphia, and the estimated coefficient is
negative and significant. We also find significant deterrent effects for the

following measures of criminal justice resource.: police officers per offense,

total criminal justice employee. (police, courts, and local corrections) per

offense, real police budget per young male, and real police budget per capita.


                                             11
       In coneidering thee. general deterrence results keep in mind that our
measure of crime is arrests. The net impact of increased criminal Justice
resources on arrests      is the   sum of two   opposing •ffect.. Increasing criminal
justice    resources   may have a deterrent effsct on the level of criminal
activity but also leads to a higher probability of arrest            for any given crime.
The estimated coefficient. on the criminal Justice resource variable.
therefore understate the pure general deterrent effect. See Tauchen, st            al.,
119941 for a detailed discussion.


V. Conclusions

       As in previous studies,1' our findings provide little evidence that wages

or incciurses have consistently significant effects on crime.         Our work does add
to   the growing literature that find. both employment and school attendance to

be significantly related, in virtually identical ways, to lower levels of
criminal activity. Similar         effects for employment and schooling     are difficult

to explain using either a static crime as            work model or the static demand—type
model developed in Section III. Perhaps different types of criminal models
will offer greater insights regarding the effect of legitimate tae uses on

criminality. Researchers have begun to develop dynamic models of criminal

activity    (e.g.,   Tlinn, 19867 Davis, 1988) and models of crime based on

psychological  and sociological processes (e.g., Akerlof and Dickens, 1982;
Dickens, 1906; Lattimore and Witte, 1986; Lattimore, et al., 1992). Gary
Becker is currently developing models for the rational formation of

preferences baeed on habitual behavior and peer group influences Isecker,
1992). Thi. work, like       Becker's   1968 article, may change how researchers
model criminal activity.

S.    Zrez (1987) provides a good survey of the research on how offender.
approach crime. She conclude, that criminal violation. are mostly
situational and that impulsive crime is more coemon than planned crias
(p.132).

of   the income of drug dealers.

8. The notation with multiple arrest.         is   messy and complicated. The
implication. of the model for structuring the          empirical work are the same as
for   the above model.
9.   Members of the sample had 147 arrests during the sample period, tight
percent of these arrests were for crimes with potential or actual violence
(homicide, rape, assault, and robbery), 25 percent involved theft of property
(burglary,     larceny and motor vehicle theft) and      the   remaining arrests involved

offense, such as drug sales and poeeeesion, and buying and receiving stolen

property.

acts than are other..

variables such as employment and schooling must be interpreted with cars. tn

a standard human capital model, these coefficients might be regarded a.
