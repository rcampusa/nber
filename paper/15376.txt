                                            ABSTRACT

We investigate the relationship between interstate highways and highway vehicle kilometers traveled
(VKT) in US cities. We find that VKT increases proportionately to highways and identify three important
sources for this extra VKT: an increase in driving by current residents; an increase in transportation
intensive production activity; and an inflow of new residents. The provision of public transportation
has no impact on VKT. We also estimate the aggregate city level demand for VKT and find it to be
very elastic. We conclude that an increased provision of roads or public transit is unlikely to relieve
congestion.

1. Introduction

We investigate the effect of lane kilometers of roads on vehicle-kilometers traveled (vkt) for dif-

ferent types of roads in us cities. For interstate highways in the densest parts of metropolitan

areas we find that vkt increases in exact proportion to highways, confirming the ‘fundamental law

of highway congestion’ suggested by Downs (1962, 1992). This relationship also approximately

holds for other important roads in dense areas and for interstate highways in less dense parts of

metropolitan areas. These findings and others in the paper imply something broader than Down’s

law, a law of road congestion that applies to highways and major urban roads in metropolitan

areas. In turn, this suggests that increased provision of highways and major urban roads is unlikely

to relieve congestion of these roads.

   Our investigation is of interest for three reasons. First, an average American household spent

161 person-minutes per day in a passenger vehicle in 2001. These minutes allowed 134 person-km

of auto travel at an average speed of 44 km/h. Comparison with corresponding data from 1995

show that the time spent on routine household travel increased by 10% in only six years, while dis-

tances remained constant. Multiplying by the number of households in the us and any reasonable

dollar value of time, we see that society allocated billions of dollars more to traffic congestion in

2001 than in 1995. That Americans rank commuting among their least enjoyable activities (Krueger,

Kahneman, Schwarz, and Stone, 2008) confirms our suspicion that the costs of congestion are large.

To the extent that these resources could have been better allocated, understanding congestion and

the effect of potential policy interventions is an important economic problem.

   Second, traffic is of considerable interest to policy makers, and given the high costs of traffic and

road infrastructure, transportation policy should be based on the careful analysis of high quality

data, not on the claims of advocacy groups. Unfortunately, there is currently little empirical basis

for accepting or rejecting the claims of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association

that “adding highway capacity is key to helping to reduce traffic congestion”, or of the American

Public Transit Association that without new investment in public transit, highways will become so

congested that they “will no longer work”.1 We find that our data does not support either of these

claims.

   Third, with the increasing certainty of global warming comes the need to manage carbon

emissions. According to the us Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2007, chapter 4) the road trans-

portation sector accounts for about a third of us carbon emissions from energy use. Understanding

the implications for vkt of changes to transportation infrastructure is immediately relevant to this

policy problem.

   Ours is not the first attempt to measure the effect of the supply of roads on traffic. Following

Jorgensen (1947), a large literature estimates new traffic for particular facilities after their opening

or after a capacity expansion (see Goodwin, 1996, Cervero, 2002, for reviews).2 However studies

of a particular road provide little basis for assessing the impact that changes in infrastructure have

on traffic in the city at large, a question that is probably more relevant to transportation policy. As

Cervero’s (2002) review shows, few studies take an approach similar to ours and assess the effect

of road provision on traffic over entire areas. These studies generally find a positive elasticity of

vkt to the supply of roads, although they differ greatly regarding the magnitude of this elasticity.

We improve on this literature in four respects.

   First, we use more and more comprehensive data. To begin, we take average annual daily traffic

(aadt) and a description of the road network from the us Highway Performance and Monitoring

System (hpms) for 1983, 1993, and 2003. We add a description of individual and household travel

behavior taken from the National Personal Transportation Survey (npts) in 1995 and 2001. These

data track several measures of traffic and infrastructure for all metropolitan areas in the continental

us. Together with data describing truck traffic, public transit, sectoral employment, population

and physical geography, these data are a powerful tool with which to investigate the way that vkt

responds to changes the stock of highways and transit in us metropolitan areas. Extant research,

on the other hand, examines one specific state (usually California) or a small sub-group of adjacent

states (usually on the East coast) taking counties or smaller administrative units as the unit of

observation.3 The resulting estimates of the relationship between infrastructure and traffic in small

administrative districts from highly urbanized parts of the us are not obviously relevant to national

transportation policy.
   2 While Jorgensen (1947) is our first modern source, the analysis of the effects of new facilities such as bridges and

their tariffs on flows of vehicles follows a much older tradition, dating back to Dupuit (1844).
   3 Noland (2001) looks at data for the entire us but uses states as units of observation. Since roads in San Francisco

or Buffalo are unlikely to affect behavior in Los Angeles or New York City, states appear to be ‘too large’ a unit of
observation for two reasons: states aggregate city level variation that is useful for inference and the relevant economic
unit appears to be the city.




                                                           2
   Second, we are more careful to establish a causal relationship between roads and traffic. Existing

literature either does not recognize that roads and traffic may be simultaneously determined or

fails to solve this identification problem. To identify the causal effect of roads on traffic, we examine

both time series and cross-sectional variation in our data and exploit three instrumental variables

to predict the incidence of roads in msas. These instruments are based on; the routes of major

expeditions of exploration between 1835 and 1850, major rail routes in 1898, and the proposed

routes of interstate highways in a preliminary plan of the network. All estimations confirm the

fundamental law of road congestion.

   Third, beyond data and methodological improvements, we extend the conclusions of the ex-

isting literature in three ways. First, we show that the ‘fundamental law of congestion’ holds

not only for urban interstates but also for major urban roads and non-urban interstates. Thus,

our data suggest the following law of road congestion: adding road capacity will not alleviate

congestion on any sort of major urban road or rural highway within metropolitan boundaries.

Second, we deduce three further implications of the law of highway congestion and confirm that

these implications are consistent with observation: when estimated directly, the demand for travel

is close to being flat; metropolitan areas with less traffic experience a stronger increase in travel;

the provision of public transportation has no impact on vkt. Third, we also document the factors

underlying the fundamental law of highway congestion. Individuals drive more when the stock of

roads in their city increases. Commercial driving and trucking increase with a city’s stock of roads.

People migrate to cities which are relatively well provided with roads. There is little substitution

between different types of roads.

   Finally, claiming, as is often done, that a high elasticity of vkt to roads automatically implies a

low social value for the marginal road is wrong. We perform a detailed welfare calculation to assess

the welfare gain from incremental increases to a city’s stock of roads in the absence of congestion

pricing. We find that the welfare gains for drivers of building more highways are well below the

costs of building these highways. This conclusion follows, not from the high elasticity of vkt to

roads, but from the fact that new roads do not reduce the cost of travel sufficiently.

2. Roads and traffic: a simple framework

To motivate our econometric strategy consider a simple model of equilibrium vkt. To begin, let

R denote lane kilometers of roads in a city, let Q denote vkt, and let P( Q) be the inverse demand

for vkt. The downward sloping line in figure 1 represents an inverse vkt demand curve for a

particular city.

   Let C ( R,Q) be the total cost of vkt, Q, given roads, R. In equilibrium all drivers face the

same average cost of travel. Holding lane kilometers constant at R, the average cost of driving

increases with vkt. Hence, the average cost curve for vkt is upward sloping. This feature is

well documented in the transportation literature (Small and Verhoef, 2007). The leftmost upward

sloping curve in figure 1 represents the supply curve AC ( R) associated with roads R.4

   Equilibrium vkt, Q∗ ( R) is characterized by

                                                              C ( R,Q∗ )
                                                 P( Q∗ ) =               .                                             (1)
                                                                  Q∗

That is, willingness to pay equals average cost.

   Increasing the supply of road lane kilometers from R to R0 reduces the average cost of driving

for any level of vkt.5 It thus shifts the average cost curve to the right. With R lane kilometers of
   4 Strictly speaking, this is an average variable cost curve since it neglects fixed costs of building and maintaining

roads.
   5 There are pathological examples where increases in the extent of a road network can reduce its capacity, in particular

the ‘Braess paradox’ described in Small and Verhoef (2007).

With R kilometers of highways, the corresponding equilibrium implies a vkt of Q ∗ .

   We would like to learn the effect of an increase in the stock of roads on driving in cities. Indexing

cities by i and years by t, our problem may be stated as one of estimating,

                                      ln( Qit ) = A0 + ρQ
                                                        R ln( Rit ) + A1 Xit + eit ,                       (2)

where X denotes a vector of observed city characteristics and e describes unobserved contributors

to driving. We are interested in the coefficient of R, the road elasticity of vkt, ρQ
                                                                                    R ≡ ∂ ln Q/∂ ln R.

   With data describing driving and the stock of roads in a set of cities, we can estimate equation

(2) with ols to obtain consistent estimates of ρQ
                                                R , provided that cov ( R,e | X ) = 0. In practice, we

hope that roads will be assigned to growing cities and fear that they are assigned to prop-up

declining cities. In either case, the required orthogonality condition fails. Thus, we are concerned

that estimating equation (2) will not lead to the true value of ρQ
                                                                 R.

   As a next step, we partition e into permanent and time varying components, and write

                                   ln( Qit ) = A0 + ρQ
                                                     R ln( Rit ) + A1 Xit + δi + ηit .                     (3)

With data describing a panel of cities, we can estimate this equation using city fixed effects to

remove all time invariant city effects. This leads to consistent estimates of ρQ
                                                                               R , provided that

cov( R,η | X,δ) = 0. We also estimate the first difference equation,

                                     ∆ ln( Qit ) = ρQ
                                                    R ∆ ln( Rit ) + A1 ∆Xit + ∆ηit ,                       (4)

where ∆ is the first difference operator. Since all time invariant factors drop out of the first

difference equation, we are left with essentially the same orthogonality requirement as for equation

(3).6 An advantage of (4) is that city characteristics and initial vkt can readily be introduced in

levels as explanatory variables in the regression.7

   To our knowledge, there is no study of a comprehensive set of metropolitan areas in the lit-

erature. The extant literature, however, has estimated variants of equations (2), (3), and (4) on a

small samples of counties or metropolitan areas. While the early literature on induced demand

at the area level (e.g. Koppelman, 1972) only ran simple ols regressions in the spirit of equation

(2), second generation work on the issue typically explored a variety of specifications with fixed
  6 In   fact, the two estimates have subtly different properties, see Wooldridge (2001, chapter 4).
  7 This   is useful if, for instance, ∆R is a response to initial vkt.

effects and, sometimes, a complex lag structure. For instance, Hansen, Gillen, Dobbins, Huang,

and Puvathingal (1993) and Hansen and Huang (1997) use panels of urban counties and msas in

California whereas Noland (2001) use a panel of us states. They all find a positive association

between vkt and lane kilometers of roadway with a coefficient generally ranging between 0.3 and

0.7.

   While the estimating equations (3) and (4) improve upon equation (2), we are concerned that

roads will be assigned to cities in response to a contemporaneous shock to the city’s traffic. To deal

with this identification issue, we need to model the assignment of roads to cities explicitly. This

leads to a two equation model, one to predict the assignment of roads to cities, the other to predict

the effect of roads on traffic,

                             ln( Rit ) = B0 + B1 Xit + B2 Zit + µit
                                                                                                   (5)
                             ln( Qit ) = A0 + ρQ
                                               R ln( Rit ) + A1 Xit + eit .
                                                  \

We can obtain unbiased estimates of ρQ
                                     R provided that we are able to find instruments to satisfy

cov( Z,R| X ) 6= 0 and cov( Z,e| X ) = 0.

   The possible simultaneous determination of vkt and lane kilometers is recognized by several

authors. To instrument for lane kilometers of highways Cervero and Hansen (2002) use a range

of 20 or so instruments, from politics to natural geography. The exclusion restriction needed to

obtain unbiased estimates, namely that the instruments are correlated with vkt only through lane

kilometers is unlikely to hold. Aside from the econometric issues associated with the use of a large

number of instruments, we expect the geographic characteristics of cities, and more particularly

climatic variables, to predict the demand for travel directly in addition to the indirect effect via

road supply. This violates the condition cov( Z,e| X ) = 0 and invalidates the instruments. Noland

and Cowart (2000) use land area and population density as instruments for lane kilometers of

roads. Again, we expect population density to be a determinant of the demand for travel as

much as a determinant of the supply of roads. Fulton, Noland, Meszler, and Thomas (2000)

instrument growth in lane kilometers of highways by short lags of the same variables in a first

difference specification. The exclusion restriction then requires that past changes in road supply

be uncorrelated with contemporaneous changes in demand. Since changes in road supply are

serially correlated (and they need to be so for the instrument to have any predictive power), the

exclusion restriction is unlikely to hold when new roads are supplied as a result of demand shocks.

We postpone a discussion of our own choice of instruments.

                                                     6
   Each of the approaches described above relies on different variation in the data to estimate

ρQ
 R . Equation (2) relies on cross-section variation, while equations (3) and (4) use only time series

variation. Equation (5) exploits the instrumental variables we describe later. Should all three

methods arrive at the same estimate of ρQ
                                        R , then either all must be correct, or all are incorrect

and an improbable relationship exists between the various errors and instrumental variables.

   We now turn to a description of our data and estimates of ρQ
                                                              R based on the estimating equations

presented in this section.


3. Data and estimation

We take the (Consolidated) Metropolitan Statistical Area (msa) drawn to 1999 boundaries as our

unit of observation. Since each msa aggregates one or more counties their boundaries often

encompass much land that is not ‘urban’ in the common sense of the word. However, msas are

generally organized around one or more ‘urbanized areas’ which make up the cores of the msa

and typically occupy only a fraction of an msa’s land area. By using data collected at the level of

‘urbanized areas’ we can distinguish more from less densely developed parts of each metropolitan

area.

   To measure each msa’s stock of highways and traffic we use the us Highway Performance and

Monitoring System (hpms) ‘Universe’ and ‘Sample’ data for 1983, 1993, and 2003.8 The separate

data appendix provides more details about the hpms. The us Federal Highway Administration

collects these data, which are used by the federal government for planning purposes and to

apportion federal highway money. Each year, states must report the length, number of lanes and

the average annual daily traffic (aadt) for the entire universe of the interstate highway system

within their boundaries. We use a county identifier to match every segment of interstate highway

to an msa. We then calculate lane kilometers, vkt and aadt per lane km for interstate highways

within each msa. In the Sample data states must report the same information (and more) for every

segment of interstate highway within urbanized areas. By merging the Sample with the Universe

data we distinguish urban from non-urban interstates within msas.

   The Sample data also report information about a sample of other roads within urbanized areas.

This sample is intended to represent all roads in urbanized areas within the state. For each sampled
   8 In fact, the hpms is available annually. We focus on 1983, 1993 and 2003 because these dates are close to census years

and to the years for which we have data on public transportation. In addition to these three years, we sometimes make
use of the 1995 and 2001 hpms.

segment in an urbanized area, the hpms Sample data reports the road’s length, location, aadt and

share of truck traffic. The hpms sample data also assigns each segment to one of six functional

classes, described in us Federal Highway Administration (1989). One of these classes is ‘interstate

highway’. We group four of the remaining five classes; ‘collector’, ‘minor arterial’, ‘principal

arterial’, and ‘other highway’ into a measure of major urban roads, omitting the last class, ‘local

roads’.9 Our definition of ‘major urban road’ thus includes all non-local roads that are not interstate

highways. Within urbanized areas, interstates represent about 1.5% of all road kilometers and 24%

of vkt while major urban roads represent 27% of road kilometers and another 62% of vkt (United

States Federal Highway Administration, 2005). The separate data appendix provides more detail.

   Table 1 presents msa averages of aadt for the 228 msas with non-zero interstate milage in 1983,

1993, and 2003. These data show that aadt increased from 4,832 vehicles on an average lane

kilometer of interstate highway on an average day in 1983 to 9,361 in 2003. Thus, at the end of our

study period, an average lane kilometer of interstate highway carries almost twice as much traffic
   9 Loosely, a ‘local road’ is one that primarily provides access to land adjacent to the road and every other class of road

serves to connect local roads. The hpms does not require states to report data on local roads, although some local roads
appear in the data.

as at the beginning. We also find that lane kilometers of interstate highways increase by about

6% between 1983 and 1993 and between 1993 and 2003. Together, the increase in lane kilometers

and the increase in aadt imply that interstate vkt in an average msa more than doubled over our

twenty year study period.

   Table 1 also presents descriptive statistics for major urban roads. Major roads represent between

three and five times as many lane kilometers as interstate highways but only twice as much vkt.

Note that urbanized area boundaries, unlike msa boundaries, are not constant over our three cross-

sections, so the dramatic increase in urbanized area vkt and lane kilometers over our study period

may partly reflect increases in the extent of urbanized areas.


Cross-sectional estimates of the roadway elasticity of                VKT


We now turn to estimating the elasticity of msa vkt to lane kilometers for each of the following

categories of roads and travel: All msa interstates (ih), urbanized msa interstates (ihu), non-urban

msa interstates (ihnu), and major urban roads (mru).

   Columns 1-5 of table 2 present estimates of the four elasticities obtained by pooling our three

cross-sections and estimating equation (2) for each type of road.

   In panel a of this table, the dependent variable is msa interstate vkt. In the first column we

include only a constant and year dummies. In the second we add msa population. In the third,

we add nine census division dummy variables along with five measures of physical geography

described in the separate data appendix: elevation range within the msa, the ruggedness of terrain

in the msa, two measures of climate, and a measure of how dispersed is development in the

msa. In column 4 we add socio-economic controls (share of population with at least some college

education, log mean income, share poor, share of manufacturing employment, and an index of

segregation). In column 5 we also add decennial population variables from 1920-1980.10 The

elasticity of interstate highway is 1.24 in column 1, ranges between 0.82 and 0.86 in the other

specifications, and is estimated precisely in each specification.
  10 We also experimented with gasoline price data kindly given to us by Kent Hymel,      Ken Small, and Kurt van Dender.
                                                                  Q
Adding gasoline prices changed nothing to our results regarding ρ R .  On the other hand, the coefficient on gasoline price
is imprecisely estimated and sensitive to the exact specification. This is not surprising since states might be using state
taxes on gasoline to deal with congestion. The proceeds of this taxation also indirectly serve to finance road construction.
We do not report these results here.

   It is interesting to note that the population elasticity of vkt is much less than one in all specific-

ations. This will persist in nearly all of our estimations and suggests that people in larger cities

drive much less, per capita, than they do in smaller cities. We consider the effect of population and

the possible endogeneity of this variable further below. vkt is higher in msas with mild weather,

neither cold nor hot. The extent to which development is scattered or compact, as measured by the

variable ‘sprawl’, does not affect vkt.

   Panel b of table 2 is similar to panel a, but the dependent variable and the measure of roads

are based on urban interstates. The estimations in panel b suggest that the urban interstate vkt

elasticity of urban interstate lane kilometers is close to one and slightly larger than for all inter-

states. Panels c and d of table 2 are also similar to panel a, but investigate major urban roads and

non-urban interstates. These results are also similar to those presented in panel a.

   Note that panel a of table 2 is based on the 228 msas which report interstate highways in all three

of our sample years. Panels b, c, and d use a slightly smaller sample, which excludes msas which

do not have urban interstate highways in all years. In appendix table 1 (in a separate appendix),

we replicate panel a on this restricted sample. The results are similar to those reported in the

text, so we do not concern ourselves with sample selection. Appendix table 2 reports regressions

similar to those reported in table 2, but uses each cross-section separately. The results of table 2 are

preserved for each of our three cross-sections.


Time series estimates of the roadway elasticity of     VKT


Thus far we have reported estimates of ρQ
                                        R which exploit cross-sectional variation. We now turn to

estimates of ρQ
              R based on time series variation.

   Columns 6-8 of table 2 estimate equation (3) by including an msa fixed effect in our cross-

sectional regression. In column 6 we include only an msa fixed effect and time dummies as

controls. In column 7, we add msa population. In column 8, we add our other time varying

msa level demographic variables. In panel a, we see that all of the fixed-effect estimates of the

interstate vkt elasticity of interstate lane kilometers are slightly above one. While it is estimated

precisely in all three specifications, ρQ
                                        R is not statistically different from one at standard levels of

confidence in any of the three.

   In panels b-d, columns 6-8 repeat the estimates presented in panel a, but use urban interstates,

major urban roads, and non-urban interstates. In each case we find the relevant vkt elasticity of

roads is close to one, and is estimated precisely. As for table 1, note that, although msa boundaries

are constant over our three cross-sections, urbanized area boundaries are not.

   We now estimate the interstate vkt elasticity of interstate lane kilometers using our first dif-

ference estimating equation (4). Using our three cross-sections we compute two cross-sections

of first differences. In table 3 we pool these two cross-sections of first differences to estimate

equation (4). Our dependent variable is the 10 year change in interstate vkt. In column 1, we

include only a constant and year dummies as controls. In column 2, we add msa population. In

column 3, we also control for initial vkt. In column 4, we add physical geography and census

division dummies. Column 5 adds decennial msa population levels from 1920-1980 and initial

socioeconomic characteristics of cities. In each case, our point estimate of ρQ
                                                                              R is very close to one

and is precisely estimated.

   Column 6 of table 3 estimates equation (4) including an msa fixed-effect and year fixed effects

as controls, while column 7 adds msa population. These estimates are second difference estimates

which exploit changes in the rate of change of roads and traffic. Strikingly, these regressions also

estimate the interstate vkt elasticity of interstate highways to be very close to one.

   Finally, columns 8-10 consider more restricted samples of observations. Column 8 replicates

column 2 using only observations with increases in lane kilometers greater than 5%. Column 9

uses the same selection rule to replicate column 5. Column 10 replicates column 5 again but this

time using only observations with declines in lane kilometers greater than 5%. The results for large

increases in lane kilometers are the same than for the whole sample of msas. The elasticity we

estimate in column 10 is 0.8. These estimations do not allow us to determine whether the response

of traffic to roads is non-linear in the amount of change to the road network, or if metropolitan

areas experiencing large changes are different from those experiencing small changes.

   As a check on our pooled first difference estimations, appendix table 3 in the separate appendix

presents first difference regressions conducted on each of our two cross-sections of first differences.

Appendix table 4 extends the results of table 3 to other types of roads. In appendix table 5 we show

that changes in vkt between 1993 and 2003 are not explained by changes in lane kilometers of

interstate highways between 1983 and 1993. This suggests that vkt completely adjusts to changes

in the road network in less than 10 years. Finally, in appendix table 6 we instrument for population

changes using initial sectoral composition of economic activity interacted by the national growth

in sectoral employment in the spirit of Bartik (1991) and others after him. This does not affect our

estimates of ρQ
              R either.



IV   estimates of the roadway elasticity of      VKT


In order for estimates of equation (2) and (3) to result in unbiased estimates, we require that the

unobserved error be uncorrelated with the stock of roads (or changes in this stock). If the demand

for vkt helps to determine an msa’s road network, then our measure of roads is endogenous, and

this assumption does not hold. To address this possibility, we estimate the instrumental variables

system described in equation (5).

     We rely on three instruments: planned highway kilometers from the 1947 highway plan; 1898

railroad route kilometers, and the incidence of major expeditions of exploration between 1835

and 1850. Baum-Snow (2007), Michaels (2008), and Duranton and Turner (2008) also use planned

interstates as an instrument for features of the interstate system. Duranton and Turner (2008)

use the 1898 railroad system for the same purpose. The exploration routes variable is new to the

literature.11

     Our measure of msa kilometers of 1947 planned interstate highways is based on a digital image

of the 1947 highway plan created from its paper record (United States House of Representatives,

1947) and converted to a digital map as in Duranton and Turner (2008). Kilometers of 1947 planned

interstate highway in each msa are calculated directly from this map. Figure 2 shows an image of

the original plan. Our measure of msa kilometers of 1898 railroads is based on a digital image of a

map of major railroad lines in 1898 (Gray, c. 1898). This image was converted to a digital map as

in Duranton and Turner (2008). Kilometers of 1898 railroad contained in each msa are calculated

directly from this map. Figure 3 shows an image of the original railroad map. Our measure of

early exploration routes is based on a map of routes of major expeditions of exploration of the

US between 1835 and 1850 (United States Geological Survey, 1970). An image based on this map

is reproduced in figure 4. Note that, in addition to exploration routes, this map also shows the

routes of major roads established prior to 1835 in the more settled eastern part of the country. The

separate data appendix provides more detail about these variables.
  11 Thediscussion of the 1947 highway plan and 1898 railroad routes is derived from, and abbreviates more extensive
discussions of these variables by these earlier authors, particularly Duranton and Turner (2008).

   Common sense suggests that all three instruments should be relevant. The 1947 plan describes

many highways that were subsequently built. Many 1898 railroads were abandoned and turned

into roads. Many current interstate highways follow the same routes taken by early explorers.

Estimates of the reduced form equation predicting roads as a function of our instruments confirm

this intuition. In almost all specifications predicting interstate lane kilometers, the first-stage

statistic for the instrumental variables is large enough to pass the weak instrument tests proposed

in Stock and Yogo (2005). We generally report the results of conventional tsls estimations, but in

the few cases where our instruments are weak, we also report the corresponding liml estimates.

   A qualifier is important here. Our instruments are good predictors of msa level stocks of inter-

state highways and urban interstate highways. They are not good predictors of msa level stocks of

major roads or of non-urban interstate highways. For this reason, we conduct iv estimations only

for interstate highways and urban interstate highways.

   We now turn to the conditional exogeneity of our two instruments. The 1947 highway plan

was first drawn to ‘connect by routes as direct as practicable the principal metropolitan areas, cities

and industrial centers, to serve the national defense and to connect suitable border points with routes of

continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the Republic of Mexico’ (United States Federal


                                                   15
Works Agency, Public Roads Administration, 1947, cited in Michaels, 2008). That the 1947 highway

plan was, in fact, drawn to this mandate is confirmed by both econometric and historical evidence

reviewed in Duranton and Turner (2008). In particular, in a regression of log 1947 kilometers of

planned highway on log 1950 population, the coefficient on planned highways is almost exactly

one, a result that is robust to the addition of various controls. On the other hand population growth

around 1947 is uncorrelated with planned highway kilometers. Thus, the 1947 plan was drawn to

fulfill its mandate and connect major population centers of the mid-1940s, not to anticipate future

population or traffic demand.

   Note that the exclusion restriction associated with equation (5) requires the orthogonality of

the dependent variable and the instruments conditional on control variables. This observation

is important. Cities that receive more roads in the 1947 plan tend to be larger than cities that

receive fewer. Since we observe that large cities have higher levels of vkt, 1947 planned highway

kilometers predicts vkt by directly predicting population and indirectly by predicting 1980 road

kilometers. Thus the exogeneity of this instrument hinges on having an appropriate set of controls,

population in particular.

   Next consider the case for the exogeneity of the 1898 railroad network. This network was

built, for the most part, during and immediately after the civil war, and during the industrial

revolution. At this time, the us economy was much smaller and more agricultural than during

our study period. In addition, the rail network was developed by private companies with the

intention to make a profit from railroad operations in the not too distant future. See Fogel (1964)

and Fishlow (1965) for two classic accounts of the development of us railroads. As for the highway

plan, the same qualifying comment applies: instrument validity only requires that rail routes be

uncorrelated with the dependent variable conditional on the control variables. With this said, after

controlling for historical populations and physical geography, it is difficult to imagine how a rail

network built for profit could anticipate the demand for vehicle travel in cities 100 years later save

through its effect on roads.

   Finally, consider the case for the exogeneity of routes of expeditions of exploration between 1835

and 1850. Among these routes are; a Mexican boundary survey, the Whiting-Smith 1849 search for

a commercial route between San Antonio and El Paso, the 1849 Warner-Williamson expedition in

search of a route from Sacramento to the Great Basin, the 1839 Farnham-Smith expedition from

Peoria to Portland, and the Smith scientific expedition to the Badlands of South Dakota. Some of


                                                 16
these expeditions were explicitly charged with finding an easy way from one place to another and

it is hard to imagine that this objective was not also important to the others. While we expect that

these early explorers were drawn to attractive places, after controlling for historical populations

and physical geography it is difficult to imagine how these explorers could select routes that

anticipate the demand for vehicle travel in cities 150 years later save through their effect on roads.

   Table 4 presents instrumental variables estimations corresponding to the ols estimates presen-

ted in table 2. In panel a, our dependent variable is all msa interstate vkt, we use all three of our

instruments, and we pool our three decennial cross-sections. Column 1 includes only interstate

lane kilometers and decade effects as controls. Column 2 adds population as a control, column 3

adds our physical geography variables and census division indicators, column 4 adds our other

city level demographic variables, and column 5 adds decennial population levels from 1920 to

1980. We pass standard over-id test in all specifications, and the values of our first-stage statistics

suggest that they are either strong, or near the critical values suggested by Stock and Yogo (2005).

Column 5 is our preferred estimate: This regression contains the strongest controls, so it is in this

regression that we are most confident that our instruments satisfy the exclusion restriction, and

hence that we obtain an unbiased estimate of ρQ
                                              R . For interstate highways, this estimate is 1.04

with a standard error of 0.13. In columns 2 through 5 we see that our estimates of ρQ
                                                                                    R are within

one standard error of 1. In column 1, the coefficient of highways is larger because of the correlation

between highway lane kilometers and population levels.

   With this said, in columns 3, 4, and 5 of panel a our instruments are near critical values

suggested in Stock and Yogo (2005), so in panel b we present the corresponding liml estimates.

These estimates are essentially identical to the tsls estimates of panel a.

   In panels c, d, and e, we repeat the tsls estimates of panel a using each of our instruments alone.

We find that using the 1947 highway instrument alone results in slightly higher estimates, that

using 1898 railroads alone results in essentially identical estimates, and that using 1835 exploration

routes alone results in slightly lower estimates. In all, the iv estimates presented in panels a-e of

table 4 strongly suggest that the interstate vkt elasticity of interstate highways is close to one.

   In panel f of table 4 we duplicate the regressions of panel a but use urbanized area interstate

vkt as our dependent variable and urbanized interstate lane kilometers as our measure of roads.

Except for column 1, which does not control for population, these estimates are also all within one

standard deviation of one, although all of the point estimates are larger than the corresponding

estimates in panel a. This suggests that the urbanized interstate vkt elasticity of urbanized

interstate lane kilometers, ρQ
                             R , may be larger than for all interstates, and hence that this elasticity

may be even larger than one.12

   For all regressions in table 4 we pool our three cross-sections. This may conceal cross-decade

variation in our parameters. To address this issue, appendix table 7 in a separate appendix reports

iv estimates of ρQ
                 R using each of our cross-sections. These results confirm those reported in table 4.



4. Implications of the fundamental law of road congestion

We have so far presented direct evidence for the fundamental law of road congestion. We here note

that this law has thee implications. By confirming these implications, we provide further indirect

evidence of the law.


Perfectly elastic demand for VKT

The extant literature suggests that the long run cost of providing vkt is approximately constant

returns to scale (Keeler and Small, 1977, Small and Verhoef, 2007). In the notation of section 2, this

constant returns to scale condition is written λC ( R,Q) = C (λR, λQ) for λ a positive scalar. If such

constant returns holds, then the fundamental law of highway demand is equivalent to a perfectly

elastic demand for vkt. To see this, restate the fundamental law of highway congestion as,

                                                  Q∗ ((1 + λ) R)
                                        1+λ =                    .                                      (6)
                                                      Q∗ ( R)

That is, an increase in lane kilometers induces an exactly proportional increase in vkt. This

statement of the fundamental law, together with constant returns to scale of C gives

            C ((1 + λ) R,Q∗ ((1 + λ) R))   C ((1 + λ) R,(1 + λ) Q∗ ( R))   C ( R,Q∗ ( R))
                                         =                               =                .             (7)
                   Q∗ ((1 + λ) R)                 (1 + λ ) Q ∗ ( R )           Q∗ ( R)

It follows from our equilibrium condition (1) that P( Q∗ ((1 + λ) R)) = P( Q∗ ( R)). That is, given

constant returns to scale of C ( R,Q), the fundamental law of road congestion is equivalent to

perfectly elastic demand for vkt.

   In order to check this implication of the fundamental law of road congestion, we must estimate

the price elasticity of vkt. That is, we would like to know how aggregate demand for vkt responds
 12 ρ Qis not bounded from above by one. An additional segment of roads can make a network more attractive.
      R
Alternatively, more lanes to relieve a particular bottleneck can increase travel on an entire road.


                                                    19
to changes in the price of travel. To begin, consider the demand by individual j for vkt in msa i,

D j ( Pi , ·). While we imagine that this demand will also depend on the city’s size, climate and

geography, demand for travel also responds to the price of this travel. That is, the number of trips

an individual takes to the store, or the length of his commute, depends on the unit cost of travel. As

a first approximation, the extent of the road network does not enter directly into the individual’s

demand function except through its impact on the time per unit travel. This will be the identifying

assumption that we use to distinguish the demand curve from the supply curve.

   If we aggregate and then invert our individual demand curve, we are left with an aggregate

inverse demand curve for msa i,

                                             P ln( Q ) + A X + e ,
                            ln( Pi ) = A0 + ρQ      i     2 i   i                                   (8)

where ρQ
       P is the vkt elasticity of the price.


   The supply curve for vkt in msa i describes the amount of travel that may be produced in an

msa at given cost. This is analogous to a standard supply curve, except that the open access nature

of the network requires that the supply curve describe the way supply responds to changes in

average cost rather than changes in marginal cost. Excluding pathological examples, the amount

of travel produced in an msa at a given unit time cost should increase with the extent of the road

network. If we invert this supply relationship, we are able to write the unit cost of vkt as a function

of the level of vkt, the extent of the road network, and other msa characteristics such as climate,

size and physical geography which also determine the cost of travel. That is, we have


                     ln( ACi ) = B0 + B1 ln( Qi ) + B2 ln( Ri ) + B3 Xi + µi .                      (9)

   One problem remains. We are concerned that roads may be assigned to msas on the basis of

unobserved characteristics which also affect supply or demand. In this case, Ri is correlated with

the errors in both equations and standard techniques result in biased estimates of ρQ
                                                                                    P.


   To avoid this problem, rather than include Ri as an explanatory variable in our supply rela-

tionship, we proxy for the stock of roads using our three instrumental variables. These variables

control for msa level variation in the extent of the road network, but unlike actual lane kilometers

of highways, are exogenous in demand and supply equations. Using these proxy variables, our

supply equation becomes


                     ln( ACi ) = B0 + B1 ln( Qi ) + B2 ln( Zi ) + B3 Xi + µi .                     (10)

                                                  20
   Using the equilibrium condition, Pi = ACi , these equations lead to the estimating equations,

                                  ln( Qi ) = b0 + b1 Xi + b2 Zi + ηi ,
                                                                                                                       (11)
                                   ln( Pi ) = a0 + ρQ
                                                    P ln
                                                       \ ( Qi ) + a2 Xi + φi .

We note that this is the textbook example of a simultaneous equations estimation (see for example

Wooldridge, 2001) and identification of ρQ
                                         P depends upon satisfying the exclusion restriction that,


conditional on control variables, the instruments shift supply but not demand.

   To estimate the demand function for vkt we use the 1995 and 2001 waves of the National

Personal Transportation Survey (npts).13 The npts actually consists of four surveys.14 The ‘house-

hold survey’ provides categorical variables describing the age, race, education, and income of the

household head or the principal respondent. The ‘vehicle survey’ provides a detailed description

of each household motor vehicle including the survey respondents’ report of how many kilometers

it was driven in the past twelve months. We use this information to construct an estimate of total

vkt for the household during the survey year. This information is reported in the top section of

table 5. Surprisingly, these data show that driving distances per person, household, and vehicle all

declined between 1995 and 2001. The ‘person survey’ describes travel behavior for each household

member on a typical travel day. From this, we construct household mean commute distance,

time and speed for household members who drive to work. Table 5 shows that mean commute

distance decreased from 20.4 km in 1995 to 19.4 in 2001. This decrease in distance resulted in a

small decrease in mean commute times despite a decline in speed. Finally, the ‘travel day’ survey

collects detailed information about each trip taken by each household member on a randomly

selected travel day. These data allow the calculation of household person-kilometers of vehicle

travel, along with the person-minutes required to accomplish this travel, and the average speed of

this travel. Table 5 shows that total daily household person-kilometers of travel was approximately

  13 We make use of the confidential geocode information which allows all respondents to be assigned to msas. The
public use data only reveals respondents’s msas for respondents residing in large msas. We do not use earlier waves
of the npts because they cannot be geocoded. This allows us to focus on the vkt elasticity of the time cost of travel. In
section 6, we consider other travel costs and show that they do not affect the estimation of ρQ
                                                                                              P.

  14 It is worth noting that the npts survey protocol requires a phone call, a house visit, and that respondents keep a

travel diary. Thus it should be regarded as accurate relative to other sources self-reported travel data. The 2000 us census
provides an alternative source of information regarding commute times. This information is reported for a sample of
the population using 12 time-bands. A comparison between 2000 census and 2001 npts data of mean commute times
across 227 msas yields a raw correlation of 0.63. This correlation is 0.85 when considering only msas with population
above 1 million. Means computed from the npts appear more noisy. Regressing log census mean commute times for all
commuters (including those using public transportation) against mean npts car commute times yields a coefficient of
1.05 in a regression without constant.

147.7 minutes to 160.9 minutes and speed decreased from 48.4 to 43.9 km/h.

   The descriptive statistics in table 5 point at stability or a small decline in vkt per household

between 1995 and 2001. For the same period, the hpms indicates increases of around 20% for

vkt, as reported at the bottom of table 5. It is natural to wonder whether these two findings are

contradictory. To see that they are not, note that the npts and the hpms report different measures of

vkt.15 The npts reports a per household measure of vkt on all roads. On the other hand, the hpms

reports aggregate vkt on interstates and major urban roads within msas. Thus, the hpms looks at

a different set of roads than the npts and the 2001-1995 difference reflects changes in commercial

traffic and number of households, in addition to changes in vkt per household.

   We now use the npts to estimate our demand system (11) and test whether, as implied by the
  15 We rule out sampling errors. npts data sample a large number of households, are broadly acknowledged to be of

high quality, and their correlation with census data is also high as mentioned above. Schipper and Moorhead (2000)
also provide evidence that reported vkt in the npts is highly consistent with odometer vkt from the 1994 Residential
Transportation Energy Consumption Survey. As for the hpms, it is carefully scrutinized by the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics which uses it as the basis of its Transportation Statistics Annual Report.

fundamental law of road congestion, the demand for vkt is perfectly elastic. In table 6 we pool the

1995 and 2001 npts and use ‘hours per commute kilometer’, the unit time cost of commuting, as

our dependent variable for columns 1 through 4. This variable is based on the ‘personal’ section

of the npts which asks for commute time and distance. The dependent variable of interest is lane

kilometers of interstate highways.

   In the first three columns, we ignore the simultaneous determination of price and quantity and

regress price on quantity with various other controls using ols. This shows that equilibrium time

cost of commuting is weakly responsive to changes in the quantity supplied of interstate lane

kilometers. In column 4 we estimate the two equation model of (11) in order to isolate the slope of

the demand function. The estimated demand elasticity is close to zero at -0.06 and, as in columns

1-3, is precisely estimated.

   Columns 5 through 8 of table 6 replicate the same regressions using a different dependent

variable. The time cost of travel is measured using the ‘hours per kilometer of daily driving’

calculated from the travel day section of the npts. The ols estimates of the demand elasticities are

marginally lower and the tsls estimate is similar to that of column 4.

   As a further robustness check, we replicate these ols regressions for other types of roads. Our

instruments are not strong enough to allow us to replicate iv results for these other types of roads.

We obtain very similar ols results, which are reported in appendix table 8

   In sum the data support the hypothesis that the demand for vkt is highly elastic. These results

provide independent confirmation of our main result since, given constant returns to scale in the


                                                       23
cost of vkt, a perfectly elastic demand for vkt is an implication the fundamental law of road

congestion.16 This conclusion is also of intrinsic interest.


Convergence of      AADT   levels

The fundamental law of road congestion requires that each msa have an intrinsic natural level of

traffic conditional on lane kilometers of roadway. An implication of this is that a deviation from

this natural level ought to be followed by a return to it. Traffic flows should exhibit convergence

to this natural level.

   The raw data suggests that such convergence may occur. From 1980 to 2000 the cross-msa

standard deviation of all interstate aadt decreases from 1.40 to 1.28. To investigate the possibility

of convergence more carefully, table 7 presents the results of ‘aadt growth regressions’ in which

we pool first differences in interstate aadt for 1990 and 2000 and regress them on initial interstate

aadt levels.

   In the first five columns of panel a we see that the relationship between initial levels and

changes in interstate aadt is negative in the cross-section, even as we add an exhaustive set of

controls. In column 6 we see that mean reversion persists if we include an msa fixed effect and

consider only time series variation.17 In column 7 we account for the possibility of an endogenous

relationship between changes in aadt and changes in population by instrumenting for the latter

using our population change instrument described above. This iv estimate shows mean reversion

similar to what we see in the ols regressions.

   In appendix table 9 (in a separate appendix), we replicate these regressions for corresponding

measures of aadt for Interstates Highways in urbanized areas, non urban interstates, and major

urban roads and find evidence of convergence for these roads as well.


Traffic and transit

The fundamental law of road congestion requires that new road capacity be met with a propor-

tional increase in driving. A corollary is that if we were to somehow remove a subset of a city’s

drivers from a city’s roads, then others would take their place. We can think of public transit
  16 Thishigh elasticity of the demand for vkt is consistent with the findings on road charging. See for instance Leape
(2006) on the London congestion charge.
  17 The much higher coefficient obtained in this regression is reminiscent of results in gdp growth regressions and might

be explained by the greater importance of measurement error for differences than for levels.

in this way. Public transit serves to free up road capacity by taking drivers off the roads and

putting them in buses or trains. It follows that an implication of the fundamental law is that the

provision of public transit should not affect the overall level of vkt in a city. We now investigate

this proposition.

   To measure an msa’s stock of public transit, we use msa level data on public transit. These data

are based on the Section 15 annual reports, and measure public transportation as the daily average

peak service of large buses in 1984, 1994, and 2004. We note that these data do not allow us to

investigate other forms of public transportation, such as light rail, independently of buses.18

   Since we expect that the stock of public transit in an msa may depend in part on how congested

is the road network, we are concerned that our measure of public transit will be endogenous in a

regression to explain msa interstate vkt. To deal with this issue, we again resort to instrumental

variables estimation. In addition to the 1947 highway plan and 1898 railroad kilometers, we follow

Duranton and Turner (2008) and use the msa share of democratic vote in the 1972 presidential

election as an instrument in this estimation.

   The 1972 us presidential election between Richard Nixon and George McGovern was fought on

the Vietnam War and McGovern’s very progressive social agenda. It ended with Nixon’s landslide

victory. Places where McGovern did well are also arguably places which elected local officials with

a strong social agenda. Importantly, this election also took place shortly after the 1970 Urban Mass
  18 There are too few msas with light rail to permit informative cross-sectional analysis. Our data indicate that there
are only 11 msas with any light rail at all in 1984, and of these only 6 had more than 100 rail cars. The situation is
only marginally better in 1994 when 21 msas had light rail or commuter rail service and 7 had more than 100 cars. We
have experimented with an index that sums large buses and rail cars in the regression performed below, and found no
qualitative change in our results.

Transportation Act and it only briefly predates the first oil shock and the 1974 National Mass Trans-

portation Act that followed. While total federal support for public transportation was less than 5

billion dollars (in 2003 dollars) for the entire decade starting in 1960, the 1970 act appropriated

nearly 15 billion dollars and the 1974 act appropriated 44 billion dollars. Similar levels of funding

persist to the time of this writing (see Weiner, 1997, Hess and Lombardi, 2005, for a history of us

public transportation). More generally, during the 1970s public transit expanded and evolved from

a private fare-based industry to a quasi-public sector activity sustained by significant subsidies.

   In order for a 1972 election to predict 1984 levels of public transit infrastructure, public transit

funding must be persistent. In fact, the ‘stickiness’ of public transit provision is widely observed

(Gomez-Ibanez, 1996) and is confirmed in our data. The Spearman rank correlation of bus counts

between 1984 and 2004 is 0.90. Our data also suggest that msas which voted heavily for McGovern

in 1972 made a greater effort to develop public transit in the 1970s, and these high levels of public

transit persisted through our study period. Furthermore, the raw data confirms the relevance of

our instrument. The pairwise correlation between log 1984 buses and 1972 democratic vote is

0.34. This partial correlation is robust to adding controls for geography and past population. In a

nutshell, the 1972 share of democratic vote is a good predictor of the 1984 msa provision of buses

which then grew proportionately to population.

   The argument for the exogeneity of the 1972 democratic vote is less strong than that for the road

instruments.19 Nonetheless, a good argument can be made that funding for public transportation

in American cities in the early 1970s was a response to contemporaneous social needs. More

specifically, the provision of buses at this time did not seek to accommodate traffic congestion

during the 1983-2003 period.

   Two facts strengthen the case for our empirical strategy. First, as we show below, the results for

public transportation are robust and stable as we change specifications. Second, when it is possible

to conduct over identification tests, our results always pass these tests.

   Regressions in table 8 are similar to regressions in tables 2 and 4 except that we also include the
  19 In
      particular, it is possible that a high share democratic vote in 1972 was associated with a variety of other policies
and local characteristics that affected subsequent vkt. Since we control for 1980 population (and thus implicitly for
growth between 1970 and 1980), we would need these policies to have long-lasting effects and not be reflected in
population growth. In this respect, Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Schleifer (1995) find very weak or no association between
a number of urban policies (though not public transport) and urban growth between 1960 and 1990. In addition, recent
work by Ferreira and Gyourko (2009) could find no evidence of any partisan effect with respect to the allocation of
municipal expenditure.

log count of large buses in an msa as an explanatory variable. In columns 1 through 6 we present

ols regressions while in columns 7 through 10 we report liml regressions (rather than tsls since

our set of instruments is sometimes marginally weak). In panel a of table 8 our dependent variable

is log vkt for all interstates. As in results reported earlier, the lane kilometer elasticity of vkt is

close to one in all specifications. The second row of panel a gives our estimates of the bus elasticity

of vkt. These estimates are consistently small, are precisely estimated, do not have a consistent

sign, and are often statistically indistinguishable from zero. Panel b of table 8 uses msa vkt

on urbanized area interstate highways as its dependent variable and its corresponding measure

of lane kilometers as its measure of roads. While the resulting roadway elasticity estimates are

somewhat larger and less precisely estimated, they are qualitatively similar to the results of panel

a. For public transit as measured by the count of large buses in an msa, the conclusion is the same

as in panel a: the provision of buses does not affect total vkt in the msa.

   To check the robustness of this finding, appendix table 10 (in a separate appendix) repeats some



                                                         27
of the regressions of table 8 for each of our three cross-sections. The resulting estimates of the

bus elasticity of vkt are qualitatively unchanged. As a further check, appendix table 11 repeats

many of the regressions of table 8 using measures on non-urbanized interstate lane kilometers

and vkt and urbanized area major road kilometers and vkt. Finally appendix table 12 repeats the

regressions of table 8 using a broader measure of transit adding all train cars to our count of buses.

The resulting elasticity estimates of these two tables also support the conclusion that public transit

does not affect traffic levels.

   Finally, we note that the finding that public transit does not reduce traffic levels should be of

independent interest to policy makers.


5. Where does all the VKT come from?

Our data show that building roads elicits a large increase in vkt on those roads. We now turn our

attention to understanding where all the extra vkt comes from. In particular, we consider four

possible sources of demand for vkt: changes in individual behavior; the migration of people and

economic activity, increases in the commercial transportation sector, and diversion of traffic from

other roads.


Commercial VKT

To investigate the relationship between changes in the road network and changes in truck vkt we

first use the hpms Sample data’s reports of the daily share of single unit and combination trucks

using each road segment on an average day. With our other data, this allows us to calculate truck

vkt for all roads in our sample. With these measures of truck vkt in hand, we replicate our earlier

analysis of all vkt for truck vkt.

   Table 9 reports these results. In panel a our dependent variable is all interstate highway truck

vkt and the explanatory variable of interest is lane kilometers of interstate highways. In columns

1 through 5, we report the results of ols estimates. In columns 6, 7 and 8 we include an msa

fixed effect and identify the effect of highways on truck vkt using only time series variation. In

columns 9 and 10 we report tsls where we use our three historical variables to instrument for

contemporaneous lane kilometers. In every case, our estimate of the highway elasticity of truck

vkt is above one and is estimated precisely. While the ols and fixed effect estimates are generally

within two standard deviations of one, the iv estimates in columns 9 and 10 are above 2 and are

more than two standard deviations from one.

   In panel b of table 9 we replicate the ols estimations of panel a, but measure roadway and truck

vkt for major urban roads (but not the tsls because our instruments are weak). Truck vkt in cities

responds less to changes in major roads than does interstate truck traffic to changes in interstates.

These results are confirmed in Appendix table 13 which runs separate regressions for each decade.

   In all, we find that a 10% increase in interstate highways causes about a 10-20% increase in truck

vkt, so that commercial traffic is at least as responsive to road supply as other traffic.

   In a separate appendix, we also examine the relationship between roads and employment

in traffic intensive activities. We use County Business Patterns data for 1983, 1993, and 2003.

These data provide county level information on employment in "Motor freight transportation and

warehousing" (sic 42). Appendix tables 14 and 15 present results of regressions predicting log msa

employment in trucking and warehousing. These regressions show that employment in this sector

increases with interstate lane kilometers, that it is more responsive to the supply of non-urbanized

area interstate than to the supply of urbanized area interstate, and that it has become more sensitive

to changes in the supply of interstate highways over the course of our study period.

   Overall, our findings suggest that improvements to highways cause large increases in the use of

these routes by long-haul truckers, and that improvements to the local road network cause smaller

increases in local commercial traffic.


Individual driving behavior and highways

We now investigate the extent to which individual or household driving behavior changes in

response to changes in the extent of an msa’s interstate network. To accomplish this, we look

at the relationship between lane kilometers of interstate highway and three different measures of

individual and household driving taken from the npts.

   We estimate two basic equations using our two pooled cross-sections of the npts. The first

is our city level cross-section estimating equation (2), adjusted to reflect the fact that our unit of

observation is now a person or household in a particular city and year. In particular, we estimate,

       j denotes vkt on all roads for household (or individual) j and i indexes msas. Because

of the log specification, the coefficient on lane kilometers is the elasticity of household vkt on all

roads with respect to highway lane kilometers. We include as control variables both msa level

characteristics and individual demographic characteristics, and allow for clustering of errors at

the msa level.

   Our second equation is the individual or household level analog of our instrumental variables

estimating equation (5). Here, our first stage equation predicts interstate kilometers and is identical

to the first stage in equation (5), the second stage corresponds to equation (12).

   Summary statistics for the npts are provided in table 5. Table 10 reports the results of regres-

sions to explain three measures of individual driving using pooled cross-sections from the 1995

and 2001 npts. Panel a of the table presents ols estimates and panel b presents tsls estimates. In

the first three columns our dependent variable is commute kilometers on a typical day for all npts

individuals who commute. In columns 4 through 6 our dependent variable is total household

person vehicle kilometers on a particular travel day. In columns 7 through 9, our dependent

variable is total vkt by all household vehicles in the survey year.

   With the exception of the regression in column 7, for which there is no measurable relationship

between interstate kilometers and household vehicle kilometers, all estimates suggest a positive

and statistically significant relationship between the extent of the highway network and individual

travel. Our preferred estimates are the tsls estimates in panel b. These estimates suggests that

a 10% increase in the extent of the interstate network causes about a 1% increase in individual

driving on all roads. While the npts data does not reveal which classes of roads accommodate this

increase in driving, in what follows we use the hpms to explore the diversion of traffic between

classes of roads.


Population growth

By reducing the cost of transportation within a city, all else equal, improvements to a city’s road

network make a city more attractive relative to other cities. Given the high mobility of the us

population, this suggests that changes to a city’s road network should be met with changes to a

city’s population. In fact, this conjecture appears to be true, and the extant literature estimates the

size of this effect.

   Both Michaels (2008) and Chandra and Thompson (2000) provide suggestive evidence. Both

papers consider the effect of improvements in access to the interstate system on rural counties in

the us. Michaels (2008) finds that an interstate highway in a rural county leads to large increases in



                                                        31
retail earnings. Chandra and Thompson (2000) find that improved access to the8 interstate system

causes an overall increase in firm earnings. Together, these results show that interstate highways

cause increases in the level of local economic activity. To the extent that population levels and

overall economic activity are linked, this suggests that improvements to the interstate network

lead to population increases.

   Duranton and Turner (2008) provide more direct evidence. Duranton and Turner (2008) con-

sider us msas between 1980 and 2000, and investigate the way that population growth responds

to changes in the road network. Like the current paper, they rely on an early plan of the interstate

highway network and 1898 railroad routes as instruments for the modern road network. They find

that a 10% increase the extent of the road network causes a 1.3% increase in msa population over

10 years, and a 2% increase over 20 years.


Diversion from other roads

We measure traffic and lane kilometers for three exclusive classes of roads in each msa; urbanized

area interstates, non-urbanized area interstates, and major urbanized area roads. These data allow

direct tests of whether changes to one class of roads affects vkt on the others. In particular, we

estimate each of the three following variants of equation (2),

In equation (13), ρQ
                   Rihnu is the urbanized area interstate vkt elasticity of non urbanized area inter-

state lane kilometers. If, for example, this parameter is -0.1 then a 10% increase in non-urbanized

area interstate lane kilometers results in a 1% decrease in urbanized area interstate vkt. Interpret-

ation of other coefficients is similar.

   Table 11 reports estimates of equations (13)-(15). In all regressions we pool our three cross-

sections of hpms data and use ols. Panel a presents estimates of equation (13). In these regressions

our dependent variable is urbanized area interstate vkt and the dependent variables of interest are

the three measures of lane kilometers. The first five columns exploit cross-sectional variation and

from left to right, use progressively more exhaustive lists of controls. In columns 6 through 8 we

include an msa fixed effect and exploit only time series variation. Panels b and c are similar to

                                                   32
panel a, but use non-urbanized interstate vkt and major urbanized area road vkt as dependent

variables.

   Consistent with our earlier results we see that vkt elasticity of own lane kilometers is close to

one in all specifications. The largest estimated cross elasticity is 0.22 for the non-urbanized area

interstate vkt elasticity of urbanized area major road lane kilometers, in column 1, row 3 of panel

b. This estimate is not robust to the addition of controls, and is negative or indistinguishable

from zero in other specifications. The estimate of the urbanized area interstate vkt elasticity of

urbanized area major road lane kilometers in row 3 column 1 of panel a is similar. Other cross-

elasticities are generally quite small. Our preferred regressions are reported in column 5. In this

specification, all cross-elasticities are negative with magnitudes no larger than 0.1. In sum, table

11 suggests that, while traffic diversion does occur in response to changes in the road network, the

fundamental law of road congestion mainly reflects traffic creation not traffic diversion.

   In a separate appendix, we confirm these results in appendix tables 16 and 17. In these tables

we replicate the results of table 11 in decade by decade ols regressions and in first difference

regressions.


An accounting exercise

The fundamental law of road congestion requires that changes in the extent of the road network are

met with proportional changes in traffic. We have suggested four possible sources for this increase

in traffic; changes in trucking and commercial driving, changes in individual or household driving

behavior, changes in population, and diversion of traffic. We now consider whether these four

sources are sufficient to explain the fundamental law and assess their relative importance.

   To begin, consider a 10% increase in the interstate network of an average msa around 2000.

Using our preferred estimate from column 5 of table 4, this increase causes a 10.4% increase in vkt

on the interstates of our hypothetical city.

   In table 1 we see that in 2003, trucks accounted for 13% of vkt on interstate highways in an

average msa. In table 9, our preferred specification is column 10, where the truck vkt elasticity

of interstate highways is about 2.3. This means that a 10% increase in the stock of roads causes

about a 23% increase in truck vkt and a 2.9% increase in overall interstate vkt, about 28% of the

total increase in vkt caused by our 10% increase in roads. While our preferred elasticity of 2.3 may

seem high, the average of all estimates in panel a of table 9 is 1.5. This value would imply that

trucks represent 18% of the total increase in vkt. Therefore, we estimate that trucks account for

between 18 and 28% of the total increase in interstate vkt that results from our hypothetical 10%

increase in interstate lane kilometers.

   For migration, taking the preferred estimate from Duranton and Turner (2008), our 10% increase

in the interstate network causes about a 2% increase in population. From column 5 of table 4, the

msa population elasticity of interstate vkt is 0.23. Together, these two elasticities suggest that a 10%

increase in population results in about a 0.5% increase interstate vkt, about 5% of the total increase.

This elasticity of 0.23 is estimated in a regression that also controls for decennial population levels

between 1920 and 1970. Because decennial population levels are highly correlated, this may

understate the effect of population on vkt. Appendix table 6 which controls for the endogeneity



                                                       34
of population in first difference reports higher estimates. Our favored estimate in column 5 is

0.76. This alternative value implies that population growth represents 15% the total effect of an

extension in interstate lane kilometers. Therefore, we estimate that migration accounts for between

5 and 15% of the total increase in interstate vkt that results from our hypothetical 10% increase in

interstate lane kilometers.

   Turning to substitution across roads, we suppose that the 10% increase in our msa’s interstate

lane kilometers network is accomplished by increasing both urbanized and non-urbanized inter-

states by 10%. Since we are considering increases to both classes of interstate highways, we need

only be concerned with diversion of traffic from major urbanized area roads. This is estimated in

panel c of table 11. Our preferred specification is in column 5. In rows 1 and 2, we see that a 10%

increase in urbanized and non-urbanized interstate causes a decrease in major urban road vkt of

0.48% and 0.04%, respectively. That is, our 10% increase in interstate lane kilometers diverts 0.52%

of traffic from major urban roads. Using the levels of vkt for major urban and all interstates given

in table 1 allows us to calculate that this diversion amounts to about a 1% increase in interstate

vkt, or about 10% of the total effect of our hypothetical 10% extension. Because many estimates in

table 11 (or in appendix tables 16 and 17) indicate no substitution from major urban roads towards

interstates, we cannot rule out the absence of a substitution effect. Therefore, we estimate that the

diversion of traffic from other classes of roads accounts for between 0 and 10% of the total increase

in interstate vkt that results from our hypothetical 10% increase in interstate lane kilometers.

   Calculating the contribution of changes to household behavior is more difficult. Table 10

estimates the effect of interstate lane kilometers on individual driving behavior. Our preferred

estimates of this elasticity is 0.13 in column 9 of panel b (and is very close to the corresponding

estimate for alternative measures of vkt in columns 3 and 6). A 10% increase in interstate lane

kilometers causes a 1.3% increase in household annual vkt. Unfortunately, our data do not allow

us to apportion household driving to different road networks. A first possibility is to assume

that this 1.3% increase in driving is proportional to current driving across all road networks.

Since households represent 87% of interstate vkt, this 1.3% increase represents an increase in

interstate vkt of 1.1% or 11% of the total increase in interstate vkt caused by a 10% increase in

lane kilometers. This is arguably an unrealistic lower bound. Alternately, suppose that the 1.3%

increase in household driving takes place only on interstates (recall that we earlier reported that

about 24% of vkt takes place on interstates). In this case, the increase in interstate vkt would

account for 4.8% of the total change in vkt or 46% of the effect of our expansion in lane miles. This

constitutes an upper-bound. Therefore, we estimate that increases in household driving account

for between 11 and 46% of the total increase in interstate vkt that results from our hypothetical

10% increase in interstate lane kilometers.

   To sum up, of four possible sources for the new traffic following an increase in lane kilometers

of interstates, changes to individual behavior and changes in commercial driving are the most

important. Migration and traffic diversion are significantly less important. We also note that if we

take the upper bound for the shares of all four sources we account for the entire increase in vkt.


6. Welfare calculation

Highway provision and welfare

That expansions of highways are met with large increases in vkt is sometimes used to argue

that the social value of new road capacity is low (Cervero, 2002, reports several such claims). To

understand why this argument is false, it is helpful to return to our simple model of the demand

and supply of traffic.

   Figure 5 describes demand and supply for vkt, and is similar to figure 1, except that it also
                                                                                                     0
represents the welfare gain for vkt associated with an increase in lane kilometers from R to R .
                                                1
Note first that the total cost of supplying Q with R is simply the average cost times quantity,




                                                 36
AC ( R) × Q∗ .20 In figure 3, this is the area of the rectangle whose northeast corner is the equilibrium

point and whose southwest corner is the origin. The consumers’ surplus associated with Q∗ is the

area under the demand curve and above average cost between 0 and Q∗ . It is equal to the social

surplus and it is represented by the hatched triangle in the figure. If we increase lane kilometers
     0
to R we see that the resulting marginal change to this surplus is given by the area of the shaded

quadrilateral in figure 3.

   We note three issues before proceeding. First and because the equilibrium is inefficient, we

compute the welfare change associated with an increase in the stock of highways given free access

to these highways. Estimating first-best vkt for given R is beyond the reach of our data because

such an estimation requires an estimation of the marginal cost function for vkt. Moreover, given

that comprehensive congestion pricing is, optimistically, still some distance in the future, the

calculation of such an optimum is of little practical value to policy makers. Second, we consider

a small increase in lane kilometers in one msa. We assume it does not affect travel conditions in

other msas. Third, this calculation ignores any cost or benefit effect not reflected in the cost curve.

Possible examples include pollution, carbon emissions, greater productivity or improved land

access.21 A full welfare calculation taking into account general equilibrium and external effects

is beyond the scope of this paper and would require additional detailed land market information

in the tradition of Mohring (1961). Here, we focus only on travel issues which are often the key

justification put forward in favor of road investments.

   Suppose that in figure 3, R is one percent larger than R. After dropping the * superscript for

respect to lane kilometers. Hence the change in surplus, ∆W, associated with a 1% increase in the

stock of lane kilometers is,

  20 We ignore the cost of building and maintaining roads for the time being.
  21 To understand this last point, consider a central city and a close suburb, both with a unit supply of residences
and hosting half the residents each. Assume the highway between central city and the close suburb that all suburban
residents use is doubled in length to reach a remote suburb. Each location then hosts a third of the residents and this
leads to a doubling of vkt. However the utility of residents increases since land consumption per capita is now 50%
larger. We are grateful to Edward Glaeser for this point.

   Because of substitution between highways and other roads, we expect an increase in highway

lane kilometers to affect also the cost of driving on other roads. Similar arguments lead us to write

the expression for the marginal welfare change for other roads corresponding to (17) as,
                                                             Qor

the highway elasticity of other road vkt.

   Finally, the total marginal welfare gain from an additional lane kilometer of highway is ∆w =

∆wih + ∆wor .

   A complete calculation of all the terms in (17) and (18) requires data well beyond what we have

available. Nonetheless, we can compute an upper bound for ∆w. First, as shown by table 11 an

increase in highway lane kilometers has a stronger effect on highway vkt than on vkt on other
                 ih         or
roads so that ρQ       Q
               Rih > ρ Rih . Second, according to the us fhwa (2005), vkt on interstates represents

about one quarter of total vkt so that Qor ≈ 3 Qih . Under these assumptions, it is simple to show

that:                                                     !

   Third, we note that our information for the time cost of driving is from the npts. It is for all

roads and cannot distinguish between highways and other roads. Thus, to evaluate equation (19)

we must transform it so that all terms involving the cost of travel are evaluated over all roads. This

is possible under the mild assumptions described below.

   With about three times as much traffic on other roads as on highways, the price of driving

on all roads can be approximated by Par ≈ [3 Por + Pih ] /4 and its corresponding highway vkt

cost of highway driving to be larger than the highway vkt elasticity of the cost of driving on other

Time in vehicle

To estimate Par and its associated highway vkt elasticity, we consider both the time cost of driving

and the cost of operating a vehicle. Since the elasticities are likely to differ, we consider both

components separately:

                                                      TCar + ρVOC
                                    P ar         TC      ar                    ar
                                   ρQ ih P
                                           ar
                                              ≡ ρQ ih         Qih                   VOCar ,                           (22)

where TC denotes time-in-vehicle cost and VOC denotes vehicle operating costs.

   Measuring time-in-vehicle costs TCar is relatively straightforward. Using the npts trip data, we

compute time per kilometer by inverting our estimates of trip speed for each msa.22 Census data

for mean msa incomes in 2000 allows us to calculate an msa hourly income assuming 2500 hours

per year.23 We adjust this wage by a ‘wage factor’ to take into account that workers may not value

time in vehicle in the same way as time at work. The product of hours per kilometer by hourly

wage adjusted by a wage factor is our measure of TCar . According to Small and Verhoef (2007),

the standard approach in transportation studies is to value the time cost of commuting at half

the wage. We follow this approach. As an illustration and taking median msa values, 0.023 hour

per kilometer valued at a 2000 hourly wage of $ 20.20 adjusted by a factor of 50% (and inflation)

implies a time cost of $ 0.26 per km in 2008 dollar.
  22 Focusing on regular commutes rather than all trips on a given day leads to a slightly lower cost per kilometer. We

retain the higher number.
  23 The American Time Use Survey reports around 1260 hours of work per person above the age of 15 annually. With

2.66 people per household and slightly less than 80% of the population above the age of 15, this implies around 2,630
hours of work per household annually. We take 2,500 to remain conservative. This yields wages about 15% higher in
real terms than wages from the us Bureau of Labor Statistics as used by Ng and Small (2008).


                                                               39
   The elasticity ρQ
                   TC is what is estimated in table 6.24 The first four columns of panel a of the

estimates are between -0.05 and -0.06 when we control for city characteristics. Using measures of

TCar from all household driving leads to slightly lower ols estimates and a similar tsls estimate.

Given these results, we use -0.06 as baseline value for ρQ
                                                         TC . Because we have less confidence in

examine below the sensitivity of our results to alternative values.


Vehicle operating cost

For vehicle operating costs, we concentrate on fuel consumption. This is likely to be the main

component of vehicle operating costs which varies with traffic conditions (at least over the range

that we consider).

   According to engineering evidence for 9 cars from 1997 cited in Davis, Diegel, and Boundy

(2008), a 20% increase in speed from about 40 to 48 km/h leads to a 5% decrease in fuel consump-

tion, which implies an arc elasticity of around -0.25 for the speed elasticity of fuel consumption.

This speed elasticity can then be multiplied by the elasticity of speed to highway lane kilometers,

that is the opposite of the elasticity of time per kilometer to interstate lane kilometers, to obtain

the relevant elasticity, ρVOC . While we believe that 40 to 48 km/h is the relevant speed range
                                  ar
                          Qih

to consider given the descriptive statistics for speed in table 5, we note that further increases in

speed lead to first a flattening and then an increase in fuel consumption. For fuel consumption, we

take 0.075 l/km. This is slightly above the numbers reported in the npts. Then we value this fuel

consumption at the average price across us states of 0.37 $/l for 2001. With these values, we obtain

$ 0.03 per kilometer for 2008.

   Viewed differently and using (22), this cost of $ 0.03 per kilometer multiplied by the speed

elasticity of consumption of 0.25 can be added to TCar before multiplying it by ρQ
                                                                                 TC . This added        ar
                                                                                   ih


quantity is less than $ 0.01 per kilometer relative to our value of about $ 0.26 for the time cost. This

suggests that our calculation is not sensitive to the assumptions made for vehicle operating costs.

Even a tripling of fuel prices would make little difference here.
  24 There is a tiny difference in that table 6 uses a cost measured in units of time as opposed to a dollar cost. The ols

estimates for the dollar cost elasticity are the same. We are not confident that our instrumentation strategy works for
dollar costs per kilometers since we expect our instruments to affect local earnings through channels other than vkt.

A welfare calculation

We can now compute the upper bound for ∆w given by (20) and (22) for 228 msas. Taking

         = −0.06, we find that the msa mean of the upper bound on the welfare gain for an extra
 TC ar
ρQ ih


lane kilometer of highway is $227,000 by year. Unsurprisingly, there is considerable cross-msa

variation in this upper bound, with values around or below $40,000 for Great Falls (mt), Casper

(wy), and Lawton (ok) and values near or above $600,000 for Chicago, Miami, Washington, San

Francisco, and West Palm Beach.

   We now turn to the cost of new lane kilometers of highways. Duranton and Turner (2008) use

data from the us Federal Government, to argue for an annual cost per kilometer of $450,000 for

maintenance of interstates. With an msa average of 4.5 lanes by highway, this figure suggests an

annual maintenance cost per lane kilometer around $100,000. For estimates of construction costs,

we rely on figures recently proposed by Ng and Small (2008). For 2006, the total costs of an extra

lane kilometer of expressways are m$3.64 for msas with a population less than 200,000, m$5.34 for

msas with a population between 200,000 and 1 million, and m$11.96 for msas with a population

greater that 1 million. Taking a cost of capital of 5% per year, these figures imply an msa average

capital cost of $419,000 per year per lane kilometer of interstate. Hence, on average the cost of

an extra lane kilometer of highway is about $519,000 annually, or more than twice as large as the

average upper bound of the welfare gain from a lane kilometer of interstate.

   The difference between costs and the upper bound of welfare is, of course, not the same across

msas. The lower bound on net welfare losses associated with a kilometer of interstate highway is

around $500,000 for the bottom five cities: Rochester (ny), Grand Rapids (mi), Oklahoma City (ok),

Greensboro (nc), and Las Vegas (nv). Only five msas would experience a net maximum welfare

gain of an average $70,000. They are West Palm beach and Fort Myers in Florida, Providence, San

Francisco and Colorado Springs. Interestingly, the largest msas are not all doing well here because

of their much higher construction costs.
    TC must reach an implausible -0.111 for the mean difference between costs and maximum

gains to become positive on average. In sum, under our preferred set of assumptions, the costs

of an extra kilometer of interstate exceeds its maximum benefits by a factor of more than two. It

is only when we double the elasticity of speed to highway provisions that we can recover those

costs. Hence, even though us interstates are increasingly busy and congested, an across-the-board

expansion would yield small welfare gains relative to the costs.

                                                41
   Clearly this conclusion does not mean that no new road should ever be built or that no road

should ever be enlarged. The removal of bottlenecks on busy roads, or other similar expansions,

may lead to sufficient time gains to justify the investment. While we may conjecture about whether

the positive external benefits of investments in new interstates are large enough to justify their

construction, savings of transportation costs alone do not.


7. Conclusion

This paper analyzes new data describing city level traffic in the continental us between 1983 and

2003. By exploiting the fact that our data describe urbanized and non-urbanized area interstates

along with urban roads, we not only confirm the ‘fundamental law of highway congestion’ sug-

gested by Downs (1962), but also provide evidence that this law extends beyond urban highways.

That is, our data suggests a ‘fundamental law of road congestion’ where the extension of most

major roads is met with a proportional increase in traffic. Not only do we provide direct evidence

for this law, but also show find evidence that three implications of this law; near flat demand curve

for vkt, convergence of traffic levels, and no effect of public transit on traffic levels.

   We also consider the sources of new traffic elicited by extensions to the interstate network. We

find that changes to individual driving behavior and increases in trucking are most important.

Migration is somewhat less important. Surprisingly, diversion of traffic from other road networks

does not appear to play a large role. Importantly, our data provide little evidence that extensions

of public transit will reduce traffic.

   High levels of induced demand do not necessarily imply that improvements to the highway

system are not in the public interest. However, our calculations suggest that an average extension

of the interstate network does not result in sufficient travel time improvements to justify its cost.

Two caveats apply here. First, our welfare calculation excludes some possible external benefits

unrelated to travel time savings. Second, certain specific improvements of the system, for example

inexpensive improvements to bottlenecks, may well be justified even if an across the board expan-

sions are not.

   A similar comment applies to public transit. The fact that increases in public transit do not

reduce traffic does not imply that such improvements are not in the public interest. While we are

not able to perform a welfare calculation to evaluate extensions to bus based public transit, we



                                                   42
suspect on the basis of earlier research (Kain, 1999, Duranton and Turner, 2008) that improvements

to bus-based public transit are often welfare improving.

   We make two final remarks in closing. First, throughout our analysis we find that our instru-

mental variables estimations show find a similar relationship between roads and traffic as does

ols. Positing the validity of our instruments, this suggest that the assignment of roads to msas is

unrelated to traffic (conditional on control variables). If true, this almost certainly results in lower

welfare than would assigning roads to places with higher traffic levels. Second, we note that this

research eliminates both capacity expansions and extensions to public transit as policies to combat

traffic congestion. On the other hand, our estimates of the demand for vkt indicate that vkt is

quite responsive to price. Together, these findings strengthen the case for congestion pricing as a

policy response to traffic congestion.
