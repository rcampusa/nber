                                           ABSTRACT

If experimental subjects arbitrage against market interest rates when making intertemporal
allocations of cash, the data will reveal nothing about subjects' discount rates, only uncovering
subjects' market interest rates. If they frame choices narrowly, market rates will not be salient and
the experiment will uncover subjects' utility discount rates. We test arbitrage directly by forcing
all transactions with subjects to be instant electronic bank transfers, thus making arbitrage easy
and salient. We also employ four decision frames to test alternative hypotheses. Our evidence
contradicts arbitrage, supports money as a valid reward, and suggests framing as a correlate with
present bias.

1        Introduction


It has long been recognized that if experimental subjects can and do engage in intertem-

poral arbitrage, then utility maximization will be represented as maximizing present value

of income.       Individual discount parameters play no part in this, thus arbitrage will frus-

trate attempts to use cash rewards to measure subjects' discount parameters (Fisher 1930,

Loewenstein 1987, Cubitt & Read 2007).

      While prior literature had been characterized by both signicant present bias (β of about

0.7   in models of quasi-hyperbolic discounting, as in Laibson, 1997) and extreme annual dis-

count rates (80% to 100% annually, Frederick et al. (2002)), new experimental measures

by Andersen, Harrison, Lau & Rutstrom (2008) and Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) nd lit-

                                                                                                                     1
tle present bias in many samples, and discounting near market interest rates.                                            Moreover,

when present bias is detected, it is often in samples for which subjects face binding credit

                                                                                          2
constraints, as in developing countries or among children.

      Although arbitrage was addressed early in this literature, (Coller & Williams 1999, Har-

rison et al. 2002, 2004), important recent ndings have sparked renewed interest in arbitrage

                                                    3
(Cohen et al. 2016, DellaVigna 2018).                   In particular, Augenblick, Niederle & Sprenger (2015)

showed that when Andreoni & Sprenger's Convex Time Budget (CTB) protocol is used to al-

locate cash there is little present bias, yet when the same subjects allocate eort, present bias

is signicant. Since allocating eort is thought to be more dicult to arbitrage, fears arose

that arbitrage over money rewards was stripping present bias from the data and invalidating

cash for measuring discounting.

      There are several counterpoints to this argument. First, Augenblick et al. (2015) mea-

sured both the        β    and   δ   of quasi-hyperbolic discounting (Strotz 1955, Laibson 1997).                               For

present bias,    β   is   0.89 for eort and 0.98 for cash, indirectly supporting arbitrage for cash but
not work. On the other hand, the estimated discount factor                                    δ   produces an annual discount

    1 Intertemporal utility      U (c0 , ..., cT ) = u(c0 ) + β
                                                                  PT
                                                                            δ t u(ct ),   is quasi-hyperbolic if   0 ≤ β ≤ 1,   and
                                                                      t=1
exponential if   β = 1.
    2 See, for example, Kuroishi & Sawada (2018), Sawada & Kuroishi (2015), Janssens et al. (2017), Clot
et al. (2017) and Lührmann et al. (2018). Sawada & Kuroishi (2015) nds that variables correlated with
liquidity have no signicant eect on present bias.
    3 Arbitrage refers to borrowing at the lower rate, and saving the higher rate when lab and market rates
dier.




                                                                  1
rate of about 5% for eort, a reasonable market rate, but 87% for money, an unreasonably

high market rate.

      Second, if subjects arbitrage in these studies, should we be surprised that they fail to

arbitrage in other similar circumstances (Harrison et al. 2004)? Yet, a large literature on

choice bracketing shows that in many situations individuals           narrowly bracket their decisions,
making choices in isolation rather than broadly considering the consequences of their choices

for later decisions (Read et al. 1999, Rabin & Weizsacker 2009). Early experiments uncover-

ing biases in discounting (Thaler 1981, Loewenstein & Thaler 1989), certain types of mental

accounting (Thaler 1985), and the endowment eect over goods easily repurchased outside

the lab (Kahneman et al. 1990), are failures of arbitrage attributed to narrow bracketing.

      Third, Balakrishnan et al. (2017) applied CTBs to a sample in Kenya, conducting all

payments electronically so that the today payment could be applied immediately. They

found a   β   parameter similar to that in the eort allocation in Augenblick et al. (2015), while

when the payment was made after a four hour delay                β   returned to 1, as in Andreoni &

                                                                                                       4
Sprenger (2012), suggesting that four hours could be enough delay to avoid present bias.

      Fourth, economic lab experiments testing equilibria in nancial markets where arbitrage

is given its best chance have instead found signicant deviations of assets prices from funda-

mentals (Lei et al. 2001), contradicting (within-lab) arbitrage. Researchers in the eld also

nd little evidence that individuals smooth consumption over small gains (for a summary,

see    Halevy, 2014).

      Fifth, both psychologists and economists have found that individual discounting can

vary across commodities (Chapman 1996, Tsukayama & Duckworth 2010, Reuben et al.

2010, Ubfal 2016).      This is unsurprising if we think of present-bias as self-control; not all

items are equally tempting. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006), for instance, nd that although

discounting parameters estimated using rice, ice cream, and money were correlated, only the

estimates from money predict take-up of nancial commitment. Others also nd discounting

estimated from money correlates with other intertemporal tradeos (Chabris et al. 2008,

Meier & Sprenger 2010, 2015) including those using CTB elicitations (Sawada & Kuroishi

   4 This contrasts with the fMRI study of McClure et al. (2007) that found immediacy aects for gift
cards delivered one hour after the decision, and which produced primary rewards no sooner than a day later,
but may speak to their conjectures on the importance on framing with monetary rewards (p.5803).




                                                    2
2015, Andreoni et al. 2016, Aycinena et al. 2018, to name a few).

   Sixth, a variety of physiological evidence corroborates the idea that the receipt of a cash

reward presents the same as a primary reward. CTB results using cash correlate with pupil

dilation (Lempert et al. 2015, 2016) and with 2D-4D digit ratios, an indicator of pre-natal

testosterone exposure (Aycinena & Rentschler 2017). Löckenho, O'Donoghue & Dunning

(2011) found that discounting and present bias are signicantly correlated with psychological

measures of anticipated emotional arousal at receiving monetary payments over time.

   Finally, fMRI studies of temporal discounting (McClure et al. 2004, 2007, Kable & Glim-

cher 2007) using monetary incentives have not been hamstrung by arbitrage, and instead

identify signicant present bias. Also, in a pivotal study, Levy and Glimcher (2011, p. 14693)

note an obvious truth from both the economics and psychology of exchange: The ability

of human subjects to choose between disparate kinds of rewards suggests that the neural

circuits for valuing dierent reward types must converge. Their research looked at choices

involving money, food, and water, and found support for the hypothesis that, Partially dis-

tinct valuation networks for dierent reward types converge on a unied valuation network,

which enables a direct comparison between dierent reward types and hence guides valua-

tion and choice. That is, the brain has a mechanism by which money achieves value by its

potential to be exchanged for a primary reward, in something of a neural re-imagining of the

                                     5
Kiyotaki-Wright (1993) model.            In a meta-study of 87 publications, Sescousse et al. (2013)

nd substantial overlap in brain areas involved in primary and monetary rewards. In a large

meta-analysis, Bartra, McGuire & Kable (2013) (see also Levy & Glimcher, 2012) conclude

that the evidence aligns with an emerging consensus of a unitary system (p. 424) of neural

value of primary and monetary rewards.

   We report on a CTB laboratory study using the protocol of Andreoni et al. (2015), but

adjusted to make arbitrage as easy as possible.             We experimentally manipulate subject's

initial liquidity and whether subjects allocate receipts or payments between sooner or later

dates, while equalizing the potential future value of earnings. We nd only a modest fraction

of subjects are arbitrageurs, and that money receipts and payments have distinct signatures

   5 See also Knutson et al. (2001), Ballard & Knutson (2009), Chib et al. (2009), and McNamee et al. (2013).
See Yoo & Hayden (2018) for a dierent interpretation.




                                                     3
of value as commodities. Moreover, we nd no signicant present bias in the receipt frame

most closely resembling Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) but nd signicant present bias in the

payment frame that is reective of the eort allocation in Augenblick et al. (2015).                   This

framing eect is, like many framing eects, dicult for typical economic models to address.

This makes the nding both worth replication and further investigation. The explanation

may lie in understanding more precisely how brains assign values to options, and the role

                                                       6
positive and negative frames may play in this.

    These results, in combination with those from neuroscience, should soothe worries that

money is not a reliable reward when studying intertemporal choice.                  Moreover, they raise

many constructive new hypotheses for how both money and commodities generate value

in experimental environments, and how evidence on discounting could be used to improve

models of intertemporal choice.




2      Arbitrage versus Narrow Bracketing


To prefer arbitrage, subjects must be forward looking; they broadly bracket their allocations

of money to maximize the present value of their incomes. To perform arbitrage, subjects must

have access to capital markets and sucient liquidity to oset any experimental payments.

    To expect subjects to reveal discount parameters using money rewards would require

decision makers to narrowly bracket choices as they would with a desirable primary reward

(Read et al. 1999, Rabin & Weizsacker 2009). It is important to note that making decisions

that are not fully forward looking is not the same as consuming the allocations immediately,

only that they consume a ow of utility immediately.                Narrow bracketing is applied fre-

quently in behavioral economics as a foundation for loss aversion, endowment eects, mental

accounting, present-bias, and more.

    Alternatively, one could take the observation of dierent discount parameters for eort

and money at face value; perhaps the parameters are measured accurately for both money

and eort, but individuals simply have dierent discount factors for each. Importantly, such

    6 In this vein, the work of Fisher & Rangel (2014) comes to mind. If a negative frame causes attention
to be xated on certain choices longer, this could result in the frame aecting values and, in turn, revealed
discounting rates.




                                                     4
good-specic discounting can easily lead to time-inconsistent preferences.

    To see this, imagine utility




                            U (x, y) = u(x0 ) + v(y0 ) + δx u(x1 ) + δy v(y1 )


with good-specic discounting      0 < δy < δx < 1.     Let   β = δy /δx < 1,    and rewrite utility as




                          U (x, y) = u(x0 ) + v(y0 ) + δx u(x1 ) + βδx v(y1 ),


which naturally shows present bias for the good one is relatively more impatient for. We

need only appeal to Jackson & Yariv (2014) to demonstrate that good-specic discount rates

must     result in time-inconsistent preferences.

    Additionally, we show in Appendix Section A.1 that for commodity choices to present

accurate measures of discounting requires the additional assumption that the commodity in

use has no complements or substitutes with other items in the budget.

    As has been the way of economics, hewing as closely as possible to Samuelson's (1937)

statement of time-separable discounted utility, allowing commodity specic discount rates

would appear to create an implausible degree of separability across commodities, and a

tangled web of shifting time inconsistent preferences. So, while the suggestion of commodity-

specic discounting has some appeal, it is perhaps a quick x to a larger and more challenging

issue.




3        Experimental Design


Sprenger (2015), Cohen et al. (2016) and DellaVigna (2018) provide recent overviews of

the diculties and advances in measuring discount rates. In light of the focus on arbitrage

precipitated by the study of Augenblick et al. (2015) comparing time and eort allocations in

the Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) Convex Time Budget framework, we used the CTB design

as modied by Andreoni et al. (2015).

    Subjects were shown a series of intertemporal budgets. For each budget, they chose from

a set of eight options to allocate money over time at a xed interest rate.                 Subjects rst



                                                    5
encountered eight budgets, each budget oering eight allocations between the day of the

study and four weeks in the future. Next were eight budgets oering allocations between

four weeks and eight weeks in the future.

     Within each eight-budget decision sheet, subjects started by allocating $21 at a 0% rate.

The rate increased as subjects worked through the budgets.         The rates diered slightly

between the rst (0-4 week) and second (4-8 week) allocations so that subjects weren't

strongly primed by their rst decisions. Interest rates ranged from 0% to 28.5%. Participants

did not encounter the interest rates directly, but instead saw eight evenly-spaced options of

allocations at the earlier date and the later date. The maximum sooner allocation was always

the left-most option and the maximum later allocation was always the right-most option.

The maximum later receipt/payment was always $21. We present details on each budget in

Appendix Table A1. The subjects' instructions and decision sheets are in Appendix Section

B.




3.1 Experimental Conditions
Our   2×2    treatment randomization occurred between-subjects.     In addition to allocating

either receipts or payments across sooner and later dates, all subjects also got an initial

payment on the date of the study and nal payments on the day following their last chosen

transaction. Initial payments, which could be negative, manipulated whether subjects initial

liquidity is eased during the course of the study, or tightened.    Final payments equalized

maximum potential future value of earnings at $23. All subjects got early and later payments

to keep the total number of payments constant across subjects.

     Credit-Receive (CR) subjects participated in a standard implementation of the CTB

choosing an allocations of electronic transfers into their bank accounts that could be as high

as $21, along with $1 initial and nal transfers (to equalize the number of transactions across

conditions).   Credit-Pay (CP) subjects received an initial transfer of $22 that could cover

any of the subsequent repayment plans they could chose to implement. They received a nal

transfer of $22. Debit-Receive (DR) subjects had to make an initial payment of $22 to the

EconLab before choosing a schedule for the EconLab to pay them back, thus had to remove

$22 from their personal funds. They received a nal transfer of $24. Lastly, Debit-Pay (DP)


                                               6
subjects received an initial payment of $1 from the EconLab (again, to equalize the number

of transactions) before choosing from a schedule of payments to the EconLab, which could

be as high as $21. They received a nal transfer of $43. Appendix Table A2 shows the design

of each cell in our study and the associated transfers.




3.2 Procedures
Our sample consists of 128 UC San Diego undergraduate volunteers, spread among 10 ex-

perimental sessions. We recruited only students with accounts at Chase Bank who would

be willing to use Chase QuickPay for experimental transactions. Chase maintains a branch

UC San Diego student center, and Quickpay is a free service for Chase clients who also have

savings and checking accounts and a debit card. Prior to indicating their informed consent,

and regardless of subsequent treatment randomization, participants were told that there was

a possibility they would have use their own funds in the short run, although they were guar-

anteed earnings commensurate with their time and eort in the long run.      After consent,

everyone in the session was randomized into the same treatment. Following the session, one

budget was randomly selected as the budget-that-counts for payments. This was common

to the session.

   Chase QuickPay oered a variety of advantages for this study. First, participants were

informed that while there would be a stream of payments between them and the EconLab

over the following eight weeks, they would not have to come back to the lab at any point.

Second, QuickPay allowed scheduling of future payments. Following the participants' choices,

but during the same session, we scheduled and veried all payments electronically, and any

payments due on the date of the study were completed before subjects left the lab. Third,

all subjects were required to schedule the same number of transfers, regardless of their

decisions. We enforce this by making $0.01 transfers on the dates where subjects allocate

zero dollars. No payments were made in cash. Fourth, choosing subjects with accounts at

a nancial institution with a physical presence on campus was the most natural way gain

subjects' condence in the transfers, and thus facilitate arbitrage.   In a post-experiment

questionnaire, 127 of 128 participants conrmed this condence.

   Three participants did not complete their transactions as scheduled and were removed


                                              7
from the sample. Seven did not respond to all 16 questions in their primary choice set and

                                                                                      7
were also omitted, leaving 118 subjects in our estimation sample.




4       Results


To compare choices across Pay and Receive conditions, and across budgets within each

condition, we create a variable equal to the fraction of potential or residual income that

is allocated to the sooner period.           We call this variable        Adjusted Sooner Income,       or   ASI .
For example, if a subject in a Receive condition chooses $7 today and $14 in four weeks,

from a budget that oered a maximum of $21 today, her                      ASI   is   7/21 = 0.33.   If a subject

in a Pay condition chooses $14 today and $7 in four weeks, from a budget that allowed a

maximum payment of $21 today, her              ASI    is also   0.33,   because the unpaid balance today is

$7. If the four-week interest rate increases to 5%, the maximum sooner receipt or payment

decreases to $20. Choosing to receive $7 or pay $13 today would thus correspond to an                         ASI
of   7/20 = 0.35.
     A comparison of average choices across budgets is presented in Figure 1. For each choice

we plot the budget line that subjects faced and the average choice from it, by condition.

Several observations are apparent in this gure: 1) Choices vary by Receive/Pay framing.

2) Average choices are not near corner solutions except for at high interest rates.                          While

the average interior choice masks many individual corner choices, it is notably inconsistent

with a unique market interest rate that our relatively homogeneous sample can access. 3)

When the interest rate is 0%, or close to 0%, subjects do not fully front-load income. This is

especially true in the Pay condition, and is inconsistent with both the arbitrage hypothesis

and a model in which the marginal utility of income is non-decreasing.




4.1 Treatment Eects on ASI
Arbitraging subjects should not be aected by Receive-Pay variation in framing. We test

for dierences across conditions in two ways. First, we ask whether the distribution of                       ASI
     7 In addition to the results reported here, our data collection also consisted of a second set of choices for
each subject that switched the subjects' pay/receive condition to the opposite. Since we found strong order
eects (which are also inconsistent with arbitrage, and in interesting and complex ways) we opted, due to
constraints on words, to set this data aside for later analysis.

is identical under Receive and Pay.                    We nd     ASI       is clearly lower in the Pay conditions.

A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the equality of Pay and Receive:                                D = 1.00, p < 0.01
                                            10
(pooled across Credit and Debit).                The Pay-Receive dierence is also signicant within each

of the Credit and Debit conditions (D                 = 0.51, p < 0.01 and D = 0.54, p < 0.01, respectively).
We cannot detect a dierence between the Credit and Debit conditions:                              D = 0.09, p = 0.95
pooled,   D = 0.14,    p =   0.94      within Receive and             D = 0.13, p = 0.95      within Pay.

   Second, we regress        ASI       on Pay and Debit indicator variables, and their interactions.

  8 Appendix Figure A1 shows the empirical CDFs of ASI for each condition.
  9 Related results on gain-loss framing, see Loewenstein (1988).
 10 We use subject-mean    ASI    in our distributional tests, so           N = 118.



                                                                10
Because   ASI      is constructed to lie between zero and one, we use a Tobit model to estimate

the demand for        ASI .11     Additionally, we consider whether the likelihood of censoring at

either   ASI = 1     or   0   depends on experimental condition. Because treatment is randomized

at the session level, clustering standard errors at the session level is appropriate here. With

only ten sessions, however, this clustering can be unreliable (Donald & Lang 2007).                           We

therefore adopt the wild-bootstrap cluster suggested by Cameron et al. (2008) for the OLS

models. For the Tobit model, we use the score-bootstrap generalization of the wild bootstrap

from Kline & Santos (2012).

   Results are in Table 1.             In column (1), we present estimates from a Tobit model with

ASI   as the dependent variable. Latent demand for                ASI     lower by 43 percentage points in

Credit-Pay than in Credit-Receive, and lower by 63 percentage points in Debit-Pay than

in Debit-Receive, although the estimates are imprecise according to the score-bootstrapped

standard errors (p        = 0.10,      and   p = 0.06,   respectively).    The OLS model in column (2)

shows a smaller eect of the Pay condition on demanda reduction of 16 percentage points

within Credit, and a reduction of 21 percentage points within Debitbut it is more precisely

estimated with the wild bootstrap technique (p                 = 0.01,    and   p < 0.01,    respectively).   In

column (3), we nd that the likelihood that                   ASI = 1     is 14 percentage points lower in

Credit-Pay relative to Credit-Receive and 25 percentage points lower in Debit-Pay relative

to Debit-Receive (p           = 0.03   in both cases.). In column (4), we nd a 16 percentage point

increase in the likelihood of          ASI = 0    in Debit-Pay relative to Debit Receive (p           = 0.06),
without a corresponding large or signicant eect of the Pay condition with Credit.                       The

only signicant eect of the Debit treatment we can detect is that the likelihood of                 ASI = 1
is seven percentage points lower in Debit-Pay than Credit-Pay (p                  < 0.01).

Result 1:      Average choices were aected by choice framing. Subjects generally demand
signicantly more sooner income, ASI , in the Receive frame than the Pay frame. This is
inconsistent with arbitrage.
 11 Latent   ASI   could be below zero or greater than one if a subject wants to borrow in one period.

4.2 Corner Solutions
The strictest test for arbitrage is that subjects should behave as if they have linear indierence

curves with a slope determined by the market interest rate.                         That is, we should observe

exclusively corner solutions. While 70% of observed choices are at corners, this is signicantly

                             12
dierent from 100%.               At the subject level, 28% of participants make zero interior choices,

                                                                      13
which again deviates signicantly from full arbitrage.

     What if we limit ourselves to the lowest and highest interest rates oered, where corners

are most clearly optimal for arbitrageurs? All of our subjects are known to have interest-

bearing savings accounts, so at            r = 0, ASI = 1         is an arbitrageur's optimum. Nonetheless,

                                                                                                       14
only 43% of       r = 0     choices are at    ASI = 1,       a signicant dierence from 100%.              Interior

                                                                                                       15
choices are taken by 48% of subjects at              r = 0,   a signicant violation of arbitrage.

     On the other side of the same coin, arbitrage predicts that once the experimental rate

exceeds the market rate, subjects should switch to                    ASI = 0.        The highest 4-week rates

oered were 29% and 25%, which translate to 2510% and 1733% annualized.                                Do choices

collapse on      ASI = 0      at this price? A signicant fraction do not. Interior choices are made

                                                        16
on 18% of choices at these very high rates.                  Under 80% of choices are at       ASI = 0.17

Result 2:       While many choices are corner solutions, we reject that all choice are corner solu-
tions. This is true even at extreme interests rates where arbitrage should be most compelling.
Interior choices are a meaningful aspect of the data, which is inconsistent with arbitrage.
     Figure 2 presents the frequency of corner choices for all of the experimental interest

         18
rates.        Here we see a clear distinction between Receive and Pay conditions, particularly

at   r = 0.    Comparing the pooled Pay conditions to the pooled Receive conditions, we see a

curious inconsistency across the Pay and Receive subjects. At                     r = 0, 75% of Receive subjects
  12 p < 0.01,   H0   : all choices at corners, s.e.'s clustered by subject.
  13 p < 0.01,   H0   : all subjects make no interior choices. For details, see   Appendix Table A3.
  14 p < 0.01,   H0   : ASI = 1 for all choices, s.e.'s clustered by subject.
  15 p < 0.01,   H0   : zero interior choices, s.e.'s clustered by subject.
  16 p < 0.01,   H0   : zero interior choices, s.e.'s clustered by subject.
  17 p < 0.01,   H0   : ASI = 0 for all choices, s.e.'s clustered by subject.
  18 Appendix Figure A2 shows the pooled fraction of corner or corner-adjacent choices (choices one option
removed from the corner) along with the upper bound of the 99% condence interval associated with this
frequency. Even by this very conservative measure, none of the condence intervals include one.

are willing to receive all of the money for free, while only 14% of pay subjects do the same.

We also anticipated that the Debit condition would encourage arbitrage by forcing subjects

to confront their actual capital markets. We see no signicant evidence of this eect.


Result 2.1                     The degree to which subjects select corner solutions depends on framing. At an
interest rate of 0%, arbitrage requires ASI = 1 for all subjects. In the Pay frames, over
  19 The dierence is statistically signicant (p            < 0.01).     The hypothesis test is from probit regressions of
ASI = 1 on condition, s.e.'s clustered by subject.               See Appendix Figure A3 for visualization of this substantial
dierence.




                                                                    13
70% of choices involve allocating something to both periods. This portion is only 20% in the
Receive frames. The Debit conditions, which were designed to be as favorable to arbitrage as
possible, however, produces no additional corner solutions over the Credit conditions.


4.3 Present Bias
We use      t=0   to refer to a choice made for the 0-4 week period, and            t=4       for the 4-8 week

period. Present bias would be seen if the demand for             ASI   is higher when     t = 0.   Arbitrage,

by contrast, implies that demands for ASI should be independent of both                   t   and condition.

      Figure 3 presents demand for    ASI   by   t within each condition.    Panel A, the Credit-Recieve

condition, corresponds to a standard CTB application. There is little dierence between the

two time periods, consistent with both arbitrage and the ndings of several recent studies

using CTB elicitations. Panels B, C and D graph demand in the other three conditions. All

three show patterns suggesting present bias, especially Panel B, the Credit-Pay condition,

and primarily at higher interest rates.

      Table 2 lists coecients of regressions testing for present bias. The dependent variable

1(t = 0)    equals one if the sooner allocation is the hour of the study, and zero if the sooner

allocation is in four weeks. Given the nonlinear relation between             ASI   and   r    in Figure 3, we

use the log of    1+r   as our price variable. As is evident in three of the four conditions, the

interaction between     1(t = 0)   and   ln(1 + r)   is predicted to be positive. We use both a Tobit

regression to test for an overall impact of       1(t = 0),   and Probit regressions to test for specic

                                                                             20
impacts on the likelihood of choosing all income sooner or later.                 Below the estimates, we

include the impact of    1(t = 0) when r = 0.10, to give an idea of the overall amount of present
bias that manifests at a rate near the average of rates we oered.

      In column (1) we nd a statistically signicant positive coecient on the interaction

term, consistent with overall present bias at prices away from             r = 0.   At   r = 0.10,    demand

for   ASI   is 16 percentage points higher ($3.11 out of $19.09) when             t = 0 (p = 0.04).      This

eect is largest in Credit-Pay at 41 percentage points higher ($7.77 out of $19.09,                 p = 0.11).
      The Probit estimates in columns (2) and (3) take a dierent view of present bias by

  20 With the continuous explanatory variable of price, a Probit model can capture non-linearity that a linear
model cannot.

Result 3     Inconsistent with arbitrage, there is evidence of signicant present bias in our data.
While the eect is evident in our pooled data, the magnitude of present bias is the largest
and most signicant for the Credit-Pay condition, and the nearest to zero present bias in the
Credit-Receive condition.


5       Arbitrageurs?


While we reject arbitrage in general, it is important to ask whether individual subjects make

choices consistent with arbitrage.         These subjects have at most one switch point, moving

from all-sooner to all-later income as the interest rate rises. They have at most one interior

choice, and it will lie on the budget separating the two sets of corner choices.

     Across all treatments, 33% of subjects meet this denition of an arbitrageur. However,

there is considerable heterogeneity across treatments. Credit-Receivethe standard imple-

mentation of CTBsgarners the most arbitrageurs (46%). Next is Debit-Receive (32%), fol-

lowed Credit-Pay (31%) and nally Debit-Pay (24%). Notice that Credit-Receive is framed

like a standard CTB and has nearly twice as many arbitrageurs as the Debit-Pay treatment,

which has a negative frame in common with eort supply.

     The strong treatment eect on arbitrageurs is further evidence against arbitrage in gen-

eral, and raises questions of whether arbitrage is even an objective of those we have just

labeled arbitrageurs. It indicates that no more than a quarter of all people would be arbi-

                                      21
trageurs regardless of the frame.




6       Conclusion


There is a rich and evolving literature on estimating structural preference parameters for

temporal discounting. Researchers have long relied on monetary rewards for these estimates.

    21 For example, Kuhn et al. (2017) nd that behaivor consistent with arbitrage responds to hunger and
satiation.




                                                    17
From the beginning, however, researchers have noted the concern that arbitrage of cash

rewards removes from the data of any signs of hyperbolic discounting that exists over primary

rewards. Since arbitrage requires broad bracketing of decisions and present bias is rooted in

narrow bracketing, this argument suggests an interesting model in which subjects integrate

monetary rewards into long run nancial plans, yet when faced with opportunities to spend

that money submit to narrow bracketing and display present bias.

   To explore the hypothesis that money may not be a reliable reward when studying in-

tertemporal choice, we constructed a direct laboratory test of arbitrage. To give arbitrage

its best chance, we recruited subjects with sucient liquidity to arbitrage against the exper-

imental payments. Next, all payments between the EconLab and our subjects were made

with instant and direct bank transfers. This mechanically made arbitrage both obvious and

easy. It also made today payments immediate. We used our         2×2   design to either add

to liquidity by crediting their bank accounts (Credit Condition), or force subjects to pay us

up-front and thus restrict their liquidity (Debit condition). Finally, we framed the actions of

the subjects as choosing either when to receive cash payments from us (Receive condition) or

when to pay cash to us (Pay condition). All four cells of the study oered subjects identical

maximum potential future value, and identical transaction costs, and thus arbitrage would

make the same predictions for each cell.

   Our direct tests strongly contradict the arbitrage hypothesis.     First, the choice frame

matters. Subjects in the Receive conditions demanded signicantly more sooner income than

those in the Pay frames. Second, not all choices were made at corner solutions as arbitrage

requires, especially at low interest rates.   Finally, we nd no evidence of present bias in

the Credit-Receive condition, the condition corresponding to standard implementations of

the CTB. By contrast, we nd sizable present bias in the Credit-Pay condition, which has

important framing elements in common with the eort-allocation task of Augenblick et al.

(2015).

   The Debit conditionswhich were designed to favor arbitrageshowed no dierential

eects from the Credit conditions.

   Neuroeconomists have argued that, much like how monetary theory accounts for money,

for the brain to make choices across disparate baskets of goods, it must have a meansa

currencyfor comparing values.       Levy & Glimcher (2012) measured subjects' rates of ex-

change between money and various food items outside of the fMRI scanner, then used this

exchange rate to predict the neural exchange rate while in the scanner.                 They concluded

that, Both reward types did predict the exchange rate between money and food across our

                                                                                                  22
subject pool, supporting the notion of direct value for economic (and neural) currency.               A

major meta-analysis by Bartra et al. (2013), nds a dierent route to the same conclusion.

They state, A principal insight from research on classical conditioning is that a conditioned

stimulus can come to inuence behavior in the same manner as the primary rewards with

which it is associated. Money is presumably an especially well learned secondary incentive.

   What does our study say about the within-subject dierences found discounting toward

eort versus money? In light of our ndings rejecting arbitrage and the neurological evidence

that money payments are likely part of a unitary reward system, it would seem that rejecting

either one of the measurements on the basis of the reward media could not be supported.

Instead we perhaps need to ask what it would imply for economic theory to accept both

measurements as reecting something true about preferences. To do so would be to inte-

grate dierent levels of impatience for dierent commodities into a single utility framework,

and perhaps even (as suggested by our ndings) dierent levels of impatience for the same

commodity depending on how the choice is framed.              Until this is accomplished, however,

an obvious implication of the work presented here is that using discount parameters from

one good to predict choices on another could be misleading. Best practices would appear to

indicate that if the researcher is interested in policies for eort, then discounting should be

measured with eort. When the application is to money, the best media to use to design

policies regarding personal nance is most likely money.

   Given the ubiquity of Samuelson's (1937) model, the well learned reex for assuming time

separability and constant discounting may have led economists to force the interpretation

of most data to t this approach. Is it only the structure given by Samuelson (1937) that

makes us surprised to see dierent commodities ruled by dierent discount rates?                 Inter-

estingly, Samuelson (1937) himself warned of this.          He says (page 139) that the model of

discounted utility has serious limitations...which almost certainly vitiate it even from a the-

oretical point of view. The questionable assumption he points to rst and most strongly is

time-separable preferences. Abstracting away from time-separability and constant discount-

ing, we can alternatively interpret the data as saying the marginal rates of intertemporal

substitution within a good over time, or between goods over time, can be dierent. More-

over, they may depend on past, current, or perhaps future levels of consumption, accounting

for endogenous tastes.    The question for research will then be can we fashion a tractable

and exible theory that will allow us to analyze intertemporal choice from a productive and

realistic perspective.   Given our ever-sharper tools of experimental economics, we may be

able to go beyond Samuelson's self-described arbitrary assumptions and, as he suggested,

let observable facts shape a more full model of preferences.

A.1 On Measuring Discounting with Consumption
As stated in the text, it is also necessary that there be no other items in a subject's current

or future consumption that is a complement or substitute for the consumption being used

as a reward in the lab. This point is most easily conveyed with a number of examples.


Example 1.      Substitutes.         A subject spends eort       e   each period and enjoys leisure,       `   such

that   ` = 1 − e.    For simplicity assume no discounting and no interest. She lives for three

periods with utility     U = u(1 − e1 ) + u(1 − e2 ) + u(1 − e3 ),          where   u(·) is strictly concave.   She

has 1 units of work to complete, thus faces the budget constraint                      e1 + e2 + e3 = 1.     Given

this she will choose     ek = 1/3      for all   k.   Suppose she becomes a subject in an experiment and

is required to exert eort       x1 + x2 = 1.         If the experiment is at the start of day 1 and she has

yet to consume any work or leisure, she will again allocate her total eort (now increased by

1 unit) equally across the three periods:              e1 + x1 = e2 + x2 = e3 = 2/3.        This has a continuum

of solutions for   x1   and   x2 ,   and since we do not observe       ek   for any   k,   we learn nothing about

preferences from this exercise.


    Here the substitutablity between eort in the experiment or outside the experiment leads

to a fully uninformative experiment.


Example 2.         Future Flexibility.       Continue with the prior example, but now suppose the

experiment comes in the middle of the day and the subject has already spent                          e1 = 1/3 units
working. Now to smooth her work equally she must choose                       x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3, e2 = 0        and

e3 = 2/3.   Since any subject will be more constrained today when the task was unanticipated

than in the future when the eort is anticipated, we naturally expect more cases of eort

being higher later.       If we neglect this, then observing only               x1    and    x2   would incorrectly

lead us to conclude the subject is present-biased when in fact she is choosing leisure in the




                                                            27
experiment to smooth her consumption. This example mirrors the conclusions of Carvalho

et al. (2016).


       This example shows problems with eort provision when it interacts with on some ow

of consumption already experienced today, and the relatively greater exibility one has later

to absorb the anticipated demands for eort (or supply of food rewards) in the future than

in the current period.


Example 3         Complements.        Suppose a subject consumes goods                           a   and   b   all of which are

fully perishable. The subject's utility is               U = min{a1 , b1 } + δ min{a2 , b2 },               where        0 ≤ δ ≤ 1.
Our subject has already planned the endowments in periods 1 and 2 of                                       w1 = (3a1 , b1 )      and

w2 = (a2 , 3b2 ).   The experimenter gives the subject a choice between one unit of                                     a1   and two

a2 .   The subject will strictly prefer two              a2 ,   leading the experimenter to conclude                         δ > 1/2.
Next, the experimenter oers one               b1   or two      b2 .   Now the subject prefers one              b1 ,    leading the

experimenter to infer        δ < 1/2.      Thus, each good leads to mutually exclusive conclusions.

       Now introduce a new commodity                c   which can be converted to either                   a   or   b   1-to-1, and,

moreover     c   is storable (i.e.    c    is money).           Suppose, however, that the subject treats                        c   as

perishable as well, that is, she narrow brackets her decision.                               The experimenter oers a

choice between 1 unit of         c1   or   k   units of        c2 .    For any   k < 1/δ         the subject will prefer             c1
while for any     k > 1/δ    the subject strictly prefer the               k   units of   c2 .   This perfectly reveals the

subject's   δ.

       Example 3 shows how money can be a superior way to elicit preferences if the subject

narrow brackets consumption. The reason is that, other than discounting, money will have a

relatively constant value across periods that will not be changed much by prior spending of

money or recent consumption of other goods. You can notice that if we brought in a capital

market through broadly bracketing the choice, Example 3 would end with the experimenter

nding the switch point        k = 1 + r,       where      r    is the relevant market rate faced by the subject

rather than      k = 1/δ .

date,   xt+k   to represent their allocation to the later date, and   r   to represent the four-week interest rate.

Welcome!

Thank you for participating in today’s study.

Today’s study will involve payments between you and the UCSD Econlab that will take
place over the next 8 weeks. All the decisions about timing and amounts of these payments
will be made today, in the EconLab, and you will not need to return to the Econlab, as all
payments will be made electronically. The whole process will take about an hour. By the end
of the 8 weeks, you can expect to have total earning of at least $15 and at most $25.


Eligibility for this study

To participate in this study you will need to understand and agree to several things. Please
read this section very carefully. If you feel that you do not meet all of the criteria below,
please let us know and we will excuse you from the study.

To take part in this study the following must be true for you:

   •   You must have an online Chase bank account with a minimum of $22 in your account.

   •   You must be enrolled in Chase QuickPay and willing to log in to your online banking
       during the study.

   •   While you will surely earn money in this study, achieving you final earnings will
       sometime involve you making payments to the EconLab as well as you receiving
       money from the EconLab.

   •   You must be willing to receive your payment from the EconLab and to the EconLab
       via Chase QuickPay.

   •   You must be willing to provide your name and e-mail address, as required by Chase
       QuickPay. This information will only be seen by Professor Andreoni and his
       assistants when using QuickPay. After the final payment has been sent, this
       information will be destroyed. Your identity will not be part of any subsequent data
       analysis. No personal bank data will be collected during the experiment.

   •   Once you decide to participate, you must faithfully carry out all payments.

If you do not agree or do not meet all of these criteria please inform us now.

Thank you!

Earning money


In today’s study, you will encounter 4 scenarios and make 8 choices in each scenario, for a
total of 32 choices. Each of the 32 choices will be over how to allocate money between two
points in time. One time is “earlier” and one time is “later”. Both the earlier and later times
may vary across different scenarios. While your final earnings from the experiment will be
between $15 and $25, however the dates that you will receive these earnings will depend on
the scenario. You could have your earnings as early as today before the end of the
experiment, as late as 8 weeks and a day from today, or a date in between. All the payments
will be done via Chase Quick Pay and will be scheduled by you today.

Once all 32 decisions have been made, we will randomly select 1 of the 4 scenarios and
then 1 of the 8 choices from that scenario as the decision-that-counts. All 8 choices in a
scenario will be on one sheet of paper: so one scenario corresponds to one decision sheet.
The randomly selected scenario and choice will determine the exact amount of your actual
earnings. Since all scenarios and choices are equally likely to be chosen, you should make
each choice in each scenario as if it will be the decision-that-counts.

Important: You will be given a total of 4 decision sheets, each with 8 decisions, making 32
decisions in total. At the top of each decision sheet you will be informed about the scenario
for the choices.

At the end of the session today, you will schedule the payments of the decision-that-counts
via Quick Pay, according to the days indicated by the decision-that-counts.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for you to receive your earnings from this study, you
must schedule the payments truthfully based on your choice on the decision-that-counts
and the selected scenario. We sincerely appreciate your cooperation.

On your table is a business card of Professor Andreoni with his contact information. Please
keep this in a safe place. If one of your payments is not received you should immediately
contact Professor Andreoni.

Please do not talk out loud during the rest of the study today. If you have any questions,
please raise your hand, and someone will come to speak with you in private.

The decisions you will make are best described by examples, so before we begin the study,
we are going to work through some examples of the choices and scenarios together.

When instructed to do so, please turn the page to begin the examples.
