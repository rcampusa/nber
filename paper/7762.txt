1.      INTRODUCTION


        It is now widely understood that through a combination of lower fertility rates and longer

life expectancies, most economies will ‚Äúage‚Äù in the 21st century. The old-age dependency ratio

(defined as the ratio of elderly persons to non-elderly adults) is forecast to increase by 75 percent

between 1990 and 2040 in the United States, by 116 percent in Germany, and by 133 percent in

Japan.1 The phenomenon, however, is confined neither to the West, nor to rich countries. For

example, the newly industrialized countries of Southeast Asia, which have relatively low initial

dependency ratios, face a 128 percent increase in their average level of dependency.

        The strain this transition will place on social security systems, and saving rates more

broadly, has been well documented (for example, Cutler, et al. [1990] or B√∂rsch-Supan [1992,

1996]). In these studies, the neoclassical growth model is used to illustrate the ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù

changes in saving and growth that policymakers should contemplate to address the demographic

transition.2

        However, demographic transition itself will likely alter public support for government

programs, and thus endogenously alter fiscal policy. It is surprising that the implications of an

aging population for publicly provided goods and services have received less attention.3 Recent

research has emphasized the important role of human capital in economic growth (see, e.g.,

Mankiw et al. [1992]), the accumulation of which depends in part on public spending and taxing

decisions.4 If the elderly do not support programs from which they do not directly benefit, it

raises the possibility that demographic transition may undermine the level of public spending for

a productivity-enhancing social infrastructure and, hence, harm long-run economic welfare.

        Our goal is to examine the link between aging populations, old-age preferences for public

programs, and economic performance. To focus squarely on the role of endogenous spending
and the impact of aging, we base our analysis on a standard overlapping-generations model of

economic growth. We use a simple median voter framework to represent the political process.

In this context, a slowdown in the population growth rate raises the average age of the population

and alters the level of public spending on education. The resultant change in the level of human

capital affects the level of per-capita income.

       The next section presents our modeling strategy and the derivation of individuals‚Äô policy

preferences. The third section describes the political process and the outcome of majority voting.

In the fourth section, we characterize the equilibrium and trace the evolution of the economy.

Next we investigate the effects of demographic transitions on steady states in the model. In the

sixth section, we simulate the steady-state effects; the seventh section presents simulations of the

transitional dynamics. The final section contains concluding comments and suggestions for

further research.


2.     MODELING STRATEGY AND POLICY PREFERENCES


       We base our analysis on a conventional overlapping-generations model (Diamond

[1965]) in which individuals live for two periods. Each period, a cohort of size N t is born,

where N t = (1 + Œ∑) N t ‚àí1 . The population at any point consists of the ‚Äúold‚Äù and the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and,

thus, is of size N t + N t ‚àí1 . Note that Œ∑ determines both the growth rate of the total population

                                               1
and the ratio of old to young, which equals        . Demographic transition is introduced as a
                                              1+ Œ∑

decrease in Œ∑ that raises the dependency ratio.

       We focus our discussion of fiscal policy on a single type of government spending

financed by a flat income tax on the labor income of the young and the capital income of the old.


                                                   2
To highlight the possibility for generational conflict, we posit that the public good enhances the

productivity of labor. There is no consumption demand for the public good per se; demand

derives solely from its effect on the income of the young. Moreover, there are no deliberate

transfers from the old to the young or vice versa. With these modeling choices, there is no gain

in utility for the currently old cohort from the provision of public services to the young and

generational conflict is maximized.5

       The conventional overlapping-generations framework provides a rather sterile theory of

public choice: the young will all want the same, positive level of the publicly provided good

while the old will want none. A median-voter representation of the political process leads to a

simple counting of generational size. With positive population growth, the young will always

outnumber the old, the young will always determine the political outcome, and (because the

young are identical), there will be a single level of human capital.

       To address these shortcomings, we posit a distribution of abilities within each

generation.6 The ability of individuals ranges from 0 to 1, and the density function of abilities

for each generation is denoted by f (a ) . By definition, the density function satisfies

1

‚à´ f (a)da = 1.
0
                 As described below, high-ability individuals benefit more (acquire more human


capital) from a given amount of government spending than do low-ability individuals. Thus, the

economy will display a distribution of human capital and income. For this reason, the

distribution of ability leads to a distribution of preferred spending levels.7

       Turning to specifics, each individual is assumed to have a lifetime utility function given

by:

                      Ô£Æ 1 Ô£π
        U = ln C jt + Ô£Ø         ln C jt +1 ,                                                     (1)
                      Ô£∞1 + Œ¥ Ô£∫Ô£ª




                                                   3
where C jt is consumption of a member of generation j when young, C jt +1 is consumption when

old, and Œ¥ is the pure rate of time preference. When young, the individual supplies one unit of

‚Äútime‚Äù to the economy. However, effective labor units are measured by the human capital of the

individual, ht (ai ), where ai denotes the ability level of individual i. 8 Labor income is thus

wt ht (ai ), where wt is the wage at time t. The individual pays taxes on labor income and capital

income at the rate œÑt . Given these arrangements, the young person of ability ai is faced with a

budget constraint of the form:

        C jt (ai ) + S jt (ai ) = Œ∏t wt ht (ai ),                                                  (2)

where Œ∏t = (1 ‚àí œÑt ) and S jt is first-period saving. Old-age consumption is financed by saving:

        C jt +1 (ai ) = (1 + rt +1Œ∏t +1 ) S jt (ai ),                                              (3)

where rt +1 is the return to capital in the economy. Human capital acquisition depends on the

interaction of each individual‚Äôs ability and expenditures by the government on a productive input

into the human capital accumulation process (hereafter ‚Äúeducation spending‚Äù). The production

function for human capital shows the dependence of human capital acquired on the interaction of

ability and educational spending:

        ht (ai ) = AH [ ai g t + 1] ,
                                       œà
                                                                                                   (4)

where ht (ai ) is the human capital acquired by a person of ability level ai when provided with gt

of education spending per young person.9 To rule out increasing returns in public service

individuals of the lowest ability (ai = 0) provide some productive labor to the economy and that

higher ability individuals provide an amount dependent on their own ability level and gt .

        The young maximize (1) subject to (2), (3), and (4). Taking gt as given, the first order

condition for the choice of C jt is:

                     Ô£Æ 1 Ô£π
        C jt (ai ) = Ô£Ø         S jt (ai ).                                                         (5)
                     Ô£∞1 + Œ¥ Ô£∫Ô£ª

Using equation (5) and the budget constraint, the optimal saving of a young person in generation

j is given by:

                     Ô£Æ 1 Ô£π
        S jt (ai ) = Ô£Ø          Œ∏t wt ht (ai ),                                                    (6)
                     Ô£∞ 2 + Œ¥ Ô£∫Ô£ª

which does not depend on fiscal policy in future periods.10 Corresponding to the saving function

are the consumption functions:

                     Ô£Æ 1+ Œ¥ Ô£π
        C jt (ai ) = Ô£Ø          Œ∏t wt ht (ai );                                                    (7)
                     Ô£∞ 2 + Œ¥ Ô£∫Ô£ª

                        Ô£Æ 1 Ô£π Ô£Æ Œ∏t wt ht (ai ) Ô£π
        C jt +1 (ai ) = Ô£Ø          Ô£Ø                Ô£∫.                                             (8)
                        Ô£∞ 2 + Œ¥ Ô£∫Ô£ª Ô£∞ 1 + rt +1Œ∏t +1 Ô£ª

        Thus far, fiscal policy has been taken as given. However, each member of the young

generation will have a preferred policy mix that balances the benefits of spending with the tax-

associated costs. To characterize this preferred policy, we substitute the consumption functions

(7) and (8) into the utility function (1), yielding the indirect utility function

                                  2+Œ¥              2+Œ¥
        Vt (ai ) = ln(1 + Œ¥) ‚àí         ln(2 + Œ¥) +      [ln Œ∏t + ln wt + ln ht (ai )]
                                  1+ Œ¥             1+ Œ¥
                                                                                                   (9)
                       1
                  ‚àí        ln (1 + rt +1Œ∏t +1 ) .
                      1+ Œ¥

We assume that each voter views himself as small relative to the economy, and thus takes

wt , rt +1 , and Œ∏t +1 as given. As a result, the preferred value of œÑt will maximize current after-tax




                                                           5
income, subject to the government budget constraint, œÑt yt = gt , where yt is income per young

person, which is also taken as given by an individual voter. This preferred tax rate is

                         ai œàyt ‚àí 1
        œÑ jt (ai ) =                 .                                                             (10)
                        (1 + œà)ai yt

Note that the preferred tax rate depends directly only upon the current level of aggregate income

per worker and the individual‚Äôs ability. 11 It is straightforward to verify that œÑ jt (ai ) is increasing

in ai . Also, higher-ability individuals will have higher individual incomes. In addition, higher-

ability individuals receive a disproportionately higher marginal value of additional spending.

Combining these two effects, (10) implies a positive income elasticity for the preferred tax rate.

        Decision making by the old is trivial. Since they receive no benefits but face taxes on

capital income from their first-period saving, every member of the old generation has the same

preferred tax rate of

        œÑ j ‚àí1,t = 0.                                                                              (11)


3.      THE POLITICAL PROCESS


        Following a long tradition dating to Black [1948], we adopt a median-voter approach to

public choice. The median-voter model is appropriate in the context of our model for several

reasons. First, the choice facing voters is over a single dimension and voters‚Äô preferences have a

single peak. Thus, it is possible to define a median voter. Second, in the context of the

overlapping generations model, our use of the median voter model effectively asserts only that

over relatively long periods the public sector is responsive to voter preferences. It need not rule

out short-run rigidities, bureaucratic agency problems, or monopoly power that are important

aspects of criticisms of the median-voter model.12




                                                    6
        The median voter is that whose preferred tax and spending policy would win a majority

of votes against any other feasible alternative. To win a majority, a proposed fiscal combination

must achieve votes equal to ( N t ‚àí1 + N t ) / 2. Because the preferred tax rate of the old is zero,

there will be N t ‚àí1 voters who will always prefer the smaller of two proposed tax rates. Among

the young, those with lesser ability prefer a lower tax rate than those with greater ability. Thus,

the median voter, denoted by her ability level am , is defined by

Given a value for am , the actual budget and spending policies of the economy may be calculated

using (10) and the government budget constraint. The tax and spending values that determine

consumption, saving, and human capital accumulation are those of the median voter.


4.      PRODUCTION, EQUILIBRIUM AND DYNAMICS


        Total output in the economy is governed by the production function

        Yt = AY K tŒ± H t1‚àíŒ± .                                                                      (13)

Human capital depends on education spending and the distribution of ability. The aggregate

supply of human capital is defined as

                   1
        H t = N t ‚à´ h(a ) f (a ) da.                                                               (14)

Using (4), human capital per young person is

                  1
        ht = AH ‚à´ [ ag t + 1] f (a)da.

where lower-case quantities are per young person, i.e., kt = K t / N t and ht = H t / N t . Given

levels of human capital, labor is supplied inelastically and the labor market clears when the wage

is equal to the marginal product of labor:

                                     Œ±

                        Ô£∞ ht Ô£ª

Similarly, equilibrium in the market for capital inputs occurs when the real rental price of capital

equals the marginal product of capital:

                           Œ±‚àí1
                 Ô£Æk Ô£π
        rt = Œ±AY Ô£Ø t Ô£∫           .                                                                (17)
                 Ô£∞ ht Ô£ª

Because of differences in human capital within a generation, supplies of capital (saving) differ

across individuals. Aggregating individual saving (6) using the human capital supply function

(15), saving per young person is:

                                         1

Capital market equilibrium requires:

As can be seen directly from equation (20), fiscal policy choices (Œ∏t , g t ) have an important

influence on the evolution of capital in the economy. Moreover, the evolution of the economy

itself affects the adopted tax policy, as equation (10) shows that the preferred tax rate of any

individual depends on income per person. These dynamics are potentially quite complicated, but

our choice of logarithmic preferences makes it possible to describe analytically the effects of


                                                          8
population aging on the steady state of the economy. Once we have examined these steady-state

effects, we use numerical simulations to gauge the sensitivity of our steady-state analysis to

different values for several key parameters. We also employ numerical simulations to trace out

the transition path between steady states that results from a rise in the dependency ratio.


5.      STEADY STATE IMPLICATIONS OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION


        As in the conventional overlapping generations model, the steady state is characterized

by kt +1 = kt . It is straightforward to verify that this equality simultaneously implies constant

values for human capital per worker, income per worker, education spending per young person,

preferred tax rate of the median voter, and ability of the median voter. The steady state will be

disrupted by a demographic transition, i.e., by a decrease in Œ∑ . To see how a decrease in Œ∑

alters the steady state, we begin by differentiating (12) to show that the ability of the median

voter will fall:

         d am 1     1      1
             =                   > 0.                                                            (21)
          d Œ∑ 2 (1 + Œ∑) F ‚Ä≤(am )
                       2




The location of the median voter in the ability distribution changes because when Œ∑ decreases

the number of old people relative to the number of young people rises. With relatively more old

voters, a majority can be formed with fewer young voters. The median voter becomes a person

with a lower ability. Note that as a consequence, the median voter‚Äôs preferred tax rate will

immediately be lower, even at the income level of the initial steady state.

        7RSXUVXHIXUWKHUDQDO\WLFVROXWLRQVIRUWKHHIIHFWRIDGHFUHDVHLQ RQWKHVWHDG\VWDWHRI

the economy, we are forced to choose a specific distribution for ability. Thus, we assume that

ability among the young follows a uniform distribution. While the uniform distribution is

special, the key insights of the model do not depend on it. As we have just shown, a decrease in



                                                   9
the population growth rate creates a median voter with a lower ability. Therefore, regardless of

the ability distribution, the tax rate chosen (at any given average income level) will be lower

when the population grows more slowly. It is this reduction in desired tax rates, rather than the

specific ability distribution, that produces our key results.



5.1    Steady-State Comparisons

       The condition for capital market equilibrium holds in both the initial and the post-

transition steady state. Noting that kt = kt +1 in the steady state and denoting steady-state values

by the absence of time subscripts, total differentiation of (19) yields,

        k$ = s$ ‚àí (1¬ú
                    + Œ∑),                                                                       (22)

where x$ = dx / x indicates the proportionate change in a steady-state value. Saving per young

person is given by (18), which can be totally differentiated to yield

             ¬ö + h$ ‚àí ‚àÜœÑ$ ,
        s$ = w                                                                                  (23)

where ‚àÜ = œÑ /(1 ‚àí œÑ). The change in human capital depends on the adjustment in steady-state

education spending. Recalling our assumption that the ability distribution follows a uniform

distribution, and integrating (15), human capital per worker is

                  AH
        ht =                Ô£Æ (1 + g mt )œà‚àí1 ‚àí 1Ô£πÔ£ª ,                                            (24)

and evaluating at the steady-state,

        h$ = Œµ hg g¬ö m ,                                                                        (25)

where Œµ hg is the elasticity of human capital per worker with respect to government education

spending.14 Government budget balance restricts the change in the steady-state level of

spending:

        g¬ö m = œÑ$ m + $y .                                                                          (26)

The change in steady-state spending must also conform to the new political equilibrium.

Differentiating the expression for the median voter‚Äôs preferred tax rate (10),

        œÑ$ m = Œµ œÑa a$ m + Œµ œÑy $y,                                                                 (27)

5.2    Demographic Transition Without Endogenous Politics

       Since we wish to highlight the importance of endogenous policy, it is useful to establish

as a baseline the effect of demographic transition without politics. Thus, we begin by deriving

of education spending per young person remains fixed.15

       Because g is fixed, the level of human capital is fixed. Consequently,

        $y = Œ± k$ .                                                                                 (31)



                                                  11
Also, by assumption, the tax rate is affected only by income changes that make it easier or harder

to finance g:

        œÑ$ = ‚àí $y.                                                                               (32)

Noting that wages grow at the same rate as income, and using (22), (23), (31) and (32),

                      1
        k$ = ‚àí                (1¬ú

economy to a steady state with a higher level of capital per worker.16 In keeping with this result,

steady-state income per young person, consumption, and the wage also rise.

        That a decrease in population growth raises steady-state income per worker is a well-

known result from the conventional neoclassical growth model. Lower population growth

reduces break-even investment, the amount of investment necessary to keep k constant, without

affecting saving at any given level of capital. Public finance matters only in that the tax rate

affects the slope of the saving function.



5.3     Demographic Transition With Endogenous Politics

        Recognizing an individual‚Äôs political incentives broadens the effect of demographic

transition to encompass tax rate changes for reasons other than those due to national income.

Slower population growth reduces the tax rate preferred by the median voter, ceteris paribus,

leading to changes in government outlays and human capital. Feedbacks via physical capital

will, in turn, further influence the political equilibrium.

        Changes in the steady-state capital per worker derive from changes in after-tax income

and changes in the number of workers. Using (22) and (23),

        k$ = w
             ¬ö + h$ ‚àí ‚àÜœÑ$ ‚àí (1¬ú

Local stability of the political equilibrium requires M Y > 0 while local stability of the

intertemporal equilibrium requires M K > 0 .17

        To gain a feel for the importance of endogenous political responses, consider first the

case in which the ability of the median voter, am , is fixed, but government spending is not. That

is, due to changes in the economic steady state, the same pivotal voter alters the demand for

government spending. Looking at the second term on the right side of (35), we see that a

decrease in population growth raises steady-state capital per worker, holding am fixed.18

        What determines this effect? M Y is the multiplier effect of an autonomous increase in

output (say due to a productivity change or shift in AY ) on steady state output, while M K is the

corresponding multiplier effect of a windfall of capital on steady-state capital per worker.

Consequently, the coefficient on (1¬ú
                                   + Œ∑) in (35) is the effect of an initial increase in capital per

worker (due to a decrease in the size of the working population) on income and the effect of this

rise in income on capital accumulation.19




                                                           13
       As noted above, however, a decreDVHLQ FKDQJHVWKHLGHQWLW\RIWKHPHGLDQYRWHUWRWKDW

of a lower ability person. This voter-identity effect has an indeterminant influence on steady-

state capital per worker, as can be verified by looking at the coefficient on a¬õm in (35).

       To see why the effect is ambiguous, consider a social planner who is constrained to offer

the same amount of education to everyone, regardless of ability. This constrained social

optimum is characterized by the first order condition

        (1 ‚àí Œ±)Œµ hg = œÑ.                                                                      (36)

The planner chooses a level of education spending that equates the marginal benefit of education,

measured as its proportionate impact on income, (1 ‚àí Œ± )Œµ hg , with its marginal cost, also measured

as its proportionate impact on income, œÑ . The coefficient on am can be interpreted in this light.

If the median voter initially chooses spending on education that is ‚Äútoo high,‚Äù the coefficient will

be negative, and a reduction in the median voter‚Äôs ability will raise capital per worker in the

steady state. Effectively, the shift in am cuts back on inefficient spending‚Äîthat whose marginal

contribution to total income is less than its marginal cost in terms of lost consumption. On the

other hand, if spending is initially ‚Äútoo low,‚Äù the decrease in the median voter‚Äôs ability

exacerbates the inefficiency, reducing income, saving, and capital per worker in the steady state.

       The median voter‚Äôs choice can be compared to the social planner‚Äôs choice by noting that

the median voter chooses œÑ to maximize her after-tax income. The first-order condition guiding

the median voter can be expressed as

        (1 ‚àí œÑ)Œµ mhg = œÑ,                                                                     (37)

where Œµ mhg is the elasticity of the median voter‚Äôs human capital with respect to education

spending. In comparing this condition to (36), we notice two differences. First, the planner

chooses public spending to maximize national income rather than after-tax income. Secondly,


                                                 14
the average effectiveness of education in raising human capital, Œµ hg , differs from its impact on

the median voter, Œµ mhg . Indeed, if ability is distributed uniformly, the marginal impact of

education on the median voter‚Äôs human capital is less than its average marginal impact. Taken

together, these differences imply that the political equilibrium may provide too much or too little

education spending and demographic transition may reduce or increase capital per worker.

        Even if capital per worker is higher in the new steady-state, however, there is no

assurance that income per worker will rise. This indeterminancy results from the possibility that

human capital per worker falls when a lower tax rate is chosen. A useful reduced form

expression for the change in education spending is:

        g¬ö = M Y Ô£Æ Œµ œÑa a$ m + Œ±(1 + Œµ œÑy )k$ Ô£π .                                                   (38)
                 Ô£∞                            Ô£ª

Because Œµ œÑa is positive, as is M Y , a reduction in the median voter‚Äôs ability may result in lower

steady-state government spending despite an increase in capital per worker. Consequently,

human capital per worker may fall and the economy‚Äôs human-to-physical capital ratio may fall.

        The change in steady-state income per worker depends on the change in h and k, and may

be expressed as:

        $y = M Ô£Æ(1 ‚àí Œ±)Œµ Œµ a¬õ + Œ± k$ Ô£π .                                                            (39)
              Y Ô£∞       hg œÑa m      Ô£ª

The coefficient on a¬õm is positive, so a fall in the median voter‚Äôs ability may reduce income even

when it raises steady-state capital per worker. This immiserizing outcome is more likely to

occur, for a given k$ , the larger are the elasticities Œµ hg and Œµ œÑa and the larger is labor‚Äôs share of

national income, (1 ‚àí Œ±). It can be shown that Œµ œÑa , the response of the preferred tax rate to a

change in ability, is smaller the larger is œà . Ceteris paribus, the more effective public education




                                                    15
is in raising human capital (defined as larger œà ), the smaller the decrease in the equilibrium tax

rate resulting from the demographic transition.

        A more effective education system, however, also implies a larger loss in human capital

as a result of the decrease in œÑ precipitated solely by the fall in voter ability. The elasticity Œµ hg

is larger for a larger œà , so holding Œµ œÑa constant, a larger œà makes it more likely that a decline in

the population growth rate is immiserizing.

        Labor‚Äôs share of national income also determines the income loss from a shift in the

median voter. The larger this share is, the more a decrease in human capital reduces national

income. In simulations described below, we characterize the combinations of Œ± and œà that

produce an immiserizing outcome.


6.      SIMULATION METHODS AND STEADY-STATE SENSITIVITES


        To better understand the implications of the model, we use numerical simulations to

gauge the sensitivity of our steady-state analysis to values for key parameters. We also

undertake a series of numerical simulations to investigate the dynamics of transition between

steady states. A necessary price of doing so, however, is that we must adopt specific functional

forms and parameters for our model.

        To begin, we set Œ¥ equivalent to an annual rate of time preference of 4 percent.20 Under

the crude assumption that one ‚Äúperiod‚Äù in the model equals 30 years, the 4 percent rate of time

preference translates into a value of Œ¥ equal to (1.04)30-1=2.24. Alternatively, 1/(1.04)30 = 0.308

is the rate at which the future is discounted in the model.

        We begin with the assumption that the population growth rate ( Œ∑ ) is 2.0 percent

annually, a bit more rapid than the recent United States experience. This annual rate corresponds

to growth of 81.1 percent over a model period. In the context of the model, Œ∑ serves as well as

                                                   16
the key parameter for analyzing generational shifts. The ratio of the old to young generations is

given by 1/(1+ Œ∑ ); in our base case, this is equal to 0.55. We investigate the dynamics resulting

from a shift in the population growth rate from 2.0 percent (annually) to 1.0 percent. Thus, in the

model the dependency ratio rises to 0.74, an increase of roughly 35 percent. We assume that

ability, a, is distributed uniformly in the interval [0,1].21 Finally, we set the elasticity of output

with respect to capital input equal to one-third (Œ± = 0.33). 22

        We do not constrain ourselves to a particular value of œà . Instead, Table 1 summarizes

RXUFRPSDUDWLYHVWHDG\VWDWHUHVXOWVIRUDUDQJHRIYDOXHVIRU WKHHODVWLFLW\RIKXPDQFDSLWDO

output with respect to inputs of ability and government spending. Entries in the first column

serve as our ‚Äúexogenous policy‚Äù baseline. They are derived by holding government spending

fixed when the population growth rate is reduced. Looking at the results, the tax rate always

declines, capital per worker always grows, and income always grows regardless of the value

chosen for œà . The decline in the tax rate varies only slightly as œà increases, reflecting only

œà ‚Äôs effect on average income.

        In contrast, consider column (2) in which government spending is determined by a

median voter. Here, a larger value for œà has a direct effect on the desired amount of

government spending. The tax rate falls dramatically for low values of œà , but actually falls by

less than the exogenous policy case for high values of œà . Indeed, for high enough œà , as shown

by the results for œà =0.5, government spending and human capital actually rise even though the

tax rate falls. At lower values of œà , steady-state capital per worker and income per worker rise

even though human capital falls. For the value œà =0.32 (and below), however, the decline in

human capital is so severe that income per worker declines even though capital increases. The

low œà value implies a large Œµ œÑa and, thus, a large decline in government spending when the



                                                   17
ability of the median voter falls. This case illustrates the possibility of immiserizing

demographic transition stemming from the endogenous response of public spending.23

       The critical value of œà , above which income per worker rises, depends on the share of

labor income in national income (1 ‚àí Œ±) . In Figure 1, for a range of values for Œ± , we trace out

the critical value of œà above which a decline in the population growth rate raises income per

worker. This relationship is non-linear in general, but for Œ± > 0.33 the value of œà needed to

ensure income growth is increasing in Œ± values.24 This relationship reflects the lower income

payoff from additional government spending when labor‚Äôs share (1 ‚àí Œ±) is low and thus the need

for a smaller human capital response from the decline in median voter ability to prevent an

immiserizing outcome.


7.     TRANSITION PATHS


       Of course, comparative steady states may provide a misleading picture of the actual

events that transpire during the process of demographic shift. To shed light on the dynamics,

Figures 2 through 5 depict the transition paths obtaining for a case in which the demographic

transition leads to higher steady-state income, specifically for œà = 0.5. 25

       Figure 2 translates the political logic of steady states directly to the transition period. In

response to the shift, the ability level of the median voter declines and remains unchanged. The

level of spending preferred by the median voter, however, initially declines but rises gradually as

income per worker rises. Indeed, eventually education spending is higher than in the case of a

fixed level of government spending. As shown in Figure 3, the level of human capital per

worker mimics this pattern, dropping precipitously in the first period and rising so that it exceeds

the fixed-g case. The dynamic path of human capital follows from the rapid growth in economic

activity (Figure 4) generated by accumulation of physical (Figure 5) capital. Thus, while we find


                                                 18
poorer economic performance during the very early periods of transition, the model suggests that

endogenous formulation of fiscal policy may provide for a compensating boost in growth that

raises income per worker. As we discussed above, however, the long-run effect of the

SRSXODWLRQVKLIWGHSHQGVRQERWKWKHYDOXHRI  WKHHIIHFWLYHQHVVRIJRYHUQPHQWVSHQGLQJLQ

raising productivity) and on the degree to which the initial conditions are characterized by an

inefficiently large (or small) public sector.


8.     CONCLUSIONS


       As dependency ratios increase over the next 50 years there will be corresponding shifts in

the political pressures that determine fiscal policy. Because of the key role of human capital in

economic performance, the degree to which a more elderly population will support public

spending for education is of particular interest. In the context of a median-voter model of the

political process, embedded within an overlapping-generations model of economic growth, we

have show that there is no automatic link between the preference for lower education spending

by older individuals and the long-run provision of human capital to young workers. Instead,

when the demographic transition alters the identity of the median voter, if the public sector is

inefficiently small, the resultant political and economic dynamics will exacerbate the

underprovision of human capital However, it is also possible that such a shift may trim an

inefficiently large government, reduce tax rates and raise capital per worker enough to raise the

long-run level of education spending per worker.

       Our findings highlight the importance of three issues for future research. First, a key

parameter in our model is the mapping between educational inputs and the production of human

capital, making clear the value of additional research in this area. Second, our model focuses on

the provision of public education spending at the expense of a detailed description of the



                                                19
financing structure. To the extent that non-neutral income taxes and other financing schemes

alter the incentives to acquire human capital, it would be useful to embody these effects in future

research. Finally, our results are derived in the context of a closed economy. In the presence of

internationally mobile capital, two additional features may be important. To begin, capital will

flow internationally in pursuit of the highest return, altering the dynamics of capital

accumulation. However, the simultaneous aging of other counties will induce political pressures

for altered fiscal policies and capital flows across the globe.

APPENDIX: STABILITY ANALYSIS


STABILITY OF THE POLITICAL EQUILIBRIUM


         Analysis of the stability of the political equilibrium obtaining in any given period allows

us to sign the term M Y in the text. The political equilibrium is defined to be locally stable if,

starting from a given level of g, the economy moves automatically to an equilibrium. To analyze

stability, we posit a Marshallian-type adjustment rule for government spending of the form

         ‚Ä¢     Ô£ÆœÑ     Ô£π
         g = c Ô£Ø p ‚àí 1Ô£∫ = œï( g ),                                                             (A.1)
               Ô£∞œÑ     Ô£ª

where the c is a positive constant and the dot above a variable represents its time derivative. The

variable œÑ is the actual tax rate, as necessitated by the government budget constraint. It is a

function of g and the contemporary level of income per young person. The variable œÑ p is the tax

rate desired by the median voter at the given level of education spending and income. The

rationale behind (A.1) is that education spending will increase if the desired tax rate exceeds the

actual tax rate needed to balance the government‚Äôs budget. The equilibrium level of spending, g

solves œï( g ) = 0. g is locally dynamically stable if and only if œï‚Ä≤( g ) < 0.

         Using (25), (27), and (29) and noting that within a generational period the capital stock is

given,

         œÑ$ p = (1 ‚àí Œ± )Œµ hg Œµ œÑy g¬ö ,                                                        (A.2)


where the elasticities are defined in the text and x$ is defined as x/ x. Rearranging the
                                                                    g




differentiated government budget constraint and using (25) and (29), the actual tax rate changes

according to:

         œÑ$ = Ô£ÆÔ£∞1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œ±)Œµ hg Ô£πÔ£ª g¬ö .                                                       (A.3)


                                                  21
Differentiating (A.1) and using (A.2) and (A.3), stability of the political equilibrium requires that

        œï‚Ä≤( g ) = (1 ‚àí Œ± )Œµ hg (1 + Œµ œÑy ) ‚àí 1 < 0.                                            (A.4)

Condition (A.4) implies that M Y , as defined in the text, is positive if the within-generation

political equilibrium is stable.


INTERTEMPORAL STABILITY WITH ENDOGENOUS POLITICS


        With Cobb-Douglas production technology and logarithmic preferences, the evolution of

the capital stock is a function of the contemporaneous tax rate, wage, and human capital level.

Since the tax rate, wage, and human capital level are functions of the contemporaneous capital

stock, the evolution of the capital stock takes the form:

        kt +1 = G (kt ).                                                                       (A.5)

A sufficient condition for a locally dynamically stable steady state is that G‚Ä≤(k ) < 1 when

evaluated at the steady state value of k.26 Using (22) and (23),

        k$ t +1 = w
                  ¬ö + h$ + ‚àÜœÑ$ .
                   t    t     t                                                                (A.6)

                                                                                  $ = 0, and
where x$ indicates x/ x. Substituting by using (25), (27), (29) and (30), letting Œ∑
                       g




evaluating at the steady state,

        G‚Ä≤(k ) = Œ±(1 ‚àí ‚àÜŒµ œÑy ) M Y                                                             (A.7)

where M Y is defined in the text and is positive because we assume a stable political equilibrium.

Using (A.7), the definition of M Y , and rearranging, stability implies

        (1 ‚àí Œ±) (1 ‚àí Œµ hg (1 + Œµ œÑy ) ) + Œ±‚àÜŒµ œÑy > 0.                                          (A.8)

Therefore, if the economy exhibits intertemporal stability, the expression defined as M K in the

text is positive.



                                                        22
INTERTEMPORAL STABILITY WITH FIXED GOVERNMENT SPENDING


With g fixed, using (23)

                   ¬ö + ‚àÜœÑ$ .
         k$ t +1 = wt     t


Using (32) and the fact that wages grow at the same rate as income,

         k$ t +1 = Œ± k$ t ‚àí ‚àÜŒ± k$ t = Œ±(1 ‚àí ‚àÜ)k$ t .

Stability requires G‚Ä≤(kt ) < 1 when evaluated at the steady state. Consequently, stability requires

         Œ±(1 ‚àí ‚àÜ) < 1.

This permits us to sign the denominator of (33) when the economy exhibits intertemporal

stability.

ENDNOTES


1.   See B√∂rsch-Supan [1995].

2.   Another strand of the literature looks at how different institutional arrangements alter the
     impact of population aging. Brueckner [1999], for example, studies the choice of fiscal
     federalism versus unitary government for long-run capital intensity and growth.

3.   A related literature investigates the effect of one form of endogenous policy,
     redistributive taxation, on growth (an extensive survey of which is provided by Persson
     and Tabellini [1994]). A contrasting approach is taken by Wright [1996], who studies the
     effect of changes in an exogenous growth rate on fiscal choices. Wright suggests that the
     complex feedback between policy and growth may explain the conflicting results of the
     empirical literature, which contains instances of both positive and negative correlations
     between cross-country growth rates and government policy variables.

4.   Our focus is on the provision decision. Alternatively, Bovenberg and vanEwijk [1997]
     study the impact of progressive taxation on human capital accumulation and long-run
     growth.

5.   Notice that despite our use of the term ‚Äúdependency ratio,‚Äù our model does not contain
     explicit provision of old-age consumption via government programs (e.g., Social
     Security). Meijdam and Verbon [1996], in contrast, analyze the effect of aging on the
     political decision making for public pensions in an overlapping-generations model. As in
     the current paper, they find that with growth an increase in the political power of the old
     may not alter fiscal choices in the direction expected in the absence of growth.
     Kaganovich and Zilcha [1999] study the effect of various allocations of tax revenues to
     education and social security benefits on growth. Their model does not, however, permit
     this allocation to be endogenously determined.

6.   We assume that the distribution of abilities is the same in all generations so as not to
     confound the effect of changes in size of generations (demographic shift) with changes in
     the composition of generations.

7.   Holtz-Eakin [1993], in an overlapping-generations framework, obtains a distribution of
     preferences for a publicly provided good by introducing the possibility that not all
     individuals born at time t survive to time t+1. This assumption generates ‚Äúaccidental
     bequests‚Äù inherited by members of the next generation and induces a distribution of
     incomes within the younger generation.

8.   In the context of our model, allowing an endogenous allocation of time between
     ‚Äúschooling‚Äù and supplying labor does not change our analysis. All young workers,
     regardless of ability, will choose to allocate the same proportion of time to supplying
     labor.




                                              24
9.    We assume education services are equally distributed among all ability types, as in Epple
      and Romano [1996]. Equal division introduces a distortion in that the marginal product
      of educational services are not equalized across young people of different abilities.

10.   This is a direct result of our choice of logarithmic utility, and greatly simplifies the
      analytics. We relax this restriction in our simulation analysis.

11.   It is useful to note that the solution for the preferred tax rate is the same for all utility
      functions of the constant relative risk-aversion form. In particular, our solution is not
      specific to logarithmic preferences.

12.   See Romer and Rosenthal [1983] for an overview of the model‚Äôs uses and limitations.

13.   In a related model, Glomm and Ravikumar [1995] show that the overlapping-generations
      model may yield multiple equilibria. Our choice of utility function eliminates this
      possibility.

14.   Given the form (4) for the relationship between human capital and educational spending,

                                 1        Ô£Æ( œàg m ‚àí 1)(1 + g m )œà + 1Ô£π .

                                   œà+1                               Ô£ª

15.   Alternatively, we could fix the tax rate. However, because inefficiencies derive from
      choosing a suboptimal value of g and not from tax-based distortions, it is more instructive
      to fix g.

16.   See the Appendix.

17    See the Appendix.

18.   A comparison of equations (35) and (33) shows that only when Œµ hg = 0 and Œµ œÑy = ‚àí1, will
      the effect be identical to the exogenous politics case.

19    It can be shown that a larger response of human capital to government spending (a larger
      Œµ hg ) implies a larger response of steady-state capital to a change in Œ∑ if (1 ‚àí œÑ) > œÑ Œµ œÑy .
      This condition restricts the effect of higher government spending on after-tax income to
      be positive.

20.   See Coronado, Fullerton, and Glass [2000] for a discussion of discount rates in the
      context of Social Security analysis.

21.   The uniform distribution is appealing for its tractability, but does not provide a realistic
      distribution of post-education earnings (which display a log-normal distribution). Thus,
      an extension for future research is the use of alternative specifications of the ability
      distribution.

22.   Laitner [2000] argues that Œ± = 0.33 is consistent with recent United States data.

23.   In Appendix Table 1, we investigate the same relationship using a utility function
      exhibiting constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) rather than the logarithmic form. The
      constant relative risk aversion form used is

                   1 1‚àíŒ≥     1    1 1‚àíŒ≥
             U=        Ct +           Ct +1
                  1‚àí Œ≥      1+ Œ¥ 1‚àí Œ≥

      where Œ≥ is set to 0.5. Other values of Œ≥ produced similar results. The results here are
      largely the same, except that the population decline is immiserizing for a higher cut-off
      value of œà . Again, we see the decline in tax rate depends on the elasticity Œµ œÑa , which is
      larger for smaller values of œà .

24.   This nonlinearity comes from the influence of œà and Œ± on the product M Y Œµ hg Œµ œÑa .

25.   The transition paths look similar for a CRRA utility function and the same œà value.

26.   For a discussion of stability in the overlapping generations context, see Azariadis [1993].
