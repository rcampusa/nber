                 Fiscal Policies and the Stock Market:

                        International Dimensions




                               AB STRACT



     The dynamic effects of fiscal policies on the real equilibrium have

been the subject of a large body of recent research, emphasizing the

intertemporal dimensions of tax and spending policies both in closed and

open—economy contexts. The analysis in this paper extends the intertempo—

ral analysis which was conducted under full certainty to uncertain enviro—

ments. Specifically the paper uses a two—country stochastic general—

equilibrium model of the world economy to address issues concerning the

effects of government tax and spending policies on private sector consump-

tion asset portfolios and stock market valuations. The key result of the

paper is that the consequences of expected future policies and the

charcateristics of their international transmission depend critically on

the precise variability of these policies across states of nature. The

effects of current policies on consumption savings and stock market

prices are shown, however to conform closely to the predictions of the

corresponding certainty intertemporal model.

      This paper uses a two—country stochastic general—equilibrium model

of the world economy to address issues concerning the effects of fiscal

policies on the international allocation of consumption, saving and risk.

Specifically, the paper deals with the effects of government spending and

tax policies on private—sector consumption spending and asset portfolios.

Consequently the analysis sheds light on the effects of these policies on

the stock—market valuation of assets.

     The dynamic effects of fiscal policies on the real equilibrium has

been a subject of a large body of recent research. Examples of such

research in a closed—economy framework are Barro (1981), Blanchard (1985)

and Mankiw (1987), and in an open—economy framework are Buiter (1986) and

Frenkel and Razin (1986, 1987a,b). This line of research, emphasizing

intertemporal considerations, is confined to an environment of full

certainty in which the private sector behavior is governed by perfect

foresight. The open—economy research focused mainly on the international

and intertemporal allocation of consumption and investment and their

manifestations in trade imbalances. Consequently in this framework the

terms of trade and the world rate of interest are the main channel through

which fiscal policies in one country are transmitted to the rest of the

world.

     This paper extends this research to a stochastic environment in which

the main channel of the international transmission of fiscal policies is

the stock market, assumed to be freely accessible to both foreign and

domestic residents.

     Our interest in the effects of fiscal policies on the equilibrium

prices of internationally traded equities of the home and foreign industries

stems in part from the close connection existing between equity prices

(the analogues of Tobin Qs) and levels of investment. Although investment

in physical capital is not treated explicitly the analysis in this papaer

provides bench—mark results on equity prices that can be used to assess

the effects of fiscal policy on domestic and foreign investment levels.

The key result of the paper is that the consequences of expected future

government spending policies and the characterisitics of their international

transmission depend critically on the precise variability of these policies

across states of nature.

     To analyze the effects of policies in such an environment it is

necessary to extend the intertemporal model which is usefully employed in

the deterministic framework, to allow for uncertainty and for the existence

of risk—sharing securities that are competitively traded in the stock

market. The stock market model used here is developed in Diamond (1967),

Helpman and Razin (1978) and Lucas (1978). A recent application to

international trade in assets is contained in Svensson (1987).

     The paper is organized in the following manner. In Section I we

briefly set out the stock—market model used in the remainder of the paper.

Section II considers the effects of current and future government spending

policies on asset prices and on levels of consumption. Section III con-

siders the issue of government debt neutrality and Section IV considers

the effect of government spending on the international allocation of risk

and on the relative price of the domestic security in terms of the foreign

security. Finally, Section V contains concluding remarks. Many of the

derivations are contained in the appendix.

                      I. An International Stock Market Model

      Consider a two—period model of a nonmonetary open economy producing

 and consuming one aggregate tradable good. The economy Is assumed to be

 endowed with the sequence of endowments 00Y0 and 01(cz)Y1 where the sub-

 scripts zero and one designate the corresponding periods indexed by the

 state of nature a •       There are S possible states of nature, 00y0 and Y1

 are predetermined and Oi() corresponds to the state of technology in

the home industries, a =           1,2,...S.     Similarly to the framework used in

Helpman and Razin (1978) 1/ let q be the price of a unit of real equity

In the representative home firm In terms of units of the aggregate consump-

tion good. The home firms produce Y1 units of these equities with a

(gross) stock market value being equal to qY1. Let an asterisk

denote foreign industries. Accordingly, foreign firms produce the
           **          *       *
sequence 00Y0 and 01(a)Y1 in period zero and one, respectively,

the price of a unit of foreign real equity is denoted by q* and the

stock—market value of foreign industries Is q*i

     In this two—period model the domestic private—sector's budget

constraints are:

     (1) CRO +     qz1     +
                               qz1    =

                                                                             Oz0   —
                                                                                       G0

     (2)   CH1(a) =                  +
                                          *      *    —
                      Ol(a)zHl            Ol(cz)zHl       G1(ct).

!/ The  present model is a two—period one—good version of the model which
was developed in Helpman and Razin (1978, ch. 11). Labor income is con-
tained in the initial endowment         Bonds will be introduced later
in Section IV.

In equations (1)—(2), CR0 and CH1(c1) denote first and (state—ct)

second—period consumption and ZHt and      denote the shares of

stocks in home and foreign firms in period t (t0,1). The productivity

parameters Oand O indicate the amount of dividends, per share,

paid by domestic and foreign firms respectively, and Gt denotes lump—

sum taxes in period t (t0,1). In equation (1) disposable income is

equal to current dividends from the historically given portfolio

(z110, z0), and the market value of this portfolio net of taxes, G0.

Income is spent on consumption C110, and on the new portfolio (z111, i•

Second—period disposable income, in equation (2), obtained from the

dividends on the portfolio (net of taxes), includes no resale value of

stocks since this period is the last period. For this reason there is

also no acquisition of a new stocks in this period.

     Let u(CHt) be a concave von Neumann—Morgenstern utility function of

the representative individual and let    denote his subjective discount factor.

The expected utility is


     (3) U = U(C110) + Eu[C111(ct)]

          where E is the expectation operator.

     The consumption—portfolio choice problem of the individual is to

maximize the expected utility (equation (3)) given (common) beliefs about

the probability distribution of states of nature and subject to the budget

constraints in equations (1) and (2). The resulting consumption and asset

demands are functions of security prices, q and q*, second—period taxes

is   a function of q, q* and G0. The foreign private sector, Indicated

by the subscript F, solves essentially a similar problem. The model

is general enough so that the utility functions u and u can be diffe-

rent with respect to all parameters except that the probability assess-

ments are identical across countries. The model is closed by the world

market—clearing conditions for current—period consumption and equities of

firms located in each of the countries. It is assumed in this section

that the government runs a balanced budget so that tax revenue (G0) is

equal to government spendings. The world equilibrium is:


      (8) 0[q,q*,G1,0] ÷ C0[q,q*,] =                           +        —

      By Wairas' law we can use only two equilibrium conditions. Accord-

ingly, we choose to omit the current—consumption market—clearing condition,

equation (8), from the analysis. The remaining two conditions in equations

(9) and (10) are used to solve for the market—clearing prices q and q*

    The nature of the world equilibrium, characterized by free financial

capital movements evaluated at the steady state is best understood with

the aid of Figure 1. The upward—sloping schedule ZZ describes different

combinations of the security prices q and q* which clear the domestic—asset

market. Likewise, the upward sloping schedule ZZ describes different

combinations of prices q and q* which clear the foreign—security market.

In the stationary state the portfolio composition does not change over time.

Accordingly, zHl = zHO,            zT =   z, zF =      zFO
                                                              and z =     z0.       Around

such an equilibrium the ZZ schedule is steeper than the ZZ schedule.

To verify we differentiate equations (9)—(1O) by using the definition of

wealth in equation (7). Rearranging and making use of the Slutsky decom-

position for asset demands the analysis yields

                                                                      —

                                   —7—

This means that with an intertemporally separable expected utility func-

tion assets z and z' are net substitutes and the (negative) own—price

elasticity is larger (in absolute value) than the (positive) cross—price

elasticity. Combining the sign conditions in equations (13) and (14)

with the expressions in equations (11) and (12) it is evident that the ZZ

and ZZ schedules are upward sloping and that the former is steeper than

the latter around a steady state. In other words around the steady state

individuals are neither net buyers nor are they net sellers in the security

markets. Accordingly, security—price changes generate no real income

effects on asset demands, and the characteristics of equlibrium are

governed by asset substitutions.

     Consider the initial equilibrium point A in Figure 1. A rise in

the domestic—security price, q, as indicated by the movement from

point A to point B, generates an excess supply of domestic securities

and since assets are pure substitutes the same price change generates

also an excess demand for foreign securities. To restore equilibrium

in the market for foreign securities, the foreign security price, q,

rises to point B. Similarly to clear the domestic security market the

price q* is raised to point D. The reason that the latter rise in q* is

more pronounced than the former is that, as indicated by the demand

condition in (14), the effect of this change on the demand for the domestic

security is weaker than the corresponding effect on the demand for the

foreign security. 1/

1/ These considerations need not hold in the presence of real—income
effects of price changes which prevail outside of the steady state.

          II. Government Spending and the World Stock Market

     Government spending alters the amount of resources available to the

private sector and thereby disturbs the world equilibrium in goods and

assets. As a result asset prices must change to restore market clearing.

In the presence of uncertainty a distinction between transitory and

and permanent spending familiar from the analysis of government spending

a non—stochastic environment (see Frenkel and Razin 1987a).   To isolate

the effects of government spending on the world stock market equilibrium

we consider in this section only balanced—budget spending policies.

1. A Current Transitory Rise in Government Spending

     Consider, first, the effect of a transitory rise in the home country's

current government spending. The rise in spending which is associated

with a corresponding tax hike creates an excess supply of assets. This

excess supply is eliminated by a fall in the prices of both the domestic

and the foreign securities. This analysis is illustrated in Figure 2.

In Figure 2 the initial (stationary state) equilibrium obtains at point A

at which the domestic—security price is q and the foreign—security price

Is q*• A transitory balanced—budget rise in current government spending

creates an excess supply in domestic securities and necessitates a corres-

ponding rise in private sector demand. As implied by equation (3) the ZZ

schedule shifts to the left to Z'Z'. The same rise in government spending

creates also an excess supply in foreign securities and necessitates a cor-

responding increase in demand that is reflected by a downward shift of the

ZZ schedule to Z'Z'. This result conforms with the one obtained in the
                                  —9—

nonstochastic analysis (see Frenkel and Razin [1987b] ch. 7) in which a

transitory rise in government spending raises the equilibrium world rate

of interest. Analogously, in the present case expected yields on both

assets rise.

           2.   An Expected Rise in Future Government Spending

     Consider now the effect of an expected transitory rise in the home

country's future government spending. Suppose that the magnitude of this

rise is known with certainty in the present period so that the rise is

equal in all states of nature. The positive effect of the rise in G1

(which lowers future disposable income in all states of nature) on the

demand for assets is shown in Figure 3 in which the indifference curve UU

describes the different combinations of savings and consumption that

leave the level of expected utility unchanged. The budget line with a

slope equal to 1 intersects the horizontal axis at point W, which is equal to

the level of wealth, and point A describes the initial demand for consumption

and savings. As shown in Appendix II a rise in G1 switches the indifference

curve from UU to U'U' and the asset demand point from A to B. As a result

consumption falls while savings rise.

     In other words, through the consumption—smoothing mechanism the fall

in future disposable income enhances current—period savings. This result

also conforms to the deterministic analysis in Frenkel and Razin (1987b).

Even though the demand for assets as a group rises we cannot ascertain

that the demand for each and every asset necessarily rises. If however

the productivity parameters ® and ®* are strongly positively correlated,
                                    — 10 —




It   is likely that demand for every asset does increase. 1/ Another case

in which the result holds is when the joint distribution of the domestic

and foreign productivity shocks is symmetric so that (ex ante) the assets

are substitutes.

       The effect of the rise in future government spending on the world

equilibrium under the assumption that assets are gross substitutes and demand

for both of them increases following the future rise in government spending

is Illustrated in Figure 4 In which the initial equilibrium is indicated

by point A. The rise in the asset demands consequent on the increase

in government spending requires a rightward shift in the ZZ schedule

and an upward shift in the Z'Z' schedule. As a result the equilibrium

point shifts from A to C and the security prices rise from (q, q*) to

(q', q*'). Similarly to the nonstochastic analysis in which an

expected future increase in government spending lowers the world rate of

interest, in the stochastic case average yields on both assets fall.

            III. Government Spending Financed by a Stock Purchase

       The introduction of state—dependent government spendirLgs may alter

the nature of equilibrium since the implied change in the time pattern

and the state distribution of private—sector disposable incomes may affect

significantly the characteristics of the demand for assets.

       Consider, for concreteness, a policy in which the government makes a

purchase of G units of the domestic security financed by current—period

taxes. The dividends to be obtained from the government security holdings


     1/ See the extreme case of perfect correlation discussed in Appendix III.
                                          — 11 —



 are used as the government revenue which covers its (state—dependent)

 spending in the future period. This policy entails a current—period fall

 in the domestic private—sector wealth and a corresponding (state—dependent)

 fall in the world resources available for the domestic and foreign private—

 sector consumption in the future.

      The policy generates an excess demand for the domestic security which

is equal to (l—zH1W) for each unit increase in government spending. At the

same time, the policy also generates an excess supply for the foreign secu-

rity which is equal to          per unit increase in government spending. In

terms of the diagram in Figure 1, the ZZ schedule is displaced to the right

while the Z*Z* schedule is downwardly displaced. A priori it is not possi-

ble to determine whether equilibrium stock prices rise or fall.

     To demonstrate some specific effects of this policy on the equilibrium

security prices consider the following example. Let the utility function be

quadratic, u(CH) =   a CH —    12    .   As usual the quadratic utility is
                                CH


restricted to a range of consumption spendings in which CH<U                  .     A similar

utility function applies also to foreigners. The domestic and foreign

measures of absolute risk aversion are 1/Ca—C11) and l/(a*_CF)
                                                                                  respectively.
With this specification maximizing the domestic expected utility in equa-

tion (3) subject to the budget constraints in equations (1) and (2) yields

(15) [a —   (a + l)ZF1 — (,oo*÷ 1)z1 — G1]          =   (a   —
                                                                 C0)q

    where ajj denotes the covariance between i and j (i0,0*; j=0,8*).

     Similarly,         the first—order conditions for the foreign—country

optimization problem are:
                                                       *                 —

     Adding equation (15) to equation (17) and equation (16) to

equation (18) and substituting the market—clearing conditions

where     =   a   + ct* and V0 =          ÷ Y.

     Evidently, as already stated in the preceding sections, a current

period transitory rise in government spending (a rise in Go) lowers both

the domestic and the foreign security prices while a future state—independent

rise in government spending (a rise in G1) raises these equlibrium prices.

It is also evident from equations (20)—(21) that the expansionary fiscal

policy charaterized by the government purchase of domestic securities

(a rise in G) while raising the domestic—security price affect the foreign

security price positively or negatively depending on the covariance

between the domestic and the foreign productivity shocks. A positive
                                        — 13   —




 correlation   between the productivity shocks implies that the increase in

 domestic government spending raises foreign security price and conversely

if the shocks are negatively correlated.

                   IV.     The Neutrality of Government Finance

        The preceding section demonstrates the significance of the means of

government finance for the world equilibrium in some circumstances. The

"claim"of the domestic private sector on domestic taxes can be viewed as

a negative asset. Whether tax shift policies are relevant depends on

whether the induced distribution of "returns" on this asset is already

spanned by the equilibrium returns on the prevailing assets. A special

case is the one in which taxes are state independent and a safe bond is

traded in the world market. Consequently the neutrality of government

debt emerges as in the certainty model. Accordingly, the budget cons-

traints in equations (1) —     (2)   are modified as follows.

(22) C110 + b0 + qz0 + q*z1 = (q + OO)zHO + (q* ÷                  + R.1b1 —
                                                                               T0
(23) C111(n) = O1(c)z111   +            + R0b0 —

where bt denotes a one—period fixed—return bond in period t (t0,—1),

R0 denotes the interest factor (one plus the rate of interest) and Tt denotes

lump—sum taxes in period t (t0,l). Equations (22)—(23) are consolidated

as usual into a single budget constraint (in terms of future value) to

yield

(24) ROCHO + CHI(cL) + R0(qz110 ÷ q*z0) =          — (R0T0 + T1)

where

    W =
           R0(q + eO)zHO ÷ R0(q*     + O)z + R0R_1b1
                                      — 14 —




It   is clear that tax—shift policies which maintain the present value of

taxes (T0 + T1/R0) do not impact on the private—sector consumption possi-

bility set. Accordingly government debt is neutral.

        Obviously the neutrality of government finance need not require the

existence of a safe bond. Consider the case in which only stocks are

internationally traded. In this case the analogue of the consolidated

budget constraint in equation (24) is



(24a)     C110 + CHI(cx) =   i)   [ZHO +       +
                                                   0
                                                       Z}j0+
                                                               0*
                                                                    ZHOJ
                                                                           —
                                                                               0
                                                                                   T + T0]


Now, if T1 is state dependent any tax shift policy that maintains

              = —qT0 constant is neutral. Indeed, under such cir-

cumstances the return on the (negative) tax asset are proportional to the

returns on the domestic security, state by state, and no new security is

introduced by the government financial activities. Evidently, state

independent future taxes are not neutral under these circumstances.

     V. International Allocation of Risk and the Relative Security Price

        To highlight the pure effect of government spending on the inter-

national allocation of risk and on the relative price of the domestic

security we abstract in this section from intertemporal considerations.

The minimal model for our purpose is the one with two states of nature

and no initial consumption. This extreme case in which markets are com-

plete yields sharp predictions for the effects of government spendings

on stock prices.
                                        — 15 —




       We   henceforth suppress period subscripts. The maximization of the

expected utility IT(O)u(CH(O)) +     Ir(1)u(CH(1))   (where ir(a) is the proba-

bility of state a (a0,1)) subject to equation (2) yields


"
       ir(O)u'(O)G*(O) +   rr(1)u'(l)O*(l)   —

    / ir(O)u'(O)O(O) +   ir(1)u'(l)Q(l)
where q* is the relative price of the foreign security in terms of the

domestic security. Denote the price of the state one contingent good in terms

of the state zero contigent good by p. In an equilibrium the marginal rate of

substitution between goods consumed in the two states is equal to the price.

That is,
       lr(1)u'(l) =
(26)
       n(O)u'(O)

       Equations (25) and (26) imply that

       e*(o) + pe*(l) —    -
'27'
    / 0(0)  + pO(1)     q


Similar conditions apply to the foreign country since at equilibrium the

relative price of the foreign security, and thereby also the relative price

of goods consumed in state one, are equalized.

       The equilibrium in the world economy is portrayed by the Edgeworth

box in Figure 5.      In this Figure the horizontal axis measures world output

in state zero (0(0)Y +     O*(0)Y*) and the vertical axis measures the
corresponding quantity in state one (0(1)Y +         0*(1)Y*).   The international

distribution of world claims to outputs is specified by point E. As usual,

quantities pertaining to the home country are measured from point °H as
                                  — 16 —



an origin and quantities pertaining to the foreign country are measured

by point °F as an origin. The equilibrium obtains at point A, where the

slope of the domestic and the foreign indifference curves are equal to

the equilibrium price of goods contingent on state one, p. Using equation

(27) we can derive also the equilibrium relative price of the foreign

security q*.

     Consider now the effect of a rise in the home country's government

spending at the amount G(O) in state zero and G(1) in state one. As a

result the size of the box (corresponding to the world output net of

government spending) diminishes. Accordingly the length of the horizontal

axis is reduced by G(O) and the length of the vertical axis is reduced by

G(1). At the prevailing relative price p foreign demand remains unchanged

as represented in Figure 5 by point B. This point is located on the

foreign consumption expansion locus displaced to the new origin 0;. By

construction the parallel line segments 0B and OFA are of equal length.

Analogously, as long as the initial p remains unchanged the domestic

consumption expansion locus also remains unchanged but in view of the

fall of income the new reduced level of desired consumption is represented

by B' instead of A. Observe that the fall in the domestic budget line

measured by the line segment AB is equal to the shrinkage of the size of

the world output box measured by the line segment, 0;0F At the prevailing

price there is an excess demand for state one goods and an excess supply

for state zero goods indicated by the line segment BB'. Thus the relative

price, p, must rise to restore equilibrium. From equation (27) it is
                                  — 17




evident that whether or not the foreign security price rises depends on

whether the domestic productivity ratio, 0(1)10(0), exceeds or falls

short of the foreign productivity ratio e*(1)/o*(o).

     Although the diagram in Figure 5 is drawn for homothetic preferences

with expansion schedules drawn as rays from the origin, the reader can

verify that the transfer—problem criterion derived above is more general.

Analogously to Frenkel and Razin (1987b) the basic criterion determining

the effect of a rise in government spending on the relative price of goods

consumed in state one involves a comparison between the government marginal

propensity to spend in state one, indicated by the ratio MPG(1)/MPG(O) and

the corrresponding ratio of the domestic private—sector propensities to con-

sume indicated by MPC(1)/MPC(0), where MP denotes a marginal propensity. If

the government propensity exceeds the private sector propensity to consume

in state one the rise in government spending and the corresponding fall

in the disposable income of the domestic private sector create an excess

demand for state one goods and an excess supply of state zero goods. As

a result p rises. If, on the other hand, the government propensity falls

short of the corresponding private sector propensity the equilibrium

price p must fall.

     Given the induced change in p, to determine the effect of the rise in

government spending on the relative price of the foreign security one

should compare the domestic productivity—ratio 0(1)10(0) to the corresponding

foreign ratio 0*(1)I0*(0). If the domestic economy is relatively more
                                    — 18 —




productive   in state one so that 0(1)10(0) exceeds 0* (1)Ie*(0)

the domestic security price, q, rises relative to the foreign security

price, q*, when state one contingent good price, p, rises and vice versa.

                           VI. Concluding Remarks

     This paper extends the analysis of the effects of fiscal policies on

the world equilibrium from the certain to stochastic environments. In

such environments the key channel through which the effects of policies

are transmitted internationally is the world stock market consisting of

international trade in domestic and foreign equities.

     As in the more standard intertemporal analysis of the issue the

analysis in this paper distinguishes between temporary and permanent

policies. But the unique feature of the present analysis is the precise

specification of the variability of future government spending policies

across states of nature, a key element in understanding the effects of

expected future policies on the world economy.

     The paper demonstrates that the effects of a current transitory rise

in government spending on equilibrium consumption levels and on equilibrium

mean returns on equities conform to the results obtained for the case of

no uncertainty: domestic and foreign consumption fall while the mean

equilibrium return on both domestic and foreign equity rises. In the

presence of stochastic government spending policies the deterministic

analysis also serves as a general guide for predicting the induced changes

in current consumption and overall savings. But It provides no guide for

understanding the effects of the policies on the composition of equilibrium
                                   — 19 —



portfolios   and on the equilibrium prices of equities. The analysis shows

that if the marginal propensity of the government to spend in the (worldwide)

low productivity state exceeds the corresponding domestic private—sector

propensity the equilibrium low productivity state—contingent price rises.

Consequently, the domestic equity price rises relative to the foreign

equity price if the domestic economy is relatively more productive in

this state in comparison to the foreign economy and vice versa. Whether

equity prices in terms of consumption rise or fall depends, among others,

on the means of goverment finance and on the statistical correlation

between asset returns.

                   Key Characteristics of Asset Demands

     In this appendix we derive the key characteristics of the asset—

demand functions which underlie the slopes of the schedules ZZ and Z*Z*

in Figure 1. To simplify the notation we suppress period and country

subscripts. Using equation (2) the utility function in equation (3)

can be expressed as a function of c0, z, z and G as follows:

(A—i) U(C0,z,z*,G) = u(C0) ÷ E{u[O(cz)z + O*(c)z* — G]}
                           =
                                u(C0) + v(z,z*,G)
consider the inverse of the function u(C0), that is C0 =             u(u)
the expenditure function .z(q,q*,G,v) associated with v(z,z*,G) and the

expenditure function associated with U(C0,z,z*,G). They are related to

each other as follows:

   (A—2) m[1,q,q*,G,U] =            mm     {i(u) + 1.I(q,q*,G,v)   s.t. u+vU}
                                    u ,v


                                =   mm     [i. c(U—v) + jj(qq*Gv)]
                                    U ,V


The first—order condition of the optimization problem in (A—2) is

   (A—3) —1 4'(U—v) ÷           j(qq*)            = 0

As usual the compensated—asset demands are the partial derivatives of the

expenditure function (A—2) with respect to prices (1, q, q*). Thus

differentiating equations (A—2), using equation (A—3), yields

   (A—4) (a) C0 = mi = •(U—v)
          (b) z =     mq
                            =


          (c)   z =             =              ,G,v)
                      mq*
                                                                    APPENDIX I
                                                         — 21 —




      Suppressing the arguments of the functions for convenience and
differentiating (A—4) yields

   (A—5)      (a)

              (b)        mqqliqq+llqvvq

              Cc)        mqq*       i.lqq*+Ilqvvq*

To obtain explicit expressions for v1, Vq and Vq* we differentiate (A—3).

This yields

   (A—6) v =                        > °


                     —
   (A—7)      Vq =                        < °


                     —
   (A8)      Vq* =                           < 0



The signs of the expressions in (A—6) — (A—8) indicated above follow

from the assumption of normality (implying that tlqv and          are posi-

tive) and from the convexity of the expenditure functions         and ii which

reflect the assumption of risk aversion (implying that " and           are

positive.)

     Substituting (A—6) — (A—8) into (A—4a) — (A—4c) yields


   (A—9)     mql =   'qv                     > 0

The negative sign in (A—b) follows from the fact that 1-tqq < 0

(because the demand for the domestic demand falls when the domestic

security price rises while holding the welfare level v constant).

The positive sign in (A—il) is implied from the convexity of the

expenditure function so that

                               l'vvPqq* > l.tqv1tq*v

     Equation (A—b) implies that the domestic security demand is negati-

vely related to q and (A—il) implies that the assets z and z are pure

substitutes.

     Multiplying equation (A—b) by q and adding the resulting expression

to equation (A—il), multiplied by q*, yields


                                   —

where use has been made of the familiar properties of expenditure function:

   is homogenous of degree zero in the prices q and q* and 'v is homogenous

of degree one in these prices. The negative sign in (A—12) implies that


   (A—13)      q*mq*q < — qmqq


Expressed in terms of the price elasticity of the compensated demand this

This means that a rise in the domestic security price, q, exerts a more

pronounced effect on the demand for this security than on the demand for

the other security. Similarly, it can be verified that a rise in q* exerts

a weaker effect on zS than on z*S.

         The Effect of a Future Transitory Rise in Government Spending

                             on Consumption and Savings.

     In this appendix we derive explicit expressions for the effects of

a future state—independent rise in government spending on consumption

and savings which underlie the diagrams in Figure 3.

     Consider first explicitly the expenditure function li(q,q*,G,v)

introduced in equation (A—i):

   (A—15) j(qq*)= mm qz+q*z* + A[vEU(®(a)z+®*(a)z*_G)]
                                 z ,




where A is a Lagrangian multiplier. The first—order conditions are gi-

ven by

   (A—b)      (a)     q—AEU'9=O

              (b)     q*_AEUt®*=o

              (c)     v—EUO
Using the envelope theorem the derivatives of ii              in   equation (A—15) are

   (A—17)     (a)     iiv
                            =A

              (b) G = AEU'
              (c)    11q =   Z

              (d)    1q* =

Differentiating     (A—16) with respect Co v and G yields

             + xEuuo*(EuhIeo*Eu '0 — EU"O2EU' 0*)+EUt (Eu1To2Euto*2_(Eueo*)2)]

            where          = 3[EU02(EUt0*)2_2EUtt00*EUb0EU?0* ÷ Eutbo*2cEue)2] > o.

Equations (A—18) (a)—(d) imply that


   (A—19)          'vG =    {X[(EU          O)liqv +       (EUtbO*)Iiq*v]
                                                                            +
                                                                                (EU')u   }




     Next we evaluate the effect of the rise in G on the utility levels
U, v and u. For this purpose consider the demand system from appendix I:


                       14'(U—v) —                                =   0
   (A—20)                                    j(q,q*,G,v)
   (A—21)              1(U—v) +               (q,q*,G,v)        =
                                                                    W0.


where W0 denotes current wealth. This system can be solved for the endo—

genous variables U and v given the levels of the exogenous variables q,q*

and G.

     Differentiating equations (A—20) — (A—21) yields:

               dU =   —
   (A—22)

              dv —         cIIJG + 4'1'vG
   (A 23)     dG           'i'''   + 4",
                                     'V


Since u =   U—v substracting (A—23) from (A—22) using (A—20) yields

              du —        1IVGItv — 11G1vv
   (A—24)     dG          h1(
                          'V       ÷   "
                                       'V



Finally,    substituting equations (A—19) into equation (A— 24) yields


   (A—25)        =   2      (EU0)11qv+(Eue*)p c*v
                                  — 25 —                     APPENDIX II



We conclude that if the assets z and z* are normal "goods" (so that

Pqv>O and itq*v>O) then a transitory future rise in government spending,

G, lowers first period utility level U(C0) and thereby also lowers

first—period consumption C0.

          Perfect Correlation Between the Returns of the Domestic

                          and the Foreign Securities


     If there exists a perfect (positive) correlation between the re-

turns of the two securities, there is essentially just one tradable secu-

rity whose price is denoted by q. From the budget constraint and (A—25)

we have

                   ldCo
   (A—26) =—">O.
     Thus a future rise in government spending raises the demand for the

security.
