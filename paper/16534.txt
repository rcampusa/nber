                                                ABSTRACT

Investors rebalance their portfolios as their views about expected returns and risk change. We use
empirical measures of portfolio rebalancing to back out investors’ views, specifically their views about
the state of the economy. We show that aggregate portfolio rebalancing across equity sectors is consistent
with sector rotation, an investment strategy that exploits perceived differences in the relative performance
of sectors at different stages of the business cycle. The empirical foot-print of sector rotation has predictive
power for the evolution of the economy and future bond market returns, even after controlling for
relative sector returns. Contrary to many theories of price formation, trading activity therefore contains
information that is not entirely revealed by resulting relative price changes.

1.     Introduction

       It is well documented that asset prices and returns help forecast business cycles

(see Stock and Watson (2003) for a survey of this literature). The motivation behind this

literature is that the information about the current and future states of the economy

collected and processed by investors is revealed by the (change in) relative prices of the

securities traded in response to this new information. Asset prices are therefore a leading,

and often thought of as sufficient statistic, for the public or private information available

to agents.

       Orderflow, the act of initiating the purchase or sale of securities, is the conduit

through which information about economic fundamentals are aggregated into asset

prices. Theoretical and empirical studies demonstrating the role of orderflow in price

formation include Glosten and Milgrom (1985), Kyle (1985) and Hasbrouck (1991) for

equities, Evans and Lyons (2002) for foreign exchange, and Brandt and Kavajecz (2004)

for fixed income.

       Combining these two observations, that asset prices help forecast business cycles

and that orderflow is the mechanism by which asset prices change, raises the question of

how orderflow itself is related to current and future economic conditions. Does

orderflow forecast the state of the economy by itself and in conjunction with asset prices?

To the extent that orderflow has (marginal) predictive power, what is the exact nature of

this information?

       Orderflow may contain less, the same, or more information than prices or returns.

Orderflow may contain less information if a substantial portion of the price formation

process is due to unambiguous public information resulting in instantaneous price
                                                                                             2


adjustments (absent contemporaneous or subsequent trade). Alternatively, orderflow

might simply pass through information to asset prices so that the information contained in

orderflow and returns is identical. Finally, orderflow may contain more or unique

information relative to prices in that investors’ trading behavior is not fully spanned by

asset prices. This possibility arises if standing between orderflow, (which reflects the

actions of investors) and returns (which reflect the consequences) is a trading process

with a number of potential frictions. A whole host of frictions can impact the mapping of

actions (orderflow) into consequences (returns), such as noise trading, non-strategic

liquidity providers (e.g. stale limit orders), multiple signals channeled through a single

price, decentralized trading venues, etc. Each of these frictions has the potential to

dampen or mask the transfer of a signal from orderflow to prices or returns; thus, it is

conceivable that orderflow may contain more or different information than is contained in

prices or returns. In the end, whether orderflow contains less, the same, or more

information about the macroeconomy than asset prices or returns is an empirical question

– one that we wish to answer in this paper.

       It is important to note, however, that this last possibility does not hinge on the

nature of the information that prompted the orderflow, in particular, whether the

information is public or private. Both public information with heterogeneous beliefs

and/or heterogeneous decision processes (i.e., different investors using proprietary priors

or models to process public information) and private information in the traditional sense

have the potential to generate informative orderflow. As our empirical results do not

depend on this distinction, we do not model explicitly how or why market participants

decide to trade. We simply argue that agents are taking in information, some may be
                                                                                            3


private while other information is public, and they are processing it with their own beliefs

and models, to arrive at an orderflow action.

       There are many different settings that could be used to investigate these questions

as there are numerous ways in which investors adjust their portfolios in response to

changes in their views about economic fundamentals – e.g., they change their

stock/bond/cash allocation, change their positions in real assets such as gold or inflation-

indexed Treasury securities, or change their relative equity allocation within different

sectors of the economy. We focus our analysis on the last case of sector rotation, a

highly publicized investment strategy that exploits perceived differences in the relative

performance of sectors at different stages of the business cycle. This setting allows us to

study a very common strategy that is implemented by institutional and retail traders alike

as well as utilize data within a single dataset. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of

orderflow across ten U.S. equity sectors to investigate whether sector adjustments to

investor portfolios is related to the current and future state of the macro economy as well

as the aggregate stock and bond markets.

       With regard to orderflow predictability, our results show that while sector

orderflow movements are inconsistent with naive portfolio rebalancing techniques, such

as buy-and-hold (no rebalancing) or a constant-mix strategy, it appears that market

participants shift funds between equity sectors according to their collective information

about changes in the macro economy as much as three months ahead. Our results show

that large-sized active orderflow into the material sector forecasts an expanding economy,

while large-sized active orderflow into consumer discretionary, financials, and
                                                                                                              4


telecommunications forecasts a contracting economy.1 We also find that the cross-section

of sector orderflow contains information that predicts the evolution of bond markets,

even after controlling for relative sector returns and traditional low-frequency forecasting

variables. While it is interesting that orderflow predicts the macro economy and bond

market, what is most intriguing is that the linear combination of sector orderflow that best

predicts the evolution of the macro economy also contains the bulk of the explanatory

power for predicting the bond markets. Moreover, we demonstrate that our predictability

results become significantly stronger after conditioning on low dispersion of orderflow

within sectors indicating a true sector view as opposed to a view on a few stocks within

the sector. Together, these results suggest that the information contained in sector

orderflow is different than the information in returns; moreover, the information

contained therein has more to do with sector allocation than stock picking.

        Our results also reveal three characteristics regarding the nature of information

contained in sector orderflow. First, we show that the information in sector orderflow is

directly related to the release of macroeconomic fundamentals, specifically the release of

the prominent non-farm payroll figures. Second, our results show that sector orderflow

movements are related to independent mutual fund flows, which suggests market

participants are making active decisions regarding their equity market allocations.

Lastly, sector orderflow movements are inherently defensive in nature. By constructing

an orderflow mimicking portfolio, whereby a well-diversified portfolio is tilted according

to sector orderflow movements, we are able to show that the resulting portfolio is focused

primarily on wealth preservation by investing in low risk stocks during difficult economic

 Active sector orderflow refers to orderflow within a sector in excess of the proportion of total aggregate
orderflow into or out of the aggregate equity market based on the sector’s market capitalization.

times, albeit it enjoys superior risk and return properties relative to the traditional market

portfolio. Thus, taken together our results reveal that the information in aggregate sector

orderflow is directly related to macroeconomic fundamentals, is consistent with

deliberate reallocation strategies by market participants and is defensive in nature.

       Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 describes our data and

methodology. Section 4 investigates the predictive power of sector orderflow. Section 5

examines the nature of sector orderflow information and Section 6 concludes.

2.     Related literature

       The role of orderflow in a trading environment has received a fair amount of

attention in the recent finance literature. Despite the growing number of papers that

analyze orderflow, each can be partitioned into two broad strands of the literature based

on their research focus. One strand of the literature takes a macro view of orderflow, by

investigating how aggregate orderflow is related to market-level variables. Chordia, Roll

and Subraymanyam (2000, 2001, and 2002) analyze the connection between orderflow

movements into and out of equities and market-wide liquidity, while Evans and Lyons

(2007) relate proprietary foreign exchange orderflow with output/money growth and

inflation. Lo and Wang (2000) and Cremers and Mei (2007) investigate the implications

of two-fund separation on aggregate share turnover, while Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001)

find that returns and orderflow in the equity market are characterized by common

factors. Finally, Bansal, Fang, and Yaron (2005) demonstrate that there appears to be no

relation between macroeconomic sectoral wealth and the return and volatility of sectoral

returns.
                                                                                                6


       The other strand of the orderflow literature takes a micro view, by investigating

whether disaggregated (by individual security or mutual fund) orderflow can be used to

forecast subsequent asset returns. In particular, Albuquerque, Francisco and Marques

(2008) estimate the Easley, Kiefer, O’Hara, and Paperman (1996) structural model on a

set of stocks with international exposure to investigate the relation between orderflow and

exchange rates. Froot and Teo (2008) analyze institutional orderflow from State Street

Global Advisors to investigate whether orderflow movements are related to mutual fund

style returns. They find that fund flows appear to be related to styles and interestingly,

sector rotation is a specific investment style that they were able to identify. Campbell,

Ramadorai and Schwartz (2008) also investigate institutional orderflow; however, their

data source is a match of the TAQ database with the 13-F institutional ownership filings.

The latter two studies find that institutional orderflow has a significant effect on

subsequent asset returns.

       Our paper is positioned between these two strands of the orderflow literature. The

focus of our orderflow analysis is distinct in that we investigate the extent to which the

dynamics of orderflow between sectors is related to the macro economy as well as broad

markets rather than less aggregate series related to liquidity, volatility or specific mutual

fund returns. Our aim is to understand whether trading activity contains information that

is not entirely captured by resulting relative price changes and then to understand the

nature of that information. Thus, our contribution to the literature rests importantly in the

paper’s focus being on the connection between market participants’ decisions about

sector orderflow and the larger macroeconomy and capital markets.

3.      Data and variable construction

         At the center of our empirical analysis are equity orderflow data constructed using

the Trades and Quotes (TAQ) dataset over the sample period 1993 through 2005. Our

universe of common stock equities is generated from the stocks covered in the CRSP

dataset.

         We construct our orderflow data through a number of steps. For each stock and

each day in the sample period, we apply the following procedure. First, to ensure data

integrity, we eliminate non-positive spreads, depths and trade prices as well as records

where the size of the quoted spread and/or effective spreads are large relative to the

median quoted for that specific stock. Second, we match the sequence of outstanding

quotes with the sequence of trades applying the standard 5-second rule.2 Third, we

aggregate all trades that are executed at the same price which do not have an intervening

quote change. Fourth, we utilize the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm to sign each trade

as being initiated by a buyer or a seller which allows us to identify the liquidity provider

and liquidity demander. Lastly, each trade is assigned to a dollar size category whose

cutoffs are defined as follows: small (< $25,000), medium ($25,000 to $250,000) and

large (>$250,000).3 The rationale for using dollar orderflow is that by summing the net

dollar orderflow into sectors we are implicitly value-weighting, this is unlike stock

returns that are expressed on a homogeneous (scale-free) basis across size. This



2
  This rule has been standard practice in the literature and was certainly applicable during the first part of
our sample; however, recent advances in technology and speed of transacting may call into question its use
(Bessembinder, 2003). In the interest of consistency, we apply it uniformly across the entire sample period.
3
  Trades were also separated into size categories based on shares instead of dollars. We focus on dollars
throughout the analysis because partitioning by shares places a disproportionate fraction within the small
and medium categories.

procedure results in a set of daily orderflow series for each security: small, medium and

large buys and small, medium and large sells.4

         We assign each stock to one of the ten sectors defined by the Global Industry

Classification Standard (GICS) developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International

(MSCI) and Standard & Poor’s (see the appendix for specific sector descriptions). We

then construct sector-level net orderflow by simply summing all orderflow for the

individual stocks included in each sector; net orderflow to the stock market as a whole is

the analogous sum of net orderflow of each sector. Likewise, we define sector level

capitalization as the sum of the capitalizations (shares outstanding multiplied by end of

month price) of the individual stocks in the sector. Throughout the paper/tables the

sectors are ordered with respect to their cyclicality with the U.S. business cycle. We use

as an objective sector ordering the MSCI/Barra partition of the ten sectors into three

groups: pro-cyclical (information technology, materials and industrials), neutral

(consumer discretionary, financials, energy and telecommunications), and counter-

cyclical (utilities, consumer staples and health care).5 As a robustness check we also

conducted our own regressions regarding each sectors degree of cyclicality; our results

largely confirmed the MSCI ordering.




4
  We acknowledge that breaking up orderflow by trade-size to identity the broad type of trader (institutional
vs. retail) can be difficult. In particular, while it is well understood that institutional traders do not trade
large quantities exclusively nor do retail traders solely trade small or medium trades; as a general rule we
believe the likelihood of large trades originating from institutions remains high. In addition, we are able to
provide evidence (upon request) that all our key results hold irrespective of whether we use large or all
trade orderflow.

       Once the basic sector and stock market level net orderflow measures have been

constructed, it is possible to define our two key measures of net orderflow, active and

passive. Passive net orderflow for a given sector is defined as the total net orderflow to

the stock market multiplied by the weight of that sector in the market portfolio.

Effectively, the definition of passive net orderflow amounts to the null hypothesis that

orderflow entering the stock market is distributed across sectors by their weight in the

market portfolio. Active net orderflow for each sector is the difference between sector-

level total net orderflow and passive net orderflow thereby measuring the excess or

shortfall in orderflow relative to a market capitalization weighted distribution of total

orderflow. We interpret active net orderflow as deliberate decisions/actions by market

participants about their capital allocation within the equity market.

       Table 1 displays our total aggregate orderflow by sector and year expressed as a

percentage of the total net orderflow for the year. While the percentage of orderflow

across years remains fairly stable, there are certainly variation across years particularly,

leading up to, and during, the economic downturn in 1999 and 2000. In addition, these

shifts in the shares of orderflow across sectors appear more pronounced for large orders

(Panel B) relative to all orders (Panel A), suggesting that market participants placing

large orders may be more aggressive and/or savvy in positioning their portfolio ahead of

changes in the economy.

       We supplement the equity sector orderflow with information about the current

state of the economy, stock and bond market performance (returns) as well as non-farm

payroll expectations and announcement information. For the non-farm Payroll

announcement we obtain the release dates, actual reported (announced) values and
                                                                                                   10


median forecasts from Money Market Services. The performances of the stock and bond

markets are measured using the returns of the S&P500 index and the returns of the Fama-

Bliss CRSP discount bonds. Finally, we measure the state of the economy using the

Chicago Federal Reserve Bank National Activity Index (CFNAI). The CFNAI index is a

weighted average of a number of monthly indicators of economic activity first developed

by Stock and Watson (1999).6 Note that an index value above (below) zero indicates

economic growth above (below) the trend. In contrast to the NBER expansion and

recession periods, the CFNAI index has the advantage of being a coincident indicator, a

measure of economic conditions available in real time. In addition, our sample covers a

relatively balanced period of economic growth and decline, with the former occurring in

58% of the months in our analysis. To provide a visual sense of our key variables, we

plot the active net orderflow of large and all orders along with the CFNAI index for each

individual sector in Figure 1.

4.      The Information in Equity Sector Orderflow

4.1     Preliminaries

        As we have argued above, aggregate orderflow is a collection of all market

participants trading strategies and therefore embeds their preferences, expectations, and

information. Consequently, if we are interested in the information component of

orderflow as it relates to the macro economy it is important to disentangle, or control for,

any systematic portion of aggregate orderflow.

6
  The CFNAI index is constructed to be a single summary measure (with mean zero and standard deviation
of one) of the activity in four broad categories of the economy: production and income; employment,
personal consumption which includes housing; and sales, orders, and inventories. For more detailed
information concerning the CFNAI index see
http://www.chicagofed.org/economic_research_and_data/cfnai.cfm
                                                                                          11


       At the most fundamental level, the systematic portion of equity market orderflow

could simply be the result of movements into and out of the equity market as a whole.

We investigate this possibility by conducting a principal component decomposition of

sector orderflow. While our untabulated results reveal one dominant factor explaining

68% of orderflow movements, consistent with Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001), there are at

least five other significant factors that are important in explaining orderflow. Given this

result, we can quickly dispel the notion that aggregate equity orderflow simply blankets

the equity sectors uniformly.

       As a further diagnostic along these lines, we also compute the cross-correlation of

sector orderflow within the cyclical and countercyclical sectors, where cyclicality is

defined by the MSCI/Barra classification. Aggressive sectors have a very low average

correlation of 0.03, while defensive sector orderflows are relatively more correlated, with

an average of 0.24. Overall, this is suggestive evidence that information in different

aggressive and defensive sector orderflow is quite heterogeneous. Furthermore, when we

compare the simple correlations between large active sector orderflow and the excess

sector returns, all of them are positive, significantly different from zero, and are on

average equal to 0.35. Similarly to the equity market evidence presented in Hasbrouck

and Seppi (2001), this is evidence that sector orderflow and returns have some degree of

commonality but also show different dynamics.

       Portfolio rebalancing of sector positions is another common motive for trade. If

market participants engage in a buy-and-hold strategy (thereby effectively not

rebalancing their portfolios), we would expect to see no relation between aggregate sector

orderflow and the previous performance of the sector, while a negative relation between
                                                                                           12


sector orderflow and previous performance would be consistent with a constant mix

strategy. To investigate these possibilities, we analyze the temporal relation between

sector orderflow and the corresponding lagged sector returns at both a weekly and

monthly frequency. We suspect that the monthly aggregation may be more appropriate

as it is better able to cancel out components that are related to liquidity and inventory, yet

retain the components of orderflow that are related to long-lived information.

Specifically, we regress active net orderflow standardized by sector market capitalization

on the sector return in excess of the return of the market portfolio.

       Our results for the weekly horizon (shown in Table 2, panel A) reject both the

buy-and-hold and defensive rebalancing (constant mix strategy) as market participants

appear extremely eager to increase the weight of a sector after a period of positive

performance (positive excess returns). One way of interpreting these results is that in

aggregate, market participants chase performance (or act as momentum traders) at the

industry level. When we repeat the same analysis using a monthly frequency (shown in

Table 2, panel B), the results on small and large orders are no longer significant while the

results for medium orders are less significant than at the weekly horizon. At this lower

frequency, orderflow simply does not appear to respond to previous excess returns. Thus,

at the sector level, neither defensive rebalancing nor momentum trading appear to be a

pervasive determinant of orderflow patterns at the monthly frequency.

       These results show little evidence that in aggregate market participants

defensively rebalance their portfolios. If anything, orderflow seems to respond positively

to past sector returns, but only at a weekly frequency. These findings combined with the

evidence from the principal components analysis, suggest that orderflow is driven by
                                                                                                             13


more than simple indiscriminant or defensive trading strategies and therefore, has the

potential to reveal aggregate investor information related to beliefs, expectations and risk

preferences.

4.2      Sector Orderflow and the Economy

         In this section we explore whether the collective trades of market participants

across asset classes contain information about the expected state of the macro economy.

Our conjecture is that market participants are continually digesting news about the macro

economy; as they process this news, it impacts their preferences, expectations and risk

tolerances, which in turn induce them to trade.

         Our analysis involves aggregating orderflow to the monthly frequency and testing

whether sector orderflow has predictive power for the CFNAI expansion indicator. In

particular, we regress the current CFNAI index on active net sector orderflow normalized

by the market capitalization of each sector and the lag of the CFNAI index.7 This

empirical specification has a number of advantages. First, our key variable reflects the

orderflow that is entering a sector in excess of new funds invested into the stock market.

Second, standardization by sector market capitalization enjoys the intuitive interpretation

of market share and also avoids the practical difficulty of overweighting the largest

sectors.8 Recall that the construction of dollar sector orderflow is comparable to value-



7
  We repeat all the regressions in the paper including three lags of the explanatory variables and the key
results are confirmed. Therefore, in the interest of parsimony we keep the simpler specification without
lags. However, in the few marginal cases where the results differ, we mention the difference in the
exposition.

8
  We measure the sector market capitalization using stock prices at the beginning of the month to avoid any
spurious effects of a given month’s return on the weight of a specific sector. As a robustness check we also
repeat our analysis using the sector market capitalization for each day of the month, obtaining the similar
results.
                                                                                             14


weighting sector returns. Lastly, we are careful to control for the current level of the

expansion indicator to ensure that coefficients on the orderflow do not pick up any

contemporaneous relation with the economy.

        At the outset, we investigate whether active monthly orderflow, within each

separate sector, have predictive power for the expansion index one and three months into

the future. Our rationale for investigating each sector in isolation is to understand, in an

unconditional and unconstrained environment, which sector orderflow series are most

closely associated with economic expansions and contractions. The results, shown in

Table 3, formalize the individual sector comparison with the CFNAI index displayed

visually in the ten panels of Figure 1. As a reminder, note that the sectors are ordered by

their cyclicality, pro-cyclical sectors at the top of the table, neutral in the middle and

counter-cyclical at the bottom.

        Intuition suggests that pro-cyclical sectors (top of the table) would have positive

coefficients and counter-cyclical sectors would have negative coefficients (bottom of the

table). While in general this intuition is bore out, it is certainly not universal, with

exceptions being more prevalent for small sized orderflow. In addition, Table 3 shows

that orderflow into a number of the sectors are able to forecast expansion/contractions in

the macro economy, particularly for large orders. Specifically, we find that active

orderflow of large orders into the material sector predict higher levels of the expansion

index both one and three months ahead, while active orderflow of large orders into

financials, telecommunications and consumer discretionary predict lower levels of the

expansion index at the one and three month horizons.
                                                                                                    15


           In order to be conservative in our interpretation of the results, we compute data-

mining robust critical values for the largest t-statistic across the thirty alternative

orderflow regressors (orderflow in ten sectors across three trading sizes) in the forecast of

the CFNAI indicator. In particular, we construct the finite-sample empirical distribution

of the largest t-statistic under the null hypothesis of no predictability from orderflow

using 100,000 bootstrap replications. Our methodology consists of a block bootstrap

approach which specifically accounts for both the cross-sectional correlation across

sectors as well as the autocorrelation within each sector by drawing sets of observations

across all sectors at a point in time as well as a time-series window within each sector.9

In choosing the block length we follow Politis and Romano (1994) for a random length,

and Hall, Horowitz and Jing (1995) for fixed optimal length; however, critical values are

similar in either case. For example, the 5% and 10% data-mining robust critical values for

the t-statistics in Table 3, Panel A, with a random block bootstrap are 2.93 and 2.64,

respectively and they are 3.01 and 2.68 with a fixed-length block bootstrap.

           Of the large sector orderflow, materials, financials and telecoms are significant at

least at the 5% level across the one and three-month horizon, while small and medium sector

orderflow show utilities as significant at the 1% level. Further evidence of the information

contained in the orderflow series can be gleaned from comparing the baseline R2 absent the

orderflow series (shown in the last row of each panel within Table 3) to the R2 including the

respective orderflow series. An alternate way of digesting the result is that under the null

hypothesis of no predictability, there is a 5% and 2.5% probability to obtain six and eight

models, respectively, out of 30 with a t-statistic greater than two. In Table 3, Panel A, we




9
    There is an average of 0.55 autocorrelation for the first lag of large orders across sectors.
                                                                                           16


obtain eight models with t-statistics greater than two, consequently we believe this is

strong evidence that our findings are robust to the number of regressions that we execute.

        One last methodological concern is the bias that could arise in small samples

when regressors are persistent (e.g., Stambaugh, 1999), even though the degree of

persistence of active sector orderflow is much lower compared to the typical dividend

yield predictor extensively examined in the literature (e.g., the first order autocorrelation

on average across sector orderflow is 0.55). In any case, we use the block-bootstrap

technology described above to derive an empirical distribution for the R2. In Table 3

panel A, for example, we find that the hypothesis of no predictability implies an increase

in R2 over the AR(1) model below 4.5% in 95% of the cases. Empirically, large active

orderflow in materials, financials and telecoms all imply R2 increases that are above that

threshold. We thus conclude that in these cases the increase in explanatory power is

significant.

        In addition to the coefficients being statistically significant, they are also

economically significant; as an example, a one-standard deviation shock to large

orderflow in the materials sector implies a 0.14 higher expansion index one month later,

and such a move is approximately 10% of the maximum value of the expansion index

within our sample. While the relation between sector orderflow and the macro economy

is quite compelling for the large orders, the forecasting power of the medium and small-

sized orderflow is dramatically lower with only active orderflow into utilities being

consistently (negatively) associated with the expansion index. The contrast between the

large and small/medium orderflow results is interesting because it suggests the

information, expectations, preferences and risk tolerance of the market participants
                                                                                                          17


behind the different size trades is dramatically different. Under the simple assumption

that large orders are more likely to originate from institutional investors, while small and

medium orders are more likely to originate from retail investors, our results suggest that

institutional investors are better able to position their trades in anticipation of changes in

the economy than are retail investors. Retail investors appear to have a very coarse

partition of the sectors with utilities showing up as the only defensive sector and no

significant expansion sectors being employed.10

         After investigating the relation between the expansion index and sector orderflow

by individual industry, we now turn to an analysis of the cross-section of orderflow.

Specifically, we are interested in determining the orderflow factor (i.e., the set of sector

loadings) with the highest correlation to the state of the macro economy. As before, the

numerators of the active net orderflow variables represent deviations from passive

allocations, thus their sum is equal to zero. As a result, the ten sectors have orderflow

that are highly collinear and the coefficients in the multivariate regression are difficult to

interpret. Therefore, we refrain from showing the coefficients of the multivariate

regression and instead present the correlations between each sector orderflow and the best

linear combination of sector orderflow estimated in the multivariate regression. Lamont

(2001) encounters the same problem when using the returns of the base assets and

concludes that “the portfolio weights have no particular meaning”.

         Table 4 presents the cross-sectional results. Consistent with intuition, the large

orderflow results display positive coefficients for pro-cyclical sectors which tend to


10
   We acknowledge that with the increased importance of algorithmic trading recently, institutions can
optimally break up their trades to minimize price impact and disguise their actions. Therefore, it might not
be necessarily true that small trades correspond exclusively to retail investors. Despite this development,
large orders are still likely to originate from institutional investors.
                                                                                             18


negative coefficients as sectors become more counter-cyclical; the one exception being

consumer staples. We are puzzled by the results for consumer discretionary and

consumer staples and hypothesize that the categories are so large and heterogeneous that

it is difficult to get a clear signal about pure discretionary and necessity purchases.

However, the puzzle is consistent across both orderflow and return regressions, which

lends credibility to a feature that is systematic across various measures within our data.

        Also, consistent with the individual sector results, the large orderflow results are

different from the small and medium results. Beginning with the three-month horizon,

there appears to be some stratification of orderflow among sectors based on the size of

the trades. For example, large orderflow show that materials, industrials, and consumer

staples are aggressive economic sectors, while energy, consumer discretionary,

financials, and telecommunications are all defensive sectors relative to the

expansion/contraction index. The small and medium sized orderflow show a sharp

contrast in their positioning with no clear pattern relative to the cyclicality of the sectors.

For example, the materials and industrial sectors for the medium orderflows are

aggressive (positive coefficients) but so are consumer staples and health care; on the

defensive side (negative coefficients), information technology, telecommunications and

utilities are significant.

        Fewer sectors have significant correlations at the one-month horizon, which

suggests that one quarter ahead of an expansion (contraction) market participants perform

a broad portfolio reallocation (three-month results), while the final adjustments before a

turn in the economy appear to be concentrated into (out of) fewer sectors (one-month

results). At the one-month horizon, the materials sector is the most aggressive sector for
                                                                                           19


large orderflow, while health care and information technology are the most aggressive for

medium and small orderflow, respectively. Consumer discretionary, financials, and

telecommunications are the defensive sectors for large sized orderflow, while utilities

remain the one defensive sector for small and medium sized orderflow.

       In summary, it is clear that the link between aggregate sector orderflow and the

macro economy is strong, with large-sized active orderflow in specific sectors able to

forecast expansions/contractions up to one quarter ahead. Both the univariate and

multivariate regression results show greater predictability (higher R2 in Table 3 and 4) the

longer the horizon, for all trade sizes. In addition, large-sized sector orderflow, which is

likely to originate from institutional investors, appears to contain the bulk of the

predictive power in aggregate orderflow. Finally, the target sectors in our results for

trading on the macro economy are consistent with common financial wisdom concerning

sector rotation and portfolio allocation tactics.

4.3    Sector Orderflow and Markets

       To the extent that financial markets are tied to economic expansions and

contractions, it is an empirical question whether sector orderflow contains pertinent

information about the performance of the equity and bond markets and how that

information compares to the information that is useful for predicting the macro economy.

       In this section, we regress equity market returns on individual sector orderflow in

order to understand whether market participants overweight/underweight sectors in

anticipation of higher/lower future stock market returns. Table 5 presents our results

which are presented in a manner consistent with Table 3 (and Table 6) for comparison

purposes. Clearly the predictive power for the equity market is much weaker than results
                                                                                                         20


for the macro economy. For example, at the 1-month horizon, small sized orderflow into

utilities as well as medium and large-sized orderflow into the telecommunication sector

seems to predict lower future stock market returns. Moreover, the economic significance

is striking in that a one-standard deviation shock to the telecommunication sector predicts

a 1% monthly return. However interestingly, these results are not sustained at the 3-

month horizon with weak and sporadic significance displayed among the sectors.

Admittedly, the number of significant regressors for the stock market are in line with

chance. We also compute the correlations between each sector’s active orderflow and the

linear combination of ten sector factor loadings that best predict the stock market, similar

to the analysis presented in Table 4 for the macroeconomy. We find that the most

aggressive sector for large-sized orderflow is information technology and the most

defensive is the telecommunication sector, consistent with the univariate results (results

not reported).

        We perform the same analysis on the bond market (1-year maturity), see Table 6.

Not surprisingly, the results are stronger than the corresponding results for the equity

market, which is consistent with the received wisdom that the macro economy and the

fixed income market may have more in common with each other than either has in

common with the equity market. For the medium and large sized orderflow, the materials

sector has a negative sign and the financials and utilities sectors have a positive sign,

which is exactly the opposite result found for the expansion indicator.11 Furthermore,

these results hold at both the 1 and 3-month horizons. As an example of the substantial

economic impact of these results consider that a one standard deviation shock to

11
  Regressions were also run using the 3-year and 5-year bond returns. The results were similar and are
available upon request.
                                                                                                         21


orderflow into the material sector predicts a 0.0005 lower monthly bond return (0.6%

lower annual return), which is about ten times the average one-year bond return in our

sample. Moreover, the analysis of the correlations between each sector’s active

orderflow and the linear combination of ten sector factor loadings that best predict the

bond market, confirms that the most aggressive sector for large-sized orderflow is

materials and the most defensive is the financial sector (results not reported).12

4.4      Relation between Orderflow Information within the Economy and Markets

        To further investigate the predictability of sector orderflow, we consider whether

the orderflow factors which have the maximal correlation with economic expansions, the

stock market and the bond market each have predictive power over the other dependent

variables. For example, does the maximal linear combination of sector orderflow which

best predicts economic expansions have any ability to predict the stock and bond market

returns and vice versa? Specifically, Table 7 shows the explanatory power of regressing

future values of the expansion indicator, the stock market return, and the bond market

return on the current value of the dependent variable and a forecasting factor. The

forecasting factor is a linear combination of either active orderflow or excess sector

returns, where the loadings are computed as those with the maximal correlation with each

of the dependent variables, respectively.

12
  Since the cross-section of orderflow across sectors contains information about the future evolution of the
economy and the bond market, one could also envision that it contains information about future
volatilities. Specifically, investors could re-allocate towards defensive sectors not only when they believe
the economy is transitioning into a recession, but also when they think the risk of such an event is higher.
We investigate this hypothesis using the same empirical specification adopted before to predict the
economy, where we replace the dependent variable with the logarithmic change in the volatility index
(VIX) (a model-free implied volatility of S&P500 options with one-month to maturity) and the change in
realized volatility obtained from S&P500 returns, one-month and one-quarter ahead. While we find that
orderflow has some predictive power, the results are far from substantial. For example, the active orderflow
across sectors only predict up to 6% of the variation in the VIX change in one month (results not reported).
                                                                                            22


       Panels A, B and C of Table 7 display the results for the economic expansions,

stock and bond markets respectively. As one would intuit, the results show that own

orderflow and own returns have predictive power across the three panels. Beyond this,

Table 7 highlights four observations about the interaction among the three independent

variables that reveals much about the predictability of sector orderflow. First, the

orderflow factor with the maximal correlation with the expansion indicator has the ability

to predict not only the expansion index, but also the 1-year bond return and to a lesser

extent the stock market return (at least at the 1-month horizon). Specifically, at the one-

month horizon, the best linear combination of the cross-section of sector orderflow for

the expansion index is statistically significant and generates a R2 of 32%, 2% and 13% for

the expansion index, stock and bond markets respectively. The lower explanatory power

for the stock market is likely due to the relative importance of information about cash

flows and discount rates changing over time, as shown in Boyd et al. (2005). Second,

there is a high degree of reciprocity among factors; the combination of sector orderflow

which best predicts the stock market (bond market) also has predictive power over the

CFNAI index, with a statistically significant R2 of 22% (26%). Third, forecasting factors

based on linear combinations of excess returns appears to have little explanatory power

beyond their own market, which suggests that orderflow contains more cross market

information than returns. Fourth, the sector orderflow coefficients are relatively stable

across the three regressions (see Figure 2 for a summary of the orderflow coefficients

across select sectors). Thus, the reciprocity of orderflow’s predictive power across the

regressions coupled with the coefficients stability across sectors implies the existence of a

single orderflow forecasting factor, which is strongly related to macroeconomic
                                                                                           23


information and has the ability to forecast performance within the economy and capital

markets.

4.5    Orderflow versus Returns

       While the predictive power of sector orderflow has been clearly established, it

remains to be seen whether prices/returns contain the same or potentially more or less

information than orderflow.

       As a matter of background, there is an established literature which shows that low

frequency, market-level variables such as the dividend yield, the corporate default spread

(BAA less AAA yields) and the term spread (10-year less 3-month Treasury yields) have

predictive power for the economy as well as for equity and fixed income markets (see,

Keim and Stambaugh, 1986; Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Fama and French, 1988; among

others). Armed with these results, others have investigated whether returns have

incremental predictive power. Specifically, Lamont (2001) and Hong et al. (2007), show

that the cross-section of returns across sectors predicts the economy and the stock

market. Thus, when juxtaposing our orderflow results with results from the existing

literature, a natural question arises as to whether orderflow contains the same information

as returns. On one hand, returns and orderflow are related through the interaction of the

demand and supply of shares (orderflow) which generates the equilibrium price (returns)

and quantity (volume); on the other hand, the two series are distinct as orderflow is an

aggregation of market participant actions while returns are an aggregation of trading

consequences. Nonetheless, it remains an empirical question whether orderflow, returns

or both, contain information about the future of the economy and the various capital

markets, as well as what the specific nature of the respective information sets may be.
                                                                                                          24


         To formalize this comparison, we predict the expansion indicator CFNAI with

excess sector returns rather than orderflow, sector by sector. Table 8 displays our

results; for comparison we include the R2 from the large-sized orderflow results in Table

3. The R2 comparison reveals very little difference on average between the explanatory

power of orderflow and the explanatory power of returns. However, further inspection

reveals that the sector returns with predictive power are different than those for sector

orderflow. For example, within the return regression, consumer discretionary and

consumer staples, health care, financials and utilities are all negatively related to

economic expansion, which suggests that a negative excess return in these sectors

predicts an expansionary economy. In contrast, recall that the orderflow regression

showed that orderflow into the materials sector and orderflow out of the financial and

utility sectors are associated with an expanding economy.13 Thus, Table 8 suggests that

the information contained in orderflow and returns is at a minimum, different.

         To complement the above analysis, we run two auxiliary sets of regressions on the

economic expansion index, the stock market return and the bond market return varying

the set of independent variables among the various orderflow and return series. Table 9

displays our results which compare the adjusted R2 across small, medium and large sized

active net orderflow predictors along with returns at the 3-month horizon. The first item

to note is that the cross-section of orderflow contains more explanatory power than

returns do for future economic expansions, specifically, adding orderflow to the current

level of the index generates a twofold increase in the explanatory power, while adding

returns alone only increases the R2 by about 2%. For the stock market return, not only is
13
  As a robustness check, we also estimate a sector-by-sector regression where we include both returns and
orderflow as independent variables. The results that obtain are both quantitatively and qualitatively similar
and available upon request.
                                                                                                        25


there less predictability, it is not clear whether orderflow dominate returns. Finally, like

the results for the economic expansion, the large-sized orderflow dominate returns in

predicting the one-year maturity bond returns. In summary, these results demonstrate that

orderflow encompasses more information than is contained in returns.

        While Table 8 and 9 suggest that there appears to be more information in

orderflow and that information is materially different than information contained in

returns, it is possible that orderflow is merely proxying for low frequency variables such

as the dividend yield, the default spread (BAA less AAA yields) and the term spread (10-

year less 3-month), variables that the literature has already demonstrated has predictive

power for the economy and other capital markets. The final set of auxiliary regressions,

contained in Table 10, addresses this concern. The regressions compare the predictive

ability of nested sets of variables: Equations 1 and 2 provide the baseline regression,

Equations 3 and 4 add returns and active net orderflow respectively, and Equations 5 and

6 investigates if active net orderflow explains the residual of the return equation

(Equation 3) and vice versa.14 However, it is difficult to interpret the individual

coefficient estimates for two reasons. First, in equation 3 and 4 there is collinearity

induced by regressors expressed as deviations from a passive benchmark. Second, in

equation 5 and 6 the dependent variable is a residual and, as a result, the signs of the

explanatory variables are not meaningful. For these reasons, Table 10 simply displays the

number of significant regressors and the R2 in order to provide some sense of the

economic significance.



14
  We also augment the set of low-frequency market-level predictors with the three-month Treasury bill and
the volatility index VIX in equation (2), (3) and (4). Our empirical findings are practically unchanged and
therefore we only report the results for the more parsimonious specifications.
                                                                                             26


       As is evident from comparing the results in Equation 5 and 6, active net orderflow

explains more of the residual after controlling for returns and other low frequency

forecasting variables (Equation 3), than returns explain of the residual after controlling

for active net orderflow and the same low frequency forecasting variables (Equation 4)

for both the macroeconomy and to a lesser extent the bond market. Specifically, returns

have no additional explanatory power beyond market-level forecasting variables and

orderflow, whereas orderflow explains 12% and 5% of the variation of the economy and

the bond market respectively, left unexplained by market-level forecasting variables and

returns. Thus, the results contained in Table 10 suggest that active net orderflow provides

more and materially different information than that contained in returns and traditional

low frequency market variables.

5.     The Nature of Orderflow Information

       Our results thus far show that orderflow contains different information than

returns, what remains is to better understand the exact nature of the information contained

therein. To that end, a number of questions come to mind. Is the composition of active

sector orderflow important to its ability to forecast? Can sector orderflow movements be

directly tied to the release of important macroeconomic information? Does sector

orderflow reflect the information of a particular category of institutional investors? Is the

information in orderflow economically relevant? The next subsections will address each

of these questions in turn.

5.1    Orderflow Dispersion within Sectors

       We conjecture that, beyond the level, the composition of active sector orderflow

may also be important. Specifically, we hypothesize that the variability of orderflow
                                                                                                      27


among stocks contained in the sector is related to the strength of the macroeconomic

signal.

          To illustrate, consider that up to now, we have measured sector net orderflow as

the simple sum of all orderflow for the individual stocks included in that sector. Thus, a

large net orderflow in one sector could be the result of investors increasing the weight of

that sector in their portfolios or it could also be the result of a heavily traded single stock

within the sector for reasons unrelated to expected economic conditions (e.g., stock

picking based on private information). If our hypothesis is correct, the predictive power

of our results should be stronger whenever orderflow within one sector is more

homogeneous across stocks in that sector.15

          In order to measure whether investors are trading the whole sector or just select

stocks, we calculate the standard deviation of active orderflow for each stock as a

measure of dispersion of orderflow within each sector.16 Next we average sector

orderflow dispersion at the market level using two different weighting schemes. The first

dispersion measure (σ1) uses weights corresponding to the monthly market capitalization

of each sector. This method gives more importance to the dispersion of orderflow within

large sectors. The second dispersion measure (σ2), weights orderflow dispersion by the

absolute value of the correlations reported in Table 4, normalized to sum to one. This

method gives more importance to the dispersion of orderflow within the sectors that

matter more for predicting the economy.



15
   Beber, Brandt, and Kavajecz (2008) is another example of a conditional analysis of orderflow and
returns.
16
   The results are very similar if we use the range between the maximum and minimum value of active
orderflow or the absolute value of the orderflow skewness.
                                                                                                            28


         In Table 11, we present the results of forecasting the expansion indicator, the

stock market and the bond market with the sector orderflow in high and low dispersion

states. In a given month, dispersion is high (low) when the aggregate standard deviation

is above (below) its median in the last 12 months.17 Our conjecture is clearly confirmed.

When orderflow has low dispersion weighted by market capitalization (σ1), the

explanatory power is between 1.47 and 1.83 times higher than with high dispersion. If we

give more weight to the sectors that are more relevant for predicting the economy and the

asset markets (σ2), the results are even more striking; in months with low dispersion the

average explanatory power of orderflow doubles.

         In summary, the predictive power of active sector orderflow is much stronger

when we condition on low dispersion of orderflow within sectors. Moreover, the results

obtain no matter which weighting scheme is used or what market is analyzed.

5.2      Orderflow and Macroeconomic News

         One potential concern is that our results could be driven by some latent variable

unrelated to economic news which alters market participants’ fundamentals views of, and

attitude toward, the macroeconomy, which in turn induces trade. To address this

concern, we investigate whether sector orderflow responds directly to important

macroeconomic announcements which we know are signals, albeit noisy, of the current

state of the economy. Thus, a significant relation between aggregate sector orderflow




17
  The rolling threshold is preferred to a static threshold to avoid that conditional results pick up specific
subsample periods. The results are robust to the choice of the rolling span (from 12 months to 36 months)
and to the choice of the percentile (e.g., low dispersion as bottom quartile and high dispersion as top
quartile).
                                                                                                           29


and macroeconomic announcements would be consistent with our hypothesis and

alleviate concerns that our results are driven by other latent factors.18

         Our empirical design is to investigate the relation between orderflow factors with

the highest correlation with the macro economy, stock market and bond market with the

standardized non-farm payroll (NFP) announcement surprise, which is commonly

understood to be the first, and most influential, macro announcement within a given

month, (see, Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Vega, 2007).19 Orderflow is measured

over the week and the month following the non-farm payroll release. If active orderflow

is indeed capturing portfolio adjustments in response to changes in economic conditions,

then the release of NFP news should trigger active orderflow in the sectors that are linked

to the evolution of the economy. Our investigation encompasses two complimentary

approaches: measuring cumulative sector orderflow following non-farm payroll releases

(Figure 3) and a regression of the orderflow factors onto the non-farm payroll surprise.

         Figure 3 cumulates orderflow by sector following non-farm payroll

announcements. We distinguish sectors in three groups according to a predictive

regression of the CFNAI indicator on sector orderflow (see Table 3, Panel A): financials,

consumer discretionary and telecom sectors act in a counter-cyclical fashion, materials

and consumer staples act in a pro-cyclical fashion, while the remainder of the sectors are

not significant. The cumulative orderflow series are further partitioned by whether the

announcement was a positive (Panel A) or negative (Panel B) surprise relative to


18
   In this sense, our paper fits into the literature that uses the relation between macroeconomic
announcements and asset prices to provide real-time estimates of the current state of the economy (e.g.,
Evans, 2005).
19
   We standardize the release by subtracting the announced figure from the median expectation and
dividing by the standard deviation of the surprise.
                                                                                                 30


expectations. Consistent with having strong direct tie to macroeconomic news, the

orderflow results show that the financials, consumer discretionary and telecom sectors

shed (accumulate) orderflow after positive (negative) surprises, while materials and to a

lesser extent, consumer staples sectors have the opposite pattern.

           Table 12 displays our complementary regression results.20 The dependent

variable is a linear combination of sector orderflow or returns in the period following the

NFP release, where the loadings are the ones with a maximal correlation with the CFNAI

index, stock returns, or bond returns. Panel A shows that both the orderflow factor for the

macro economy and the bond market are significantly related to the non-farm payroll

announcement, while the orderflow factor for the stock market appears to have no

relation. The positive sign on the CFNAI indicator regression suggests that the creation

of new jobs (increase in non-farm payroll) predicts orderflow into those sectors which are

associated with a macroeconomic expansion. The negative sign on the bond market is

consistent with new jobs being associated with orderflow from the bond market into more

risky assets, which in turn puts downward pressure on bond returns. Panel B replicates

the above analysis using returns instead of orderflow as the dependent variable. In

contrast to the orderflow results, the return factors are unrelated to the non-farm payroll

release. This suggests that not only do returns carry less pertinent information relative to

orderflow, the nature of the information within returns and orderflow appears to be

markedly different.

           The remaining two sub-sections address the economic significance of our

findings. In particular, we study the sector orderflow behavior of an identifiable set of


20

institutional investors as well as the profitability of trading on sector orderflow

movements.

5.3       Orderflow and Mutual Fund Flows

          A drawback of the empirical measures of orderflow used in the literature and in

our paper is that the identity of the trader is unknown and thus it is not possible to

determine the category of investors that is primarily responsible for orderflow into a

group of stocks of the same sector. Mutual Funds, however, are one category of

institutional investors for which we can obtain low-frequency information on flows

invested in stocks of different sectors. The data we utilize for this portion of the analysis

is obtained from two mutual fund databases. The first database is the TFN/CDA

Spectrum database that contains quarterly portfolio holdings for all U.S. equity mutual

funds and the second mutual fund database is available from CRSP and contains detailed

information on the style of the fund provided by Lipper. While the Spectrum database

spans our sample period, unfortunately, the Lipper style categories data begins in 1998.

Thus, we backfill the style designations over the initial five years of our sample using the

first available styles in Lipper. We note that by backfilling data we are implicitly

assuming low mobility across fund categories in the first part of our sample. Additional

details on the two databases and the process to match funds are provided in Wermers

(2000).

          Once the data is compiled, we apply a series of filters to make sure that we are

properly and timely measuring mutual fund flows. Specifically, we require the quarterly

reporting date to be within two months of the stock holding reporting date and not more

than a quarter away from the previous reporting date. We also exclude all funds that do
                                                                                            32


not exhibit positive stock holdings in all the ten sectors throughout our sample period.

This filter effectively excludes international funds, bond funds, gold funds, real estate

funds, and all other sector specific funds, which are unlikely to be responsible for the

orderflow patterns documented earlier in this paper.

       For each of the style categories, we compute quarterly stock holding changes in

dollars broken down by the ten GICS sectors. According to the same logic used before to

compute the active component of orderflow, we calculate the active part of the sector

mutual fund flows. Specifically, we compute the passive part of flows in a sector within a

particular category of mutual funds as the sector allocation that would match a passive

market replication strategy. For example, if the total dollar flow in the category equity

income mutual funds is $100 in one specific quarter and the market cap weight of the

industrial sector at that time is 20%, we calculate that the passive dollar flows to

industrial is $20 and deviations from this level constitute active allocation strategies.

Similarly to the previous empirical analysis for orderflow, we standardize the active

flows by the market capitalization of each sector.

       We aggregate sector orderflow data of large orders by quarters to match the

frequency of mutual fund holding data and we compute the correlation between the

standardized active components of sector orderflow and sector mutual fund flows. We do

not expect to find a significant correlation between sector orderflows and mutual fund

flows in an analysis of all mutual funds, because there would be plenty of confounding

effects, like passive index mutual funds or mutual funds that are constrained to invest in

only one sector. In contrast, we focus our attention on the Lipper ‘core’ category without

distinction for size because we assume that the categories of mutual funds that are most
                                                                                                 33


likely to implement sector rotation strategies are those with an investment objective that

are not constrained to a particular category of stocks.

        Table 13 shows the correlation results by sector for the mutual funds with the

‘core’ investment objective, i.e. a blend of value and growth. All ten sector flows in core

mutual funds exhibit a positive correlation with sector net orderflow of large orders. In

four of the sectors, this positive correlation is statistically significant, despite the small

sample (52 observations). This result is notable, given the number of confounding

influences on quarterly mutual fund holdings. This is strong evidence that our active net

orderflow variables are measuring the rebalancing strategies of within core funds. As

benchmark, we also include the correlation of sector net orderflow with a passive

replication strategy of the S&P500 index (labeled S&P500 in Table 13). By definition,

these correlations should be unrelated to sector rotation strategies. As expected, the

average correlation is close to zero with only six of ten sectors being positive correlations

and two cases of correlations that are significantly different from zero, one positive and

one negative.

5.4    The Orderflow Mimicking Portfolio

       Thus far, our results are consistent with the notion that the magnitude, direction

and timing of orderflow across sectors reflect information about the risk preferences,

expectations and overall trading strategies of market participants.

       If we continue this line of reasoning within an asset pricing framework, then the

result that market-wide sector orderflow reflects the aggregate preferences and

expectations within the entire market suggest that market participants must necessarily

hold portfolios that are different than the market portfolio. Therefore, as a capstone to
                                                                                             34


our analysis we investigate the practical nature of information contained in the movement

of orderflow across sectors by constructing an orderflow mimicking portfolio.

       Specifically, we construct and analyze a portfolio that mirrors the aggregate

equity asset allocation of the investors initiating large trades, i.e. orderflow of large-sized

orders. The intuition behind our empirical strategy is that movements of orderflow across

the various sectors represent tilts to the market portfolio which define an orderflow

mimicking portfolio. These tilts define a market-wide portfolio that is potentially

different from the traditional CAPM market portfolio which will provide an evaluation of

the economic importance of the information contained in the cross-section of sector

orderflow.

       To implement such an orderflow portfolio, we start at the beginning of our sample

with an equity portfolio where the allocations across sectors are determined by market

capitalization weights. As before, we compute the weekly net active orderflow of large-

sized orders in different sectors as the difference between total orderflow for each sector

and the passive orderflow, that is, orderflow expected given the market capitalization

weight of each sector the previous week. Thus, active orderflow represents the proportion

of the orderflow to the aggregate stock market that deviates from the current allocation

based on current portfolio weights. We translate dollar orderflow into percentage weight

changes through a simple normal cumulative density function transformation. Like most

other asset allocation techniques, our procedure has the potential to generate extreme and

unrealistic weights. For example, an extremely positive (negative) active orderflow in

one sector may translate into a 100% increase (decrease) in the weight of that sector in

the orderflow portfolio. Since we rebalance the portfolio weekly, we impose a reality
                                                                                                          35


constraint of 1% on the maximum weekly adjustment, so that the largest possible change

in a sector weight is 1% every week. Economically, this constraint on the sector weights

might be interpreted as a transaction costs, implementation constraint, or even a risk

management technique.

        The orderflow mimicking portfolio that we constructed has properties that are not

only interesting, but also consistent with our earlier results pertaining to the information

content of sector orderflow. For example, Figure 4, Panel A, shows the cumulative return

performance of investing $1 in the orderflow portfolio compared with the market

portfolio over our sample period. Clearly the orderflow portfolio outperforms the

traditional market portfolio by approximately 40% over the sample period ($3.50 versus

$2.50). Moreover, a closer examination of the figure reveals that the orderflow portfolio

does not suffer the 1999-2000 down-turn in the market portfolio, which is consistent with

the orderflow portfolio being largely a defensive allocation strategy. Panel B of Figure 4

confirms this intuition as the orderflow portfolio loads heavily on low beta stocks over

the course of the 1999-2000 recession. Furthermore, the orderflow portfolio enjoys

superior risk and return metrics compared to the market portfolio; the orderflow portfolio

has an annual return, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of 19.7%, 14.5% and 1.36

respectively, compared to 11.8%, 15.7% and 0.75 for the market portfolio.21 Lastly, the

sector weights are well behaved ranging from a high of 30% to a low of 0% which argues

for the feasible implementation of the orderflow mimicking portfolio.




21
  We have also examined the performance of the orderflow portfolio conditional on the dispersion of flows
within sector, i.e. the tilts to the market portfolio are implemented only when flows’ dispersion is low or
high. Consistent with previous results, the Sharpe ratio of the low dispersion strategy is higher than in the
case of the high dispersion strategy.
                                                                                                        36


        We acknowledge that a number of assumptions were made to generate these

results; however, our results are robust to a wide range of parametric permutations. For

example, the orderflow portfolio results still obtain (1) relaxing the dollar to percentage

transformation, (2) utilizing a 1% to 100% weekly threshold range, and (3) irrespective of

the timeframe analyzed (starting date).

        Finally, it is important to be clear on what should be inferred from these results.

Certainly the reader should not be surprised to know that a portfolio can be constructed

that dominates the S&P500, this is just another manifestation of the Roll Critique. What

is remarkable though is that the information contained in orderflow across sectors has

striking economic implications as reflected through our orderflow mimicking portfolio

dominating the market portfolio. Moreover, the information contained in the orderflow

portfolio is directly related to the macro economy, tends to be defensive in nature, and

goes beyond the information captured by sector excess returns.22

6.      Conclusion

        There is mounting evidence in the literature that the trade decisions of market

participants incorporate their risk preferences, expectations and actual or perceived

information. Armed with this evidence, we investigate what orderflow movements

among equity sectors are able to tell us about the macro economy as well as the near term

performance of the equity and bond markets.


22
  A potential concern might be that the results are proxying for other factors known to be priced. One
specific concern might be the momentum factor at the industry level, which reflect information contained
in sector returns. However, our results show that the orderflow portfolio is different from the momentum
portfolio that has an annual return, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of 22.4%, 25.1% and 0.89,
respectively. Therefore, even though the momentum factor has superior returns, on a risk adjusted basis the
orderflow portfolio produces superior performance and must therefore contain different information than
merely momentum.
                                                                                           37


       We find that sector orderflow movements predict changes in the

expansion/contraction index and the future performance of the bond markets. In

comparing the various orderflow factors which predict the economic expansion, stock

and bond markets, we find that not only does orderflow contain more and different

information compared to returns and traditional low-frequency forecasting variables, but

the nature of the information is common across the three markets and explicitly linked to

information about the macro economy as seen through its relation to the non-farm payroll

announcement. In addition, our results are stronger when orderflow is less dispersed

within sectors, lending further support to our conjecture that the sector orderflow

measures indeed reflect the empirical foot-prints of sector rotation.

       Finally, we investigate the nature and economic relevance of the information

contained in sector orderflow movements within a portfolio context. The correlation

between active sector orderflow and mutual fund flows in core categories suggests our

orderflow measures are indeed capturing institutional trader flows. Moreover, when we

translate sector orderflow movements into tilts to the market portfolio in order to produce

an orderflow mimicking portfolio, the result is that the orderflow portfolio enjoys

superior risk and return properties relative to the traditional market portfolio or industry

momentum portfolios. This suggests that orderflow contain asymmetric information in

that it is primarily defensive in nature and largely related to wealth preservation.

             Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) and Sector Orderflow
We plot 3-month moving averages of the CFNAI index (bold line), active net orderflow of large orders
(continuous line) and active net orderflow of all orders (dashed line) for each sector. The CFNAI index is
constructed to be a single summary measure (with mean zero and standard deviation of one) of the activity
in four broad categories of the economy: production and income; employment, personal consumption
which includes housing; and sales, orders, and inventories. For more detailed information concerning the
CFNAI index see http://www.chicagofed.org/economic_research_and_data/cfnai.cfm . The active
orderflow series are constructed as the difference between sector total net orderflow and sector passive net
orderflow (stock market orderflow that would be allocated to the sector based on its market share) scaled
by the sector market capitalization and standardized to have mean equal to zero and standard deviation
equal to one.

              Cumulative Active Orderflow after Non-Farm Payroll Surprises

Panels A and B of this figure show the cumulative active orderflow following the release of the
Non-Farm payroll data for positive and negative surprises respectively. Triangles denote pro-
cyclical sectors, squares denote counter-cyclical sectors, the remainder are non-significant
sectors, as defined by regressing the expansion indicator on sector orderflow (see Table 3, Panel
A, for details).

    Unconditional Relation between Active Net Order Flow and Lagged Excess Returns

This table contains the results of the following unconditional regression:

       Net Orderflow j ,t − Passive Net Orderflow j ,t
                                                          = α + β (Ret j ,t −1 − Ret mkt ,t −1 ) + ε j ,t
                         Capsectorj,t
Net Orderflowj,t, Passive Net Orderflowj,t , Retj,t represent the actual net orderflow, the passive net
orderflow, and the value-weighted return within sector j over week/month t. Retmkt,t represents
the value-weighted return on the stock market index. We compute the passive net orderflow for
sector j as the total net orderflow to the stock market multiplied by the weight of sector j in the
market. Panel A shows the results for orderflow and returns cumulated over a week, while Panel
B shows the results for orderflow and returns cumulated over a month. T-statistics in parenthesis
are calculated using White heteroschedastic consistent standard errors..

     where Net Orderflowj,t, Passive Net Orderflowj,t , Capsectorj,t represent the actual net orderflow,
     the passive net orderflow, the capitalization of sector j over month t. We compute the passive net
     orderflow for sector j as the total net orderflow to the stock market multiplied by the weight of
     sector j in the market portfolio. T-statistics are calculated using White heteroschedastic
     consistent standard errors. Sectors are grouped by cyclicality as per the MSCI ranking in three
     broad groups, pro-cyclical, neutral and counter-cyclical respectively.

                 Relation between Expansions and past Active Net Orderflow

This table contains pairwise correlations between the best linear combination of active orderflow
that predicts the economy (CFNAI) and each specific sector’s active orderflow:

                        ( Net Orderflow   j ,t −1   − Passive Net Orderflow j ,t −1 )
                                              Capsector j ,t −1
where Net Orderflowj,t, Passive Net Orderflowj,t , Capsectorj,t represent the actual net orderflow,
the passive net orderflow, the capitalization of sector j over month t. We compute the passive net
orderflow for sector j as the total net orderflow to the stock market multiplied by the weight of
sector j in the market portfolio. *, **, *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level,
respectively. At the bottom of each panel, we also report the R2 of the multivariate regression of
the expansion indicator on the active orderflow in all ten sectors that we use to obtain the best
linear combination. Sectors are grouped by cyclicality as per the MSCI ranking in three broad
groups, pro-cyclical, neutral and counter-cyclical respectively.

          Relation between orderflow information within the economy and markets

This table shows the explanatory power of regressing future values of the CFNAI expansion
indicator, the stock market return, and the bond market return on the current value of the
dependent variable and a forecasting factor. The forecasting factor is a linear combination of
either active sector orderflows or excess sector returns. The loadings in the linear combination are
the ones with the maximal correlation with each of the dependent variables in turn.
We report only the adjusted-R2. *, **, *** denote a significant coefficient on the factor at the
10%, 5%, and 1% level, with White heteroschedastic consistent standard errors.

                    Relation between Expansions and past excess sector returns

This table contains the results of the following bivariate unconditional regression:

                      CFNAI t = α + β (Ret j ,t − Ret mkt ,t ) + φCFNAI t −1 + ε j ,t
where Retj,t represent the value-weighted return of sector j over month t, Retmkt,t represents the
value-weighted return on the stock market index, and CFNAI is the expansion indicator.
We report the R2 of the regressions together with R2ofl, which is the R2 of the large orderflow
regressions reported in Table 3. The excess return regressor is standardized.
*, **, *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level with White heteroschedastic
consistent standard errors. Sectors are grouped by cyclicality as per the MSCI ranking in three
broad groups, pro-cyclical, neutral and counter-cyclical respectively.

Orderflowj,t, Passive Net Orderflowj,t , Capsectorj,t represent the actual net orderflow, the passive
net orderflow, the capitalization of sector j over month t. We compute the passive net orderflow
for sector j as the total net orderflow to the stock market multiplied by the weight of sector j in the
market portfolio.
The regression is estimated conditional on low or high dispersion of orderflow within sectors. We
measure dispersion as the standard deviation of active flows within each sector. We aggregate
dispersion at the market level using either the market capitalization of each sector (σ1) or the
absolute value of the correlations reported in Table 4 and normalized to sum up to one (σ2). In a
given month, dispersion is high (low) when the standard deviation is above (below) its median in
the last 12 months.

where Net Orderflowj,t, and Passive Net Orderflowj,t , represent the actual net orderflow and the
passive net orderflow, within sector j over quarter t. We compute the passive net orderflow for
sector j as the total net orderflow to the stock market multiplied by the weight of sector j in the

where Net Flowj,t, and Passive Net Flowj,t , represent the actual flow and the passive flow, within
sector j over quarter t in the mutual fund category L. We compute the passive net flow for sector
j in mutual fund category L as the total flows to the category L multiplied by the weight of sector
j in the market. *, **, *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level. The Core
investment objective represents a blend of the value and growth styles, while the S&P investment
objective represents the passive style of replicating the S&P 500 index. Sectors are grouped by
