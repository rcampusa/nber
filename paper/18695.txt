This paper explores the relationship between education and the evolution of wealth after retirement.
Asset growth following retirement depends in part on health capital and financial capital accumulated
prior to retirement, which in turn are strongly related to educational attainment. These “initial conditions”
for retirement can have a lingering effect on subsequent asset evolution. Our aim is to disentangle
the effects of education on post-retirement asset evolution that operate through health and financial
capital accumulated prior to retirement from the effects of education that impinge directly on asset
evolution after retirement. We consider the indirect effect of education through financial resources—in
particular Social Security benefits and defined benefit pension benefits—and through health capital
that was accumulated before retirement. We also consider the direct effect of education on asset growth
following retirement, emphasizing the correlation between education and the returns households earn
on their post-retirement investments. Households with different levels of education invest, on average,
in different assets, and they may consequently earn different rates of return. Finally, we consider the
additional effects of education that are not captured through these pathways. Our empirical findings
suggest a substantial association between education and the evolution of assets. For example, for two
person households the growth of assets between 1998 and 2008 is on average much greater for college
graduates than for those with less than a high school degree. This difference ranges from about $82,000
in the lowest asset quintile to over $600,000 in the highest.

        A large literature on the relationship between education, earnings, and the
accumulation of wealth has developed over many decades. Most of this research
has focused on how education affects earnings and the process of wealth
accumulation during the working career. In this paper our goal is to understand
the relationship between education and the evolution of assets after retirement.
The education-wealth relationship after retirement may differ from that before
retirement because many of the wealth-building mechanisms that operate at
earlier ages are different from those at younger ages. Earnings are lower, or
non-existent, in retirement, and income streams from Social Security and defined
benefit (DB) pension plans are largely determined by pre-retirement earnings.
These income streams also exhibit less cross-sectional variation than pre-
retirement earnings.

        We consider first how education affects the level of financial resources
and health capital that are acquired prior to retirement. Wealth, health, Social
Security benefits, DB pension benefits, and earnings potential are established by
retirement and are related to the future evolution of assets. In particular, lifetime
levels of real Social Security and DB benefits are fixed at retirement. We begin
our analysis by estimating the relationship between these financial resource and
health variables at the start of retirement and the subsequent evolution of assets.
These variables are strongly related to education. For example, education
exhibits a strong correlation with pre-retirement earnings which in turn determine
Social Security benefits at retirement. The level of real Social Security benefits
will affect asset spend-down decisions after retirement. We consider the
accumulation of financial resources and health capital at retirement as one of the
pathways through which education can indirectly affect post-retirement asset
evolution.

       A positive correlation between health and wealth accumulation has been
documented by Smith (1999, 2004), Lee and Kim (2008), Michaud and van Soest
(2008), and Coile and Milligan (2010). Recent surveys include Grossman (2006)
and Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2008). In Poterba, Venti, and Wise (hereafter
PVW) (2010a) we suggest that the "asset cost of poor health," the divergence
between the path of assets for households in good and in poor health, exceeds
the direct costs of medical care.

       Many previous studies have tried to understand the mechanism by which
education affects health, to measure education-related health inequalities, and to
determine whether causality runs from education to health or from health to
education. The proposition that education has causal effects on health has been
buttressed by a large body of recent work that employs instrumental variable
techniques to identify these effects, including Adams (2002), Lleras-Muney
(2005), Oreopolous (2006), Silles (2009), Clark and Royer (2010), Fonseca and
Zheng (2011), and Kemptner, Jurges and Reinhold (2011). There is also a
growing body of work suggesting that health affects education. At young ages,
shocks to health can affect educational attainment. Strauss and Thomas (1998)
                                                2


survey the early literature; more recent contributions include Behrman and
Rosenzwieg (2004) , Case, Fertig and Paxson (2005), and Currie, Stabile,
Manivong and Roos (2010). The effect of health on formal education at older
ages is less apparent, although poor health may impede informal learning,
financial literacy, and cognitive skills.

        Education may also influence the types of assets people invest in through
its effects on risk-taking, financial literacy, and development of cognitive skills.
McArdle, Smith and Willis (2009) explore the link between cognitive skills and the
composition of wealth. Haliassos and Bertaut (1995), Bertaut and Starr-McCluer
(2001), and Campbell (2006) show that more educated investors are more likely
to own stocks. Ehrlich, Hamlen, and Yin (2008) find a correlation between a
household's education level and the portfolio share allocated to risky assets.
They also find that more educated households earn higher returns.

       We divide our analysis of the links between education and the late-life
accumulation of assets into five parts, corresponding to sections of this paper.
Section 1 presents the data that we analyze. The measurement of health and
the development of the health index that plays a central role in our analysis are
explained in section 2. Section 3 introduces descriptive data that motivates the
estimation approach. The results are presented in section 4. Section 5
summarizes and concludes.

1. Data

       The analysis is based on data from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). The HRS is a longitudinal survey that resurveys respondents every two
years. The current HRS is comprised of five entry cohorts. The original HRS
cohort surveyed respondents age 51 to 61 in 1992 and the Asset and Health
Dynamics of the Older Old (AHEAD) cohort surveyed respondents age 70 and
older in 1993. Subsequent cohorts include the War Babies (WB) cohort, first
surveyed in 1998 when respondents were between the ages of 51 and 56, the
Children of Depression (CODA) cohort that was first surveyed in 1998 when
respondents were between ages 68 and 74, and the Early Baby Boomers (EBB)
cohort that includes respondents aged 51 to 56 in 2004. All cohorts were
surveyed every second year through 2008, which covers nine waves for the HRS
cohort, eight waves for the AHEAD cohort, six waves for the CODA cohort.1 All
three cohorts were well into retirement by 2008. The members of the HRS were
age 69 to 79, members of AHEAD age 87 to 97, and members of the CODA
were age 78 to 84 in that year.


1
  We do not use the data for the first wave (1993) of the AHEAD for two reasons. First, as
Rohwedder, Haider, and Hurd (2006) explain, financial assets were under-reported in AHEAD in
that year. Second, a series of questions on functional limitations that are used to construct the
health index were not asked in the 1993 wave.
                                         3


       The HRS is well-suited to the present analysis for several reasons. It
provides detailed information on health conditions. The health variables used in
our analysis are described in Section 2. The HRS also provides detailed
information on assets and on income sources including Social Security benefits
and defined benefit pension income. We construct a measure of total non-
annuity wealth from respondent reports of holdings of home equity, other real
estate, financial assets, business assets, and personal retirement accounts such
as IRAs and Keoghs. All asset and income values have been converted to 2008
dollars using the CPI-U.

        As explained in PVW (2010b) and Venti (2011), the HRS data on 401(k)
plan balances is incomplete. In addition, there is measurement error in the HRS
wealth data. Venti (2011) shows that these data errors typically arise because
either asset ownership is misreported or the value of an asset is misreported.
The consequences of these data errors can be quite severe in longitudinal
analyses when the wave-to-wave change in wealth is of interest. For this reason
we have taken steps to minimize the impact of potential data errors, including
"trimming" the data before calculating mean values. These steps are explained
in later sections.

2. The Measurement of Health Status

       Our analysis depends critically on measuring health status, which we do
with a health index that is based on respondent-reported health diagnoses,
functional limitations, medical care usage, and other indicators of health
contained in the HRS. We use responses to the 27 questions that are shown in
Table 2-1, and obtain the first principal component of these indicators of health
status. The first principal component is the weighted average of the health
indicators where the weights are chosen to maximize the proportion of the
variance of the individual health indicators that can be explained by this weighted
average. The variables in the table are ordered by the principal component
loadings.

       We have constructed similar health indices based on the first principal
component of the HRS responses in our prior research, summarized in PVW
(2010a, b). In those analyses we constructed a separate index for each wave of
the HRS. The index for a particular wave used information from both that wave
and all previous waves. Thus, for example, the health index in the fifth wave
depended on whether a respondent reported difficulty with an ADL in the first
through fifth waves. In our current analysis, the health status index for a
particular wave depends only on information provided in that wave. Also, in
previous analyses we estimated separate principal component models for each
wave. The estimated coefficients were very similar across waves, so in this
analysis, we estimate a single principal component equation by pooling all
respondents -- men and women -- from all of the waves. The estimated loadings
                                       4


for men and women were very similar when we estimated them separately, so
we have combined them for our analysis.

       component loadings)

       Ever experience cancer                          0.058

       We use data from all five HRS cohorts spanning the years 1992 to 2008 to
estimate the principal component index. The estimated coefficients are used to
predict a "raw" health score for each respondent. For presentation purposes we
convert these raw scores into percentile scores for each respondent at each age.
We assign each person in a two-person household the minimum percentile score
in the household because household health expenditures are likely to depend on
                                          5


the health of the partner in poorest health. In PVW (2010a,b) we used the
average of the health of the two partners.

         The health status index that we use in the regression analysis that we
present later in this paper is a cardinal measure. It has several important
properties. 1) It is strongly related to the evolution of assets, as shown in Figure
3-1 in the next section. 2) It is strongly related to mortality. The upper left panel
of Figure 2-1 shows the relationship between the health index in 1992 and
mortality in 2008 for members of the HRS cohort. Among those in the poorest
health in 1992, approximately 46 percent are deceased by 2008. Among
persons in the best health only about 10 percent are deceased by 2008. 3) It is
strongly predictive of future health events such as stroke and the onset of
diabetes, as is also shown in the remaining panels of Figure 2-1. The index
value in 1992, however, has little predictive power for future episodes of cancer.
4) It is strongly related to economic outcomes prior to 1992, such as earnings,
and to economic outcomes in later years.

         The health status index can be also be used to show the very strong
persistence of health. Figure 2-2, which is drawn from Poterba, Venti, and Wise
(2011), shows the average health percentile of HRS respondents at each age -
this is the heavy blue line with round markers. This average health trajectory
reflects the offsetting effects of two forces. First, average health declines as
people age. Most survey respondents report more health problems, and more
limitations, as they age. Second, however, there is a selection effect (in the
opposite direction) in moving from one HRS wave to the next: those in better
health are more likely to survive from year to year. This may in part be due to
underlying heterogeneity, and in part due to greater investment in life-extension
by wealthy households, as described in Ehrlich (2000). This selection effect is
illustrated by the other curves in Figure 2-2. These show the average health in
prior ages of those who survived until at least age 70, age 80 and age 90. At
each age those who survive longer are in better health. Those who survived until
80 had much better average health at age 65 than those who survived until 70.
The health at age 75 of the persons who survive until 90 was, on average, much
higher than the health of all those who survived until 80.

       To set the stage for analysis presented below, we show the trajectory of
health status by health quintile in 1992. On average, those who approach
retirement in good health experience a decline in health status over time. For
those who begin with the worst health and survive in subsequent years their
health remains roughly constant over time. Mortality is much greater for persons
in the poorest health quintile in 1992, so that those who remain in subsequent
years may be a highly select group of the least healthy 1992 respondents.

3. Descriptive Data

        In earlier papers, notably PVW (2010b, 2011), we explored the strong
relationship between health and the evolution of assets. We focused on wealth
at the beginning and end of each two-year interval between survey waves. For
example, we followed persons aged 51 to 61 in 1992, and 53 to 63 in 1994,
through ages 67 to 77 in 2008. We described the evolution of assets for eight
two-year intervals between 1992 and 2008. Throughout our analysis the unit of
observation was the person. For married households we included both partners
(separately) in the analysis, but we associated household assets with each
person. Finally, we classified each person in the survey as belonging to one of
four possible family status groups defined by marital status at the beginning and
end of the two-year interval. The groups are "continuously two-person" (married
at both the beginning and end of the interval, but not necessarily to the same
person), "continuously one-person" (single at both the beginning and end of the
                                             9


interval), transiting from a one-person household to a two-person household
through marriage, and transiting from a two-person to a one-person household
through divorce or death of a spouse. This analysis considers only the first two
family status groups, which are the largest ones across all age categories.

        Figure 3-1 is taken from PVW (2011). It describes the change in assets
between waves of the HRS by quintiles of the health index in 1992. The figure
pertains to two-person households who were aged 51 to 61 in 1992. The level of
assets at the beginning and end of each interval are predicted based on the
health index described above. The figure illustrates the relationship between
health and wealth. Households in better health have substantially higher levels
of wealth than households in poorer health. In addition, however, the evolution of
assets is different for healthier and less healthy households: assets grow for
healthy households, while they are stable or declining for others. Conditional on
surviving until 2008, the increase in assets between 1992 and 2008 was about
$632,000 (or 6.5 percent per year) for those in the top health quintile but only
$161,000 (or 4.8 percent per year) for those in the bottom health quintile, as
indicated by the dashed lines in the figure. Analysis of changing wealth levels
over time is potentially confounded by survivor bias, the tendency of households
with greater wealth to live longer than those with lower wealth levels. By
stratifying households based on initial health status, we try to attenuate this bias.

4. Results
                                        10


       As explained in the introduction, our goal is to understand the relationship
between education and the evolution of assets after retirement. We distinguish
two types of pathways through which education may matter. The first type
involves effects of education on variables that are determined by pre-retirement
behavior, and that are fixed at retirement and at subsequent ages. Examples of
such pathways are effects on wealth and health at retirement, Social Security
benefits, and defined benefit pension benefits. We label variables such as the
level of Social Security benefits "pathway variables" to denote their role as links
between education and circumstances at the time of retirement.

        The second type of pathway involves an effect of education on the change
in financial and health circumstances after retirement For example, the level of
education may be associated with the change in health after retirement, which in
turn affects spending needs and opportunities to earn income, or it might be
associated with asset allocation patterns that directly affect wealth evolution.

       To distinguish between the effects of education on post-retirement asset
evolution that operate through these two types of pathways, we begin by
estimating the effect of various "pathway variables" on the evolution of assets.
Then we estimate the association between education and each of these
variables, which allows us to compute the partial effect of education through each
of these pathways. After estimating each of these pathway effects, we compute
the component of asset evolution that cannot be explained by the effect of
education operating through these pathways, and we then relate this "residual" to
education as well. We interpret this last effect as an additional general effect of
education on post-retirement asset evolution.

       The dependent variable in our analysis is the level of household assets in
a survey wave, Aw, where w denotes the survey wave. To frame our empirical
specification, it is helpful to consider the standard inter-temporal budget
constraint for the evolution of assets:

(1)   Aw = (1+r)Aw-1 + aw + ew - cw

where r denotes the return on assets between waves w-1 and w, aw and ew are
annuity income and earned income respectively, and cw denotes consumption.
Education can affect the level of assets by affecting annuity income, earned
income, consumption, the rate of return, or the household's level of assets in the
previous year. The consumption effect, in turn, could arise from a number of
sources, as education might be linked to an individual's time preference rate, to
spending on medical care or health-promoting activities, or to other components
of consumption. We do not have data on consumption outlays, so we cannot
estimate the effect of education on the consumption channel directly. We
therefore study how a number of variables that may affect both health spending
and other consumption spending are related to the level of household assets. It
is important to recognize that one of the ways variables such as health status
                                          11


may affect the evolution of assets is through their impact on spending. In the
framework of equation (1), out-of-pocket spending on medical care would be
included with other consumption goods and would reduce asset accumulation.

       We explain below how we estimate r for each person in our sample.
Given this r̂ , we calculate the value rA
                                       ˆ w1 , which we think of as the estimated
potential investment return at wave w, in dollars, on assets held in wave w-1.
This return, which may include unrealized capital gains, along with annuity
income from various sources and earnings if the household is still working, can
be spent or saved. The evolution of assets is determined by the difference
between these income flows and spending, which is likely to be a function of
health status as well as a number of other factors.

       We estimate the relationship between assets in wave w and a set of
"pathway variables" that capture some of the channels through which education
can affect asset accumulation: assets in w-1, health status, Social Security
income, DB annuity income, earned income, as well as other variables. The
specification is given by:

(2) Aw = k + λ*Aw-1 +γ* rA
                        ˆ w1 +α*Hw-1 + β*∆Hw.w-1 + a*SSw + b*DBw + c*Earnw + m*Mw + εw

The coefficient  can be thought of as the marginal rate of saving out of the wave-
to-wave investment return. H w1 and H w, w1 denote the level of health in the
previous wave and the change in health since the last wave respectively. Higher
levels of H and H are expected to reduce the need to rely on assets to finance
health care needs and thus are likely to be associated with a positive change in
assets. Higher levels of Social Security benefits, DB annuity income, and earned
income are also expected to be positively associated with asset change. The
assumption is that persons with greater income can cover the cost of health-
related and other expenses with less need to draw down their accumulated
assets. M is an indicator of expected lifespan, which we discuss below, and  w is
an error term.

        We can calculate the effect of education through each pathway variable as
the product of the estimated coefficient and the change in the pathway variable
associated with education. For example, the effect of education on assets
through Social Security benefits is the product of the effect of Social Security
benefits on assets (dAw/dSS, or the estimated coefficient a ) and a measure of
how Social Security benefits vary by level of education. We describe the latter
part of this calculation in more detail below. The total effect of education on
assets is the sum of the effects through each of the pathway variables:
                                         12

                            
              dSS dE dDB dE dEearn dE
       Education may affect asset accumulation in retirement through each of the
pathway variables in equation (2). We want to distinguish the effect of education
through circumstances that are given at the time of retirement from the further
effect of education through circumstances that change after retirement. For
example, Social Security benefits and DB pension benefits are determined at
retirement. Both are related to education because education affects earnings
over working years, and possibly the age at which the individual claims benefits.
These factors in turn determine Social Security and DB pension benefits. But the
level of education has no further effect on the level of Social Security or DB
benefits once a person has retired.

        Still other effects of education operate through financial or health capital
that are given at retirement but continue to evolve after retirement. Consider the
role of health capital. Persons enter retirement with a given level of health, but
health also evolves after retirement. The coefficient  in (2) captures the effect of
the post-retirement level of health, H w1 in wave w  1 , on the level of assets in
wave w . We can, in principle, decompose H w1 into two components: the level of
health at retirement and the sum of changes to health after retirement.
Education may influence the level of assets in wave w through either component.
Our estimates allow for both the stock of health, and the change in health, to
affect asset accumulation. Similarly, the post-retirement evolution of the level of
assets may be determined in large part by the level of assets at retirement—
which is related to education—as well as by the further effect of education on the
change in the level of assets after retirement.

       We present estimates of (2) in section 4-4 below. We find, however that
the effect of education is not fully captured by the various "pathway effects" that
we have described above. We demonstrate this by regressing the residuals from
the specification in equation (2) on levels of education. The estimates reveal that
education has substantial further effect on the evolution of assets, suggesting
that there may be additional pathways that we have not identified.

      To recognize the additional effect of education, the effect that is not
captured by our pathways, we also tried adding the level of education directly to
equation (2). We find that the estimated coefficient on education is substantial
and statistically significant, and we also discover that including education in (2)
                                         13


reduces the absolute value of the estimated coefficients on most of the "pathway
variables." This finding raises the question of whether we should estimate the
pathway effects using the coefficient estimates from (2), which excludes
education, or the expanded specification that includes education. If educational
attainment has a direct effect on assets that is not captured by any of our
pathways, then the coefficient estimates on the included pathway variables will,
through a standard left-out-variable-error analysis, be biased because they will
reflect some of the direct effect of education. If, however, we have omitted some
pathways that may be largely determined by the date of retirement, or if there is
measurement error in some of the pathway variables, then these pre-retirement
effects will in part be captured by the education variable in the expanded
equation (2). This could lead to biased estimates of the post-retirement role of
education. We do not believe that our specification has captured all possible
pathways linking education to post-retirement asset holdings, so we therefore
follow the first strategy. We compare the two strategies below.

        We present the details of our analysis in five stages. First, we consider
the relationship between education and the level of health at retirement and the
relationship between education and the post-retirement changes in health. We
later use these findings in conjunction with the estimated coefficients on H and
 H in equation (2) to assess the effect of education through the health pathway.
Second, we consider the relationship between education and the types of assets
held in household portfolios, the implications for the potential differences in
expected returns across education levels, and the magnitude of the implied
potential differences in returns. These estimates provide the values for r̂ in rA
                                                                                ˆ w1
in equation (2). Third we present estimates of the effect of health and income on
asset evolution—equation (2). Fourth, we use these estimated coefficients to
estimate the effect of education on assets through each of the pathways. Finally,
we explore the further effect of education not captured by these pathways by
estimating the relationship between the education variables and the residuals
from equation (2). To simplify the presentation, we show detailed results only for
persons in two-person households.

       4.1 Education and the Trajectory of Health. We begin our analysis by
describing the relationship between educational attainment and the trajectory of
health status at older ages. This relationship is a key input to our assessment of
how education affects late-life asset evolution through the health pathway.
Consider first the wave-to-wave change in health of the HRS cohort respondents,
shown in Figure 4-1. The figure resembles Figure 3-1 above, but pertains to
health rather than assets. For example, for persons in the sample in 1992 and
1994, the average health percentile declines from 65.8 to 58.8 between these
two years. Health also declines within each of the subsequent intervals. The
figure also reveals another important feature of the data. It is important to
distinguish between the wave-to-wave changes in health shown by the line
segments in the figure and the effect of differential mortality indicated by the
"gaps" between segments. For example, persons present in both the 1992 and
                                                 14


1994 waves had mean health of 58.8 in 1994, but persons who were also
present in both the 1994 and 1996 waves had mean health of 59.1 in 1994. The
difference between 58.8 and 59.1 is the mortality selection effect—persons who
survived through 1996 had better health in 1994 than persons who were alive in
1994 but did not survive through the next wave. The mortality selection effect
between the end of one segment and the beginning of the next segment is
evident for each of the adjacent segments.

       Our interest is in how these health trajectories differ by level of education.
We show the data for three HRS cohorts. Figure 4-2a shows the within-interval
changes in health by education group for the original HRS cohort age 51 to 61 in
1992. There are two important features of the data. First, when first observed in
1992, the differences in health by education group are very large. The mean
health percentile in 1992 is 75.8 for persons with a college degree, 69.8 for those
with some college, 65.3 for persons with a high school degree, and 54.3 for
persons with less than a high school degree. The difference between the highest
and lowest levels of education is 21.5 percentile points. The difference in 2008 is
18.8. The key conclusion is that the level of health in subsequent years is largely
determined by the level of health when first observed in 1992. Over time, health
declines by approximately the same amount (in percentiles) for persons at all
levels of education. This suggests that there is little effect of education on the
change in health after 1992, the first year members of this cohort were observed.

        More formal estimates of the wave-to-wave changes in health are
presented below; they show that post-retirement wave-to-wave changes in health
are essentially unrelated to education. But the levels of health are strongly
related to the level of health when a person is first observed, in particular at the
age of retirement as we see more clearly in the figures for other cohorts.

        Comparable results for the AHEAD cohort are shown in Figure 4-2b. This
figure uses persons in the AHEAD cohort who were age 72 to 82 in 1995. Data
for the AHEAD cohort were first collected in 1993 but, as noted above, there is
insufficient data to construct a health index for 1993 and thus the data shown in
the figure begin in 1995. Again there are large differences in health by education
when respondents are first observed in 1995. The mean health percentile
ranges from 52.8 for the college educated to a low of 38.9 for those with less
than a high school degree. Again, the health trajectory in subsequent years
shows only a limited relationship to education. The range narrows somewhat by
2008 when this cohort is age 83 to 93; at this age the range in mean health is
from 34.3 for the most educated to 25.9 for the least educated.

        Figure 4-2c shows data for persons who were 65 to 75 in 1998. This
group is primarily composed of persons from the CODA cohort (the youngest
member of this cohort was age 68 in 1998), but also includes some older
members of the HRS cohort. Again there are large differences in health in
1998—the mean health percentile is 58.4 for persons with college or more but
only 40.8 for those with less than a high school degree—but the subsequent
within-interval trajectories of health seem to differ only slightly by education
group.

       Figure 4-2d shows the trajectories for all three cohorts on the same figure.
The figure reveals two features of the data. First, for the HRS and CODA cohorts
the spread in health by education does not change much with age (as shown
above), but the spread in health by education level tends to decline with age for
the older AHEAD households. Second, the cohort effects in health appear to be
small. For example, health at each level of education in the AHEAD cohort that
attained ages 72 to 82 in 1995 seems very similar to the pattern for persons in
the CODA cohort that attained ages 71 to 81 nine years later in 2004 (circled in
the figure). Similarly, the pattern by education for persons in the HRS cohort that
attained ages 67 to 79 in 2006 is very similar to the pattern for persons in the
CODA-HRS cohort that attained ages 66 to 77 eight years earlier in 2000 (shown
by the rectangle in the figure).

      The figures above show large differences in health between high and low
education groups in initial assets, but the slopes for the education groups are
                                                18


similar in subsequent years. Table 4-1 shows the mean wave-to-wave change in
health by education group and by lagged asset quintile (the quintile of assets in
the beginning year of each wave-to-wave change) for married persons. The
breakdown by asset quintile will be useful for calculations later in this section.
Separate estimates are presented for the three cohorts shown in Figure 4-2d as
well as for all persons who were age 65 or older in 19982. As the figures
suggested, there is no strong pattern associated with education. It does appear
that the wave-to-wave changes are slightly more negative for persons in the
highest lagged asset quintile, probably because persons in this quintile have the
highest initial health. All but one estimate in Table 4-1 is statistically different
from zero; the lone exception is for persons with less than a high school degree
in the fifth asset quintile in the CODA cohort. We cannot reject the null
hypothesis that the estimated effect for the fifth quintile equals that for the first
quintile in any of the sixteen cases comparisons that can be made.

        4.2 Education and the Return on Assets. We now consider the
relationship between education and portfolio allocation choices. We also explore
how rates of return on total assets differ by education and we calculate how the
expected dollar return on assets differs by education. These relationships
highlight a second pathway through which education might affect the evolution of
assets: households with different levels of education may make different financial
decisions. Our analysis treats these differences as an effect of educational
differences, although we recognize that both education choices and portfolio
choices could be the result of underlying third factors.

       Households with different education levels may make different portfolio
choices and they may also earn different rates of return on the assets they invest
in. While most analyses of household portfolio behavior assume that returns by
asset classes are the same for all investors, we consider the possibility that
education is related to those returns, either because more educated investors
choose investments with, on average, a lower expense ratio, or because they
choose different investments within an asset class. We first focus on how
holdings of stocks, bonds, housing and other assets differ by education, and then
explore the implications of these differences for expected returns on household
wealth. This is another instance in which it is difficult to determine how much of
the observed difference in post-retirement returns by education level is due to the
level and allocation of assets at retirement and how much might be due to the
change in allocation after retirement.

      The return on a portfolio is a weighted average of the returns on
                                         N

Aa / A are the dollar weighted portfolio shares and the return on asset a is
indicated by ra . For most assets both the portfolio share and the return are
related to a household's level of education.

        The portfolio shares for two-person households are shown in Table 4-2 for
four education groups. The estimates are for all persons over the age of 65 in
2008. In results not reported here, we disaggregated the population into those
with and without earned income; the results were similar for the two groups. The
first four columns show mean assets in each asset category and the next four
columns show portfolio shares. The top panel of the table shows shares for eight
broad asset categories. The first four columns show large differences in asset
holdings by education group. Total assets range from $344,000 for the lowest
education group to over 1,490,000 for persons in two-person households with a
college degree or more. The medians (not reported in the table) range from
                                                   20


$132,000 to $763,000. There are also striking differences in portfolio allocations
by education. Married persons with a college degree or more hold 20 percent of
their wealth in personal retirement accounts (IRAs, Keoghs and 401(k)s) and
another 34 percent in financial assets outside these accounts. Over half of their
portfolio is in these financial instruments. Married persons with less than a high
school degree have a combined 28 percent of assets in these same financial
instruments. On the other hand, married persons with more education have a
much smaller proportion of their portfolios invested in their primary residence,
26.5 percent for persons with a college degree or more and 35.4 percent for
persons with a high school degree or less.3

        To some extent the variation in portfolio shares reflects the wealth
elasticity of demand for assets held in various ways - and for different types of
assets. Since households with less education are likely to accumulate less
lifetime wealth, and households tend to invest first in owner-occupied housing,
then in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, and finally in other financial assets.

  There is one observation in the "less than high school" education group with other real estate
reported to be $15,000,000. If this observation is deleted the percentage of total assets held in
other real estate falls from 23.88 percent to 9.93 percent.

return) equities than those with less than a high school degree—55.0 percent
versus 31.6 percent—and much less in low-return checking accounts and CDs—
22.0 percent versus 47.8 percent.4 These results are consistent with Ehrlich,
Hamlen, and Yin's (2008) findings on the holdings of risky assets by different
educational groups. The data in the bottom panel of Table 4-2 only pertain to
financial assets held outside of personal retirement accounts. It is likely that
more highly educated persons also hold higher proportions of equities within
these accounts. Unfortunately detailed data are not available to make these
calculations.5

        The data in Table 4-2 show that the principal asset of many households is
home equity, although more highly educated persons hold proportionately less
home equity than persons with less education. We next investigate the wave to
wave evolution of home equity by education level. We restrict our analysis to
homeowners who do not move between waves. This excludes approximately 19
percent of the sample. Given this restriction, changes in home equity from one
wave to the next reflect the change in the value of the home as well as the
change in the amount of outstanding mortgage debt. Thus a household could
display a large increase in home equity between waves if there was a sharp rise
in the value of its home, with little or no change in mortgage indebtedness, or if it
repaid mortgage debt, even if house prices remained the same. Educational
attainment may be correlated with both the rate at which house value changes, if
households with different educational backgrounds on average live in different
communities that face different economic conditions, or if they buy different types
of homes, or borrow against their homes at different rates, or repay their
mortgage debts at different rates in late life. One issue that we cannot address,
given our data span of less than two decades, is whether differences in housing
wealth accumulation patterns across education groups is a general finding, or
just a pattern that emerges in the particular time period that we observe.

      We report wave-to-wave changes in home equity for all persons who do
not move between waves in Table 4-3 for two education levels (less than high
school and college or more) and in Appendix Table 1 for all four education levels.
These results suggest that growth in home equity is very strongly related to

  The definitions for financial asset categories in this table are:
Bonds: corporate, municipal, government or foreign bonds, or bond funds
Stocks: shares of stock or stock mutual funds
Checking: checking accounts, saving accounts or money market funds
CDs: CDs, government savings bonds, or Treasury Bills
Other: other savings or assets, such as jewelry, money owed to you by others, a collection for
investment purposes, rights in a trust or estate where you are the beneficiary, or an annuity that
you haven't already told us about.

 The HRS does ask what percent of personal retirement account assets are invested in "stocks
or mutual funds"? Persons in all education categories report percents greater than 80 percent,
which may indicate that many respondents interpret this category to include more than just
equities.

education. In some years, particularly during periods of rising house prices, the
differences between education groups are substantial.

       The period that we examine includes a historic house price run-up, and it
may not provide a clear guide to the experience of future generations of older
households. The data suggest however that there may be important differences
in the way this house price boom—and the associated bust that began at the end
of our sample—affected households at different points in the education and
wealth distribution.

        Appendix Table 2 decomposes the change in mean home equity into the
change in home prices and the change in housing debt. The table shows that for
four of the five two-year intervals prior to 2006, the highest education group
repaid mortgage debt more quickly, or expanded mortgage debt more slowly,
than households in the lowest education group. The most recent period, 2006-
2008, which is characterized by more disparities in the housing market than
earlier periods, shows a sharp decline in mortgage debt for the lowest education

group. This may reflect an involuntary loss of mortgage debt, through
foreclosures, or it may reflect a tightening of lending to this group.

         One explanation for the findings in Table 4-3 is that more educated
households earn higher rates of pre-tax appreciation on their homes than do their
less-educated counterparts. There has been some tendency in the last decade
for cities with more educated workforces, "science and technology based cities,"
to fare better economically than cities that depended on traditional blue-collar
industries. The disparities in housing returns may reflect in part differences in
where households with different educational levels live.

        The disparity of rates of return might also apply to other asset categories,
in particular to financial assets. If more educated households have larger
account balances on average, they may have better access to lower-cost mutual
funds, or to other investment vehicles with lower management costs, than less
educated and (on average) less wealthy households. We do not have the data
we need to assess this issue for non-housing assets, because wave-to-wave
changes in these assets reflect buying and selling as well as pure investment
returns. Unlike housing, for which we can eliminate the effect of buying and
selling by restricting estimation to non-movers, the HRS does not include any
information that would let us identify "non-traders" in financial assets.

       While it is very difficult for us to determine whether households in higher
education categories earn higher (or lower) returns on various types of financial
assets than those in lower education tranches, we can use differences in the
average portfolio structure of households in different education groups, along
with data on the average returns to different asset classes, to estimate potential
differences in the expected portfolio returns for these groups. We can also do
such calculations using the actual returns on various asset categories in
particular years. While this is likely to be a noisy measure of the actual return for
any household, it provides some guidance on the return that the household may
have earned. It is important to note that the variation across households in the
returns earned on some asset categories, such as corporate stock, is likely to be
much greater than the variation in other asset categories, such as government
bonds.

       In the analysis below we assume that, with the exception of housing, all
education groups earn the same return on each asset. We use annual returns
obtained from Ibbotson (2010) as our return measures. We use the return on
large cap stocks to approximate the return on stocks and holdings of business
assets (assumed to be similar in risk to stocks). For bond holdings we use the
annual return on intermediate government bonds. For CDs and similar accounts
and for debt we use the three-month Treasury bill rate. For checking and similar
accounts we assume a zero rate of return. Other real estate is assumed to earn
the same return as housing. We also assume that investments in personal
retirement accounts are split evenly between stocks and bonds.
                                        24



       We can combine estimates of portfolio shares like those shown in Table 4-
2 (but estimated separately for each person and for each year) with estimates of
the mean return on housing by level of education shown in Table 4-3 and the
external return data for other asset components to estimate the total portfolio
return for each person. Table 4-4 shows the weighted average portfolio returns,
the product of the percent in each asset component and the return on each asset
component, by education group for married persons. On average the return for
married households with a college degree or more is about 2.7 times as large as
the return for those with less than a high school degree. However, the patterns
are quite different in the individual years. In the downturn of 2000-2002 portfolio
returns for the less educated exceeded returns for the highly educated who were
much more heavily invested in risky assets, particularly stocks.

       households age 65 and over

        Using the rate of return estimates, we compute the total dollar return from
asset holding—essentially the percentage return between waves w-1 and w,
times the stock of assets reported in wave w-1—for each household. More
specifically, for each household and for each asset we multiply the dollar value of
holdings in the asset in wave w-1 by the measured rate of return on that asset
between w-1 and w. This yields the potential income from holding that particular
asset. Then, for each household, we sum over all asset classes to obtain total
dollar return from all asset holdings. Note that the use of actual dollar value
holdings of each asset preserves the variation by education level in portfolio
shares shown in Table 4-2. For example, among persons with the same total
assets, those with higher levels of education will have larger dollar investments in
stocks than persons with less education. The calculation uses the mean returns
on housing, which also vary by education level, as shown in Table 4-3. However,
for the return on other assets we use average rates of return from external
sources that do not vary by education level.

       These investment gains are shown in Table 4-5 for each wave-to-wave
interval and for all years combined for married persons, in 2008 dollars. Separate
estimates are shown for each education group and for each quintile of the
                                         25


distribution of lagged assets At 1 . By presenting separate estimates by lagged
asset quintile, we are able to show that even among persons who begin with the
same initial At 1 , those with more education earn higher returns. The last column
shows the difference between the highest and lowest education groups.

        Averaged over all years (bottom panel), the education effect (the
difference between the potential investment gain of persons with a college
degree or more and persons with less than a high school degree) ranges from
$5,842 for persons in the lowest asset quintile to $146,017 for persons in the
highest asset quintile. In other words, among persons in the same initial quintile
of the wealth distribution, those with higher levels of education receive
investment "income" that is two (in the top quintile) to nearly three (in the bottom
quintile) times as large as the investment "income" experienced by persons with
the lowest levels of education. We place "income" in quotations because it
includes both cash income, the interest on bonds and bank accounts and the
dividends paid on corporate stock, as well as capital gains on housing and on
financial assets.

       There is considerable wave-to-wave variation in the estimated effect of
education. In particular, between 2000 and 2002 when equity markets performed
poorly, the education effects are relatively small. In periods of high returns on
high-risk assets, such as 1998 to 2000, the education effects are substantial.

       4.3 The Effects of Asset Levels, Health, and Income on the Evolution of
Assets. The next step in our analysis is to estimate equation (2) above so that
we can calculate the effect of education on the level of assets through each of
the "pathway variables."

        We obtain separate estimates for each quintile of Aw-1 (lagged assets).
We do this because the effects estimated in this model are specified in levels.
Thus, for example we expect the effect of a unit change in health to have a larger
effect on a person with large assets than on a person with low levels of assets.
Because the specification includes the level of assets in wave w on the left side
and the level of assets in wave w-1 on the right side, the estimated effects will be
very sensitive to reporting errors in either wave w-1 or w. To minimize the effect
of reporting errors we "trim" the top and bottom one percent of the change in
assets between wave w-1 and wave w. We also eliminate all households with
lagged assets less than $1,000. This excludes slightly less than 4 percent of the
sample. The results are shown in Table 4-6. The sample used to produce this
table includes multiple observations on the same individual. We compute robust
standard errors, and thus t-statistics, for this and subsequent tables to adjust for
the possible correlation of unobserved individual effects.

        There are several noticeable features of the results. First, as anticipated,
assets in wave w are strongly related to assets in wave w-1 (lagged assets). In
addition, with the exception of the fifth quintile, assets are importantly related to
the expected income from lagged assets rA    ˆ w1 . The coefficients on this variable
might be interpreted as the marginal propensity to save out of potential income
from assets, with the marginal propensity declining with asset quintile. The
estimated coefficients for the first and the second quintiles, however, are greater
than one, although we do not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient equals
one in either case. The decline in the estimated coefficients with quintile may
reflect differences in the composition of wealth across quintiles, as well as in the
signal-to-noise ratio in our estimate of the return to asset holdings. Most of the
wealth of the first four quintiles is housing equity which may be difficult to convert
to consumption in the short run, even with the availability of home equity loans.
On the other hand, much of the wealth of persons in the top quintile is in financial
assets which may be much easier to turn into cash for consumption. Even more
importantly, there are likely to be larger differences across households in the
particular composition of financial wealth than in housing wealth. Within
"corporate stock," for example, there may be large differences in the ex post
return to different households—even if their ex ante holdings have the same
value. We were also concerned that the estimates for the 5th quintile could be
importantly affected by asset reporting errors—persons with transitorily high Aw-1
are more likely to be in this quintile and are also more likely to experience
negative asset growth between waves w-1 and w. However, median regression
estimates are essentially the same as those reported in the table.

        In our specification, there are two ways that assets in the prior wave can
affect assets in wave w. The first is the direct effect of lagged assets; the other is
the effect through the expected return on lagged assets. That is, the effect of
lagged assets depends not only on the level of the assets but also on the
expected return on these assets. The total effect of the level of prior period
assets is given by the direct effect of prior period assets plus the effect of the
expected gain on the prior period assets times the rate of return on these assets,
  Aw1   rA
            ˆ w1  (   rˆ) Aw1 . Using the estimates for  ,  , and the predicted
value of r̂ for each person, we have calculated the combined coefficient on
lagged assets. The combined coefficients are shown in Table 4-7 by asset
quintile and by education level. With the exception of the second quintile the
combined coefficients on lagged assets do not differ greatly by quintile or by
education level.

        Second, prior assets can affect current assets through variation by asset
level in the estimated effects of health and annuity income, and earned income,
on asset accumulation. Each of these effects tends to increase with asset
quintile, particularly for married households. One more dollar of income from
these sources is associated with a larger wave-to-wave increase in assets for
those with higher initial asset holdings. The coefficients on these income flows in
some cases are greater than unity, which suggests that they may be proxying for
other sources of income as well. In addition, if the income in wave w is thought
of as “lifetime” income that can be counted on until death—Social Security
income in particular—the effect on asset withdrawal in wave w could be larger
than income in wave w. A dollar for life is worth more than a dollar for a year.

        The estimates for lagged health, the change in health, Social Security
income, and DB income are graphed in Figures 4-3a and 4-3b. In each case with
minor exceptions, the estimated effects tend to increase with asset quintile; in
each, the estimated effect in the 5th quintile is much greater than the estimated
effect in the 1st quintile. The effect of DB income is much smaller than the effect
of Social Security income. This may reflect the fact that receipt of DB income is
much less certain than Social Security income; it is not consistently indexed to
inflation and, according to Johnson, Uccello, and Goldwyn (2005), in about one-
quarter of the plans for men and about two-thirds of the plans for women the
benefit is not based on a joint life annuity. The estimates for health shown in the
figure are very consistent with estimates of the asset cost of poor health reported
in Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2010a). Their estimates also show that the asset
cost of poor health is much greater for those the highest asset quintile than for
those in the lowest quintile.

        Third, most of the 25 estimated coefficients are statistically significant at
the five percent level and a few at the ten percent level (17 and 5 respectively).

       Fourth, the mortality ratio is never statistically different from zero and the
sign varies across asset quintiles. In the standard life-cycle framework, asset
holdings depend on expected longevity, and the rate of spending out of assets
may also depend on this variable. Thus, for example, persons in poor health
may accumulate fewer assets than persons in good health not only because they
face higher health-related costs, but also because they anticipate a shorter
lifespan. At the same time, conditional on the level of assets that households
hold, those that expect to live a long time may spend at a slower rate out of their
accumulated wealth. To control for this effect we have included a measure of
each person's subjective survival probability in the asset change equation.

         The HRS asks each respondent to self-report the probability that they will
survive for another ten years. Specifically, persons less than age 70 are asked
for the likelihood that they will be alive at age 80; persons age 70 to 74 are asked
if they will be alive at age 85; persons age 75 to 79 are asked if they will be alive
at age 90, and so forth. Persons over the age of 90 were not asked this
question. We use a "survivor ratio", constructed by RAND (2010), that is the
ratio of the respondent's self-reported probability to the implied probability of
living another ten years for a person of the same age and gender obtained from
the Vital Statistics life table. A lower value of M suggests that a person expects to
live a shorter life than the average. If persons who expect to have shorter lives
spend down assets more quickly, as the life cycle model predicts, the estimated
coefficient on M (the relationship between the change in assets and M) should be
positive. None of the estimates is statistically different from zero.

       Fifth, we are aware that the relationship between earned income and
asset growth is more complex than our estimates reveal. Earned income is the
product of the probability of working and the level of earnings if a person works.
The estimates of these relationships (not reported here) show that whether a
person works as well as earnings if working are positively related to health and
negatively related to Social Security and DB income. Both the probability of
working and earnings conditional on working are also positively related to the
level of education, which is presumably a good measure of potential earnings.

        Finally, for the fifth asset quintile the coefficients on the year indicator
variables are large and negative for 2000-2002 and 2006-2008. We suspect that
these effects reflect the two recent periods of decline in equity markets. The
effect shows up strongly for the fifth assets quintile because equity holdings are
much larger among household in the fifth quintile than in the other quintiles.

        Given these estimates, we now consider how education affects assets
though each of the pathways defined by variables in the regression. We do this
by combining two components: (1) the estimates in Table 4-6 that show the effect
of each pathway variable on the level of assets, and (2) an estimate of the
relationship between education and the pathway variable. The second of these
components is the difference between level of the pathway variable for persons
                                          32


with college or more education and the level of the variable for persons with less
than a high school degree. For example, consider the health pathway. In terms
of equation (3) above, the first component is dAw / dHW 1 (the estimated coefficient
on lagged health) and the second component is dH / dE (from Table 4-1 above).
We therefore define the effect of education on assets, through the level of health
pathway, as

 dAw dH w1
dH w1 dE
            
               dAw
              dH w1
                      HCollege  HHS 
The estimated effect of education on assets through the "change in health"
pathway is:

 dAw dH H
dH H dE
           
              dAw
             dH H
                    HCollege  H HS 
        Table 4-8 shows the effect of education through each of the pathways.
Each row pertains to one of the pathways. The table shows separate results for
each lagged asset quintile. The detail of the calculations is shown in Appendix
Table 3. The total effect of education on assets through these pathways—the
left-hand side of equation (3)—is shown in the last row. The total effect is
greatest for the fifth asset quintile. In this quintile the pathway through lagged
assets ($394,012, shown in the first row) accounts for 85 percent of the total
effect of education ($466,451). The next two most important pathways for the
fifth asset quintile are earnings and the level of health. For the first four asset
quintiles the total effect of education is much smaller--$32,083, $50,560,
$58,232, and $63,444 respectively. For these quintiles the most important
pathways are lagged assets and the dollar return on assets. The post-retirement
effect of education on assets through each of the other pathways appears to be
small. One such post-retirement pathway is through the effect of education on
the wave-to-wave change in health. The effect of this pathway is very small and
negative for four of the five quintiles. Another possible post-retirement pathway
is the dollar return on assets. But it is likely that most of the portfolio choices that
determine this effect are established at retirement. The post-retirement level of
health might also be affected by education, but data in Figures 4.2 above show
that education-related differences in health in years subsequent to retirement are
very similar to the differences when individuals are first observed. Thus the post-
retirement level of health seems largely a carryover of the level health at
retirement.

       4.4. The Additional Effect of Education: The calculations above allocate
the effect of education on asset growth following retirement to the several
"pathway variables" included in the regression. We now consider effects of
education that may not work through these pathways. We use two methods to
estimate this additional effect of education.

       One approach is to estimate the additional effect of education by a
regression of the residuals from the specification reported in Table 4-6 on
indicator variables representing levels of education. The results are shown in
Table 4-9. The omitted category is less than a high school education. The
estimated coefficients on education level suggest that education is strongly
related to the level of assets even after controlling for the pathways described
above.6

        As noted above, we could capture the effect of education not accounted
for by the pathways by simply including the level of education directly in the asset
regression. This approach, however, makes it difficult to estimate the indirect

effect of education—through its effect on pre-retirement levels of financial and
health capital—on the post-retirement evolution of assets. Because health and
financial capital at retirement are so closely linked to education, and because
there may be measurement error in our recorded health and financial capital
variables, adding the level of education to the specification reduces the estimated
effect of health and financial capital on household assets. This suggests that the
estimated coefficient on the education variable may be capturing part of the
health and financial capital effects on subsequent asset growth that are
attributable to education. We therefore focus on the strategy of relating the
residuals from equation (2) to education, without including education directly in
the asset equation.

        We nevertheless estimate the alternative specification and compare the
two sets of findings. When we add education to equation (2) the effects of the
pathway variables (the absolute value of the coefficients) are reduced by about
18 percent on average. Similarly, the effects of education on asset growth
through each of the pathways are smaller than those shown in Table 4-8. The
total reduction in the "pathway effect" is more than twenty percent for households
in the three lowest deciles of the wealth distribution, but less than five percent for
those in the highest quintile. The "total" effect of education is unaffected by the
estimation method, that is, the sum of the pathway effects from Table 4-8 and the
"additional" effect of education from the residual regression in Table 4-9 is
virtually identical to the sum of the pathway effects and the "direct" education
effect obtained from estimates that include the education variables in equation
(2). Thus the difference between the two methods is only how the effect of
education is allocated. The pathway effects are smaller when education is
included in (2)—and the proportion of the total effect of education "unexplained"
by the pathways is correspondingly larger. Further detail on the relationships
between the two methods is presented in Appendix Table 4.

       Table 4-10 combines the results shown in Tables 4-8 and 4-9 for two-
person households. Together, these two sets of results account for the total
effect of education on the post retirement evolution of assets. The total of the
effects of education through each of the pathways (from Table 4-8) ranges from
$32,083 to $63,444 for the lowest four asset quintiles, but jumps to $466,151 for
the top asset quintile. The "additional" effect of education (from Table 4-9)—
presumably the effect of education through pathways not identified—ranges from
$34,241 to $139,326. The total effect shown in the third row—the sum of the
indirect effect through the identified pathways and the additional effect of
education—for two person households ranges from about $82,000 for the first
asset quintile to over $600,000 for the fifth asset quintile. Taken together, these
results suggest that the post-retirement evolution of assets is strongly related to
education. The last row shows the percent of the total effect that is not
accounted for by the identified pathways. This percentage is much larger in the
lower asset quintiles than in the higher asset quintiles.

5. Summary and Conclusion

        This paper presents evidence on the links between educational attainment
and the evolution of assets in late life. Education affects income and saving over
the life course in many ways. We focus on a set of health and financial
pathways (such as Social Security income and the general level of health)
through which education may affect asset growth for older households. Our goal
is to estimate the effect of education on each pathway and to estimate the effect
of each pathway on asset growth. In combination these estimates allow us to
determine how education affects asset evolution through each pathway.

        We acknowledge at the outset the difficulty of identifying the effects we
are trying to measure. Our primary interest is the effect of education on asset
evolution after retirement. Older persons with different levels of education may
make different consumption and investment decisions in retirement and thus
accumulate or draw down assets at different rates. However, asset growth in
retirement also depends on choices made long before retirement. Such choices
—which were strongly influenced by education—affect the financial and health
capital that persons have upon entering retirement and will affect the future
evolution of assets. For example, a person enters retirement with a general level
of health and a level of annuity income—both are "pathways" through which
education may affect subsequent asset growth, even though, for example, the
influence of education on health and financial capital (principally through the
effect of education on earnings) occurred long ago. It is particularly difficult to
disentangle the effect of education on assets after retirement from the effect of
education on financial and health capital acquired before retirement.

        We estimate the relationship between each "pathway" variable, Social
Security benefits for example, and the subsequent evolution of assets. The idea
is that education affects Social Security benefits and these benefits in turn affect
the post-retirement evolution of assets. However, we do not observe a change in
education policy or a change in Social Security benefit rules. We are not able to
randomly assign education levels to different households with similar levels of
                                         36


retirement income and wealth at retirement, and to study how their wealth
evolves in their post-retirement years. Instead, we treat education as though it
was pre-determined, and describe the differences in asset evolution across
households that are associated with differences in education. Decisions about
the level of education to acquire early in life may be related to family
circumstances or to unobserved individual attributes that are also affected with
late-life asset accumulation behavior. We do not have a way of evaluating the
role of such unobserved heterogeneity.

        These cautions notwithstanding, our findings suggest a strong relationship
between financial capital and health capital accumulated at the age of retirement
and the subsequent evolution of assets. Because much of the variation in health
and financial capital at retirement is education-related, this at least suggests the
possibility that changes in education early in life may have long-lasting effects.
The level of education may also affect decisions made after retirement, including
portfolio allocation and investment returns that have significant implications for
asset accumulation.

         We present separate results for households in five wealth quintiles. We
first identify the effect of each pathway on asset growth. For two-person
households, a 10 percentage point increase in the level of health is associated
with a substantial increase in the level of assets from wave to wave—ranging
from about $7,000 in the first asset quintile to about $27,000 in the fifth quintile.
A ten percentage point increase in the change in health between the waves is
associated with an increase assets ranging from about $3,000 in the first quintile
to about $14,000 in the fifth quintile. More income is also associated with an
increase in assets between waves. A $10,000 increment in Social Security
income is associated with an increase in assets ranging from about $7,000 in the
first quintile to $27,000 in the fifth assets quintile. An increment of $10,000 in
earned income is associated with an increase in assets ranging from about
$3,000 in the lowest to almost $15,000 in the highest asset quintile. Thus Social
Security income in particular, but also earned income, are "protective" of assets;
greater income reduces the need to withdraw assets to meet health and other
expenses. Defined benefit pension and annuity income is much less important.

        We calculate the "indirect" effect of education through each of the
pathways we consider, as well as a substantial additional effect of education not
captured by the identified pathways. The total effect is very large. For two
person households the evolution of assets for college graduates is much greater
than for those with less than a high school degree, ranging from about $82,000
for the first asset quintile to over $600,000 for the fifth asset quintile. For
households in the lower asset quintiles the "additional" effect accounted for
slightly over half of the total effect of education on asset growth. Conversely, in
the top quintile over three-quarters of the effect of education was through the
identified pathways. For single-person households the effect of a college
                                         37


education versus less than a high school education ranges from about $19,000
for the first quintile to about $322,000 in the fifth asset quintile.

       The results for one-person households are less consistent across financial
resources and health capital, but they still show a strong relationship between
health and the return on assets and the evolution of assets. The total effect of
education—the indirect effect through the pathways plus the additional effect—is
again very large, ranging from ranging from over $19,000 in the first quintile to
almost $322,000 in the top quintile.

       Two additional insights emerge about aspects of late-life health and
financial status and educational attainment. First, health status is highly related
to educational attainment, but the change in health status after retirement is not.
Second, more educated households not only have more wealth on average in
retirement but those with more education also allocate their wealth in a different
way than their less-educated counterparts. They are more likely to hold financial
assets such as stocks and bonds, which provide an opportunity for substantial
returns. They also appear to experience more growth in housing equity during
the sample period we study. This in part reflects a lower rate of home equity
borrowing, and a higher rate of pay-down on existing mortgages. The result is a
pronounced education gradient in the return to assets, with more educated
households earning more, as a percentage of their asset holdings, than less
educated households.

       While we have considered a number of different pathways through which
education can affect pre-retirement household behavior, and through those
behaviors influence post-retirement asset evolution, our list of pathways is not
exhaustive. There may also be important post-retirement channels for the
influence of education on household behavior that we have not explored. For
example, more educated individuals may have greater ability to adjust to
changing technology, and consequently face better job prospects and higher
potential earnings if they choose to work at older ages. This may, in turn, raise
the probability that they work. We leave the study of this and other pathways to
future work.

Note: Each panel pertains to one of the pathways. The first row in each
panel shows the mean level of the pathway variable for persons with less
than a high school degree and the next row shows the mean level of the
pathway variable for persons with a college degree. The third row shows
the estimated coefficient from Table 4-6 and the last row, labeled
"estimated effect" is the product of the coefficient and the difference
(college or more minus less than high school) in the pathway variable.
Thus each row labeled "estimated effect" represents one of the terms on
the right-hand side of Equation (2).

method 1
Note: The text discusses two methods of estimating the effect of education not accounted for by included
pathways ("additional effect of education"). Method 1 obtains estimates by regressing the residuals from
equation (2) on the education variables. Method 2 directly adds the education variables to equation (2). The
table summarizes the estimated effect of education for each method, and shows how the effect of education is
allocated to pathway and additional effects. The first two lines show the estimated effect of college education
(versus less than a high school degree) for each method. The difference between the two is shown in the third
line and ranges from $8,774 in the first asset quintile to $14,217 in the fifth quintile. The fourth line shows the
corresponding reduction in the sum of the pathway effects associated with the health and resource circumstances
given at retirement. One is essentially the mirror image of the other. The percent reduction is show in the last
line of the table. The percent reduction in the sum of the pathway effects is very small for the top asset quintile
because the indirect effect of lagged assets is very large for this quintile and the coefficient on lagged assets is
affected very little by the addition of education levels to the regression.
