to soften product marketcompetition. In particular,when managerscan be compensated based on

theirown and theirrivals’ performance,we show thattherewill be an inverse relationshipbetween

the magnitude of high-powered incentives and the degree of competition in the industry. More

competitive industriesarecharacterizedby weakerpay-performanceincentives. Empirically,we find

strongevidence of this inverserelationshipin the compensation of executives in the United States.

Our econometric resultsare not consistent with alternativetheories of the effect of competition on

executive compensation. We conclude thatstrategicconsiderations can preclude the use of high-

powered incentives, in contrastto the predictions of the standardprincipal-agentmodel.

1.     Introduction

The separation of ownership and control of large corporations is a central feature of modern

economies. The largely unobserved choice of actions by a firm’s managers can have a major

impact on the wealth of its shareholders. The literature on principal-agent theory suggests

that the primary means for the shareholders to ensure that managers take optimal actions

is to tie managers’ pay to the performance of their firms; that is, to provide high-powered

intent ives for managers to maximize the returns to shareholders. However, the empirical

literature has not found evidence of high-powered incentives. Instead, the typical finding is

a low pay-performance sensitivity, which seems to imply that shareholders are not providing

managers with incentives to maximize the returns to shareholders.

     In this paper, we argue that strategic interactions between firms in an oligopoly can ex-

plain the puzzling lack of high-powered incentives in executive compensation contracts writ-

ten by shareholders whose objective is to maximize the value of their shares. We derive the

optimal compensation contracts for managers and demonstrate that the use of high-powered

incentives will be limited by the need to soften product market competition.        In particu-

lar, when managers can be compensated based on their own and their rivals’ performance,

we show that there will be an inverse relationship between the magnitude of high-powered

incentives and the degree of competition in the industry. More competitive industries are

characterized by weaker pay-performance incentives. Empirically, we find strong evidence of

this inverse relationship in the compensation of executives in the United States.

     We conclude that strategic considerations can preclude the use of high-powered incen-

tives, in contrast to the predictions of the standard principal-agent model.     That model

posits an economic trade-off between inducing the correct amount of unobservable effort by

the agent and minimizing the amount of risk she is required to bear. In practice, that model


                                               1
predicts that managerial compensation will be correlated with the total return to sharehold-

ers, typically through ownership of shares of the firm’s stock or grants of options on the

fire’s stock. In a seminal article, Jensen and Murphy (1990) test and reject this theoretical

prediction, finding that the compensation of chief executive officers increased by ody $3.25

per $1,000 increase in shareholder wealth.1                       They hypothesize that political forces (e.g.,

societal notions of fairness and equity) work to reduce the pay-performance sensitivity.2

This contrasts with our explanation that the pay-performance sensitivity is low because a

high pay-performance sensitivity would induce overly aggressive behavior in the product

markets.

     Another prediction of the principal-agent model of executive compensation is that pay

should be based not only on the returns to the firm’s shareholders but on every variable that

provides unique information about the actual action taken by the manager.3                              A prominent

example of such a variable is the profits of other firms in the same product market, leading

to a compensation contract based on the relative performance of the manager compared to

her rivals. The prediction from the relative performance evaluation model is that, other

things equal, an executive will receive lower compensation if executives of rival fires deliver

higher returns to their shareholders. In our model, the validity of this prediction depends on

the nature of strategic competition. When the returns to attenuating competition are high,

compensation contracts will not exhibit relative performance evaluation. When the returns

to achieving product market leadership are high, contracts will have incentives that resemble
1 Later work by Haubrich (1994) has demonstrated that some parameterizations    of the principal-agent            model
do allow for pay-performance sensitivities as low as the 0.003 found by Jensen and Murphy.

2 Finkelstein   and Hambrick     (1996)   discuss the political    forces that shape executive   compensation   in great
detail.

relative performance evaluation. The empirical literature on whether relative performance

evaluation is an important source of managerial incentives finds mixed results.4 We do not

find evidence in support of relative performance evaluation in our empirical work.

     The lack of empirical confirmation is a consequence of the absence of strategic con-

siderations from the standard principal-agent model, with or without relative performance

evaluation. With few exceptions, the typical principal-agent model fails to recognize that

the interaction between shareholders and managers occurs in an environment of strategic

interactions between firms in imperfectly competitive markets.5                                  A model that considers

compensation divorced from competition is incomplete. We show that when the optimal con-

tract allows compensation to vary with own and industry performance, strategic interactions

support relative performance pay—a negative relationship between executive compensation

and industry performanc=nly                      when firm outputs are strategic substitutes, as in the stan-

dard Cournot model.

     When outputs are strategic complements, as in the differentiated Bertrand model of

price competition, relative performance pay lowers the shareholders’ returns by encouraging

more aggressive price setting by managers and is therefore not observed in equilibrium. In

this case, the level of compensation under the optimal contract incremes with both own

and industry performance, softening competition and raising the returns to shareholders.
d Jensen and Murphy          find that relative    performance     is not an important      source of managerial     incentives.
Gibbons and Murphy (1990) test more directly                for relative performance    pay and find that, holding constant
the rate of return on a firm’s common stock,                a higher value-weighted      industry rate of retmn lowers the
growth of CEO pay.

5 The earliest papers that do recognize this interaction are Vickers (1987), Fershtman and Judd (1987),
and Sklivas (1987). Vickers (1987) demonstrate es that precommit ment to managerial incentive cent racts can
facilitate   collusion   between rival firms. Fershtman        and Judd (1987) and Sklivaa (1987) derive similar results
by allowing the compensation          contract    to include sales in addition    to profits.   Reitman    (1993) demonstrates
that the nonlinearity       in profits introduced        by a stock option   improves     the outcome      for the shareholders
relative to a contract      that is linear in profits.    See also Katz (1991),    Hermalin     (1992),   and Fumas (1992).




                                                                 3
Furthermore, the differentiated Bertrand model generates the strong prediction that the op-

timal compensation contract is sensitive to the degree of substitutability in the firm’s product

market. In more competitive industries, managers are given weaker incentives to maximize

returns to their own fires’ shareholders and stronger incentives to maximize returns to all

firms in the industry. Specifically, we show that the differentiated Bertrand model predicts

that the ratio of the own-firm pay-performance sensitivity to the industry pay-performance

sensitivity is a decreasing function of the level of competition in the industry.

   We test our predictions by linking together two sources of data. We use industry concen-

tration ratios from the Census of Manufactures to characterize product market competition

and compensation data for executives of large corporations from the Standard and Poor’s

ExecuComp dataset.      The prediction for the differentiated Bertrmd model is cotimed

empirically under a variety of econometric specificat iom. Our empirical results do not sup-

port the standard principal-agent model, the relative performance evaluation model, or the

Cournot model that we derive.

   The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we derive the form of optimal executive

compensation contracts under differentiated Bertrand competition when contracts can vary

with own and industry performance. In section 3, we repeat the analysis under the assump

tion that competition is Cournot. In section 4, we demonstrate that in our model the optimal

contract is invariant to managerial risk aversion. In section 5, we describe the data that we

use for our empirical tests and, in section 6, present those findings. Section 7 discusses

the implications of our empirical resdts for alternative theories of executive compensation.

Section 8 concludes.

2.     Bertrand Competition


We consider the following contracting model. There me two firms in an industry, 1 and 2,

who engage in differential ed Bertrand competition.                The model has two stages. At stage

1, the owners of the firms write contracts with the managers, and at stage 2 the managers

engage in differentiated Bertrand competition.G                We assume a manager’s action choice at

stage 2 is unobservable.         Profits, or statistics for profits such as returns to shareholders,

are observable, so contracts can be made contingent only on profits. Firm face symmetric

demand functions given by:


                                    Dl(pl, p2) =       A–    bpl +ap2 +E                          (1)

                                    DQ(pl, p2) =       A–@2+ap1+&


e is a mean zero shock to demand with variance 02. Therefore, prices cannot be perfectly

inferred from profits. We resume that b > a. That is, the manager’s action choice has a

greater impact on the demand for her own product than does her rival’s action. We assume

linear demands and two firms because this specification yields straightforward comparative

statics across product markets. The rmults of our model will generalize to industries with

more than two firms and to nonlinear demand functions so long as ~                  < 0, ~   > 0, and

1*1>*-
     At stage 1, if contracts are written contingent solely on own firm profits, we get the

standard differentiated Bertrand result. A contract that is increasing in own profits will

induce the manager to choose the profit maximizing price. If marginal cost is given by c, we

have the following program for the manager:


                                    mP~     (pl – c)(A – bpl + apz +       E)                     (2)

G Our derivation   will apply to any model with strategic   complements.

and symmetrically for the manager for firm 2. Firm 1‘s reaction function is:

                                             A+ bc+ap2+c
                                    pl =                                                     (3)
                                                        2b

and the profit mtimizing    choice for pl is:

                                                A+ be+&
                                                                                             (4)
                                         ‘1=        2b–a      “

Symmetric equations hold for firm 2. We can then calculate profits under this standard

differentiated Bertrand model (which we do in the proof of Proposition 1).

   The question we wish to ask is, can the standard contract be improved upon? Would

the owner of firm 1 raise her profits by offering the manager a contract contingent upon the

rival firm’s profits = well as the own firm’s profits? Suppose the following contract is offered

to the manager of firm 1:

                                     WI = kl + O!ml+ prz                                     (5)

where

                               mi=(pi–       c)(A–bpi+apj+        e).                        (6)

In this model, the owner of firm 1 chooses the contract, the contract is revealed to both

managers, and then the managers choose pric~. We ~sume that the manager of firm 1 has

a reservation wage w! and that the managerial labor market is competitive. Therefore, the

manager of firm 1 is always held to her reservation wage. The first period program for the

owner of firm 1 is:


                                                                                             (7)

                             St.   WI    >     w;       and




                                                    6
The first constraint is the manager’s individual rationality constraint, which will always bind

through the choice of kl, the fixed payment in the managerial incentive contract. The second

constraint ensures that the manager’s second period action choice is optimal given the first

period contract.

   We start by analyzing the second period action choice of firm 1‘s manager in the differ-

entiated Bertrand game. Explicitly, the manager’s problem is:


            max    a(pI –c)(A–bpl+apz+E)                 +~(pz–c)(A           –bpz+apl+   e).    (8)
             P1


Firm 1‘s reaction function is


                                                                                                 (9)


Firm 2’s manager’s second period action choice is given by the standard Bertrand problem:


                                mn=     (p2 – c)(A – bpz + apl +         E)                     (lo)


Firm 2’s reaction function is:
                                               A+ bc+apl+&
                                       p2 =                                                     (11)
                                                        2b           “

Jointly solving both gives prices as a function of firm 1‘s first period contract.




                            (A+ E) (au+ 2ba + ~a) + bc (2ba + au - ~a)
                   P;   =                                                                       (12)
                                                4abz –   aa2   –   ~a2

                            a   (A +   E)   (2b + a) + c (2ab2 – ~a2 + aab)
                   P;   =                     4abZ _ ~a2 _ ~a2


   Substituting thwe price choices back into the owner’s first period problem and holding

the manager to her reservation wage yields the following prog-ram:


                                                                                                (13)


                                                    7
There is a continuum of optimal contracts given by:

                                    4b2 + 2ab – a2
                                                         D’=x,   ZER+.                      (14)

which generate expected prices of

                              1 c(ab + 2b2 – a2) + A(a + 2b)
                  E~l]    =   j                                                             (15)
                                          2bz – ~z
                              1 –ca3 – a2A – ba2c + 2abA + 2ab2c + 4b2A + 4b3c
                  E~2]    =   ~
                                                  b (2b2 – a2)

   We first establish that firm 1‘s expected prices and profits are higher under this contrac-

tual arrangement than under standard differentiated Bertrand competition.          All proofs of

propositions are in the appendix.
Proposition   1 lfE~l]        > c, then E~l]   > E~l],   E[m~] > E[nl], E~z] > E~2] and E[m~] >
E[m2].

   This establish        that fim 1 would like to w-rite a contract based on both firms’ profits

and that firm 2 benefits when firm 1 dom so. Next we establish that firm 2 would like to

offer its manager an analogous contract. We continue to consider linear contracts of the

following form:

                                                                                            (16)




We put no restrictions on a, ~, 6 or ~; they could be greater than 1 or less than O. We assume

each manager has a reservation wage, w~ and w~, and that the managerial labor market is

competitive. Therefore, the k’s, which are constants, are chosen so that the managers ae

always held to their reservation wages. The first period program for the owner of firm 1 is:

                                                                                            (17)
where the constraints are w given in program 7,

   We start by analyzing the manager’s second period action choice in the differentiated

Bertrand game, which is the same problem we malyzed before for firm 1. As in program 8,

the manager’s problem is:


              mP~     ~(PI – c)(A – bPI + apz + E) + ~(pz – c)(A – bpz + apl + s).


As above, fim 1’s reaction function is

and a symmetric equation holds for firm 2. The optimal price levels as functions of a, ~, 6

and ~ are:




                    –a(A   + e)(a6 + 2~b + a~) – abc(2~b – a6 + a~) + ~a2c(6 + ~)
         P;   =
                                –4~b2a + aa2y + aa26 + ~a2~ + ~a26

   Substituting the price choices back into the owners’ first period problems and holding

the managers to their reservation wages yields the following program for firm 1:




A similar program holds for firm 2. Jointly solving both gives the continuum of optimal

contracts for each firm’s manager, which is:


                                                                                      (20)




We can now solve for the symmetric equilibrium prices, p~:

   Proposition 2 compares expected prices and profits in the cme where both managers

can be compensated on own and rival-firm profits to the case where only firm         1‘s   manager

can be compensated on own and rival-firm profits and to the case where both managers are

compensated strictly on their own-firm profits.




   Figure 1 depicts the shift in equilibrium as we move from standard differentiated Bertrand

competition to competition characterized by compensation contracts based on own and rival-

firm profits. The upward sloping lines labelled pl and p2 are firm 1 and firm 2’s reaction

functions under standard differentiated Bertrand competition. The lines labelled p; and pj

are the reactions functions when managers can be compensated on both own and rival-firm

profits. In the new equilibrium, prices (p;, P;) are higher relative to standard differentiated

Bertrand competition.

   Allowing a manager to be compensated on the rival firm’s profits lessens competition

and raises profits for both firms. Notice that the optimal contracts we derived,




are functions of a and b. The relative weight put on own firm’s profits in the optimal contract

is an increasing function of b, or the weight on own price, and a decreasing function of a, or the

weight on the rival firm’s price. The ratio b/a measures the degree of substitutability between

the two firm’s products.       A higher value of b/a indicates lower substitutability, i.e., an


                                                10
industry that is closer to a monopoly. A lower value of b/a indicates greater substitutability,

i.e., an industry that is closer to perfect competition.

   The optimal contracts are only identified up to their ratio, a*/~*, and not to their levels.

This is a result of the continuum of equilibria. We call this ratio the   compensation   ratio.    As

the product market approaches a monopoly, that is


                                                                                                  (22)


the optimal contract puts all of the weight on own-firm performance and none on rival-firm

performance. As the product market approaches the perfectly competitive outcome,


                                           limg=l,                                                (23)
                                           a~b ~%

the weights on both own firm and rival firm become equalized in the optimal contract. In

other words, as the products become more substitutable, more weight is put on the rival

firm’s profits to offset the increased competitive pressure.

   The next step in the analysis is to consider the situation in which the principal allows

the agent to choose her contract. For example, the principal pays the agent a fixed amount

of money and allows her to allocate the funds (or some fraction thereof) between the stock

of her own firm and her rival firm. In other words we are considering the agent’s portfolio

problem and explicitly accounting for strategic effects on portfolio choice. Mathematically,

the agents now choose a, ~, 6 and ~. The problem for firm 1‘s owner is:


                                             m~=     E[7r~]– WI                                   (24)

                          St.   WI =      kl + CXrl+ ~~2 z w;     and

                            Q“ , P“   c   arg ~-l    WI

                                p;    ●   arg mP~x WI(a”, ~“, ~“, 6“).


                                                11
   A symmetric problem holds for firm 2. k will be chosen so that the IR constraint is

met with equality. Therefore, we only need consider the agent’s problem. The information

structure here is important–the manager of firm 1 chooses her contract at the same time

that the manager of firm 2 chooses her contract, the contracts are revealed, and then the

firms compete (prices are chosen). Price competition yields the same prices w functions of

contracts as we derived for Proposition 2.




   The manager of firm 1 chooses a and @ to maximize




given the prices above and symmetrically for the manager of firm 2. The symmetric equilib-

rium contracts are a“ = r, ,f3°= r, ~“ = t, 6“ = t,        r, t E R+. If we choose ~“ = ~“ (the

contract from Proposition 2), i.e., r = y, then

                                             2b–a
                                  Q“=T<-          a   y=   ~”.                               (26)


Allowing the agent to choose the contract further softens price competition.          Given these

contracts, Proposition 3 shows that prices and profits are higher when the manager picks

her contract (or allocates her portfolio) than when the owner chooses the contract for the

manager.

Proposition   3 If ~~~] > c, then EM] > E~~]          and E[m~] > E[TT]   foT i E   [1,2].



   Competition is further softened because now the managers fully internalize their com-

petitive externality. Shareholders cannot commit directly to maximizing industry profits

                                              12
because this is not credible-they can only commit to maximizing their own wealth. Letting

managers choose their contracts indirectly commits firms to maximizing industry profits.

Both managers choose contracts and then prices to mtimize        industry profitability, Because

prices are strategic complements, higher prices increase joint profits, which then increase the

manager’s payoff.

     In summary, we might expect to see compensation contracts based on own and rival-

firm profits when firms engage in differentiated Bertrand competition. Relative to standard

differentiated Bertrand competition, such compensation contracts soften competition. How-

ever, firms do even better by allowing managers to allocate their wealth across the equity

of their own firms and their rivals. As long w managers hold some of the equity in their

own firm, they will also choose to hold equity in their rival and further attenuate Bertrand

competition. Thus, it is not a requirement to observe explicit provisions regarding own and

rival-firm profits in managerial contracts. The manager can be relied on to make optimal

portfolio allocations.


3.     Cournot Competition

Now we consider the same model as before but where the market is characterized by Cournot

competition instead of Bertrand competition. The demand structure is:


                                D(ql, qz) = A – b(ql + qz) + &                              (27)


The standard Cournot solution obtains if the manager is strictly compensated on own-firm

profits. It is given by:

                              mqy    9i(A–~(q2+     qj)+E–   c)”                            (28)




                                              13
    The firms’ reaction functions are:

                                                  lA–bqj+&–c
                                   qi=5                                                            (29)
                                                          b
                                                  lA–bqi+&–c
                                   qj     =
                                                  i          b“

The firms’ profit maximizing quantities are:

                                     qi       =       ~(A+&-c)                                     (30)

                                    qj        =       ~(A+&-c).


Expected profits are:


               E[~i]    =   E[qi(A - b(qi+qj)           +& -      c)] = E   [~   (A+~   -   C)2]


                        =   &[(A-c)2+a2].                                                          (31)


   Next we consider contracts contingent upon rival-firm profits M well as owr-firm profits.

First we look at the case in which only the manager of firm 1 is compensated on the rival

firm’s stock price in addition to her own share performance. We consider linear contracts of

the following form:

                                        WI =      kl + Qrl + ~TZ                                   (32)


We also assume that contracts me bounded:


                                  a,p     E   [–M, M],            M<m.                             (33)


   We now proceed as we did before in the Bertrand ewe. The first period program for the

owner of firm 1 is:




                                                        14
Thesecond period action choice of firm l’smanager              is given by:


              m~~    aql(A–b(ql         +q2)+&–     c)+~q2(A         –b(q1+q2)+&–   c).   (35)


The reaction function for the manager of firm 1 is:

                                       1 aA – abq2 +    ~E –   ~C –   @q2b
                               ql=j                                                       (36)
                                                        ab

For firm 2, we have the standard Cournot reaction function:

                                               lA–bql+&–c
                                        q2=5                                              (37)
                                                        b“

Jointly solving both yields:

                                                     -. A–c+E
                                                                                          (38)




   Substituting these quantity choices back into firm 1‘s owner’s first period problem and

holding the manager to her reservation wage gives the following program:


                         :7           E[q; (A – b(q; + q;) –    C+    E)] – u;.           (39)


The solution to this program is given in the following proposition:

Proposition   4 There is a continuum of optimal contracts in which a’ = y, F = –y, y ●
[-M, O)U (o, M]. For uzzy~, VI c [-~, O)U (o,~], ~[q~k]= E[g~l], E[T~~]= E[~~~], E[qi~l=
E[q;l] and E[m~~] = E[mjl]. Therefore, we have unique quantities and pagofls E[q{], E[n[],
E[q~] and E[n~]. Relative to the Coumot payofls and quantities we have E[q{] > E[ql],
E[n~] > EIzI], E[q~] < E[q2] and E[n~] < E[7rz].


   This leads to firm 1 becoming a Stackelberg leader and firm 2 becoming a Stackelberg

follower. Profits are higher for firm 1 when its manager is compensated on both firms’ profits

than when she is compensated solely on own-firm profits. Note that the optimal contracts

                                                   15
can be decomposed into two types: those in which the manager of firm 1 is given a long

position in her own firm and a short position in the rival and those in which the manager

is given a short position in her own firm and a long position in the rival. While both

are theoretically possible, legal constraints prevent a manager from shorting her own firm.

Section 16(c) of the Securiti-                  Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits insiders from maintaining

short positions in equity securities.7                    Hansen and Lott (1995) demonstrate that no such

constraints exist on taking a short position in a rival firm. We thus refer to the contract in

which the manager of a firm is given a long position in her own firm and a short position in

her rival as the equilibrium contract.

     Next we consider if firm 2 is better off by also adopting such a contract. The contract

specification is again linear:


                                                                                                                           (40)




We assume that:

                                                     ~,o,7,~ E [–M,M].

The fire’s first period optimization is:


                                                                                                                           (41)


                                         St.    WI    >   w;     and




7 According    to SEC Document            No. S7-26-88,   “A reading of the legislative     history   indicates   that Congress
did not want insiders,     with access to inside information,          speculating   in their company’s    stock by acquiring
short positions.    Further,   Congress did not want insiders to take short positions         in conflict with their fiduciary
duties,   because   insiders   could     use short positions   to manipulate    a stock   price or to profit by a fall in the
price of their company’s       stock.”




                                                                16
A s~metric    program holds for firm 2. Firm 1‘s manager’s second period action choice is

given by:


              max    aql(A–     b(ql +qz) +E – c) +@qz(A – b(ql +qz) +s–       c).
               91


The reaction functions are:


                                                                                            (42)




and optimal quantity levels are:


                                                                                            (43)




   Substituting these quantity choices back into the owner’s first period problem and holding

the manager to her reservation wage yields the following program:


                          rn~     E[q; (A – b(q; + q;) + &– c)] – W;.                       (44)


A similar program holds for firm 2. Jointly solving both gives the Nash equilibrium optimal

contracts for each firm’s manager.

Proposition      5 There are two continua of pure strategy asymmetric Nash equilibria. In
the first continuum, al* = r, @l* = –r, ~1” = t,61* = O, and r,t 6 [–M, O) u (O,M].
For all rk, Tl, t G [–M, O) U (O,M], E[q]~] = E[q~~], E[m~~] = E[~~;], E[q~~] = E[qj~] and
E[T~~] = E[n~~]. In the second continuum, a2* = u, ~2” = 0, ~2* = v, 62* = –v, and
U,V E [–M, O) U(O, M]. FOT a~luk,vl,u     E [– M, O) U(O, M], E[q?~] = E[qfT], E[~f~] = E[T?T],

E[q~~] = E[q~~] and E[T~~] = E[~~~]. Therefore, we have unique quantities and payofls E[q~*],
E[~~*], E[q~*] and E[nfi*], e G {1,2} associated with each continuum of equilibria, In all of the
pure strategy Nash equilibria, one firrR is a Stackelberg leader and the other is a Stackelberg
follower. Joint quantities are higher and joint profits lower than in the standard Cournot
model.


                                               17
   As in the previous proposition, within each continuum we can decompose contracts into

two types: those in which the manager is given a long position in her own firm and a short

position in the rival and those in which the manager is given a short position in her own

firm and a long position in the rival. Again, we will refer to this first type of contract as

the equilibrium contract. The optimal contracts exhibit short-selling of the rival by one of

the fires, who becomes the Stackelberg leader; that is, either ~“ or 6* is negative. The

Stackelberg follower has a long position in her own firm and no position in the rival (this is

again the result of legal prohibitions against short selling of one’s own firm).

   It is worth noting the differences between our results and those of Fershtman and Judd

(1987) and Skliv~ (1987). Fershtman and Judd and Sklivas consider contracts in which the

manager is compensated on a linear combination of own-firm profits and sales, and not on

rival-firm profits. They show that quantities are higher and profits are lower than in the

standard Cournot model. However, their models generate a unique equilibrium that does not

have Stackelberg behavior. Our model has continua of asymmetric pure strategy equilibria

in which the firms do exhibit Stackelberg behavior. Asymmetry is a natural feature of our

model and characterizes a richer set of possible outcomes for the Cournot c~e.

   In our model, shorting one’s rival resembles relative performance evaluation. The man-

ager does get compensated on the difference between her firm’s performance and that of

the rival firm. However, what looks like relative performance evaluation is not the result of

the owner’s need to provide the agent with incentives to supply effort while filtering out the

common shock 6. Instead, what appears to be relative performance evaluation arises because

the owner wants to toughen competition–it is a strategic choice rather than a response to

moral hazard.

   Next we ask the question of whether the owner would prefer to let the manager choose



                                              18
the contract, as we did in the Bertrand case. Again, this means the agents pick o, ~, 6 and

~. The problem for firm 1’s owner is:


                                               m~~     E[nl] – WI                        (45)

                            St.   WI   =   kl + crml + ~7r2 2 w{    and

                              ~“ , D“ G arg Inl       WI
                                               ,

                                  9Y ●     mg mq~     wl(~”, B“, v“, 6“).


      A symmetric problem holds for firm 2. k will be chosen so that the IR constraint is met

with equality. Therefore, we only need consider the manager’s problem. The manager of

firm 1 chooses her contract at the same time that the manager of firm 2 chooses her contract,

the contracts are revealed, and then the firms compete (quantities are chosen). Quantity

competition yields the same quantities as functions of contracts as we derived in equations

43.

given the quantities above and a symmetric equation holds for the manager of firm 2.

Proposition      6 Consider equilibria in pure strategies.   The equilibria are:

         ay=M,    p;=   M,’y; =M,6;     = –Mand~~=Mj@~=–M,~~=M,6~=M.

In the jirst equilibrium, firm 1 does not produce and firm 2 produces at the monopoly level.
In equilibrium 2, firm 2 does not produce and jirm 1 produces at the monopoly level. The
expected payoff to both managers is E[w~] = ka + ~ (A +s – C)2 ~, i ~ {1, 2}.

                                                 19
     These contracts lead one firm to be the monopolist andtheother                           to stay out, but the

manager of the firm that stays out gets compensated anyway.8                           Allowing the managers to

choose their contracts makes them less competitiveone                         firm becomes the monopolist and

both managers take long positions in that firm. Clearly the owner of the firm that does

not produce is made worse off in this situation–such an owner would prefer not to let her

manager choose her own contract. On the other hand, each owner would like to induce her

manager to produce at the monopoly level. One way to achieve this is to give a manager a

sticiently   large stake in her own firm so that she cannot take an equally large long position

in her rival. In this case, the best the manager can do is to short her rival, thus committing

the manager to produce aggressively and to become either a monopolist (as in Proposition

6) or a Stackelberg leader (w in Proposition 5).

     Next we consider what happens when one firm lets the manager choose her contract and

the other firm uses no contract. The quantity functions are:




                                           91    =   (a_p)A–c+&                                                   (48)

                                                       A+E–c
                                           ‘2    =   ab(3a–p)

The manager of firm 1 maximizes WI = kl + Onl + ~7r2.The optimal contract turns out to

be a = @ = z, z E (O,M]. We conclude that if one firm wants to let its manager choose her

contract, the other firm would not want to let the manager choose her contract. The firm in

which the manager does not choose earns monopoly profits, and the manager who chooses

does not produce.

     Next we consider what happens when one manager chooses her own contract and the
s One thing to notice   about   the equilibria   in this case is that there are ordy two pure strate~       equilibria,
rather than two continua   of equilibria   which we identify    generically   with the same payoffs as in Proposition
5.

other firm dictates a contract. The quantity functions are:




                                                    A+&–c
                         91   =   7(fl-~)   ~(_3a7+6a+6B+7B)                             (49)

                                                   A+E–c
                         q2 =     ~(~–7)~(_3a7+6a+6P+7B)


Firm 1 chooses the contract for the manager and firm 2 lets the manager choose.          The

optimal contract in this c~e is: 6 =?       = M,a   = z,~   = –Z, Z E (O,M]. This leads to

another continuum of equilibria. Firm 1 can choose any contract where a = z, ~ = –z and

get a monopoly position. Firm 2, by letting the manager choose, does not produce.

     These cases demonstrate that there remains a strategic role for relative performance

evaluation. We expect to see both firms choosing contracts for their managers. This is

the situation analyzed in Proposition 5. One manager’s contract will consist of aggressively

short-selling the rival, i.e., there will be a contract that resembles relative performance

evaluation for that manager. The other firm will select a standard compensation contract

consisting of a long position in the manager’s own firm.


4.     Risk Aversion


Thus far we have assumed that the manager is risk neutral. In this section, we show that

the analysis is unchanged if the manager is risk averse. This property is the consequence of

our assumption that there is no disutility to the agent’s action choices. To see this, recall

that throughout the paper, the principals have solved programs of the following form:




                                              21
                                                                                          (50)




   In order to show that risk aversion does not matter, we need only show that the optimal

action choice Zi does not change when the manager is risk averse. This is because the

principal is risk neutral in either case, and so a and ~ will be chosen optimally given Zi and

kl is chosen so WI = w;. The optimal z; in the problem above is given by the solution to:


                                                                                          (51)


A symmetric equation holds for firm 2. The principal’s problem when the manager is strictly

risk averse is:


                                                   max    E[7rl] – WI                     (52)

                               u’   >        0,   u“ <0           and




The optimal xi in this problem is given by:

                                    au          anl         aT2
                                                —+p—                    = o.              (53)
                                    ~       ( aaxl          axl )

By assumption, ~ >0, so the optimal x{ solves

                                              a~l   a~z
                                              —+P—=                 o.
                                            aaxl    axl

                                                       22
The same argument holds when the manager chooses a and Q, i.e., the manager chooses the

contract or her portfolio.

     A simple contract that implements z: when the agent is risk averse is the following.

We interpret a and @ w the fractions of shareholdings in firm 1 and 2 respectively for the

manager of firm 1. Let r be a constant that scales the number of shares held in each firm

by the manager of firm 1. Then the owner of firm 1 solves the following program:

                                                     max     E[n~] – w~                         (54)
                                                    ~,p,kl,r
                          St.   WI =      u (y) ~ w;      and

                                xi    ●   arg mm        WI where
                                               ~1

                                 u’   >   0,   U’l <0     and

                                 y    =   k~ + 7-(a7r~(z~,z~) + ~7r~(z~, z~))

     The solution is to choose a’ = arg m=a           E[nl] – w{ as above, kl = u-l (wj), and to let

r ~ O. As     T   is chosen arbitrarily small, the agent is directly paid her reservation utility,

bears vanishing risk, and chooses the optimal z;. This is the least-cost way to implement

the optimal action.


5.     Data


The models of sections 2 and 3 yield testable implications regarding the relationship between

product substitutability and the sensitivity of executive compensation to firm performance.

We combine data from two separate sources to explore this relationship empirically. Our

data on compensation are drawn from the Standard and Poor’s Compustat ExecuComp

database. Our data on the product market substitutability across different firms are drawn

from the Censuses of Manufactures conducted by the Commerce department. This section

describes each of these data sources in turn.

                                                     23
5.1       Executive Compensation Data

The ExecuComp dataset compiled by Standard and Poor’s includes data on total compensa-

tion for the top five executives (ranked annually by salary and bonus) at each of the firms in

the S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600.9 In addition to measures of short-

term compensation such as salary and bonus, ExecuComp cent ains data on components

of long-term compensation such as long-term incentive plans, restricted stock, and stock

appreciation rights. Due to enhanced federal reporting requirements for fiscal years ending

after December 15, 1992, the ExecuComp data for 1993 and 1994 are virtually complete. 10

Relative to the dat=ets used in the studies by Jensen and Murphy (1990) and Gibbons and

Murphy (1990), the advantages of the ExecuComp data are that its sample encompmses the

largest 1500 fires each year and is not restricted to just chief executive officers. The main

disadvantage is that its panel dimension for payments to executives is limited to only two

years at present.

    Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the components of executive compensation for

all executiv= in the ExecuComp sample for 1994 for whom complete data on total com-

pensation is available. The top panel of the table pertains to the 1,490 executives who are

identified as the chief executive officer of the fire. The bottom panel describes the other 6,146

executives in the sample. Our measure of total compensation can be divided into short-term

compensation and long-term compensation.                       Short-term compensation consists of salary,

bonus, and other annual payments (e.g., gross-ups for tax liabilities, perquisites, preferential

other compensation)       for fiscal years ending before December     15, 1992.   Prior to that, disclosure     was at the
company’s   discretion.    Hence, although   we do have some data extending          back to 1991, we focus only on the
years for which we know that the set of firms reporting      all the components       of compensation    is representative.

discounts on stock purchases). Annual short-term compensation averages $973,000 for the

CEOS and $454,000 for the Non-CEOs. Long-term compensation includes the value of re-

stricted stock granted, stock options granted, payouts from long-term incentive plans, and all

other compensation (e.g., contributions to benefit plans, severance payments). The sample

averages of long-term compensation are $1,045,000 for CEOS and $381,000 for Non-CEOs.

In the aggregate, long-term compensation accounts for 51.8 percent of CEO compensation

and 45.6 percent of Non-CEO compensation. At the individual level, the average share of

compemation that is long-term is 35.0 percent for CEOS and 32.1 percent for Non-CEOs,

reflecting the skewness in the distribution of long-term compensation. Stock options granted

are by far the most important component of long-term compensation, accounting for 72.9

percent for CEOS and 68.8 percent for Non-CEOs.ll


5.2        Product Market Data

Our model links the compensation contract to properties of the demand curve for a firm’s

products. Specifically, in the differentiated Bertrand model from Section 2 with linear de-

mand curves, the compensation contract is a fiction                     of the ratio b/a, where the numerator

(denominator) is the slope of the demand curve with respect to the firm’s (rival’s) price. A

firm in an industry in which there is little product differentiation will have a low ratio. Our

theory predicts that the compensation of executives in such an industry will be insensitive

to   changes in own performance relative to rival firm performance. Compensation becomes

more sensitive to own-firm performance relative to rival-firm performance as product differ-

entiation (and the ratio b/a) increases.

     Since we do not have estimates of the parameters of demand functions at the level of the

Standard   and Poor’s    (1995) for a discussion.

firm or even the industry, we proxy for the degree of substitutability that a firm’s product

faces with the firm’s industry concentration ratio. We conjecture that a firm in a more

concentrated industry will have fewer close substitutes for its products. This assumption is

consistent with a framework such as that of Salop (1979), in which firms in each industry

have located optimally in the product space to maximize the distance between competitors.

In such a model, industries with more firms will have greater product substitutability and

lower concentration ratios.

     Our source of data on concentration ratios by industry is the 1992 Census of Manu-

factures, conducted by the Bureau of the Census as part of the quinquennial Economic

Censuses.12            Within the manufacturing sector are the twenty 2-digit standard industrial

classification (SIC) codes from 20 to 39, and within these 2-digit SICS are 458 separate 4-

digit SICS (ranging from 2001 to 3999). For each SIC, the Census contains five measures of

industry concentration: the 4, 8-, 20-, and 50-fim ratios and the Herfindahl index. Denot-

ing a firm’s share of the total value of shipments in the industry by (i and ordering the firms

from the largest share to smallest, an industry’s Herfindahl index is:




The restriction of the Herfindahl to the largest 50 firms is a convention of the Census of

Manufactures .13

    Table 2 presents the average concentration ratios for each of the 2-digit SICS within
12The     data    and documentation      of the concentration       ratios    for 1992 are found    in BUeau    of the Cemus
(1996).    More complete      documentation     of the concentration         ratio series through   1987 is found in Bureau of
the Census (1993).        The Economic       Censuses for other sectors of the economy          do not include concentrate ion
ratios and so are excluded        from our empirical    analysis.

131n the few SICs in which the HerfindaN           index is missing, we impute the value from the other concentration
ratios by assuming        that the shares of the firms within each group (i.e. 1-4, 5-8, 9-20, 21-50) are equal, This
procedure        will always underestimate    the Herfindahl    index.




                                                                26
the manufacturing sector.              Each cell in the table weights the concentration ratio of the

constituent 4-digit SICS in proportion to their value of shipments. There is wide variation in

average concentration across these broad industry groups. In our empirical work, we use the

Herfindahl index as our measure of industry concentration, although our qualitative results

are invariant to the particular measure of concentration that we use. We believe that the

Herfindahl best captures the impact of both the number of firms and their relative market

shares on the degree of product substitutability in an industry.

    It is worth noting that although we use the concentration ratio m a prow for the sub-

stitutability of products between firms in a market, the correspondence between SIC codes

and product markets is not perfect. Even at the 4-digit level, some industries may include

several products that are not themselves close substitutes for each other. This aggregation

tends to understate the true concentration ratio for a firm’s product, possibly by different

amounts in different industry classifications. This consideration must be balanced against

another data limitation; namely, that many firms have products in several 4-digit industries,

but the firm’s top executives are typically responsible for all of them, and the firm’s financial

statements reflect its overall performance. Conducting the analysis with more disaggregated

industry classifications would exacerbate this problem. 14




141n OUT~mPirical      work, we we the Compustat   “principal   products”   SIC code for the firm’s largest business
segment.   For some firms in which this is given only at the 2- or 3- digit level, we impute the concentration
data for the 2-digit    SIC average.




                                                        27
6.     Empirical Results


Our model specifies executive compensationm         a linear combination of own and rival-firm

profits:



                                     WI = kl + anl + ~7rz                                   (56)

Note that Q and ~ also represent the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities in this

linear compensation contract. The main prediction from the differentiated Bertrand model

is that the relative weight of own profits relative to rival firm profits-the compensation ratio

(a/~) -should be a decreasing function of the degree of substitutability between the two firms’

products. In other words, M products become more substitutable (markets become more

competitive), an executive’s pay will depend less on her own firm’s performance and more

on the performance of rival firms. In contrast, the main prediction of the Cournot model is

that executive compensation hm a constant own-firm pay-performance sensitivity regardless

of the degree of competition in the product market. In this framework, a is positive and @

is negative or zero. To the extent that rival firms’ performance matters, better rival firm

performance decreases executive compensation.

     As discussed above, we make two simplifying assumptions to test our theory empirically.

The first is that the firm’s rivals are the set of firms who also have their principal business

in the same 4-digit SIC code (Below, we will also consider more aggregated industrial clas-

sifications at the 3- and 2-digit levels). The second is that the degree of substitutability in a

firm’s product market can be proxied by the concentration of the firm’s industry. In order

to estimate pay-performance sensitivities, we specify both parameters of the compensation



                                               28
contract as linear functions of the percentile of the firm’s industry in the distribution of

concentration ratios:




                                                                                                                       (57)


where F(H) is the empirical curntiative distribution function (calf) of the Herfindahl index

across 4-digit SICS. F(H)            will equal zero (one) at the minimum (maximum) observed

industry concentrations in our sample. 15 We use the cdf of H as a                       convenient     normalization


that allows for e~y interpretation of the parameters, ~k, in a regression specification. Note

that when the firm’s rivals are alternatively defined m all firms within the same 3- or 2-digit

SICS, we continue to use the Herfindahl for the 4-digit SIC to characterize the degree of

product substitutability the firm faces.

    Given the equations in 57, the Cournot model m~es                          the strong prediction that in a

cross-section of industries: ql >0, q2 <0, and q3 = 7j14
                                                       = O. Alternatively, the prediction for

the Bertrand model will be empirically confirmed if the compensation ratio is an incre~ing

function of the Herfindahl index:



                                                                             >0                                        (58)

where ~(H) is the probability density function associated with F(H).                                  Since f(H)       is a


positive number independent of the parameters, qk, it can be divided out of both sides of

the inequality, leaving:
lsIn our sample,   the Herfindahl   for the leaat concentrated   industry    is 15, i.e., F(15)   = O. Additionally,    the
Herfindahl   is 489 at the median and 2999 for the most concentrated        indust~,   i.e., F(489)   = 0.50 and F(2999)
= 1.

   Equation 59 is a single nonlinear restriction on the parameters of a linear regression

which we fully specify below in equation 65.16               The test statistic is therefore distributed

asymptotically as:



                           W = R (~)’ (G (q) ~ (q) G (~)’)-’        R (q) ‘X2(1)                     (60)

and ~ (q) is the estimated varianc~covariance matrix of the parameters. Note that each

term in the test-statistic depends on the value of F(H).            In our empirical work, we test the

null hypothesis for values of F(H) corresponding to 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75.

   In our oneperiod        model from sections 2 and 3, we referred to nj as the “profits to firm

j .“ In practice, the appropriate variable to use is the total dollar returns to shareholders–

including capital gains and dividends but net of inflationan              their holdings at the beginning

of the period. This is the concept underlying the measures of performance used by Jensen

and Murphy (1990). Own performance for firm ‘j’ is defined as:




where pjt is the total ifiation-adjusted      return to shareholders and Wj)t_l is the beginning

of period market value of firm ‘j.’ In our dataset consisting of large firms in 1993 and 1994,

lGR(q)is   also   equalto ~d~~~).



                                                   30
the mean and median values for Wj,~-l are $3.3 billion and $874 million (in constant 1994

dollars), respectively. We define the total itiation-adjusted                  return to shareholders of rival

firms as:



                                         ~_j , = ~k#j pkt~k,t-1
                                             ,                                                           (63)
                                                  ~k#j Wk,t-1

where the summation is taken over all firms excluding firm ‘j’ in the same SIC code. In our

datmet, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of pjt and p-j,~ are {-12.67Y0, 5.40%, 26.76%}

and {-2 .4670, 10.5070, 27.8070}, respectively. Our measure of rival firm performance is:



                                                                                                         (64)

      Rival firm performance is therefore the hypothetical dollar returns to shareholders of firm
1.>
 J if it experienced the value-weighted average return of other firms in its industry. Studies

of relative performance evaluation typically include ~~t – n~~as an explanatory variable

in a regression for compensation.          We extend that framework first by including the two

components separately and, second, by allowing both pay-performance sensitivities to vary

across industries in proportion to their concentration ratio. Accordingly, we estimate the

following equation:




                      Wijt   =   qln~t   + q2mjt + ~3F(Hj)m~t         +    V4F(Hj)n~t   +                (65)
                                                                 39       94


                                                                k=20t=93

      In this equation, the executive ‘i’ works at firm ‘j’ in year ‘t.’ The dependent variable

is compensation (in constant 1994 dollars), and the first four independent variables are own

and rival firm performance, alone and interacted with the cdf of the Herfindahl index. The


                                                    31
regressions also include the cdf of the Herfindahl itself and an indicator variable that is

equal to one if the executive is a CEO and zero otherwise. The remaining terms, denoted

by ~j~t, are indicator variables for whether fim ‘j’ is in the 2-digit SIC ‘k’ in year ‘t. ’17

The inclusion of these indicator variables ensures that it is not the variation in the aver-

age pay-performance sensitivities between 2-digit industry groups but the variation in the

pay-performance sensitivity within those groups that identifies the estimated coefficient. In-

cluding the industry effects also controls for any other factor such as a macroeconomic shock

that varies across broad industry groups but not within the narrow industries that comprise

them. Note that we cannot estimate the model with a more disaggregated fixed effect (e.g.,

at the level of the firm or the executive) because our memure of the Herfindahl index does

not vary across executives in a given firm or over the two years of data in the sample.

    Table 3a presents the estimates of equation 65 with total compensation as the dependent

variable. In all specifications, executive compensation is denominated in thousands and firm

performance is denominated in millions of constant 1994 dollars. The fist column pertains

to a regression in which the firm’s rivals are all other firms in the sample with the same 4-

digit SIC code. The first coefficient shows that an executive’s total compensation incremes

by 0.11 cents for every thousand dollars of incremental shareholder wealth per year in an

industry that hm the minimum industry concentration (i.e., the one for which F(H) = Oand

is therefore the most competitive).         The third coefficient shows that this pay-performance

sensitivity increases by another 7.92 cents per thousand as industry concentration incremes

from the least to the most concentrated. Thus, the pay-performance sensitivity is 8.03 cents

per thousand at the maximum industry concentration (i.e., the one for which F(H) = l)).

    The second and fourth coefficients show that the rival pay-performance sensitivity is 32.66
lTOne of the ~j~t terms is omitted   from the regression   to avoid linear dependence   among the explanatory
variables.




                                                      32
cents per thousand in the least concentrated (i.e., most competitive) industries and declines

to 32.66 – 34.10 = – 1.44 cents per thousand in the most concentrated (i.e., least competitive)

industries. The rival pay-performance sensitivity changes from positive to negative at the

96th percentile of the Herfindahl index distribution. As shown in the table, at the median

industry concentration, the own pay-performance sensitivity is 0.11 + 0.50 * 7.92 = 4,07 cents

per thousand and the rival pay-performance sensitivity is 32.66 – 0.50* 34.10 = 15.61 cents

per thousand.      In their estimates of the pay-performance sensitivity, Jensen and Murphy

(1990) found that for total compensation, the pay-performance sensitivity was 3.29 cents

per thousand.la        The result that the rival pay-performance sensitivity is positive rather

than negative over almost the entire distribution of industries is inconsistent with models

such as Gibbons and Murphy (1990) which emphasize relative performance evaluation. This

result also contradicts the predictions of the Cournot model that we derived in section 3.

    Although our model abstracts from all other factors that might cause one executive to

be paid more than another, in actual data we have to allow for these factors. In addition

to the full set of 2-digit industry and year interactions, we also include the percentile of

the Herfindahl index itself and a dummy variable that takes on a value of one if the exec-

utive is a CEO and zero otherwise. Including the cdf of the Herfindahl allows for the level

of compensation to be different in more concentrated industries, independent of own and

rival performmce.       The fifth row in the table shows that total compensation incremes by

approximately $38,000 for every decile incre~e in the distribution of the Herfindahl index.

Including the indicator variable is motivated by the differences in the level (more so than in

the composition) of executive compensation revealed in Table 1. The last coefficient shows
18JenSen
       and Murphy (lggo)       had a longitudinal   sample of CEOS from large corporations.          Their   measure
of total pay used in this comparison   did not include the value of stock options     granted.   Additionally,      they
used the change in compensation    as their dependent   variable,   whereas we control for broad industry        effects.




                                                        33
that CEOS receive approximately $1 million more in total compensation than do non-CEOs,

a number that is similar to the unconditional difference shown in Table 1.

   The bottom panel of the table presents the tests of the nonlinear restriction on the pa-

rameters {ql, q2, q3, q4} specified as R (q) >0 that is implied by our differentiated Bertrand

model. In the first entry, where the value of F(H) is set equal to 0.25, the value of the re-

striction is 0.4504 and the test statistic is 15.4154. Since the test statistic is asymptotically

distributed chi-square with one degree of freedom, the null hypothesis that the compensation

ratio is not increasing with H is strongly rejected with a p-value of 0.0001. The null hy-

pothesis is similarly rejected for F(H)   = 0.50 and rejected at the 4 percent significance level

for F(H)   = 0.75. The higher p-values at higher percentiles indicate that we can have less

confidence that the compensation ratio is still increasing with respect to industry concentra-

tion once industries have become highly concentrated. The strong results for the hypothesis

tests can be traced to the pattern of signs on the estimates for {ql, q2, q3, q~}. A sticient

but not necessary condition for R (q) >0 to obtain is that qd be negative and ql, qz, and qa

be positive. This condition will result in ~    >0 and ~      <0, which in turn will guarantee

that the compensation ratio is increasing in H.

   The second and third columns of Table 3a extend the definition of the rival firms to

those in the same 3-digit and 2-digit SICS, respectively. The second column shows that

when the 3-digit SIC is used, the parameter estimates, median pay-performance sensitivities,

and hypothesis tests are similar in magnitude and significance to those in the 4-digit SIC

specification.   The third column shows that when the 2-digit SIC is used, q3 is negative

(though with only marginal significance). Given the magnitudes of the other parameters,

this is enough to make the restriction on the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities

insignificantly negative rather than significantly positive. It is not surprising that the model



                                                34
fails under such a broad definition of the firm’s rivals. It is unlikely that strategic interactions

between firms are as important at the 2-digit level as they are at the narrower 4-digit level.lg



    Table 3b presents the estimates of the same three regressions using short-term compen-

sation as the dependent variable. The results are very similar to those in Table 3a. When

the rivals are defined at the 4-digit or 3-digit SIC level, the ndl hypothesis that the com-

pensation ratio does not increase with industry concentration is strongly rejected. Unlike

the regressions for total compensation, there is no industry concentration level at which the

rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity is negative. At the median industry concentration,

the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivities are 3.21 and 4.11 cents per thousand,

respectively, for the 4-digit SIC rivals and 3.19 md 5.23 cents per thousand for 3-digit SIC

rivals. These results are somewhat higher than Jensen and Murphy’s (1990) range of esti-

mates from 1.35 to 2.19 cents per thousand for salary plus bonus. When the definition of

rivals is extended to the 2-digit SIC level, the restriction value is again negative though not

statistically significant.

    The skewness of the distribution of many of the components of executive compensation

documented in Table 1 raises the possibility that the results in Table 3 are being unduly

influenced by outliers. Tables 4a and 4b estimate the same specifications from Tables 3a

and 3b using median regression. Because median regression minimizes the sum of absolute

deviations rather than the sum of squared deviations, it is less sensitive to outliers than is

ordinary le=t squares. Using this method, the estimates for each of the six specifications

provide stronger support for the predictions of our differentiated Bertrand model: all of

the test statistics are positive and significant below the 0.1 percent significance level, in-
191tis noteworthythat GibbonsandMurphy(1990)found                 larger negative effects in broader   industry   groups
in their estimates   of a relative performance   evaluation    model.




                                                          35
eluding those for the 2-digit SIC definition of rivals, which were previously negative and

insignificant.20 The parameter estimates for {ql, q2, q3, q4} are typically more positive than

in Table 3, resulting in higher values of the own pay-performance sensitivity. At the median

industry concentration, own and rival pay-performance sensitivities are 8.44 and 12.20 cents

per thousand for the 4-digit SICS for total compensation. They are 5.61 and 5.20 cents per

thousand for short-term compensation. The median regressions estimate smaller effects for

the CEO and the industry concentration variables. Thus, the main results from the OLS

regressions are supported and strengthened by the median regressions.

    The optimal contracts based on the parameter estimates for the 4-digit and 3-digit SIC

specifications from Table 4 are graphed in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In each graph, the

horizontal axis represents F(H) and the vertical axis represents the regression estimate of

the compensation ratio:



                                                     :   =    m+mF(H)                                                               (66)

for both total and short-term compensation. Each of the four curves is upward sloping, as

predicted by the differentiated Bertrand model. In both figures, the total compensation ratio

varies more with industry concentration than does the short-term compensation ratio.21 The

greater sensitivity of the total compensation ratio to industry concentration suggests that

shareholders rely more on long-term compensation to accommodate strategic interactions

and that the incentive effects of long-term compensation are greater than those of short-

term compensation.
20The~iance-covaiance ~atr~                of the parameters         and goodness        of fit statistic   are estimated   using the
method    of Koenker    and Bassett     (1982) and Rogers       (1993),      as described     in StataCorp     (1995).

21T0 enhance      the ~aph’s    readability,   the   curves    in   Figure     2    extend   only through     the 95th percentile      of
F(H).    Beyond   that percentile,    the compensation        ratio (a/~)          for total compensation     increases   rapidly   to a
maximum     value of 11.37.




                                                                    36
   In Tables 3 and 4, we have constrained the own and rival-firm pay-performance sensitivi-

ties to be equal for CEOS and non-CEOs, allowing only their average level of compensation to

differ. In Tables 5 and 6, we relax that assumption and estimate the same set of regressions

restricting the sample to only CEOS. The results are qualitatively the same w in the full

sample of executives, with larger magnitudes on all of the coefficients. The pay-performance

sensitivities will be higher in the sample of CEOS because they bear more responsibility for

decisions within the firm that affect own profits and within the industry that affect rival

profits. B~ed on the OLS estimation for total compensation, reported in Table 5a, the

own and rival pay-performance sensitivities at the median industry concentration are 3.10

and 40.34 cents per thousand for 4-digit SICS and 10.50 and 38.44 cents per thousand for

3-digit SICS. B~ed on the median regressions (Table 6a), the median own and rival pay-

performance sensitivities are 7.25 and 41.17 cents per thousand for 4-digit SICS and 7.45

and 41.03 cents per thousand for 3-digit SICS. Thus, the main difference between the esti-

mates for CEOS and those for the full sample is a higher rival pay-performance sensitivity,

not a higher own pay-performance sensitivity
                                           y. The tests of the restriction implied by the

differentiated Bertrand model are similar to those in the full sample but offer weaker statis-

tical evidence. For the 4-digit and 3-digit SIC specifications, the restriction value is always

positive, but it is statistically significant in the OLS regressions only at median industry

concentration or below. The test still rejects the null hypothesis at a significance level below

ten percent in the corresponding median regressions.

   Throughout our theoretical and empirical work, we have limited our me~ure of total

compensation to the annual flow of resources that the shareholders could have kept for

themselves had they not used it to compensate the executive. In practice, m executive also

receives incentives from the effects of her actions on the value of her holdings of stock in



                                              37
her own firm and in her rival firms. If an executive owns stock in her firm, then the total

increme in her wealth due to the performance of her firm will include not only the extra

pay she receives as part of the pay-performance sensitivity built into her compensation but

the appreciation on her personal stock holdings .22                     Recognizing this, the shareholders of

her firm will incorporate a lower own-firm pay-perfomance                          sensitivity into her contract. If

the manager’s holdings of her rival firms’ stock were also known, then her compensation

contract would include a lower rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity as well.

       The consequences of an executive’s personal wealth holdings are straightforward in our

framework. The optimal compensation contract becomes a function of both the degree of

substitutability in the product market and the executive’s holdings of her own firm and her

rivals. Conditional on a particular allocation of the executive’s personal wealth, however,

the relationship between product substitutability and the compensation ratio takes the same

form as in the model of section 2.

       In order for our econometric specifications to remain valid, we would have to control for

the executive’s holdings of her own and rival firms. Since it is impossible to obtain data on

the executive’s holdings of her rival firms, we cannot modify our regressions in this way.23

  In order to test for the robustness of our tidings                     to the incentives provided by inside

ownership, we stratify our sample into two groups of executives: those who had less than

the median wealth in their own firm at the beginning of the sample year and those who had

more than the median. We then run the regressions from Table 3a separately for each group
zzof    the overall    $3.25 per thousand   that Jensen   and Murphy      (1990)    estimated   for the pay-performance
sensitivity,   fully $2.50 was related to changes in wealth due to stockholdings.         Another   $0.30 waa related to
changes in wealth due to dismissal      for poor performance.

2sAdditionally,       ExecUCOrnp
                               doesnot      contain data on the due    of stock options    held at the beginning   of 1993
for many of the executives       in our sample.   Thus,   accounting   for the change in the value of the executive’s
claims on her own firm would eliminate         half of our sample.




                                                            38
of executives. The median wealth in the executive’s own firm in our sample is approximately

$400,000.

   The results of these regressions for the 4-digit SIC and 3-digit SIC specifications are

presented in Table 7. The bottom panel shows that the null hypothesis, that the restriction

implied by the differentiated Bertrand model is not satisfied, is rejected at significance levels

below five percent at the 25th percentile of industry concentration. The null hypothesis is

rejected at significance levels of approximately ten percent or below at the median concen-

tration. At the 75th percentile, the restriction value is always positive, but the p-values are

approximately 0.30 for the low ownership sample and 0.20 for the high ownership sample.

Thus, if the model had been tested only on these smaller groups, it would still be largely

supported by the data. More importantly, the middle panel shows that the comparison of

the compensation ratios across the two groups supports the predictions of the model. The

compensation ratio is higher in the subsample of executives who have low holdings of their

own firms. In the 4-digit SIC specification, the ratio is 1.5441 in the low ownership group

and 0.1080 in the high ownership group.       In the 3-digit SIC specification, the ratios are

1.1643 and 0.1996.

   The results presented in Table 7 support the differentiated Bertrand model in two dis-

tinct ways. First, the compensation ratio is increasing in both the low ownership and high

ownership subsamples.     Second, the compensation ratio itself is greater in the low own-

ership group than in the high ownership group. In the high ownership group, executives

already receive high-powered incentives from their own personal stock holdings. They have

a correspondingly lower compensation ratio. We conclude that the empirical confirmation

of the predictions from our differentiated Bertrand model are robust to the omission of the

executive’s personal wealth from the model.



                                               39
     The regressions of executive compensation on firm performance in Tables 3 through 6

provide strong empirical support for the differentiated Bertrand model derived in section 2.

Under the assumption that the Herfindahl index for a fire’s 4-digit SIC is an appropriate

proxy for the degree of product substitutability, our results show that the sensitivity of

compensation to own performance relative to rival performance decreases with the degree

of product substitutability. Based on these restits, we conclude that strategic interactions

have important effects on the structure of executive compensation.


7.     Discussion

In   our model, compensation contracts are used to influence the nature of competition–in the

case of Bertrand competition, to soften it. There are two major strands in the literature that

consider the effects of competition on the nature of optimal contracts. The first literature

examines the effects of product market competition on agency problems, and the second

literature analyzes the importance of competition for relative performmce evaluation.

     The research of Hart (1983), Scharfstein (1988), and Hermalin (1992) considers whether

or not market competition induces managers to run their firms more efficiently by increasing

their supply of effort. Hart (1983) assumes that the manager’s utility is infinitely negative

below a certain income threshold. This implies that the manager is paid a fixed wage if

she achieves a certain profit target. In equilibrium, when competition increases, firm profits

and the manager’s wage are constant and the manager’s effort increases. The first empirical

prediction is that the own-firm pay-performance sensitivity is positive (ql + qa~(~)    > O).

This prediction is borne out by the data. Second, there is no cross-sectional correlation

between industry concentration and the manager’s own-firm pay-performance sensitivity

(qs = O). This prediction is usually rejected in our empirical work.       Third, there is no



                                              40
correlation between the manager’s compensation and rival firm performance (qz + q~~(~) =

O). This prediction receives no empirical support in our data.

    Scharfstein (1988) allows the manager to be risk averse (but not infinitely so) and derives

the optimal contracts when a productivity parameter is hidden information. In his model,

managerial effort, firm profits, and compensation m a share of profits all decrease when com-

petition increases. Notice that this model implies that managerial effort will decrease (not

increase) in response to an increase in competition, the opposite of Hart’s (1983) result. Our

empirical results support three cross-sectional predictions of this model: that the own-firm

pay-performance sensitivity is positive (ql + q3F(H) > O), that this sensitivity is increasing

with industry concentration (q3 > O), and that the level of compensation is increasing with

industry concentration (q5 > O). Scharfstein’s model provides no predictions regarding the

rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity. It is therefore silent on two of our more robust find-

ings; namely, that the rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity is positive (q2 + q4F(H) > O)

and increming with the degree of product market competition (q4 < O). Thus, Scharfstein’s

model cannot fully explain our empirical restits. 24

    The relative performance evaluation literature, particularly the work of Lazear and Rosen

(1981), Holrnstrom (1982), and Gibbons and Murphy (1990), shows that a risk-averse man-

ager’s compensation should be insulated from common industry-wide shocks to profits. Rel-

ative performance evaluation filters out the common shock by placing a negative weight on

rival firm’s performance. This is true for evaluation of both effort and ability. For effort,

relative performance evaluation allows the principal to infer the agent’s effort choic~this is

and infer the agent’s ability. Our finding of a significant and positive coefficient on rival

firm’s performance when explaining executive compensation is clearly inconsistent with the

predictions of the relative performance evaluation literature.


8.     Conclusion


We have derived the optimal contracts in a principal-agent model of strategic competition in

which managers can be compensated on both their own profits and their rival’s (or industry)

profits.   We demonstrate that when competition is differentiated Bertrand, the optimal

contract compensates the manager positively on both own and rival-firm performance. This

contract has the effect of softening competition. We show that the fraction of compensation

based on rival firm performance is increasing in the degree of competition in the industry.

The need to soften competition is highest in those industries that are most competitive. In

this case, relative performance evaluation, the natural consequence of the principal-agent

framework, would lower returns to shareholders.

     When competition is Cournot, the optimal contract compensates the manager positively

on own-firm performance and negatively on rival-firm performance. This contract intensi-

fies competition and leads to one firm achieving Stackelberg leadership and the other firm

becoming a Stackelberg follower. Such contracts look very much like relative performance

evaluation, but the impetus for their use comes from the nature of competition, not an

agency problem.

     Our empirical findings are consistent with the predictions from our differentiated Bertrand

model and are inconsistent with the predictions from a standard principal-agent model, a

relative performance evaluation model, and our model of Cournot competition.         Firms op-



                                               42
crating in product markets that are more competitive rely less on high-powered incentives

to compensate their managers than do firms in less competitive industries. More generally,

the magnitude of own-firm pay-performance sensitivity is explicitly linked to the magni-

tude of the rival-firm pay-performance sensitivity
                                                 y. Thus, what is import ant for executive

compensation and incentives is the ratio of the pay-performance sensitivities, not the abso-

lute magnitude of either. That only this compensation ratio is identified may provide an

explanation for the widely observed low own-firm pay-performance sensitivity.

     Our theoretical and empirical work also provides an explanation of the Jensen and Mur-

phy (1990) finding that relative performance pay is not an important source of managerial

incentives. If managerial decisions are strategic complements, then relative performance pay

induces managers            to    compete     too   aggressively from the shareholders’ perspective.                       When       the

shareholders’ objective is to foster collusion,                  it   may be more important to ignore relative per-

formance to avoid aggressive behavior rather than to use                            it   to more clearly infer the precise

action taken by the manager. The notion that shareholders should exclude potentially useful

information (the performance of rival firms)                  to      avoid giving the manager incentives                     to   distort

that information shows clearly the potential cotiict                          between strategic competition and the

standard principal-agent trade-off of insurance and incentives. 25                                  Our analysis shows that

providing insurance may come                   at   the cost of not only lower           effort    in    the production process

but detrimental levels of production itself.

    Our results suggest a reinterpretation of some of the findings of Gibbons and Murphy

(1990). They motivate their use of executive pay as a way to test a more general theory

of relative performance evaluation breed                    on        the assumption that “because CEOS tend                           to

ZSA related    point    was made by Gibbons           and Murphy        (1992),   who axgued that basing            compensation       on
potentially   informative        accounting   measures can be counterproductive          because        their use distracts    managers
from maximizing        economic      profits toward maximizing        the more readily observed           accounting   profits.




                                                                 43
have limited interaction with CEOS in rival firms, sabotage and collusive shirking seem un-

likely” (p. 31-S). We start from a different premise; namely, that the nature of oligopolistic

competition makes executives in rival firms interact in ways that are fundamental to the ob-

jectives of the firms’ shareholders. As Gibbons and Murphy go on to note, “Paying workers

based on relative performance instead of absolute performance distorts the worker’s incen-

tives whenever the worker can take actions that affect the average output of the reference

group” (p. 34-S). In our framework, pay based on relative performance would give the ex-

ecutive an incentive to price too aggressively in a differentiated Bertrand model, opposing

the shareholders’ objectives to soften competition.          The Gibbons and Murphy result that

CEO performance is more likely to be evaluated relative to agg-regate market movements

than to industry movements is consistent with our model. Valu&maximizing shareholders do

not give their executives strong incentives to outperform their most immediate competition.

Within narrow industries, product market considerations are likely to dominate consider-

ations of relative performance. To the extent that shareholders provide insurance to their

executives as dictated by the standard principal-agent model, they rely more heavily on

benchmarks that do not interfere with strategic competition.

   Finally, we believe that a model of executive compensation that incorporates product

market considerations can help to answer an outstanding question in the literature on in-

centives. In “A Survey of Corporate Governance,” Shleifer and Vishny (1996, p. 56) note

that:


        Given the large impact of executives’ actions on values of firms, why aren’t

        very high powered incentive contracts used more often in the United States and

        elsewhere in the world? Is their use limited by optimal design of incentives, by

        fear of self-dealing, or by distributive politics?


                                                  44
       The principal-agent model’s emphasis on the trade-off between incentives and insurance

    ignores the importance of strategic competition in product markets to the value of the firm.

    Our model predicts that product market competition is fundamental to the way shareholders
*
    structure managerial incentives. Our empirical work cofirms      this idea.   Thus, we offer

    a straightforward explanation for the infrequent use of high-powered incentives–they are

    typically not optimal for shareholders.

   Proof of Proposition     6

                 + a’)




   Because there is no interior maximum, the first order conditions do not characterize an

equilibrium. In order to find equilibria, we examine the extreme points for contracts.

   Suppose that the manager of firm 1 chooses a = M, ~ = M. This generates payoffs of



                                             53
   W{=kl+~(A+E–            C)2~

   w:=k2+;        (A+ E–c)2;      .

   The manager of firm 2’s best respome then is to choose ~ as large as possible, or ~ = M,

and 6 can be arbitrary. In order to characterize an equilibrium, we must find a 15along with

~ = M that make a = M, ~ = M the best response for the manager of firm 1. Setting

6 = –M results in a payoff to the manager of firm 1 of

   W~=kI+~(A+&–             C)2~.

   It is   immediate that a >0 in order for the manager of firm 1 to earn a positive payoff.

Further, in order for firm 1‘s quantity choice to be nonnegative, it must be the case that

a z ~ because

   ~; = 7 (P – ~) ~(_3a7~:;:p+7p) = –; (P – ~) *.

   But the manager of firm 1’s payoff is increasing in ~, which results in a = ~ = M, which

establishes the equilibrium. In this case, the manager of firm 1 produces q? = O and the

                                                      1 A+~–c
manager of tim 2 produces at the monopoly level, qj = ~~.                The manager’s expected

payoffs are:

   ~[w;] = kl + ; ((A – C)2 + ~2) ~

   ~[w:] = kz + ~    ((A - C)2 + 02) ~.

   As the managers share monopoly rents, this outcome cannot be improved on for the

managers. As both a and v must be positive, the other extreme point to check is a =

M, ~ = –M.       Because the problem is symmetric, we have already analyzed this situation

for the manager of firm 2, and so we have found our two pure strategy equilibria. As no

internal solutions exist, these are the only pure strategy equilibria.
