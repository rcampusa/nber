                             THE BEST BUSINESS SCHOOLS;
                             A MARKET BASED APPROACH


                                         ABSTRACT

       We present a new methodology for ranking business schools. Unlike previous rankings
based on subjective survey responses (from CEOs, business school deans, recruiters, or
graduates), our approach uses data derived from the labor market for new MB As. We adjust
programs' salaries for the quality of entering students in an attempt to distinguish value added
from the quality of incoming students. We then rank programs according to value added. Our
results are rather surprising. While four of our top five programs are also labelled as top
programs in other rankings, ten of our top twenty are previously unranked. By emphasizing
program value added, our procedure identifies several programs that have been overlooked by
other rankings since they do not recruit the very top students. We explore the determinants of
our value added and student quality measures and find that connections to the business
community are positively related to value added, while academic research and high faculty
salaries are more stongly associated with student quality. We also find that tuition is better
explained by our measure of value added than raw salary, suggesting that programs charge
according to value added.

         The past few decades have witnessed tremendous growth in the training of MBAs. The

number of MBAs awarded annually has risen from 5,000 in 1960 to more than 70,000 in 1989.'

Over 650 schools in the country now offer an MBA degree. Demographic changes suggest that this

enrollment growth will not continue in the future.2 Sensing a shakeout coming in the decade ahead,

business schools are strenuously competing to achieve or maintain top rankings as means of survival.

This has necessarily fbcused attention on the process of ranking business schools.

         Previous rankings of business schools have been constructed using a variety of sources and

methods. Rankings have been based on interviews with CEOs, business school deans, recruiters, and

graduates. In 1986, Business Week (BW) published a ranking based on interviews with 486 top

executives. In 1987, U.S. News & World Report published a ranking based on interviews with 131

deans. Jn 1988, BW published a widely publicized ranking reflecting both the views of recruiters and

business school graduates. These rankings differ significantly because of the differing criteria used by

each constituent group to evaluate business programs.

        In this paper, we present a new methodology for ranking business schools. Unlike previous

rankings, our approach does not use subjective responses from various constituent groups. Rather, we

use data derived from the labor market for MBAs.5 Our approach can be viewed as a modification

of the simple method of ranking by average starting salary. We standardize salaries for the quality of

the students entering each program in an attempt to isolate the program's value added. A basic goal

of our paper is to distinguish the quality of the program from the quality of its incoming students.

Our results are rather surprising. While four out of our top five programs are also labelled as top

programs in other rankings, ten out of our top twenty program are previously unranked. By

    3To use a sports analogy, each year there is considerable interest in which college football teani is
the best in the country. The current method of resolving this issue is through polls by sports writers.
An alternative which is often suggested is a ranking based on a post season tournament. We view the
labor market for MBAs as the playing field where business programs compete, and use this rather than
taking polls of deans (coaches), recruiters (scouts), or players (graduates).
 emphasizing program value added, our procedure identifies several programs that have been
 overlooked by other rankings since they do not recruit the very top students.

        We make several other contributions to the school ranking debate. First, we take the study of

 MBA rankings a step further by examining the detenninants of a school's ranking. For example, how
 essential are academic   research, faculty salaries, and alumni networks to a program's success? We

present regression results which assess the contributions of various characteristi√≥s of business
programs to a school's ranking. Second, we test our measure of value added by asking whether it -
or starting salary of graduates - better explains tuition. Finally, because our evaluation is a by-

product of statistical estimation, we can report measures of precision for our rankings. Through
simulation we determine the frequency that a school is ranked in the top 5 and top 20. This allows us

to report confidence intervals for these classifications.



                                        1. BusIness School Data

        Data for this study come primarily from a survey conducted by the authors. Our survey, sent

to deans at 85 business schools, requested information about the MBA class of l991. We sought

information about students' backgrounds, their immediate post-MBA job placement, and the

characteristics of the MBA programs. We received 49 responses for an overall response rate of 58

percent. although response rates vary significantly across requested data items. Relevant survey

information on student backgrounds included GMAT (43 responses), undergraduate (WA (43), percent

of students with advanced degrees prior to business school (30), percent with full-time work

experience of greater than a year (43). We also asked about the number of applications (38) and

acceptances (34) and nonresident tuition (42).




    4We chose programs two ways. First, we selected programs designated as 'top' programs in the
business press, e.g. Byrne (1991), Stuart and Stuart (1990). Second, we included the major state school
in most states lacking a top program.

                                                     2
         Requested placement information included mean starting salaries, as well as the distributions

of placements by occupation (finance, marketing, consulting, operations, accounting, general

 management, and other), by industry (manufacturing, services and nonprofit), and by region (by ur

census regions and foreign and by major cities, see below). We supplemented our survey using the

secondary sources listed in appendix Al. The data set we ultimately use for analysis covers 63 MBA

programs.5 Summary statistics are provided in Table Al.



                                      2. Measuring Value Added

        Two principles guide our ranking procedure. The first principle is that rankings should be

based on measurable criteria that are comparable across programs. BW's widely cited rankings fail to

meet this innocuous-sounding criterion. Their rankings are based in part on a survey of graduates in

which respondents rate their own programs on a scale from 1-10 according to 30 criteria. As an

example, question I asks: "To what extent did your MBA experience fulfill or fail to meet your

expectations of what a good program should be?' The reply to this question will be comparable

across programs only if each program's students have, on average, identical expectations. This would

arise, for example, if students were allocated randomly to MBA programs; but, this clearly is not the

case. Expectations and other student characteristics vary across programs making graduate ratings of

their own MBA experiences incomparable.

        The second principle is that rankings should be based on 'outputs' rather than 'inputs."6 A

difficulty in devising a ranking system is the lack of consensus on what business programs should be

producing. In this paper, we focus on the degree to which business programs are successful in




    5We have mean starting salary data on 63 programs. Of these 63 programs, we are missing one
program's GMAT. we are missing the percent of students with advanced degrees for two programs, and
we are missing the selectivity variable (the ratio of acceptances to applications) for two programs. Rather
than lose these observations, we impute the missing values by regressing each of the five explanatory
variables in Table 2 on the other four, then solving for the missing values.

    6This distinction can be difficult to make in practice. For example, academic research can be viewed
as an output of a business program as welt as an input into the training process of MBA students.

                                                    3
  producing high-salary jobs for their graduates. Given a competitive labor market for MBAs, salaries

  will reflect the willingness of employers to pay for the attributes embodied in a program's

  graduates.7 A program which attracts high quality students may generate high salaries for its

 graduates without adding value to them. To isolate a program's value added to the students, we

 standardize the salary data ftr the quality of the program's incoming students.8



                       2.1 AdJusting Salary by Region, Occupation and Industry

         Reported salary figures reflect regional differences in cost-of-living as well as wage

 differentisis based on occupation and industry (including whether the job is in the non-profit sector).

 To make our salary data comparable across programs, we adjust starting salaries
                                                                                 using school-specific
 deflators which reflect each school's regional and occupation/industry placement
                                                                                  composition.
         To control for regional cost-of-living differentials, we use the Bureau of Labor Statistics

 (BLS) intermediate income urban cost-of-living budget data (BLS 1982). These data indicate the cost
 of purchasing a common basket of goods across twenty-four major metropolitan areas, as well as an

overall urban area average. We delete from the budget amount the component due to personal income

taxes. The resulting budget figures are normalized by the overall urban average to yield an index
value for each city.

        We compute four regional index values using the population-weighted average of the indices

for the cities in each region. The BLS last produced budget data for 1981. We update the index to

1990 using the CPI Urban
                         Wage Earner index (1982-1984=100) (81.5 1991). This index gives the
current cost-of-living in each of these cities relative to the base period. We compute school-specific


     7We acknowledge that starting salaries are an imperfect measure of the labor market performance of
a progranfs graduates. No infbrmation is provided on the growth rate of earnings on the job or on the
expected job duration. Data limitations, however, prevent us front using a measure of the present value
of career earnings.

    8The methodology we use is similar to that used in the urban economics literature to construct quality
of life indices fir metropolitan areas. See for example Rosen (1979), Robaclc (1982). and Gyourko &
Tracy (1991). The issue of cream-slcimming" arises in many other contexts. See Cragg (1993) for an
application to performance evaluation in the government job training programs.

                                                    4
cost-of-living indices using the city and regional distribution of their graduates' placement. The index
is calculated as a placement-weighted average of the city and regional cost-of-living indices. The
resulting regional salary deflators vary between a low of 0.91 and a high of 1.13.
         Business schools also differ in the occupations and industries chosen by their graduates. Some

programs send a substantial fraction of their graduates to work in high-paying consulting firms, while

other programs place a substantial fraction of graduates in low-paying nonprofit institutions. Whether

we should adjust a program's average salary for occupation and industry depends on the determinants
of the occupation/industry salary structure for MBAs. lithe salary structure reflects ability and skill
differences of the MBAs hired into each field, then MBA graduates choosing high-salary

occupations/industries would have earned high salaries regardless of their choice. In this case, we
should not adjust salaries for occupation and industry. On the other hand, salary differentials may

reflect compensation for job attributes such as stress and average hours that systematically vary across

jobs in different occupations and industries, in this case, we need to adjust the average starting
salaries for each school's occupational/industry placement composition.9

        Identifying the extent to which the MBA salary structure reflects compensating wage

differentials would require data on job attributes for MBA jobs disaggregated by occupation and

industry. We do not have such data. In light of this, the best we can do is to estimate

occupation/industry wage differentials adjusting for self-selection based on the observed ability of the
MBAs. To do this requires micro data on MBAs which identifies the individual characteristics that
we use to predict student quality.

        We obtained five years of data from a leading business school on starting salary, occupation,

industry, GMAT, age, prior work experience, and gender. Using this data we regress each MBA
graduate's starting salary on a set of individual characteristics, class year indicators, and
occupation/industry indicators. The results, in Table A2, provide some evidence on whether selection
on observed ability affects the occupation/industry salary structure for MBAs. The regression in


    9See Dickens and Katz (1987), Krueger and Summers (1987), and Murphy and Topel (1987) for a
discussion of the determinants of the overall occupation/industry wage structure in the U.S..

                                                     5
 column (I) includesobservable measures of ability while the regression in column (2) omits these

 controls. The resulting occupation/industry wage diffrrentials are virtually identical in the two

 specifications.'0 Our data suggest that self-selection based on observed ability is not prominent in

 the MBA labor market. However, the occupation/industry wage differentials estimated in

 specification (1) may still be biased from selection on unobserved ability. Addressing this issue would

 require panel data which fbllows MBA graduates through their future job changes, data which are

unavailable.

         These results suggest that occupation/industry salary differentials depend primarily on job,

rather than student, characteristics. Hence, we use the estimated occupation/industry wage

differentials from specification (I) of Table A2 and each school's occupation/industry placement

profile to construct school-specific occupation/industry deflators. We combine the regional and

occupation/industry deflators into an overall salary deflator which we use to adjust starting salaries

across programs. Table I gives the top 20 schools in our sample sorted by adjusted average starting

salary. In addition, we list the unadjusted starting salaries and the salary deflators. The adjusted

salary distribution is more compressed than the unadjusted salary distribution. The standard deviation

of adjusted salary is $8,476 while the standard deviation of unadjusted salary is $10,511.



                                   2.2 AdjustIng lot Student Quality

        We now turn to standardizing the output measure (adjusted salary) for the quality of inputs

(incoming students). Our approach is to weight a variety of student characteristics into a single index

ol' student quality. After identifying a set of characteristics which reflect underlying student quality

differences, we assign relative weights again appealing to the labor market. We weight each

characteristic using its coefficient from a regression of adjusted average starting salary on average




    10'Fhe Chi-square test for the equality of the occupation/industry wage differentials in the two
specificationi is 9.74, which has a probability value of 0.20.

 student characteristics. Our resulting measure of "student quality" is the fitted value from this salary

 regression, while our measure of a school's "value added" is the residual from this regression.11

           The regression used to construct our student quality index is given in specification (2) of Table

 2. Summary statistics and information on sources are given in Table Al. The two most important

 student quality variables are the average GMAT and the percent of students with at least a year of

 full-time work experience. The marginal effect for GMAT turns positive at a score of 546, which is

 slightly above the minimum score observed in our sample. Business programs whose students score

 higher on the GMAT and who have more prior work experience have significantly higher starting

 salaries upon graduation, and are therefore better inputs into the MBA training process. Figure 1

 provides simple plots of our adjusted starting salary measure and the GMAT and work experience for

 each school in our sample. Each of these determinants is clearly positively correlated with adjusted

 salary.

           The three other coefficients reported in the specification (I) of the quality regression have the

expected sign but are not precisely measured. Controlling for the average GMAT score of the

incoming class, an increase in the average undergraduate grade point average has a positive but

imprecisely measured effect on starting salaries. The adjusted salary - and, we infer, quality of the

incoming students - is higher when a greater fraction enter with a graduate degree. Finally, the

quality of the incoming students may be higher as a result of a wide applicant pool from which to

select)2 This is supported by the negative coefficient on the schools' ratio of acceptances to

applications. We construct our student quality and value added measures using the fitted values and

residuals from specification (2), which omits the insignificant variables.




    For a similar analysis of the determinants of the average starting salaries of lawyers see Table I of
Ehrenberg (1989).

     t2Admissions offices have more information available to them on which to base their decisions than
is reflected in the variables reported in Table 2. If on average this information is useful for screening out
the less qualified candidates, then average quality among the admitted students should be increasing in the
selectivity of the admissions process.

                            2.3 Is Our Value Added Measure Reasonable?

        Our measure of value added, the residual from the adjusted salary regression, provides a

measure   of how unexpectedly high - or low - a program's adjusted     starting salary is, given the
observed characteristics of its incoming students. We interpret this residual as the relative

enhancement of starting salaries that is induced by the business program itself. This interpretation

attributes all differences in salary, conditional on student characteristics, to differences across

programs in value added. Alternatively, residual post-MBA salary differences may reflect residual

pre-MBA salary differences. That is. our measure of value added may be biased due to the

nonrandom assignment of students to business programs conditional on observed characteristics in our

data which results from the admissions process.

        A program's adjusted salary might be high, given its students' average GMATs and work
experience, because business programs may admit candidates on the basis of characteristics which lead

to high starting salaries, and are observed to the admissions office but unobserved in our data. For
example, some programs may interview candidates and select those with charisma. If charisma

enhances salaries, then such programs' adjusted salaries will reflect not only value added by the MBA
program but also screening by the admissions office.13 As a result, our value added measure, the

post-MBA salary residual, will partly reflect pre-MBA unobserved salary heterogeneity in addition to
value added by the program,

        The natural approach to this problem is to measure a program's value added by comparing

students' pre- and post-MBA salaries. Limited longitudinal data allow us to explore this method. We
have pre- and post-MBA salary data for 35 schools which we can use to calculate the change in

salary, Isy = y,,,, -        The use of 4y as a measure of program value added would be valid if



   t3Our inclusion of an admissions selectivity variables partially avoids this problem, but the problem
may linger given the inherent difficulty of measuring selectivity across different self-selected applicant
pools.
    t4Pre and post-MBA salary data for the class of 1992 are from Byrne (1993), No information is
available to adjust the pre-MBA salary for regional and industryfoccupational differences in admission
profiles. Consequently, we use unadjusted pre- and post-MBA average salaries in the analysis.

                                                     8
 there were no complementarities between student quality and program quality in the production of
 business education.

           To explore this issue we estimated the foltowing regression:
      -             + , where X contains the student characteristics used above to explain the level of
          ye,,
 post-MBA salary. Here, 3(8 is intended to capture the degree of complementarity in the business

 education production function while i is the component of the change in salary that is independent of

 student characteristics.15 We reject the hypothesis that   6=   0 (for instance, students at programs

with higher average GMATs experience higher average salary growth). For this reason, we prefer 17

over Esy as a measure of program value added derived from the longitudinal data.

           How similar are the rankings resulting from ij and the post-MBA residual,         when both

are calculated front the same longitudinal salary data? Figure 2 plots 17 against Cr,,,. The two

measures are highly correlated (0.88), and the resulting rankings are very similar. Appendix Table
A4 presents thetop 20 business schools (of the 35 programs for which pre- and post-MBA salary data

are available) based on the post-MBA salary residual e41,0,, and based on ,. We conclude from this

evidence that the rankings resulting from our approach are not driven by the mistaken attribution of

unobserved differences in pre-MBA salary to our value added measure.

          Table 3 presents the top twenty schools in our sample sorted by our measure of student quality

based on student quality were ranked in BW's top 20. Not surprisingly, 17 of these schools were also
in the top 20 based on adjusted salary.

           The student quality ranking is based on estimation. Sampling variation in the underlying

regression coefficients will produce variation in the resulting rankings. Thus, we can compute
measures of precision associated with each rank. The standard deviation of a school's rank was

estimated using simulation methods. We generate new coefficient estimates using the estimated

distribution of the coefficients derived from our quality regression. For each new set of coefficients,

we recalculate the ranking. We replicate this process 100,000 times, which produces a distribution of
ranks for each school. The standard deviation of this distribution is reported in the table.



                                        3. Top Business Schools
        We are now ready to present our value added rankings of the top business schools. Recall,
we measure each school's value added using the school's residual from the adjusted salary regression

reported in specification (2) of Table 2, Table 4 presents the top twenty business schools based on

our methodology. Stanford University ranks highest, while Harvard, Chicago, Virginia, and Wharton
round out the top five. Except for Virginia, each of these schools was also in the top 5 of the BW

ranking.

        Our methodology produces some surprises of inclusion in, and exclusion from, the top twenty.
For example, Dartmouth, Columbia, and UCLA are all in the SW top 10, yet do not appear in our
top 20. These schools rank very high on our student quality measure, but do not produce

commensurately high starting salaries. Consequently, our methodology assigns a low value added to
these programs. In contrast, Oklahoma State, New Mexico, and Wake Forest are in our top 10, but
are not in the BW top 20. These schools are in the opposite situation; their graduates earn moderately

high starting salaries despite having relatively modest student characteristics. The appearance of such

different programs in our top 20 highlights the difference between our value added approach and the



should be kept in mind when interpreting the rankings in this paper.

traditional rankings. In particular, our results suggest that existing rankings implicitly assign a large
weight to the quality of students when evaluating the quality of the programs themselves.

         Table 4 also reports two columns indicating the percentage of times in 100,000 replications
that a school is in the top 5 and top 20. This allows us to calculate confidence intervals for these two
classiflcations. For example, three (fourteen) schools are in the top 5 (20) in at least 90% of the

simulations. In contrast, eight (twenty seven) schools are in the top 5 (20) in at least 10% of the
simulations.

         Two observations are in order. First, it is important to recognize that the value added
estimates, and associated rankings, are based on the current allocation of students to programs. Thus,
our rankings should be understood to reflect the value added currently conveyed to the students at

each of the programs, not the value added that would unconditionally be transmitted to any students at

these programs. Second, while the ranking of any particular program can be distorted by

measurement error (particularly in salary), the overall pattern of rankings, with traditional top schools
near the top and less well-known programs completing the top 20, is not driven by measurement
error.


                               4. Determinants of Program Quality
         Previous approaches to ranking business programs do not attempt to determine the factors

contributing to their overall ranking. Yet, this is an important matter for investigation. Deans are
continually faced with decisions affecting the scope and content of their programs, and the effect of

these decisions on the performance of the programs is relevant to these decisions. We investigate this
issue by examining the relationship between schools' value added and a set of program characteristics,

including the quality of the alumni network, faculty research quality, and faculty salary. Data
availability limits the extent to which we can explore other program characteristics.

         To explore the determinants of program quality, we regress our measure of value added on

program characteristics. There are two qualification to keep in mind as we proceed. First, given the

complementarities between student and program characteristics that we demonstrated earlier, there is

                                                   11
no unique decomposition of starting salary into student quality and value added. Second, we have

adopted a two-step estimation strategy in which we first regress starting salary on student

characteristics, and then we regress the salary residual (value added) on program characteristics. If

student and program characteristics were orthogonal in the data, then this two-step procedure would

produce the same coefficients as a pooled estimation. The data, though, reject this orthogonality.17

While the two procedures are statistically distinct, meaningful differences do not exist. The rankings

produced by both methods are virtually the same and the qualitative findings are identical)5 We

prefer the two-step procedure for its methodological simplicity.

        The first program characteristic we include is a measure of each school's alumni network.

Specifically, we calculated the number of Business Week 1000 firms with CEOs from each business

program)9 Schools with more connections to top firms, as measured by the training of their CEOs,

may have an advantage in placing their recent graduates. Alternatively, this variable may simply

measure current success in terms of past success. Harvard is a outlier according to this measure with

79 CEOs to its credit. Stanford ranks second with 23 CEOs. We present these regressions with and

without Harvard in the sample to check for robustness of the results.

        We control for two characteristics of the business school's faculty. The first is a proxy for

the research intensity of the faculty. Unfortunately, we do not have any direct measure of research

intensity for all of the schools in our sample. What we can measure is the research output of the

economics department in the same university. Limited available evidence indicates that this is as an




    '7The specification test for the equality of the coefficients on the student quality variables estimated
with and without the program characteristics results in a chi-square statistic of 20.4, which is highly
significant.

    18Let X represent the students characteristics used above in the adjusted salary regression. Z represent
the program characteristics, and Y our adjusted salary data. If we regress Y on X and Z. then the
residual e = Y - X $ produces virtually the same ranking as     used above.

    19See Roman, Mims, & Jespersen (1991).

                                                     12
 adequate proxy.20 The measure used is the citations per faculty taken from Liebowita & Palmer

 (1988). The data are normalized as a percent of the level of citations at the University of
                                                                                               Chicago.
 The second characteristic is the level of faculty salary. Specifically, we include a dummy variable

 which takes a value of one for schools whose faculty salaries are rated "well above average" based on

 the AAUP rating system for their category of institution. This classification is taken from Barron's

 (1990).

         Table 5 presents the results from regressions of value added and student quality on
                                                                                             program
 characteristics. Since the dependent variables are estimated from a previous stage, we
                                                                                        estimate this

 regression using weighted least squares. The weight applied to each school is the precision of the
 estimate of the dependent variable.21

           The results in Table 5 indicate that business networks have a positive impact on both value

added and student quality, significant in the case of value added. When we exclude Harvard, then the

marginal effect of business networks more than triples in magnitude. With Harvard excluded, each

additional BW 1000 CEO among a school's alumni is associated with over a $700 increase in our

measure of value added. A standard deviation change in our business network variable (3.8) leads to

a $2,888 increase in value added, or roughly one half of the standard deviation of value added in the

sample. The impact of business networks on student quality is roughly half the magnitude of its effect
on value added.

        Research intensity and high faculty salaries have weak and insignificant impacts on value

added, but stronger and more significant effects on student quality. Schools paying high faculty

salaries attract on average students that are over $4,000 better in our quality measure, roughly two-

thirds a standard deviation of student quality in the sample. Similarly, increasing a school's research

 intensity by 17 percentage points (one standard deviation) results in over an $1,800 increase in student
 quality.
            The coefficients on research intensity and faculty salaries reported in Table 5 must be

 interpreted in light of the other variables being held constant. That is, given a program's business
connections, increasing its focus on research andfor moving to the right tail of the faculty salary
distribution does not appear to directly contribute to a program's value added. However, research

intensity and high faculty salaries may still have an important indirect effect by making it possible for
a school to maintain its business network. To investigate this, we estimated the value added

specification dropping the BW 1000 CEOs variable. In this case, the coefficient (standard error) on

research intensity was 75 (44) and on faculty salary was 616 (1.606). Research intensity, then, does

have a positive and marginally significant relationship to value added when we do not control for a
school's existing business network.

         We would like to briefly describe the results from some alternative value added and student

quality specifications that we estimated. As an additional control for teaching quality, we included a

variable measuring the percent of classes taught by instructors with Ph.D.'s. This variable was
insignificant in both specifications. We also included an indicator variable which takes the value of
one if a school makes grades available to recruiters. This grade policy had a positive but insignificant
effect on value added, both with Harvard in and out of the sample. In contrast, this grade policy had

a sizeable negative effect on student quality that is robust to including or excluding Harvard. Schools

that provide grade information are estimated to attract students that are on average $2,000 lower in
quality (however the standard error on this estimate is around $1,600). If withholding grades fosters a

cooperative learning environment, then there is weak evidence that this enhances a school's ability
to attract better qualified students.



                                  5. You Pay For What You Receive
        The last section of the paper explores the issue of what determines the tuition charged by

MBA programs. If schools compete for MBA students, then tuition should be an increasing function

                                                     14
of the quality of the program. Better programs should be able to collect higher fees from its students.
If our value added methodology is sensible, then the a school's value added should have a stronger

association with its tuition than does its adjusted salary.

        Table 6 gives regressions of tuition on adjusted salary and value addedP We include an
indicator variable to control fix the private status of a school. The first column indicates that tuition
fbr business programs in private schools is higher on average by $6,793. It is interesting to note that
this tuition differential remains largely undiminished after we control for either adjusted salary or
value added. We also find no evidence of an interaction between private status and the slope of the

tuition/adjusted salary or the tuition/value added relationship. The second column indicates that each

additional dollar of adjusted starting salary is associated with 14 cents in additional tuition.

        We estimate the tuition/value added relationship using instrumental variables. The reason is
that value added is an estimated variable. Measurement error in the estimation process will lead to a
downward biased estimate of its coefficient. To correct for this, we instrument for value added using
the variables reported in Table 5. The results in column three show that each additional dollar of

adjusted salary is associated with 44 cents in additional tuition. At the margin, then, tuition has a

stronger relationship to what a school offers a student in terms of value added than simply adjusted

salary.23



                                               Conclusion
        In this paper, we present a new methodology for evaluating the performance of MBA

programs. The ranking is based on the performance of each school's graduates in the labor market
for MBAs. A school's performance is judged by its value added rather than its adjusted salary. Our



    11We do not have sufficient information on fellowships by school to standardize the tuition amounts.
School's may raise their tuition and also their level of fellowship support in an attempt to price
discriminate in their admissions.

   23Using 1985 data, Ehrenberg (1989) finds a similar tuition differential for private law schools
controlling for quality of the law program as indicated by the law school's Gourman score.

top seven business programs all have received praise from other rankings. However, our procedure

does pick out several schools that are not high salary schools, but deserve credit for adding value to

their students. Similarly, several schools with high salaries and high praise in other quarters are poor

performers using our methodology. This reflects the fact that they attract exceptionally high quality

students who do not receive correspondingly high average salaries. This underscores the fact that our

methodology is not simply a relabeling of the underlying starting salary. Further, our results suggest

that the existing widely cited rankings implicitly give substantial weight to the quality of a program's

students, rather than focusing on the quality of the programs themselves.

        We extend the earlier debate by attempting to find variables that are correlates of value added.

A school's connections with the business community is a positive force in determining a school's

ranking. In contrast, research intensity and high faculty salaries have a stronger impact on the quality

of a school's students. Finally, we find that the tuition a program can charge has a stronger

connection to the program's value added than to its adjusted salary.
