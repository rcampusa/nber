               Carrots and Sticks: Pay, Supervision and Turnover




                                    ABSTRACT




      Large and persistent differences across industries in wages paid for given
occupations have commonly been observed. Recently, the efficiency wage model
(EWN) has been advanced as an explanation for these wage differentials. The
shirking version of the EWM assumes a trade—off between self—supervision and
external supervision.    The turnover version assumes turnover is costly to the
firm.    Variation across firms in the cost of monitoring/shirking or turnover
then are hypothesized to account for wage variation across firms for homogeneous
workers.
      This paper presents empirical evidence of the trade—off of wage premiums
for supervisory intensity and turnover. A new sample of 200 firms in one sector
in one state in 1982 is analyzed. Little evidence Is found to support either
version of EWM. The substantial variation in wages for narrowly defined occu-
pations across firms remains largely unexplained.

1. Introduction

     Large and persistent differences in pay for a given occupation are commonly

observed across establishments and industries.     If both workers and jobs are

homogeneous, such differences are not predicted by standard theory.        Such

findings have then been taken as the basis for more complex theories of wage

determination.

      Principal—agent models extend standard theory to cases of imperfect in-

formation.   This paper examines the particular case in which employees cannot

directly and costlessly observe a worker's effort or output. The monitoring

problem may be addressed either by purchasing more direct supervision, or by

purchasing self—supervision.     The latter choice results in what appear to be

occupation and firm specific wage premiums.     The aim of this paper is to de-

termine whether there is evidence to support monitoring problems as an expla-

nation for differences across plants in occupational wages. In particular, this

paper searches for empirical evidence of a trade—off in production between

supervision and wage premiums.

     A second version of the efficiency wage model explains wage premiums as a

mechanism to reduce turnover.     Firms which find turnover particularly costly

will find it profitable to offer wage bonuses so as to reduce turnover. This

paper also offers empirical evidence of the tradeoff between turnover and wage

premi ums.

     These two variants of the efficiency wage hypothesis are discussed further

in the next section. The accumulated evidence on industry and establishment

differences in occupational wages is surveyed in Section 3. Section 4 describes

the plant level data on wages and supervision analyzed here.      Tests of the

trade—off between wage premiums and supervision are presented in Section 5.
Section 6 presents tests of the effect of wage bonuses on turnover. The con-

clusions follow.



2.    Efficiency Wage Models

      The foundations of efficiency wage theory are reviewed by Katz (1986), from

which this section draws.            Following Yellen (1984), consider an economy of

identical firms in perfect competition, each with production function:



(1)      P = aF[e(w)L]


where

         e = The efficiency function giving the effort of the worker,
                > 0, e'1 < 0
         L = Number of employees, all homogeneous
         w = Real wage
         Q = Output
         a = Productivity shifter



      The profit maximizing firm chooses both the level of wages, and the quantity

of labor to satisfy:




(2)      eI(w*)w*/e(w*) =       1


and

(3)      e(w*)aFI[e(w*)L] =



In other words at the optimal wage, the elasticity of effort with respect to

the wage is equal to 1.        This minimizes wage costs per efficiency unit of labor.

The second condition i s standard:              marginal product equals marginal factor
price. This model has been offered as an explanation both for unfalling
                                                                        wages




                                                                                     2
in the face of unemployment, and for wage dispersion across firms for identical

workers.

    This basic efficiency wage model has been developed in a number of versions

(Akerlof, 1984; Stoft, 1982).      The shirking and turnover variants concern us

here. The shirking model is driven by imperfect information: the firm cannot

perfectly observe the effort or output of workers, and supervision is costly.

The firm cannot impose "ultimate" sanctions on employees: threats of infinite

cost (hanging) sufficient to compel non—shirking with infinitesimal super-

vision.    Nor can firms fine, sue, or extract performance bonds from workers.

Piece rates are also assumed to be impracticable given the difficulty of ob-

serving effort or output. The firm's problem is then to develop an effort—

eliciting pay mechanism. Wage premiums may offer the appropriate incentives

for self—supervision.     Such shirking models are developed in Shapiro and

Stiglitz (1984) and the earlier literature reviewed there.

      Wage dispersion for identical workers arises in such models because of

differences across firms in 1) the cost of monitoring, and 2) the cost to the

firm of employee shirking. The level of such bonuses depends in turn on 3) the

expected duration of employment.

     The turnover variant of the efficiency wage model is similar in structure

to the shirking variant. Assume firms bear part of the costs of turnover, and

that turnover decreases with wages.     Firms with higher turnover costs have an

incentive to pay high relative wages to reduce turnover. See Salop (1979) and

Stiglitz (1974). Firms also have an incentive to use tenure bonuses, or to have

workers post bonds or pay for their own hiring and training costs. For evidence

against the use of tenure bonuses, see Abraham and Farber (1985) and Altonji

and Shakotko (1985).     Where these alternatives are restricted, the turnover




                                                                              3
model predicts that high wages, associated with high turnover costs, will cause

lower turnover rates. This is an empirically testable proposition.



3. Past Studies: Industry Wage Effects

     To my knowledge, there have been no past studies of the efficiency wage

hypothesis at the level of the firm.'    This appears to be due to the absence

of requisite information in the commonly used data sets, and to the rarity of

any studies of firms.

      There is a lo'ng tradition showing differences in wages paid in the same

occupation across industries. Dunlop (1957), for example, shows that in Boston

in 1951, the industry with the highest pay for truck drivers paid 1.88 times

as much as the lowest paying industry. He ascribes these substantial differ-

ences to underlying differences in product markets.

     Slichter (1950) finds a high rank correlation (.71 in 1939) of unskilled

and skilled wages in an industry. At any point in time, such a positive cor-

relation of unskilled and skilled wages could reflect a transitory demand shock

temporarily driving up industry wages along a short—run inelastic supply curve.

If so, we would not expect to see the same industries stay at the top of the

wage distribution decade after decade. Yet, industry wage differentials appear

to be remarkably persistent over time.   Slichter (1950), Cullen (1956), Reder

(1962), Montgomery and Stockton (1985), Bell and Freeman (1975), and Krueger

and Summers (1987) all present evidence of persistent industry wage differen-

tials over differing periods ranging from 1895 to 1984.    Taken together this

is a century of persistent and largely unexplained industry wage effects.




                                                                              4
Behind the Industry Wage Effect

     Two regularities appear to stand out from studies that attempt to account

for systematic differences in pay within occupations across plants or indus-

tries. Higher wages are usually associated with 1) higher profits or concen-

tration, and 2) larger plants and larger firms (the size wage effect).      The

chief suspect in this search is product market power. Ability to pay appears

to be associated with industry wage premiums.      Dickens and Katz (1987), and

Krueger and Summers (1987) offer useful reviews.

     A strong, positive relationship between wages and plant or firm size is

also persistently observed, see Brown and Medoff (1984), and the literature

reviewed there. Assuming that direct supervision is more difficult in larger

plants and companies, this has been taken as direct evidence in favor of the

efficiency wage hypothesis.

    It is not obvious why the owners of a firm should share their economic rents

with their workers, although the morale version of the efficiency wage model

offers a possible explanation.     Unobserved quality differences in workers

leading to both higher wages and profits offers another, Cain (1976). From the

perspective •of the shirking model, it is troublesome that wage differentials

tend to be dominated by employer, rather than occupation effects (Nolan and

Brown, 1983), and that at the establishment level much of the differential is

accounted for by the unionization and gender of the workers (Groshen, 1985).



Tests of the Efficiency Wage Hypothesis

      The earliest applications of the efficiency wage hypothesis were to the

output and pay of agricultural workers near starvation. The output effects of

wage bonuses in developed economies have not yet been shown.    Two provocative

and interesting recent studies set the stage for such tests (Dickens and Katz,



                                                                               5
1987; Krueger and Summers, i987). They present a variety of evidence suggesting

that neither transitory demand shifts, unobserved human capital, nor compen-

sating differentials can easily account for the observed industry wage differ-

entials, which persist across time and countries. However, the advantage of

efficiency wage models in explaining these wage differentials remains to be

shown.

        More direct tests of the efficiency wage hypothesis are offered by Krueger

and Summers (1987), who show that wage premiums are (1) negatively associated

with quits, and (2) positively associated with tenure and with self—reported

effort and job discretion. In both cases, the effects do not appear to be large

enough to make the payment of wage premiums profitable, and both may reflect

unobserved quality differences.



4. Data

        All of the data analyzed here come from a survey of employment conditions

in the high—technology sector of one state. In 1982 this survey includes more

than 200 plants with more than 70,000 employees. Employees are placed into one

of 290 narrow occupational classifications. For each occupation in each plant,

the number of employees and average pay are reported.      In most cases, a plant

is the sole operating asset of a firm, so one could use the terms interchange-

ably.

    This study analyzes average pay by occupation by plant, which is the average

of the base pay rate for individuals in a single occupation.          It includes

cost—of—living or geographic differentials, and excludes shift differentials,

lead premiums, or other differentials which are not considered base pay. Extra

compensation which is not regularly paid and considered as part of the normal

base pay is excluded.      Commissions and incentive pay which are part of total



                                                                                6
targeted earnings are included.    In other words, for incentive pay jobs, the

expected value of total pay is reported, deviations from the expected value are

not. The pay and employment2 data anaiyzed here are for the pay period closest

to Sepfember 1, 1982.    Wage bonuses are taken here as the deviation of plant

wages by occupation from the sample mean.

      Firms are provided with 290 detailed job descriptions that reflect the

normal range of duties, responsibilities and requirements found in each level

of the specified job. Employees that do not match a job description by at least

roughly 80 percent are to be excluded. The job descriptions are detailed, and

the occupational classifications narrow.3

      Data on supervision comes from the same survey. Organizational charts

showing hierarchies and time allocation of supervisors are not available. In-

stead, for a number of occupations, matching supervisor or manager occupations

are reported. For example, the relation of order processing clerks, purchasing

assistants, and field service workers to the occupations of order processing

supervisors, purchasing manager, and field service supervisor is readily ap-

parent.

      I have limited the analysis to sets of workers and supervisors for which

the supervisory relationship seemed complete and exclusive from the        job
descriptions.4     Absent an actual organizational chart, error cannot be pre-
cluded.   In particular, supervisory intensity is incorrectly low where higher

or lateral supervisors oversee a particular operation, and it is incorrectly

high where direct supervisors oversee other occupations in addition to the ones

specified here.5

     Throughout this paper I assume that the very detailed occupational clas-

sifications used here serve as a control on worker quality that is at least as

good, If not better than, the commonly used age and education measures. Note



                                                                             7
also that this data is bought and paid for by the participants, rather than by

academicians or the government. By the market test of survival, it has proven

its usefulness to survey participants, and that usefulness depends on accuracy

and reliability. In particular, the occupational categories used in the survey

are those that participating firms believe best reflect their own jobs.



5. The Tradeoff of Wage Premiums for Supervisory Intensity

        In theory, considering the same occupation in different firms, the effi-

ciency wage model predicts that firms employing more supervisors per worker will

offer lower wage premiums. Supervisor intensity and wage bonuses are substi-

tutes in production. This section presents tests of the tradeoff between wage

premiums and intensity of supervision for six occupations in subsamples of 19

to 111 manufacturing plants.           Consider a production function of the general

form:                                                                 -




(4)        Q =   Q[e(P,S/L)L]            e1,e2, > 0

                                              e 22' e12 < 0



where:

          Q =   output
          P = wage premium for workers
        S/L =   ratio of supervisors   to workers
          e =   effort function


        Along an isoquant, higher levels of P are associated with lower levels of

SIL.     In principle, this is testable. In practice, the usefulness of any such

test will depend critically on 1) the ability to control for variations in

output Q, and 2) the ability to hold occupation fixed, or control for the cost

of shirking. For the former, this section relies on measures of number of em—


                                                                                   8
ployees; for the latter it relies on the use of occupations narrowly defined

within one industry by industry participants.

     To test for substitution bbtween two factors of production, by regressing

one (wage premiums) on the other (supervisory intensity) is by no means an ideal

procedure, and is open to a number of criticisms, many of which are shared by

substantial parts of the production function literature. First, factor mix is

in theory a function of factor prices, and perhaps scale. Within a single in-

dustry in a single geographic area, one might expect little variation in factor

prices. Without such variation, the elasticity of substitution in production

cannot be well identified.    What variation is observed may then represent

transient optimization errors, rather than the production function. Second,

the choices of levels for both factors of production are endogenous and jointly

determined. In this case, the error term in the wage equation may be correlated

with the measure of supervisory intensity.   I attempt to control for variations

in output quantity by including a measure for number •of workers on the right

hand side.     This is obviously troublesome because labor input is itself

endogenous. If output is not adequately controlled for, or if what is labelled

a single occupation here is not homogeneous with respect to shirking costs, then

this procedure biases towards finding a positive correlation between supervi-

sory intensity and wage premiums.   This makes any finding of a tradeoff more

compelling, but renders the precise interpretation of a positive correlation

doubtful.    The results to be presented here should be interpreted with this

caution in mind. With longitudinal data, one could try to limit the scope of

such problems by estimating first difference equations.

        The first question to be addressed is whether thereis a substantial

occupation—specific element of wage differentials, or alternatively, whether

the firm effect on wages is similar across occupation. The shirking model is



                                                                              9
consistent with the former but not the latter case, because it predicts dif-

ferent monitoring difficulties across occupation, rather than a constant firm

effect across occupations. Among the compelling pieces of evidence against the

shirking model so far is the finding (Dickens and Katz, 1987) in CPS data of

highly correlated industry effects across occupations.

      To test whether firm effects on wages are highly correlated across occu-

pations, I select six common occupations in which shirking or heterogeneity are

likely to be a relatively minor problem. Table 1 shows the correlation coef-

ficients for these six occupations across subsamples of 48 to 91 companies.

Most of the occupational wages are positively correlated with each other, and

a number of these are significant, but there are also a number of insignificant

and negative correlations.   Firms that pay high wages in one of these occupa-

tions do not also pay high wages in the others. Wage differentials across firms

do not simply reflect a constant firm effect, but also reflect occupation—

specific components. This result stands in contrast to the Dickens and Katz

finding of strong industry wage effects across occupations, using more aggre-

gated occupations and industries. Aggregation across occupations, and firms

would tend to average out distinctions, and so could help explain the difference

between these two results.   The finding here of little constant firm effect

across narrowly defined occupations leaves scope for the shirking model. At

the same time this finding casts doubt on simple equity theories which hy-

pothesize strong firm effects on wages across occupations.

    Table 2 presents characteristics of the sample for six additional occupa-

tions chosen using the following criteria:    1) they are found in substantial

numbers in a large proportion of companies; 2) they have clearly defined

supervisors who are likely to supervise the respective workers and no one else;

3) they appear to have only one set of direct supervisors; 4) they appear to



                                                                             10
be homogeneous across firms; and 5) effort may not be easily observable and

failure to perform may be costly to the firm.    No other occupations fulfilled

these criteria, although their application obviously involves personal judge—

ment.

        There is indeed substantial variation across firms in a single industry

and area in the average wage paid to workers. The coefficient of variation of

wages among these occupations ranges from .14 field service workers to .22 for

testers and machinists.    In five of these occupations, the firm paying the

highest average wage pays more than twice the lowest average wage. This is the

sort of wage dispersion that industrial relations experts have long pointed out,

and which efficiency wage theory now attempts to explain.

    The occupations in Table 2 are ordered from lowest to highest average wage.

If one thought these occupations differed greatly in cost of shirking but had

similar factor price ratios of external to self—supervision, then the super-

vision to worker ratios should follow the same ranking. Table 2 shows no gen-

eral evidence that differential shirking costs across occupations dominate

twists in factor price ratios and result in both higher supervisory ratios and

higher costs. Note that outlying firms with zero supervisors in a given occu-

pation, or with more supervisors than workers, have been excluded from the

sample.

     Within occupations there is no significant evidence of a tradeoff between

wage premiums and supervisory intensity.     Table 3 shows the results of re-

gressions of worker wages on the ratio of supervisors to workers. If shirkers

are more of a potential problem in larger units, and if scale effectsdominated

this data (or if workers demanded a compensating differentialfor working under

supervisors), we would expect to see strong positive correlations between wages

and supervisory intensity. If the efficiency wage hypothesis played an impor—



                                                                              11
tant role in explaining wage premiums, we would expect to see a strong negative

coefficient on the supervisor variable. What we actually see in Table 3 can

best be described as noise, compounded in some cases by few degrees of freedom.

There is substantial variation in wages in these occupations, but there          is

little evidence that the efficiency wage model helps to explain this
variation.6 In other regressions (not shown) of the average workers' wage ag-

gregated over all occupations, aggregate supervising intensity again has an

insignificant and small effect.7



Factor Quantities as a Function of Factor Prices

     This section tests for substitution between factors of production by re-

gressing the ratio of factor quantities on the ratio of factor prices.    In the

usual application this has the virtue of relegating the endogenous variables

to the left hand side. The results of regressions of the ratio of supervisors

to workers on the ratio of supervisors' wages to workers' wages are presented

in Table 4.     In each of the occupations, firms not reporting supervisors, or

supervisors' wages are deleted from the sample. Controls for detailed industry,

area, and scale are included.

      As the standard theory predicts, the wages of supervisors relative to

workers increases when the ratio of supervisors to workers employed falls. This

effect is found in all occupations except testers, but is only significant in

the case of machinists.    The interpretation of this effect is complicated in

efficiency wage models because wages are choice variables.    It is clear that

firms that pay higher wages to workers (relative to supervisors) ——   either   be-

cause they have to or they choose to —— employ     fewer workers (relative to

supervisors).     The negative correlation between supervisory intensity and




                                                                                12
workers' wages (so a positive coefficient in these regressions) predicted by

the shirking model is not generally apparent in these estimates.8



Output, Supervisory Intensity and

     A production function may be characterized by observing how output varies

as inputs change.       The inputs in question here, supervisory intensity and

workers' wages, are observed. The output of workers is not directly observed.

Table 5 assumes that firm output is correlated with firm sales. This is a noisy

measure of the relevant output, and is available only for a subset of firms.

Table 5 shows regressions of sales on supervisory intensity, the average wage

of non—supervisory employees, total employment and the set of dichotomous var-

iables for industry and area.     Neither higher wages nor more supervisors per

worker are significantly associated with greater sales conditional on total

employment.



6. Turnover and Wage Premiums

     In its short history, efficiency wage theory has quickly spawned a number

of different varieties. Now I turn from the shirking version to the turnover

version.      The hypothesis is that wage bonuses are profitably paid to reduce

costly turnover. This section investigates whether turnover is lower in high

wage firms, whether this can explain much of the observed wage dispersion, and

whether the wage bonuses are efficient in the sense that they pay for themselves

through reductions in turnover.

      For each of 200 plants I observe the total number of separations -among

non—exempt (non—managerial) employees over the previous 6 months, along with

total employment of non—exempt employees at the beginning (March 1982) of this

6—month period.    I calculate the mean wage paid by each firm to non—exempt em—



                                   -
                                                                              13
ployees by weighting mean firm wages for detailed non—exempt occupations by

employment share of each occupation in each firm.    Separations include quits,

fires, and retirements, but should not include temporary layoffs.       Unfortu-

nately, I          subtract out the retirements, but this is a small proportion

of all separations. The turnover rate for each firm is calculated as the ratio

(for non—exempt workers) of total separations over the previous 6 months to

total employment at the beginning of that period. Turnover averages 25% per

half year in the firms sampled here.9

    The turnover version of the efficiency wage model predicts that higher wages

cause lower turnover, and more distinctively that wage premiums increase until

the point that marginal reductions in turnover do not add to profits. Table 6

presents the results of regressions of turnover rates on wages for 200 firms.

Column 1 presents an unadorned simple regression. Column 2 presents a multiple

regression with controls for total employment, occupational composition, in-

dustry and area. These additional controls reduce the wage effect on turnover

by 14%.     In both cases, the first prediction of the efficiency wage model is

borne out: higher wages are associated with lower turnover, and the result is

statistically significant. But note that a number of other models predict the

same result.    In particular, a model of accidents predicts this.    A smaller

proportion of workers is expected to quit at any firm that accidentally pays

higher wages.

     The important questions are 1) whether this association is strong enough

to explain a substantial part of wage variation across firms, 2) whether it is

profitable.     In both cases, the answer appears to be no.   In the first case,

while there is considerable variation in both turnover and wages, the former

is not highly enough correlated with the latter to account for its variation.




                                                                              14
     The second question can be addressed by asking how high the marginal cost

of turnover would have to be to justify the observed wage premiums. Suppose,

as in the first equation of Table 6, that an additional dollar of 'wages per

worker per hour reduces turnover by 3.6 percentage points per worker per half—

year. For convenience, think of this as a 3.6 percentage point decrease in the

probability that the representative worker turns over per half—year. Assuming

a 2080 (52x40) hour work year, this result is achieved at a marginal cost of

$2080 per worker—year. For a risk neutral firm, this is profitable only if the

marginal cost of turnover exceeds $57,777.   Because the wage bonus effect on

turnover is small, payment of such bonuses only profitably reduce turnover if

the benefits of actual turnover reduction exceeded 28 times the cost.   In view

of the fact that workers in this sample average an annual pay of $15,500, such

exorbitant turnover expenses may be ruled out.

     Higher wages are associatedwith lower turnover, as the efficiency wage

model (among others) predicts, but the reduction in turnover achieved by such

wages premiums hardly justifies the payment of observed wage premiums as a

profit maximizing act.1°



7. Conclusion

    The shirking version of the efficiency wage model makes a strong prediction

that self—supervision is a substitute in production for external supervision.

This paper tests for evidence of a trade—off between wage premiums and super-

visory intensity. While all of the tests presented here are subject to serious

qualification, little evidence is found to support the hypothesis. There is

little evidence that the considerable differences in occupational wages paid

across firms can be accounted for by the shirking model.




                                                                             15
    This paper has shown that there are large differentials in wages paid within

narrow occupations between plants in the high—technology sector of a single

state. Take the very narrowness of the occupational definitions used as a good

control for unobserved worker quality. Assume that the concentration of em-

ployees in one industry in one state controls for much of unobserved location,

union threat, or industry effects. Under these assumptions, the results here

of wide wage dispersion across firms remains a puzzle from the perspective of

both of the competing theories.

    The turnover version of the efficiency wage model predicts that wage bonuses

are paid up to the point at which further reductions in turnover cease adding

to profits. This paper presents evidence that higher wages are indeed associ-

ated with lower turnover rates, but that the reductions in turnover achieved

are not sufficient to establish the profitability of wage bonuses.

    Wages for narrowly defined occupations within one sector of one state are

widely dispersed. Neither the shirking nor the turnover variants of the effi-

ciency wage model appear able to explain this dispersion. The task that remains

for contemporary wage theory is to provide evidence supporting an explanation

for this observed wage dispersion.




                                                                             16

1. Since writing this, two others have appeared:        Xrueger (1987) and Levine

     (1987).




2. Part—time employees who regularly work over 20 hours per week and are eli-

     gible for pro—rated normal benefits are reported at their full—time equiv-

     alents. Temporary or seasonal employees are excluded unless they are paid

     as are full—time regular employees. Those on job—shop rates are excluded.



3.   For some occupations, two or more levels of the job are reported, for ex-

     ample Field Service "B" and Field Service "A'.     In such cases I take the

     total of employment in each of the subclassifications, and the weighted

     average of pay.



4. Where more than one level of supervision is reported, I take the sum of

     employment and the weighted average of pay.



5. It is not clear that firms have an incentive to act strategically in re-

     porting wages. Any individual response has a negligible effect on reported

     averages. In addition, a firm may cause comparable damage to a competitor

     by fooling it into paying wages above market as by fooling it into below

     market wages. Given the high level of "trading" in this concentrated mar-

     ket, market price is a difficult secret to keep.



6. The analysis in Table 3 excludes firms that report zero supervisors in the

     sample. This has no effect of note on the results.



                                                                              17
7. There is also no evidence of a size—wage effect, at this detailed level of

      analysis, with size measured as number of employees within
                                                                   a given occupa-
      tional group.



8. Table 4 also shows no significant scale, industry or area effects on the

     supervisor—to—worker ratio, although there are differences in this ratio

     across occupations.



9.   It ranges from 0 to 1.7. The mean wage of non—exempt workers in these firms

     is $7.45, ranging from $4.99 to $11.13.   The firms in this sample average

     144 non—exempt employees, ranging from 3 to 2,444. Both the turnover rate

     and the mean wage of non—exempt employees vary across firms because of

     changes in the occupational composition of the non—exempt work force.     In

     the analysis that follows, I control for each firm's occupational composi-

     tion by including control variables giving the proportion of each firm's

     non—exempt employment in each of 7 occupational groups. The average wage

     here, conditional on this broad occupational distribution, may not pre-

     cisely capture the wage bonuses within detailed occupations relevant to

     efficiency wage models.



10. Table 6 also contains other results of interest. Some have theorized that

     turnover is a greater problem at large plants because of a greater sense

     of alienation. Here, I observe lower turnover rates at larger plants, al-

     though the effect is small and insignificant. Design and drafting
                                                                         workers,

     and operative have (insignificantly) higher turnover rates than do elec-

     tronic technicians. Across industries, turnover rates are significantly

     higher in computer equipment, medical equipment, and electronic instru—



                                                                               18
ments, by 14 to 20 percentage points.   Obviously, other factors besides

wages (such as promotion prospects, or quaLity of supervision) are of im-

portance in exp1ainng turnover.
