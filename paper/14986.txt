                                             ABSTRACT

Leisure activities such as local recreation trips usually take place in discrete blocks of time that are
surrounded by time devoted to other commitments. It can be costly to transfer time between blocks
to allow for longer outings. These observations affect the value of time within those blocks and suggest
that traditional methods for valuing time using labor markets miss important considerations. This
paper presents a new model for time valuation that uses non-employment time commitments to infer
the shadow value of time spent in recreation. A unique survey that elicited revealed and stated preference
data on household time allocation is used to implement the model. The results support the conclusion
that there is an increasing marginal value of time for recreation as the trip length increases.

     Short Run Constraints and the Increasing Marginal Value of Time in Recreation


1.     Introduction

       Time may well be the ultimate scarce resource for many people in contemporary society.

Choices about time allocation can signal consumer preferences about the balance between

market and non-market activities. While these choices are made continually throughout each

day, they are nonetheless undertaken within a defined set of constraints. Some are imposed by

nature, such as the hours of daylight. Others are imposed by institutional conventions such as the

distinction between weekdays and weekend days. Still others are the result of commitments

made in earlier time intervals that constrain future patterns of time use. Some of these decisions

have long-term consequences, such as labor market choices and retirement planning. Others are

mundane and easy to adjust. These can include a multitude of everyday activities, such as

running errands or taking a walk in a park. Since decisions about time allocation are made in

different contexts and with different constraints, the marginal value of time to an individual may

vary depending on prior commitments, context and the needs of the specific time use. Estimates

of the value of time are especially important in understanding recreation demand.

       Early work in recreation modeling has largely relied on established labor market models

for estimating the shadow value of time. This pattern is also true for other sub-fields in

economics where time allocation questions arise. The relationships between the opportunity cost

of time and labor market choices have been assumed to apply equally well to long-term decisions

about jobs and to short-run choices such as allocating time for a short recreation trip. While it

stands to reason that these types of decisions involve substantially different choice margins, little

conceptual or empirical research exists that differentiates the alternative time frames and

analyzes their consequences for the shadow value of time. This paper presents a new approach



                                                  1
for time valuation.

       We propose and illustrate a new strategy for combining stated and revealed preference

data to estimate how the value of time for short term decisions can be different from the shadow

values implicit in long term labor market choices. The model and empirical results show that the

short run value of time varies with the size of the block of time involved. By contrast, most

empirical research on time has assumed time is fungible. Our starting point is that time, unlike

many other resource endowments, is not perfectly fungible. The way total time is divided affects

how it can be used. For example, one four-hour period of time allows different consumption

possibilities than four one-hour periods. This notion of the imperfect divisibility of time,

particularly over a short planning horizon, is central to our analysis. We highlight the fact that

discretionary time is usually available in non-contiguous blocks of time, and it is not possible to

move time freely between blocks. People do a variety of activities in these non-work blocks of

time. Some activities can be broken-up into parts and partially reallocated between time periods.

This type of decomposition may, however, entail greater costs. Other activities require

contiguous blocks of time. Recreation is an activity that falls primarily in the latter category.

The travel costs of outdoor recreation introduce indivisibility in time allocations. That is, it

would be costly to replace a day-long recreation trip to a site with several shorter trips to the

same site, and would likely involve different activities even if the total time used were the same.

       Finding a block of time for recreation in one period may require shifting competing

activities to other periods. Some of these activities may be necessary but not especially

enjoyable, such as cleaning the house or tending the yard. It is likely that there is diminishing

marginal productivity of time in these alternative activities in a given block of time, perhaps due

to other fixed inputs or fatigue. This relationship implies that completing household tasks in one




                                                  2
period in order to free another period for recreation would result in an increasing marginal

opportunity cost of the time made available for recreation, as a greater amount of time is shifted.

       Our conceptual model accounts for the imperfect divisibility of time. The assumption of

different choice margins for time allocation is used in a two-step estimation strategy to measure

the shadow values of different sized blocks of leisure time. We designed and conducted a new

survey of homeowners in Wake County, North Carolina to test our framework. Our findings

indicate the marginal value of time can increase by several percentage points for each additional

hour included in the time block.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short overview

of previous research on the value of time and describes the strategic role that different choice

margins play in each approach. Our theoretical model is developed in Section 3. In the model,

an individual’s time allocation decisions over sequentially unfolding short horizons are

conditional on long term decisions such as employment. The short term decisions allocate

blocks of time to recreation and “household maintenance”. To obtain longer blocks of time for

recreation, maintenance activities must be reallocated over time, and so the marginal value of

time increases with the length of the block of recreation time. Because this conceptual model

examines time use decisions over many short time periods, an empirical version would require

panel data on household time use that is generally not available at reasonable cost. In Section 4

we therefore modify the model to enable a tractable empirical strategy that still addresses the

central issue, which is the relative importance of time commitments in addition to employment in

determining the opportunity cost of time. We investigate whether the time required for

household activities is a commitment that can be displaced or broken up in some time periods to

allow the accumulation of time for other tasks. This response is another margin of adjustment




                                                 3
that is intermediate to changes in work commitments, and therefore may better reflect the short

run value of time. The model requires data on representative individual time allocations as well

as our stated preference question on substitutes for personal time in household chores. Section 5

describes the survey used to collect our data, while section 6 discusses the implementation and

results. The last section discusses some general implications of the model and a summary of our

overall findings.

2.     Previous research

       Numerous studies have questioned the use of the wage rate as the relevant opportunity

cost of time, yet the profession seems far from a consensus on an alternative basis for estimating

how individual circumstances and different types of decisions condition the relevant opportunity

cost. In dealing with time, the existing literature has considered models that vary along three

dimensions. The first involves if and how time enters preferences. The second considers how

time budgets constrain choices, and how multiple money and time constraints are specified. The

last describes how time ‘prices’ are associated with the consumption of final goods and services

that contribute to well being.

       Classic papers by Becker [1965], Johnson [1966], and De Serpa [1971] began the

consideration of the allocation and value of time. They showed that the value of time need not

be equal to the wage rate. While the earliest studies of the value of time were transportation

related, the importance of the issue for recreation demand was also recognized in an early paper

by Cesario [1976], which cites the transportation research in proposing a one-third the wage rate

rule for valuing travel time. Shortly thereafter McConnell and Strand [1981] included mileage-

related travel costs and travel-time costs (measured using the wage rate) as separate arguments in

a travel cost demand model to test the Cesario approximation. This strategy could also be




                                                 4
interpreted as a test of the Becker [1965] full price logic in costing trips to recreation sites. Their

results suggest that an individual is unable to perfectly exchange time units.1

       In another important paper Bockstael, Strand, and Hanemann [1987] model recreation

decisions conditional on whether individuals face limits on their ability to re-allocate time. In

their case, time enters preferences as leisure. Recovering estimates of the opportunity cost of

time requires understanding how agent’s constraints condition what can be learned from

observed time use. People differ in their work time environment. Those working full time may

not be able to freely adjust work hours, and so we do not observe their opportunity cost of time

through the wage rate. In cases where adjustment is possible, the rate of compensation maybe an

overtime wage that can differ from the regular wage. These insights suggest the most effective

way to account for differences in the shadow value of time is to classify individuals into flexible

versus inflexible in their time allocation decisions. Thus, the Bockstael, Strand, and Hanemann

logic for describing time allocation follows conventional labor economics and implies a

piecewise linear budget constraint. Importantly, we learn very little about the value of time for

individuals without flexible work hours. By contrast, the choices of flexible individuals do

reveal an opportunity cost for time as their wage, while those with second jobs reveal an excess

demand for work and a reservation value for leisure less than the wage on their primary job.

       This implies there are important limitations in our ability to use labor market choices to

measure shadow values of time. The only opportunity to use revealed preference information to

recover measures for the value of time with traditional full time workers is through their

decisions to change jobs. Using revealed and stated preference data Feather and Shaw [1999]

illustrate one way to address this issue. Their approach adapts Heckman’s [1974] labor supply

model to recover some information about shadow values of time for individuals who are unable




                                                   5
to adjust their work time. They use a simple stated preference question paralleling Heckman’s

strategy for recovering the shadow values of time for constrained individuals. They offer

respondents the opportunity to relax their labor market constraints. People were told they could

increase working time and receive additional earnings or they could decrease work with a

corresponding reductions in earnings, each at a constant wage rate corresponding to their hourly

rate. Survey respondents’ answers determine whether a non-flexible individual’s existing wage

is an upper or lower bound on their reservation wage. By combining flexible and non-flexible

individuals Feather and Shaw identify a reservation wage equation for all labor market types. In

short, their framework reveals the long run shadow value of time based on a set of stated

opportunities to renegotiate employment conditions.

       Larson and Shaikh [2001] and Shaikh and Larson [2003] extended the two-constraint

model in several directions. The value of time is reflected in the relative scarcity of time versus

money in the task of maximizing utility. Each person has a unique opportunity cost of time that

is the same regardless of how it is used. All time is fungible and interchangeable, but its shadow

value need not equal the wage. In the most recent application of this two constraint model, Lew

and Larson [2005] demonstrate how a joint framework linking the Feather-Shaw strategy to

Larson and Shaikh model can control for unobserved heterogeneity in a mixed logit model for

recreation site choice. However, their framework requires that the shadow value of time be

invariant to the timing of the decision. Although the shadow value varies with individual

characteristics, it is constant for choices based on daily, weekly, and annual time budgets.

       Several lessons emerge from the literature to date. While early conceptual research

highlighted the different margins at which time allocations are made, empirical models were not

able to incorporate them into the measurement of the implied values for time. What appears to




                                                 6
be missing is recognition that some time allocation choices create cascading commitments on

both the amounts and the margins for decisions in later time choices. For example, job decisions

limit the discretion in labor-leisure choices. Depending on the job they can involve quasi-fixed

commitments to work at specific times for specific periods of time. It seems reasonable to

assume these types of choices reflect a longer run time horizon and are taken as given when an

individual plans weekly leisure activities. They are also likely to be considered fixed in planning

day trips or longer recreation outings. This hierarchical decision structure is an alternative to the

model in Lew and Larson, which jointly estimates the job choice decision and the beach trip

decision. In contrast, our model recognizes that people attempt to make commitments to jobs

that will be consistent with what they anticipate will be their subsequent short term time needs.

Models for short run choices should consider time’s role both as a constraint on choice and as an

input in the production of utility-generating services. The framework used to estimate the

opportunity cost of time should reflect the relative scarcity of time and money in the planning

horizon that is relevant to the choices under analysis.

3.     Conceptual Model

       Our model of individual behavior assumes decisions take place over different time

horizons. This formulation allows us to explore time-related insights without reliance on a less

tractable dynamic model.2 We begin by noting that different types of commitments are made by

individuals. Each of these can limit the discretionary uses available to the time remaining. The

largest commitments stem from employment and residential location decisions, which are not

easily changed and are assumed to be part of long run choices. Other decisions also imply longer

term time commitments. For example, decisions such as owning a house, having children, or

purchasing a pet have implications for a household's time commitments. These choices can




                                                  7
require repeated home production tasks such as preparing food, caring for dependents, cleaning

the house, feeding and exercising a pet, and tending the yard. We label this class of activities as

‘household maintenance’. There are two important aspects of these commitments. First, the

amount of time spent on them can vary over short periods largely by displacing the timing of the

activities or delaying some tasks. Nonetheless, the needs motivating the time do not go away

unless the nature of the commitment is changed. So in the longer term displaced time needs to

be made up. Second, the total level of maintenance is determined by the personalities and habits

of the members of each household, so we expect to observe differences in the importance of

these commitments and differential effects on their opportunity costs of time. For short-run

decisions, including day-trip recreation behavior, households take employment, residential

location, and total maintenance over the long term as predetermined.3

       Ideally, one would use a panel of choices over time to learn, through adjustments in these

commitments, the full dimensions of each individual’s opportunity costs of time. A necessary

condition for this type of analysis is the ability to observe people’s responses to temporally

delineated constraint sets through unique diary-type datasets. Our strategy mimics but avoids

this fully detailed description by using a set of real and hypothetical choices, together with the

envelope conditions they imply, to recover the shadow values for different types of time

adjustments.

       We begin our model by assuming that short-run decisions unfold over J weeks. Each

week offers the same discretionary time (which can be allocated to leisure activities and

maintenance) as any other week. Let T j represent the total amount of non-work (and non-sleep)

time that is available in week j. This time is used for household maintenance and short term

leisure activities such as recreation activities. We denote the output of maintenance in week j by




                                                  8
M j, and assume that Mj is strictly positive. The individual produces maintenance in week j using

own time denoted t mj and purchased inputs. The maintenance production function is defined by

M j (t mj ), where purchased inputs are suppressed for notational convenience. The marginal

product of own time is assumed to be positive but exhibits diminishing returns. While

maintenance is defined for each week, we also assume it is possible to shift maintenance

activities between weeks.4 This shifting is a key element in isolating the short-term, inter-

temporal substitution that identifies how people tradeoff non-work time uses. Total maintenance,

M, is the sum of maintenance in the various weeks and is predetermined. In the absence of other

considerations, if the weekly maintenance functions were the same, each individual would spend

equal amounts of time each week to minimize the total time costs of reaching the fixed level of

total maintenance.5 To the extent the functions differ by week, time would be allocated to

equalize implied marginal costs of producing the required level of total maintenance. Other uses

of non-work time, however, imply the allocation is more complex.

        In our model, the alternative use of non-work time is local recreation, R j. Recreation is

produced using time spent in the activity and complementary purchased goods, such as out-of-

pocket travel costs. Again suppressing these other inputs for notational convenience we denote

the recreation production function for week j by R j (t rj ) where trj ≥ 0 , so that recreation can be

zero in a given week. The marginal product of time for recreation is positive, and the marginal

productivity of time in recreation is increasing over the relevant range. Though asserted rather

than tested, the local convexity of Rj(·) seems reasonable. As a larger block of time becomes

available constraints on activity choices are relaxed (longer-commitment activities become

possible), thereby expanding the utility-generating options inherent in the block. Thus our




                                                   9
maintained assumption is that larger blocks of recreation time are more useful in producing

recreation.

       The individual gets satisfaction from allocating time to the leisure activity (recreation)

and from purchased goods. Purchased goods are denoted by x, where price has been normalized

to one, and income for the period is y. The individual allocates non-work time and income to

maximize utility subject to income and time constraints as well as to the maintenance

requirement. Formally the individual solves the constrained maximization problem

          max U ( R1 (tr1 ),..., R J (trJ ), x )     s.t. T j = tmj + trj ∀j ,   y = x, M = ∑ M j (tmj ).   (1)

                                                                                               j



This model combines elements from several earlier treatments of time. Time can make different

contributions to utility through the various R’s. There could also be contributions from both

work and maintenance time allocations. These are not explicitly entered in this definition of the

choice problem because both are assumed to be pre-determined as part of long-run decisions.

Inverting the J time constraints and substituting them into the maintenance function reduces the

J+2-constraint problem to a more familiar two-constraint case with maintenance serving a role

comparable to the time constraint:

                                                   M = ∑ M j (T j − t rj ).                                 (2)
                                                          j



       Maximizing utility subject to (2) and the income constraint leads to solutions for the

optimal time allocation and the indirect utility function V(y,T1,…,TJ,M). With λ and μ, the

Lagrangian multipliers for money and maintenance, respectively, the Envelope Theorem implies

Vy = λ and VM = μ. More importantly we also have:

                                                          ∂M j     ∂M j
                                               VT j = μ        = μ        .
                                                          ∂T j      ∂t mj




                                                              10
The marginal utility of time depends on the marginal product of time in maintenance. As a

result, the marginal opportunity cost of time in time period j, ρj, can be defined in terms of this

household production activity.

                                                 μ ∂M j
                                        ρ =

                                               =        .                                             (3)
                                            V y λ ∂t mj

       Maintenance’s role as a recurring activity offers repeated time allocations, which provide

opportunities for short term adjustments. Properties of the maintenance activity imply, for given

values of μ and λ, the marginal value of time is larger when the marginal product of time in

maintenance is larger.6 If little time is spent on maintenance, the marginal productivity of

maintenance effort is high, and the opportunity cost of spending that time in leisure activities is

also high. As a consequence, the shadow value of different blocks of recreation time will depend

on their size (i.e., the amount of time that must be assembled). Total and marginal utility from

recreation are dependent on the amount of time available to produce the experience. It may be

optimal to reallocate maintenance across periods to assure that more time is available for longer

recreation trips. For a given individual these choices can result in differing marginal values of

time for trips of different lengths. The challenge is designing an empirical strategy to measure

these different values. This task is especially problematic when one considers the challenges in

collecting data on people’s time allocations (see Kahneman, et al [2004] for discussion of some

aspects of this issue). In the next section we describe simplifications to our model that are

needed to test the framework with data collected from a single cross sectional sample.

4.     Empirical Strategy

       The model in the last section is based on choices within individual weeks. We recognize

that the time spent in both recreation and maintenance can vary by week. In the absence of a

panel with detailed records on time use patterns across individuals, we structured hypothetical


                                                     11
choices along with the specification of the production function for household maintenance to

learn how the opportunities to adjust some aspects of one’s commitments influence time

tradeoffs. An individual’s marginal value of time for recreation in a given week will vary

depending on the time she spends in recreation. In addition, her marginal product of

maintenance depends on the time she spends on maintenance that week. Because of the overall

time constraint for recreation and maintenance time, the two decisions are linked. If we can

estimate the household production function for maintenance, we can use the results to derive

estimates of the value of time. Our strategy uses data on the household’s maintenance and other

activities for a “typical” week, and the household’s response to a stated preference question

providing a market opportunity to purchase maintenance services. The question offers an option

to purchase (at a fixed hourly price ws) regularly scheduled hours of weekly services that can be

used for maintenance (i.e., lawn services, cleaning services, and a variety of other time saving

market services).

       For the empirical model we assume an individual’s utility for a representative week is

given by U ( x, H ; M ) where M is average time per week devoted to maintenance and is

predetermined.7 H represents leisure of all types including recreation. Let the individual’s labor

devoted to household maintenance production be L and purchased hours of maintenance service

labor be LS.8 We define f (L) to be the contribution to total maintenance from own labor, where

f ′ (L)>0 and f''(L)<0, and we normalize the units for maintenance so that one hour of

professional service provides one unit of maintenance. Maintenance is therefore the total of own

and purchased production, given by

                                         M = f ( L) + LS .                                         (4)

is the price per hour of purchased maintenance) and time constraint T = H + L. Substituting the

time constraint and the maintenance function in (4) into the budget constraint yields

                                       y = x + ws [ M − f (T − H )] .                              (5)

There are two types of solutions to this utility maximization problem. The first involves

individuals who purchase a positive amount of service at the offer price, resulting in an interior

solution. In this case, the value of time in a typical week with the option of purchased

maintenance services, ρs, is

                                              UH
                                       ρs =      = ws f ' (T − H ). 9                              (6)
                                              Ux

In the second case we have individuals who choose not to purchase service at the offered price.

As a result, it is not possible to collapse the maintenance and time constraints into the budget

constraint. The value of time for these individuals is determined by a corner solution in the

purchased service market:

                                      UH μ
                               ρs =     = f ' (T − H ) < ws f ' (T − H ),                          (7)
                                      Ux λ

where μ is the Lagrange multiplier for the maintenance constraint.

       Estimating equations can be derived from (6) and (7). Using censored regression and a

specification for f we can estimate a transformation of the weak inequality

                                               ρs
                                                    ≤ f ' ( L), 10                                 (8)
                                               ws

where L is the amount of own maintenance labor when the service is available at a price ws and

ρ s is the mean value of time, which is determined in the long run. We use the Feather and Shaw

(1999) approach, discussed in section 2, to estimate the long run work/leisure tradeoff. The



                                                      13
responses to our actual and hypothetical behavior survey questions allow equation (8) to be

estimated. Our description of the hypothetical service is presented in the next section.

       Once the marginal product function has been estimated it is possible to calculate the

value of the marginal product for each individual’s own maintenance labor in the absence of the

hypothetical purchased personal service. This is the marginal product evaluated at the observed

allocation of personal labor to maintenance in the baseline, designated here as L*. With the

baseline marginal product and the long term value of the shadow wage ρ s it is possible to

calculate μ/λ, the marginal value of maintenance as:

                                            μ   ρs
                                              =         .                                          (9)
                                            λ f '( L* )

       Since decisions about work time and overall maintenance levels are determined in the

long run, the marginal utilities of income and of maintenance are constant over the short time

period that is the focus of this analysis. Thus, the primary influence on the short run value of

time from equation (3) will be due to time allocated to maintenance in a particular week. If a

person wants to enjoy additional recreation during the week, he needs to adjust his time

allocation accordingly. The resulting reduction in maintenance activities has an increasing

marginal opportunity cost, in that progressively more productive hours of maintenance are given

up to produce additional recreation. The forgone maintenance is made up in other time periods,

but with reduced productivity, due to the diminishing marginal product of time in maintenance.

With estimates for the marginal product of maintenance as well as the long-horizon shadow

wage, our model allows estimation of the time cost of varying recreation time allocations. The

details of this procedure are given in Section 6.




                                                    14
5.     Data

       The data used here were collected as part of a larger effort that sought to integrate

residential housing sales information, survey data on homeowners’ recreational activities, and

their household characteristics, within a spatially delineated framework that allows inclusion of

detailed information on the quality of the recreation sites. The focus of this analysis is on the

components of the survey that requested information on household time allocation decisions.

Between May and September 2003 a mail survey was sent to a sample of homeowners in Wake

County, North Carolina, USA. The target population was homeowners who had purchased their

homes between 1992 and 2001. A random sample of 9,000 of these households, stratified by

geographical location, was drawn from this population. To verify that the survey would be sent

to the owner (and resident) of the house, the addresses listed for tax purposes were cross checked

with names and addresses of the individuals purchasing each house. The sample was limited to

cases where the addresses of the housing unit and the individual receiving the tax bill matched.

7,554 surveys reached valid addresses where it would be possible to receive a response.11 The

Dillman (1978) method for mailed surveys was followed with two mailings and a reminder

postcard. Returned surveys amounted to 31.7 percent of the mailings to correct addresses. After

screening for missing and implausible values, there were 1,719 useable responses for this

analysis.12 The sample for this analysis is less than the number of returned valid questionnaires

due to item non-response.

       Our response rate is at the lower end of what conventionally has been considered

desirable based on experience in the nineties. However, recent research on the topic suggests

that low response rates alone do not signal non-response bias. For example, Holbrook, Krosnick,

and Pfent (2005) conclude their detailed evaluation of 100 random digit dialed telephone studies




                                                 15
over a 10 year period noting that “…lower response rates seem not to substantially decrease

demographic representativeness within the range we examined” (p.38).13 Our comparison with

Census information suggests our survey is consistent with their findings. To confirm this, we

also estimated a selection model. The results are virtually identical to those from the estimation

described here. The coefficient of the inverse Mills ratio is not significant at the 5% level and

the coefficients of each of the variables are not different between the two equations. There is

also no economically significant difference in the resulting marginal values of time. Since non-

response bias appears to make no significant difference, we have not included the adjustment for

it here.14

        Two aspects of the questionnaire are directly relevant to our model. First, we solicited

time usage for the respondent and spouse (if any) for fifteen activities including primary and

secondary employment, commuting, and a wide variety of non-work activities. The survey also

includes questions about how much paid help the household hired for maintenance services, and

whether they could freely choose how much time they allocated to each of the activities. In

addition, we asked about the flexibility they had in their work time. Our survey also asked labor

supply choices using the same question developed by Feather and Shaw (1999).15

        Second, each household was asked about a personal assistance service (i.e., the stated

choice question discussed earlier) that offers a substitute for each respondent’s time in household

tasks. After describing the services available and presenting a randomly-assigned16 market price

per hour, we asked if the respondent would purchase the service and, if so, how many hours in a

typical week. The framing of the question implies that it could be used for any of the activities

undertaken by adults in the household. We assume all hours allocated to household maintenance

can be aggregated. The personal assistant question was followed by several regarding how




                                                 16
respondents would use any time made available by purchasing the service. The specific question

about the potential purchase is reproduced in the Appendix.17 We also collected information on

the earnings and non-labor income of the household, job characteristics, and a variety of other

socio-economic variables. The variables definitions and descriptive statistics are given in Table

1.

       Households’ reports of the time devoted to household activities (e.g. cleaning, cooking,

etc.); yard work/gardening; activities related to your children; and shopping for routine

needs/running errands were assumed to correspond to maintenance. Following the unitary

household assumption the times reported for the respondent and the spouse or partner (if present)

were combined. The amount of time for household maintenance is assumed to be the sum of

times reported in these four categories. Time allocated to maintenance when the hypothetical

personal services are available is estimated by subtracting stated time purchases from the

baseline measure of their time allocated to maintenance.18

6.     Empirical implementation and results

       Our estimation of the short-run value of time function for households requires estimates

of the long-run shadow wage. The Feather and Shaw (1999) framework assumes the market and

shadow wages are equal for respondents with flexible work schedules. For unemployed, under-

employed, and over-employed people the relationship between the shadow and market wages is

an inequality. The model begins with specifications for the shadow and market wage equations

                                       ρis = Ω1 F1i + α hi + ε i
                                                                                                 (10)
                                        w = Ω 2 F2i + ui ,

where ρis and wi are person i's shadow and market wages, respectively, F1i and F2i are sets of

exogenous variables, hi is hours of work, (Ω1,Ω2,α) are parameters, and εi and ui are error terms.



                                                 17
The form of the estimating equation for each person in the sample depends on their responses to

the question about adjusting their hours. For flexible workers the relationship wi = ρis holds,

while we have wi ≤ ρis and wi ≥ ρis for under- and over-employed people, respectively. For

unemployed people wi ≤ ρis also holds, where in all cases ρis is evaluated at the observed level

of hi. If we assume the errors are jointly normal, these inequalities can be used to bound the

support of error values that are consistent with observed outcomes, and maximum likelihood can

be used to estimate the parameters of the shadow wage and market wage functions.

        Our specifications for these functions follow the original Feather and Shaw application.

The shadow wage function includes a constant and variables for work hours, non-work income,

spouse work hours, and qualitative variables indicating the presence of young children, gender,

and an interaction term between gender and the presence of young children. The market wage

function includes a constant and variables for age, education, and indicators of race and gender.

The parameter estimates are given in Table 2. The estimates are generally consistent with a

priori expectations with most coefficients significant at conventional levels. For the individuals

in our sample, the mean predicted shadow wage is $26.64 and the median is $19.61 (in 2003

dollars).

        Estimation of the marginal product of maintenance requires specification of the personal

maintenance production function. We expect that this function would vary by individual and

exhibit diminishing marginal product. We focused on two specifications for this function, a log

form and a quadratic form. The results were quite comparable. Since the quadratic form

introduces more flexibility, those results are presented here.19

        The simple quadratic household production is

                                          f ( L) = aL2 + bL.                                      (11)


                                                 18
This form allows testing for diminishing MP. A vector z including any observable

individual/family characteristics that might influence productivity can be included in this

equation. Inverting the marginal product function implied by equation (11) and using the

equality form of the first order condition given in equation (8) (recalling that ρs is the shadow

wage and ws is price of personal services), the estimating equation is then.

                                                         ⎛ ρs ⎞
                                    L = β 0 + z β z + β1 ⎜ ⎟ + ε .                               (12)
                                                         ⎝ ws ⎠

Algebraic transformations allow the structural parameters of the marginal product for time in

maintenance to be recovered from the estimated coefficients. That is: β1=1/(2a) and β0 + zβz

=−b/(2a), or a=1/(2β1) and b=−2a(β0 + zβz). Thus, the prediction would be β0>0 and β1<0.

With this functional form it is possible to have estimates for the β’s that imply the marginal

product is not positive even for parameters with the theoretically predicted signs. A positive

marginal product would be consistent with a rational time allocation in our model. Thus, this

feature offers an indirect empirical test for the framework.

       The dependent variable is the number of hours devoted to household maintenance. We

use maximum likelihood assuming a censored normal distribution for the error. The estimates

are presented in of Table 3. Column two reports a parsimonious specification that includes

relative price and a constant. Even in this specification, the marginal product is positive in the

range of the data and diminishing as expected. Our two step estimation strategy uses an estimate

of the conditional expectation for ρS in the numerator of the ratio of shadow value to service

price. As a result, the estimated model is expected to have a non-spherical error. To take

account of this issue, all of our tests use Huber’s (1967) robust covariance matrix for the

estimated model parameters.




                                                 19
       We hypothesize that the characteristics of households also play an important role in

explaining the differences in behavior with respect to maintenance. Column three of Table 3

provides the results for a more complete specification. There are a number of factors that play a

significant role in the maintenance decisions. Households with higher labor income and thus

probable higher opportunity costs of time do less own maintenance. Households where a

“significant other,” typically a spouse, is present do more own maintenance production. Recall

that maintenance is the sum of both members’ home production, so this does not represent any

substitution within the household but rather a difference by household type. The number of

family members in the house also increases maintenance. There is some support for the logic

associated with our unitary household model in that the sex of the respondent was not a

significant variable in this or other specifications and was not included. Similarly, race was

never significant and was omitted. Age is not significant here but was included since it

displayed some explanatory power in other specifications.

       The difference in the number of hours worked by the respondent compared to his or her

spouse is also hypothesized to influence reported own maintenance. Our formulation of this

effect codes this variable in qualitative terms with one indicating that the respondent works at

least ten hours more per week than the spouse, a zero if there is less than a ten hour difference

between the work weeks for the couple, and a negative one if the respondent works at least ten

hours less than the spouse. This variable was included to control for any differences in

perceptions depending on the relative workforce participation of the respondent compared to the

spouse in the household.20 It is not significant in column three but is in the more complete

specification in column four. This pattern is repeated with the work flexibility variable.




                                                 20
          The fourth column in the table reports the last and most complete specification of the

model. The first of the additional variables uses the number of non-work hours calculated in two

ways. The first uses the number of hours in a week and subtracts the number of hours that

respondents reported they devoted to all employment plus the time spent commuting plus an

allowance for time spent sleeping. We expect the respondent to be quite accurate in reporting

work and commute time. As a result, this measure probably represents a fairly accurate measure

of non-work time. The second strategy simply uses the total of all the time reported for non-

work activities. The difference in the two measures captures the accuracy and completeness of

the respondent’s accounting for non-work time.21 As expected, if the accounting for non-work

activities in general was higher, the reported time spent on maintenance was also higher.

          The other two variables included in this full specification are based on the responses to

the question about what survey respondents would do with the new time made available by

employing the hypothetical personal services. The variables are dichotomous variables for those

who said they would work longer hours and for those that said they would devote the time to

housework. The omitted category was for those who would use the time for leisure activities.

The individuals who would take more leisure tended to report more time spent on maintenance.

Finally, the time flexibility measure is positive and significant, whereas in the previous

specification it was not significant. Households where there was flexibility in shifting the work

schedule devote more time to household maintenance. Diminishing marginal product in

household maintenance is more of an issue if work hours cannot be shifted, so this is a plausible

result.

          This last specification of the quadratic model is our preferred model and is used in

calculating the value of different blocks of time. In estimating the household’s maintenance




                                                  21
services production function, we used the exogenous price of purchased services that was given

in the stated preference question. However, the individual’s actual value of time is based on her

actual choices. Therefore, to calculate the value of time using equation (6), we use the marginal

product of own labor computed at the actual level of household services, rather than the level if

the purchased services were available. If maintenance is then shifted to allow for recreation, it

increases the marginal product of maintenance and raises the marginal cost of time for

recreation. By this logic different marginal values of time can be calculated for different length

trips.

         Specifically, from equations (3) and (9) we can express the short run marginal value of

recreation time (MVT) as

                                                  ρs
                                    MVT (t ) =              × f ′( L* − t ),                    (13)
                                                 f ′( L )
                                                       *




where L* is the actual amount of maintenance expected per week, t is the amount of maintenance

time displaced by recreation, and estimates of the parameters in f(·) come from Table (3). Note

that MVT(t) is increasing in t due to the diminishing marginal product of time in maintenance.

Equation (13) shows that a given individual’s value of time will be influenced by her long run

shadow wage and by her individual characteristics, since the maintenance production function

includes these variables. This means that for a given length trip, there is a distribution of

marginal values of time between the individuals in the sample. Table 4 provides the sample

quantiles of the distribution of the predicted marginal value of time for blocks of recreation time

that displace 2, 4, 6, and 8 maintenance hours, as well as the long-run shadow value of time of

these individuals. The marginal value of time increases as the proposed blocks of recreation time

become longer.




                                                   22
       Our framework has several important implications for recreation research. First, the

opportunity cost of time spent in travel and on site is arguably the largest component of the costs

of local and day recreation trips. To provide a sense of the potential importance of the treatment

of these costs Table 5 presents summaries for the total opportunity cost of time measured using

four different time valuing strategies for trips of varying lengths. We report the sample mean of

the baseline marginal value of time and the sample mean total value of time for 2, 4, 6, and 8

hour combinations of travel and onsite time. For the one-third the wage rate, wage rate, and

Feather and Shaw strategies the marginal value of time is constant, and so the total time values

are simple products of the opportunity cost estimate and the time involved. For our approach the

marginal value is not constant, so we obtain the total value of the block of time by integrating

MVT(t) in equation (13) from zero to the trip length t, where t=2,4,6,8 in the table. The results

using the wage rate or one-third the wage rate are quite different from the results using our

measure, as might be expected. We focus our comments on the differences between our model

and the Feather and Shaw model, since the two provide identical baseline marginal values. For

short trips the differences in the total time costs of the trip are relatively small. However when a

four hour block of time is accumulated, the total value increases by nearly five percent. This

climbs to nearly ten percent for eight hour trips.

       Second, the framework implies that when the marginal value of time does change

appreciably with the amount of time, conventional demand (and random utility specifications for

choice models) will need to be revised to incorporate the full implications of nonlinear budget

constraints for the choice process. Ideally a fully integrated model would link recreation choices

with the adjustments considered in altering time constraints as implied by the envelope

conditions we used to develop or estimates. Short of such a complete framework our estimates




                                                 23
suggest it may be desirable to adapt the methods used for measuring benefits of changes in

access conditions or the quality of local recreation sites using an extension to the framework

proposed by Reiss and White [2006]. Finally, our analysis reinforces the need for micro models

of individual behavior to deal more explicitly with individual heterogeneity in constraints and

preferences.

7.     Conclusion

       People’s choices about their time allocations take place on a variety of margins and

timeframes. They are made sequentially with some choices constraining others that come later

(at least until the consequences are important enough to warrant incurring the costs of revision).

This recursive structure has been implicitly discussed in the environmental economics literature,

but its implications have not been fully utilized. In this paper we have shown that it is possible

to use the different margins on which time allocations occur to estimate a shadow value of time

that is partially decoupled from the labor market, and is appropriate for short run choices. In

doing so we have shown how non-work choices can convey information on the value of time.

Many recreation activities require blocks of time, and the value of time for these activities may

differ depending on the size of the block. This is because constraints on how time can be

assembled are imposed by its imperfect transferability, and choices must be made if a larger time

block is desired. Our strategy for valuing time for recreation has used information from revealed

and stated preferences together with a recognition that decisions represented in each of these

sources of choice information may well be made in quite different time frames. The results

indicate that the marginal value of time can be increasing as the size of the block time increases.

       This finding has implications for valuing different types of recreation experiences. For

example, small blocks of time are adequate for a visit to a local park, while larger blocks are




                                                24
necessary for trips to a regional park. For a given individual the marginal value of time devoted

to the latter trip will be higher. Similarly, these findings also have implications for assigning the

values of time to visitors living different distances from a site. The greater the distance, the

greater is the time commitment, and the higher is the relative value of time.

       Our research has focused primarily on developing methods for valuing time used in local

recreation outings for non-market valuation purposes. It is worth noting, however, that our

approach has applicability for a wide range of extra-market valuation problems. In particular

there has been recent discussion of methods needed for augmenting the national income and

product accounts to reflect non-market activities (see Nordhaus [2006] and Frazis and Stewart

[2007]) as well as attention to non-work time allocation in general. For any research involving

non-work time allocation at least two definitional challenges must be met and made operational.

The first concerns defining the utility-generating non-market outputs that time contributes to, and

the second concerns defining and measuring a ‘price’ for these outputs. Landefeld and McCulla

[2000] address the definition of outputs, describing the so-called third person test. In this case

the household produced outputs are defined based on the potential substitutes available in the

market. Our maintenance function is an operational example of this strategy in that we define

the commodity in terms of its purchased substitute. Importantly, it also highlights the critical

role of the time horizon in defining the non-market output. This is a point that has received less

attention in the general time allocation literature, but is closely related to the second definitional

challenge. Frazis and Stewart [2007] describe two ways to price household produced outputs:

using the market wage of the household member, and valuing the output by its market

replacement cost. Dissatisfaction with the former has been expressed for many of the reasons

long cited in the environmental economics literature, yet as an alternative it seems that the latter




                                                  25
ignores the crucial issue of the individual’s opportunity cost of time.22 What is missing is the

recognition that the frequency and timing of the non-market activities matter, and that short run

time constraints and the production technology imply a shadow value of time (and hence

opportunity cost of the non-market output) that need not be equal to the wage rate. Our research

shows how a strategic stated preference question might be used to define the non-market

commodity, partially understand its production technology, and assess its shadow value. We

also demonstrate the importance of including questions in time use surveys that acquire

information about the decisions on how much home production to undertake as a means of

gauging short run time constraints and values.

       Finally, our empirical application highlights a new role for stated choice questions. Most

applications in environmental economics have focused on new choices, offering individuals the

opportunity to decide about an amenity that has previously been outside the domain of their

choice set (or one where it was difficult to make large changes). In addition, many previous

efforts at joint estimation were designed to use revealed preference data to calibrate stated

preference responses. Our model relies on an integrated strategy in which the stated preference

model offers a different type of choice margin that may serve to relax time constraints for some

individuals. This new information can be combined with data on actual time allocation decisions

      It is becoming more common to see firms that provide personal assistant services starting up. These types of
      businesses organize and perform many household tasks such as house cleaning, lawn care, food shopping, and a
      wide array of other tasks. Clients typically contract for a specific number of hours per week and specify the
      activities employees of the firm are to do. If transportation is needed for the tasks, it is provided by the firm and
      included in the number of hours that are purchased. Guarantees are made that the service is safe and reliable. It
      is not necessary for clients to be present when the tasks are performed. In spite of the growth in this industry,
      little is understood about how much of these services would be used.

      If this personal assistance service was $5.501 per hour used, would you purchase any time?
             ______ yes                 ______ no

      If you answered yes, how much personal service time would you purchase in a typical week? Please check the
      relevant box or write in the value. (If no, skip to Part C, “Leisure Outings”).

                   please indicate how many:

      The hours I would purchase would replace paid services I currently use for some household tasks.

           □ yes
           □ no
      On average, how would you most likely use the time you saved by purchasing this service? (check most           likely
      use)

           □ Use the time to work additional hours
           □ Use the time for activities I enjoy
           □ Use the time for other household tasks

    Prices of $5.50, $8, $10, $20,$30, and $50 were used on different versions of the survey.

                                               Notes
1
  Smith et al. [1983] also showed, using a related model, that the relationship between the value
of time and the wage rate varied extensively. Larson and Shaikh [2001] suggest that both sets of
results may well yield biased estimates because they failed to include a time budget variable in
the site demand.
2
  Completely modeling the dynamic tradeoffs implied by inter-temporal choices might seem
desirable. However, such a framework requires not only a record of the sequencing and duration
of activities, but perhaps more importantly, an understanding of the constraints to the allocation
of time over the course of a day, week, or month. At this time both data and modeling
limitations preclude such a fully dynamic model. The sequential model presented here maintains
the important insights while remaining empirically tractable.
3
  Multiple day vacations or recreation trips requiring an overnight stay are not included among
these short run decisions, since their planning horizon is likely to be longer than we are focusing
on in this model.
4
 We assume that individuals never choose to completely shift all maintenance from a period
because the high initial marginal productivity of maintenance. This assumption seems to accord
well with actual behavior and guarantees interior solutions.
5
  This is consistent with Hamermesh’s (2005) treatment of the role of household
production for the timing of activities:

       “Routine (selecting the same time for the same activity and repeating it at the
       same time over several periods) is productive, in that it enables the
       producer/consumer to mechanize decisions about when and how to engage in
       each activity, thus allowing her to produce/consume more of each commodity”
       (p.82, parenthetical description inserted).

Hamermesh also discusses the costs of shifting activities between periods to gain variety. His
model suggests that variety contributes to utility, but routine behavior reduces the costs of the
activity.
6
  Both Lagrange multipliers are functions of the parameters of the optimization problem.
Holding the parameters constant we can describe the effects of the marginal product function for
a given level of time allocated to maintenance on the opportunity cost of time implied by the
framework.
7
 Since total maintenance over the time periods is predetermined as is the number of time
periods, the average per period is predetermined.




                                                 35
8
 In this empirical model we use L to denote own maintenance labor to distinguish the amount of
planned labor in the typical week from the actual amount of labor t mj , decided at the short time
horizon.
9
 An alternative way to interpret this equation would be to divide both sides by the marginal
product of own labor. The individual should equate the marginal cost of own production to the
price for purchased maintenance services.
10
  At a conceptual level there are parallels between our structure and what Hall [2009] uses
recently in a macro context. He finds the disparity between the value of time and the marginal
product of labor can be reconciled through complementarities between consumption and labor.
In our context it is the opportunity to adjust a discrepancy in the marginal product of labor for
maintenance that allows measurement of the opportunity cost of time.
11
  This figure reflects adjustment for changes that were not captured with the cross check of tax
records. These include household re-location, death, age limiting a designated respondent’s
ability to answer, and mail loss.
12
  We eliminated observations with a predicted shadow wage greater than $500, those with
reported own maintenance hours greater than 150 hours/week, and those who reported they
would purchase more hypothetical hours of services than they reported actually doing
themselves.
13
  Response rates in the studies these authors considered ranged from 4 percent to 70 percent. A
second study by Keeter et al. (2000) compared a “standard” and “rigorous” survey using
identical questionnaires. The standard realized a response rate of 36 percent and the rigorous
60.6. The authors considered 96 comparisons, no difference exceeded 9 percentage points and
the average difference was 2 points.
14
  Details of the estimation controlling for non-response are available in an appendix available
from the authors.
15
  In the questions preceding the time allocation questions, to orient respondents to time related
choices, the survey also asked about a variety of time-saving market products and services they
may have used recently.
16
   Each respondent was offered a specific price that was randomly selected from six prices. The
six prices are given in the Appendix.
17
  The complete sections of the survey on time use and time-saving activities are available from
the authors on request.
18
   Some of the respondents indicated that they were using hired assistance already for household
tasks. For those who indicated that the hypothetical services we offered would be substituted for




                                                36
the services they already used, we added their own household time and the hired time before
subtracting their purchase of the offered services. For those who said the offered services would
not be substituted for the hired services they were currently using, we used the current own time
and subtracted their purchase of the offered services.
19
     The results for the log form are available from the authors.
20
  Recall that the dependent variable is the combined hours of maintenance in the household and
not hours done by the respondent.
21
     See Kahneman et al. (2004) for related discussion of this issue.
22
  Frazis and Stewart observe that the opportunity cost approach to valuing labor time has
conceptual and practical difficulties. They highlight that: “On a conceptual level, the implicit
assumption that hours of paid work are freely variable at the margin may not hold; workers, at
least in the short run, may have little choice in their working hours. Perhaps more importantly,
the opportunity cost approach assumes that people who are highly productive in market work are
just as productive doing household work. It is hard to imagine that lawyers are five times more
productive building a deck than a carpenter” (p.14).

                                   B. Time Use and Time Saving Activities

6.   Now we would like you to think about your typical weekly schedule and what you and your
     spouse/partner do with your time on average. In a typical week, about how much time do you and your
     spouse/partner (if relevant) spend on each of the following activities? For some categories you may
     hire paid help. If so, the third column asks how many hours in a typical week you pay someone to help
     with some of these activities. Finally, if you feel you are able to freely choose the amount of time you
     spend each week on an activity please check the associated line in the last column.
