            AN ANALYSIS OF FIRM DEMAND FOR PROTECTION AGAINST CRIME

                                  Ann P. Bartel*



       It is well known that as a result of spiralling crime rates, public

expenditures for police protection have been risinci at a rapid rate. It

is less well known, however, that private expenditures for quards, pro-

tective services and equipment have kept pace with the increasing public

expenditures. The data in Table 1 show that durin the 1960's per capita

private protection expenditures and per capita public protection expendi-

tures both rose by 75 per cent in constant dollars. Despite the fact

that in 1970 the private sector allocated at least $3.3 billion of its

resources to protection,1 and this sum is two—thirds the size of the

corresponding public outlay no one has explicitly analyzed the deter-

minants of the private sector's demand for protection.2

   'Total private   orotection expenditures are certainly underestimated
by the fiiures in   Table 1 since a complete measure of private outlays
would include the   cost of substituting taxi rides for subway trips,
keeping lights on   at night, staying home after dark, etc.

     This article, which summarizes a larqer study, 3attempts to fill this

gap by considering firm demand for protection. Since about 85 per cent of

total private security spendinq is by firms an analysis that concentrates

solely on firms explains almost all of the private sector's security

outlays. The main purpose of this article is to answer three questions.

One, how is firm demand for protection related to business losses from

crime and the probability of crime? Two, are public and private expendi—

tures substitutes or complements? Three, does a firm choose self-

protection as a substitute for market insurance or will it spend more on

protection if it has insurance?

      Part I describes a theoretical framework for analyzing a firm's

protection decisions. In Part II I discuss the data set that is used

to test the model and the methods of proxying some of the unobserved

theoretical variables. Part III presents the results of the empirical

analysis. In Part IV the data are used to test what factors, holdinq

protection expenditures constant, predict whether or not a firm will be

victimized.


I. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. The Model

      A firm's decision to purchase protective services and/or market in-

surance can be analyzed within the context of the "state preference"

approach to behavior under uncertainty. Ehrlich and Becker have developed

an expected utility model within this context to analyze protection and

insurance decisions of individuals.4 In what follows I apply their basic

framework to firms but make several important extensions on their model.




   4See I. Ehrlich and G. S. Becker, "Market Insurance, Self—Insurance,
and Self-Protection," Journal of Political Economy, \olume 80, July 1972.




                                                                            .
                                    —4—


      The firm is assumed to produce an output X using two inputs: M,

which is hired labor measured in manhours, and T , which is the entre-

preneur's time.5 For simplicity, X is assumed to be produced according

to a Cobb—Douglas decreasing returns to scale production function:


                       Tm8
                  cx
            X = AM           where a +   8 <   1                       (1)




      The firm is also assumed to be subject to the possibility of losses

from crimes such as burglary, robbery, vandalism, shoplifting and employee

theft. These losses will be denoted L (a composite loss) where L (meas-

ured in dollars) is a function of factors that are exogenous to the firm

as well as being a function of the size of output:



            L = L (Le, X)                                              (2)




      Le, the so-called endowed or exoqenous loss is determined, by among

other things, the firm's industry group and its location (i.e. urban vs.

nonurban). Type of industry can affect Le in one of two ways: the ease

with which merchandise can be transported and the accessibility of the

merchandise. For example, a bank would have a higher Le than a manufac-

turing plant of the same size since banks hold a larger inventory of




      have ignored the obvious third input, capital, because I primarily
wish to emphasize the market—nonmarket dichotomy between certain inputs
in the production process. To the extent that I am dealing with short-
run decisions by the firm, capital could be treated as a fixed factor
and need not enter the short—run production function.
                                   —5—


cash; while the cash is not readily accessible, it is easily transportable

once the criminal has access to it and this would enable him to steal a

larger dollar amount from a bank than from a manufacturing plant for any

given criminal action against these two firms. Alternatively, if one

compared a retailer with a service firm of the same size one would expect

the retailer to have a higher Le since his output is readily accessible to

customers, employees, and burglars, whereas the output of a service firm

is usually not a tangible item. The effect of location on Le is less

clear. An urban firm might have a higher Le than a nonurban firm since

the high population density of urban areas would result in an urban

criminal being more likely to take the risk of stealing a larger amount

than a nonurban one because he could be less easily detected.

      It should be noted that I am assuming that type of industry and

location are fixed for the short-run decisions of the firm which I am

analyzing. of   course,   in the long run the firm could affect Le by

moving to a new neighborhood or changing the nature of its business.

      X, the size of output, has a positive effect on L since the more

the firm produces the larger its potential losses. While protection

expenditures can reduce the probability of a loss they are assumed not

to reduce the size of the loss.6 This relationship enables me to




   6For example, the main function of a security quard is to deter a
criminal frQm attempting to steal from the firm. However, once the crime
takes place, the presence of the guard will have little effect on the
dollar amount that the criminal is actually able to remove from the store.
This distinction between protection affecting probability and not loss is




                                                                             .

assume that -     . - = 1,   a 1 per cent chance in output X results in a

1 per cent change in L and the loss—output ratio remains fixed as firrn

size increases. This is a valid assumntiori since I am merely trvina to

capture a scale effect and there is no obvious reason to assert that L

should increase either at a slower or faster rate than

      The loss, L, is assumed to occur with probability, p, which is a

function of exogenous factors as well as decisions made by the firm:



            p =       c)                                                 (3)




         is the endowment or exogenous probability and it is determined

by the firm's location and tvne of product or industry. Acain one might

expect a retailer to have a higher pe than a service firm because of the

greater availability of merchandise in a retail store. Location in an

urban area would result in a higher e because of the greater supply of

potential criminals.8 The firm can, however, change e by self-protecting.

Let c be the level of self—protection where ap/c < 0 and      <   ej   c > 0.



   71f protection expenditures could   reduce L, then the loss-output elas-
ticity would have to be greater than   1 because this elasticity is com-
puted with protection held constant.   Then if the firm were to double its
output without changing its level of   protection its losses would have to
increase by more than 100 per cent.


   8Urban areas would have a greater supply of potential criminals than
nonurban areas because the median family income is higher in urban areas:

                                                  (continued on next page)
                                   —7—


     Self—protection, c, is assumed to be produced according to a decreas-

ing return to scale production function9 with two inputs: G, guard hours

purchased in the market, and T, time went by the entrepreneur policing

his firm. Thus since c, self—protection, is some function of G and T we

can write the p function as:



                =   (e   G, T)                                       (4)




For simplicity I have not considered the third protection input, capital,

since I am primarily interested in emphasizing the idea that an entre-

preneur can purchase protective services not only in the market but also

from himself.

Ehrlich (1973) has shown that when income inequality is held constant,
median family income has a positive effect on crime rates because it
measures the criminal's potential illegal payoff.

   9Decreasing returns to scale is required by the second-order maximum
condition. See Appendix A in Bartel (1974).

       The role of the entrepreneur as a policeman can be compared to the

analysis by Aichian and Demsetz of the entrepreneur as the monitor of

team production who reduces shirking by team mernbers)0 They show that

the monitor has the incentive not to shirk as a monitor because he has

title to the net earnings of the team. Similarly, in my model, the entre-

preneur has an incentive to reduce the probability of crime against the

firm because in that way he maximizes the net earnings of his firm. Any

other non—guard employee would not have this incentive and he might in

fact try to steal from the firm.

       The function in (4) has the following properties: An increase in

G reduces p and an increase in T reduces p. Also         ap'G   > 0   and

    °See their "Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization,"
AER, 62, December 1972. Their model requires the entrepreneur to spe-
cialize in monitoring whereas I view the entrepreneur as playing two roles,
that of policeman and that of production input (in this latter role he
could in fact be a monitor). Another article dealing with the entrepre-
neur's enforcement role is M. Silver and R. Auster, "Entrepreneurship,
Profit, and Limits on Firm Size," Journal of Business, 42, July 1969.

p. While one could argue that the cross-partials should be negative (i.e.,

the marginal products increase) since the hirinq of a guard may enable the

entrepreneur to allocate his policing time more efficiently (i.e., a divi-

sion of labor effect) it seems more likely that the otposinq effect

dominates, especially as guard time is increased, since division of labor

would only be important when guard usage is first introduced.11 In spite

of the positive cross—partials, however, the self—protection isoquants are

still assumed to be convex.12

      Given that the firm faces two states of the world, the no—loss state

and the loss state (where losses L occur), it maximizes the expected

utility of its net income prospect:



                 = (l—p) U (Ii) + pU                                   (5)
                                     (11—L)



sublect to the production function for output X in (1), the constraint on

L in (2), the constraint on p in (4), and a constraint on the entrepre-

neur's time:



               T=T s +Tm                                               (6)




   HOne other possible source of complementarity is that the entrepre-
neur must police the guards themselves. I have, however, ignored or at
least minimized the importance of this relationship.

   12Convexity is required by the second-order maximum conditions. See
Appendix A in Bartel (1974).

where T is the total time the entrepreneur spends on the job, T is the

entrepreneur's policing time, and Tm is the time he allocates towards

producing output        If initially we assume that insurance is unavail-

able to the firm, net income can be exoressed as:



                                                                        (7)
            Il=kX_wM_wGG

where k is the market price of the output and is assumed fixed for the

firm, w is the waqe rate of the hired input (also constant) and WG is

the wage rate of security guards (also constant for the firm).

      If the firm is risk neutral it maximizes exnected profits and

equation (5) reduces to:



            *kX_wM_wG_pL                                                (8)




The firm maximizes rr* with respect to the variables it controls: M, G,

and T, subject to the four constraints. Internalizing the constraints,

the resulting first order conditions are:


            C-i (k-p)
                             L X    =   w

            C_3_PTs L= (k-pa)               M



       is fixed because the amount of leisure and consumption time are
assumed to be previously determined.
                                   — 11 —




     Condition   C-i states that in equilibrium the marginal revenue from

hiring an additional manhour, M, must equal the marginal cost of hirinq

him. Note that labor is not paid the value of its marginal product

kX/M; rather there is a wedge between the wage and the VMP that is

equal to the expected loss due to hiring the extra manhour and thereby

increasing output. Condition C-2 states that the marginal revenue from

hiring an additional guard hour must equal the guard wage rate. Condi-

tion C-3 states that the marginal revenue from using an additional hour

of own policing time must equal the marginal cost of that hour. Note

that the marginal cost of own time, T, equals the value of the foregone

output X adjusted for the decrease in the expected loss due to the cut-

back in output x. Whereas the entrepreneur can purchase guard time at

constant cost, the marginal cost of T is increasing since Tm has a

diminishing marginal product and since p falls as T is increased. In

addition, since C reduces p, the price of T is not independent of the

number of guard hours the firm   hires.
      Conditions C-2 and C-3 can be combined to form the equilibrium

condition

which states that the ratio of the marginal products of the two protection

inputs must equal the ratio of their marginal costs. This equilibrium

Since G and T are imperfect substitutes the self-protection isoquants are

convex. The slope of the isoquant equals               The transformation curve,


whose slope equals                ,   is   nonlinear because T can not be pur—
                      (k-pa)

chased at constant cost. Equilibrium occurs at the tangency of an isoquant

and the transformation curve.

      Equation (9) points out that guards and entrepreneural time are

asymmetric in the sense that an increase in G reduces p while an increase

in T reduces p and L. (This asymmetry has important implications for com-

parative statics predictions as will be shown below.) Another distinction

between G and T is that there may be some "lumpiness" in the hiring of

guards. For example the optimal decision for a small firm might be to

hire a guard for fifteen minutes out of every hour but contractual con-

straints would not permit this arrangement. Entrepreneurial time, on the

other hand, could be adjusted more precisely. Therefore small firms
                                   — 13 —




might be forced to specialize and only use T to produce protection.14

B. Comparative Statics Predictions

       By differentiating the first order conditions at the maximum the

effects of several exogenous factors on the amounts of G and           that

are used 'can be determined. Complete explanations and proofs of these

results can be found elsewhere;15 a brief summary of the predictions

is presented here.

        1. An increase in the guard wage rate results in a decrease in

the number of guard hours hired and an increase in the amount of the

entrepreneur's time used in self-protection.

       2. An increase in the parameter        in the production function in

(1) causes an increase in guard hours and a decrease in the entrepre-

neur's time.

        3. An increase in the endowed loss results in an increase in

bothGandT.
         S
       4.   An increase in the endowment probability will cause an in-

crease in both G and T if the increase in e raises the marginal
                                         16
products of the two protection inputs.




   14sman firms could avoid this problem by organizing in a group which
would hire a full-time guard. Each firm could then get a few minutes
out of every hour of the guard's time. An alternative solution may be
to hire a guard just for a few key hours out of every day.

level of public protection.

      In   the expected utility literature it is often noted that a 1 per

cent change th Le has the same, larger or smaller percentage effect on

expected utility as does a 1 per cent change in e according to whether

the individual is risk neutral, risk averse or a risk preferrer; hence

the deterrent effect on a criminal of a 1 per cent increase in the prob-

ability of apprehension exceeds, equals, or falls short of the effect of

a 1 percent increase in the fine according to whether he is a risk

preferrer, risk neutral, or a risk avoider)8 A similar test can be

applied to the protection response of firms to an increase in Le and
                e
an increase in p .    In   my model, even though firms are assumed to be

risk neutral, a 1 per cent change in Le has a larger percentage effect

on G than does a 1 per cent change in e19 The reason for this is that

when the increase in e takes place, the firm can maximize expected

profits not only by hiring G, but also by hiring fewer M and thereby

reducing losses. Since the loss itself is endogenous the firm has another
alternative when e rises; this alternative is usually ignored in the

standard expected utility models.

      In the case of the entrepreneur's time, if the loss is completely

exogenous, a 1 per cent increase in Le will have the same relative effect

on T as will a 1 per cent increase in e the usual risk neutral result.

ut since my model treats the loss as endogenous, risk neutrality results

in a 1 per cent increase in Le having a smaller relative effect on T than

does a 1 per cent increase in pe• This is because the increase in

reduces the marginal cost of T thus causing a further expansion of T
                                                20
beyond that of the case of an exogenous loss.


C. Risk Aversion and the Availability of Insurance

      If the assumption of risk neutrality is relaxed such that the firm's

utility function now has a negative second derivative then the firm maxi-

mizes the utility function in (5).      Introducing   insurance into the   model

requires   the insurance premium, q, to be subtracted from I, income in
state one, and the quantity A-qto be added to income in state zero where
A is the amount of insurance the firm purchases and q = ApA.        If insur-

ance is actuarially fair, A =   1,   and all the predictions derived above

hold since the firm acts as if it were risk neutral.




   20Although M is reduced when e rises and this lowers L, CT,Pe is
not reduced because the reduction in M also lowers the marginal cost of
T and these two factors are perfectly offsetting:

d(C-3) =
            0   because   —
                          L   X— = 1.
                                  — 17 —




      The effect of insurance on the demand for guards and entrepreneurial

time is unclear. An increase in A reduces the net loss to the firm    and
the marginal gain from self-protecting either via C or T diminishes.

This is the source of the moral hazard problem; if a firm has loss cover-

age it has no incentive to reduce the probability of the loss occurring.

On the other hand, an increase in G or T reduces the price of insurance

since p falls and q = ApA, thereby implying a complementary relationship

between protection and insurance. However one would expect to observe a

stronger complementary relationship between guards and insurance than

between entrepreneur's policing time and insurance because there is an

additional negative relationship between T and A that does not exist

for G and A; that is, an increase in T reduces L since output falls

and the reduction in L lowers the demand for insurance.


D. Industry Equilibrium

      The model described above considered the reactions of a single firm

in a competitive industry to losses from various crimes. One of the basic

assumptions of the model was that the firm could not affect the price of

its output. Althouqh crime increased the firm's costs the firm reached

an equilibrium by producing that output where its new marginal cost

equalled the fixed market nrice. However, as discussed in Section A, all

firms in a particular industry in a given location will be faced with a

certain amount of crime as described by the variables e and Le. Since

all of these firms will face higher marginal cost curves as a result of




                                                                             .
                                  — 18 —




crime the industry supply curve will shift to the left and the market price
will rise. Of course if one firm in the industry is especially vulnerable

to crime it may be forced out of business since the leftward shift in its

marginal cost curve will outweigh the increase in the market price; the

intersection of its marginal cost curve and its horizontal demand curve

may only occur at an output of zero units.

       Since firms in different industries in a particular location and

firms in a single industry in varying locations will face different

endowed losses and endowed probabilities one would expect to observe

changes in relative prices across these groups. For example, if over

time, crime against retailers increases relative to crime against service

firms, then one should observe an increase over time in the price of re-

tail goods relative to the price of services, holding location and other

shift factors (e.g., technological change) constant. Alternatively, if

crime against urban firms increases over time relative to crime against

nonurban firms then one should observe an increase over time in the price

of retail goods in urban areas relative to the price of retail goods in

nonurban areas.

       Similar predictions would hold in the cross-section. Using data

on industries in a given location and choosing one industry as the

nuzneraire, a regression of industry price on demand factors and supply

factors should yield positive siqns on the independent variables meas-

uring the probability of crime in the industry and the endowed loss in

the industry.

E.   Reaction of Offenders

        The model as developed up until this point is still only a partial

equilibrium model. It is a model of how firms react to the possibility

of losses from various crimes and describes how market prices are affected

by crime. One assumption of the model was that if a crime took place, a

firm would lose $L where L was determined by Le, a set of exogenous fac-

tors, and X, size of output. Each firm, therefore, had a specific L.

Why is it that the market can tolerate loss differentials across firms?

The answer lies in the fact that the offender's cost of committing a crime

will differ across firms. In evaluating possible targets, the offender

considers a net return function for each firm:



                 N. = (1 —
                  1
                             f.)
                              1
                                   L. — R. —
                                    1    1
                                               f.1 F.1                   (10)




where   L. is the gain to the criminal if he successfully carries out the

crime, f. is the probability of his being apprehended, R. is his resource

costs in perpetrating the crime, and F. is the punishment for committing

the crime. For simt1icity I assume that all offenders have equal

productivities so that every offender has the identical net return for

the i
     .th
            firm. 21
             .




           The firm is able to raise f. and R. by self-protecting. If the

entrepreneur hires a guard and/or spends his own time policing, the




    21T. Ozenne (1974) also makes this assumption in developing his gen-
eral eguilibrium model of theft and protection.



                                                                                .
                                    — 20 —




probability   of a criminal being apprehended in his store increases and

moreover, the criminal may have to engage more of his own resources in

order to successfully commit a crime in this store. The entrepreneur

has the incentive to increase f. and R. because this will reduce the
                               1      1
probability of a crime being committed against his firm and expected

profits will thereby increase. Also, he can reduce L. by cuttinq back

on his output. F. is presumably out of the entrepreneur's control

since it would be decided by public officials.

         Then, in order for the market to tolerate loss differentials

across firms, net returns to crime must be equalized across firms.

This implies that, in the cross—section, the occurrence of higher

losses, L., should be associated with hiqher exnected --punishments and
                                             -




higher   criminal resource costs.


II. EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION

    Data limitations make it impossible to test all of the implications

of the theoretical model. The market equilibrium conditions discussed

in Sections D and E of Part I are not considered in the empirical work.

Moreover only those comparative statics predictions outlined in Sections

B and C of Part I that deal with the demand for guards are tested here.


A. The Data

         The data set used to test some of the implications of the theoretical

model is the Small Business Administration's 1968 Survey of Crime Against
                                 — 21 —




Business.22 While the survey was performed by the Small Business Adminis-
tration, it should be pointed out that the survey was not limited to small

businesses; in fact annual gross receipts for the firms included in the

sample ranged from under $10,000 to over $10,000,000. The survey was

designed to measure business losses from various crimes and protection

decisions and expenditures by individual firms. The sample of firms was

selected from corporate and business tax returns for fiscal years ending

between July 1, 1965 and June 30, 1966. After excluding returns filed

for agriculture, forestry, and fishery businesses, the sample was

stratified by type of business ownership and by size of business receipts.

A self—weighted 1 in 1,400 sample was then selected; however, only 50 per

cent of the businesses were actually interviewed in the summer of 1968

resulting in a final group of approximately 2,450 firms. I reduced the

sample to 1,941 firms because many firms failed to provide information

on their losses and protection expenditures.

       The crime cateqories included in the survey were shoplifting,

burglary, robbery, vandalism, and employee theft.23 The Small Business

Administration asked each firm to give dollar amounts for each of the

above types of loss that it incurred during the twelve—month period




    22See U.S. Small Business Administration, "Crime Against Small Busi-
ness," a Report Transmitted to the U.S. Senate, U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1969, for a complete description of the survey.

    23The firms were also questioned about their losses from bad checks
but I excluded these losses.

prior   to the date of the interview, i.e., between July 1967 and July

1968.24 Table 2 shows the distribution of the reported losses broken

down by type of loss and location of firm.          The relatively low loss

figures in lines 1 and 4 are explained by the fact that many firms ex-

perienced no losses at all. 2mong those firms with a loss, however,

the averaqe loss for urban firms was $1,400 while for nonurban firms

it was $600. While urban firms incurred laraer losses than nonurban

firms in every category the distribution of the total losses into the

separate categories differs by location. Burglary and vandalism com-

prise 64 per cent of urban losses but represent only 51 per cent of

nonurban losses; employee theft and shoplifting account for only 33

per cent of urban losses but they comprise 46 per cent of nonurhan

losses.


B. Demand for Guards Equation

        The basic reduced form equation from Part I which will be tested

on the Small Business Administration data is as follows:


              Guards = a +        Endowed Loss +
                             b1                    b2 Endowed Probability
                       +        Public Protection +        Wage of Guards
                           b3                         b4
                                                                              (11)
                       +        Education of Guards +
                           b5                           b6 Experience of
                       Entrepreneurs +          Insurance + u
                                           b7



   24The firms actually picked a loss interval into which their loss fell.
I used the midpoint of the interval to measure the actual loss value. For
the open-ended intervals arbitrary values were used but very few firms had
losses which fell into these upper intervals.

The empirical proxies of the theoretical variables re discussed below.


C. Dependent Variables

      The SBA asked each firm whether or not it (a) employed a guard or

watchman or hired a guard throuch a security auard service, or (b) sub-

scribed to a protective service. Firms that did subscribe to a protec-

tive service were asked to give the monthly fee they paid for this

service. The difference between a guard or watchman and a protective

service is in the amount and type of protection each provides. A guard

is assigned to patrol a store for a specified period of time. Hence,

if he works for a retailer during the day, he is able to reduce the prob-

ability of shoplifting, employee theft and robbery. If he is a night

watchman for a manufacturing plant his primary responsibility is to re-

duce the probability of burglary and vandalism. If a firm subscribes

to a protective service, however, it does not aet full—time protection

from a guard or watchman. Rather a group of firms, in ore neighborhood,

hires a guard service to patrol the entire area and each individual firm,

therefore, may receive only a few minutes of actual protection out of

every hour that the guard is on duty in the neighborhood. Since a pro-

tective service patrols outside the store and usually at night, the

service is primarily aimed at reducing the probability of burglary and

vandalism. The average monthly expenditures for these protective services

is approximately $50. Moreover, 7 per cent of the firms in the sample re-

ported subscribing to a protective service while 6 per cent reported that

they had a guard.
                                 — 25 —




      Since the SBA survey made the above distinction between the two

types of guard service, I was able to test the model in Part I using

two dependent variables. Unfortunately, the data only enabled me to

approximate the number of guards by a dummy variable (GD) which eauals

one if the firm has a guard and zero if it does not. The presence or

absence of a protective service is similarly measured with a dummy

variable (PSER).


D. Independent Variables
                                  e
1. Estimate of the endowed loss (L

      The model in Part I assumes that the firm has some subjective

measure of Le, the dollar loss that it will incur qiven that a crime

takes place and also ignoring scale effects (i.e., the effect of size

of output on absolute losses). Le was assumed to be determined by

the type of industry and location of the firm. The empirical specif i-

cation in equation (11) requires that a dollar figure be assigned to

each firm to measure its Le. I assume that the
                                                 .th   firm decides what

its    is by looking at the recent loss experience of other firms that

have similar industry and location characteristics. The th firm looks

at the losses experienced by these firms in the previous twelve months

and uses this information to predict what it thinks its own Le will be

for the coming period. In other words, if firms in the surrounding

neighborhood (or in the same industry) have been experiencing very high

losses, (when a crime takes place), the th firm in that neighborhood




                                                                           .
                                     — 26   —




(industry)   realizes that it faces a high Le and it will be more likely to

hire a guard than a firm in a neighborhood (industry) with a low Le. It

is not important that the 1th firm might have had the guard during the

past year; what matters is that it currently has a guard and this is in

part determined by its estimation of the losses it thinks it will incur

in the next few months if a crime is committed against the firm.

        The estimation of Le requires grouping the firms in the sample into

cells of "similar" firms. I used two grouping methods. For the first

method, the firms were stratified by industry group (nine categories),

urban/nonurban, and three size categories (gross sales less than

$50,000, between $50,000 and $500,000, and greater than $500,000), re-

sulting in fifty-four cells. Although the theoretical model describes

Le as being unrelated to size of firm, I used the three broad size

categories because there was a tremendous range in the sizes of the

firms    in the sample and it seemed unreasonable to assume that an urban
grocery store with $10,000 gross sales would gain any information from
the loss experience of an urban department store with $1,000,000 gross
sales.    Size, however, is really not held constant in the construction

of Le since within each of the three categories there is still much size

variation.

         The second grouping method is to stratify by geographic region of

the country    (nine regions),   urban/nonurban, and the three size cells.

This method is not as attractive as the first one since it is unlikely
that a retailer in a certain area would use the losses of a bank (in
                                       — 27 —




the   same area) as a measure of its own endowed loss; but stratifying by

industry, region, urban and size was impossible because too many small

cells would be produced.

        After the firms were appropriately grouped, Le was computed by

taking the mean loss in the twelve—month period of those firms in the

cell that had a positive loss. The five types of losses were added

together in computing this variable

        The above argument assumes that the th firm relies on the loss

experience of similar firms in predicting its endowed loss. It is, of

course, possible that if the 1th firm itself experienced a very high

loss during the previous twelve months then the average loss of the

other firms may be an underestimate of this firm's Le for the coming

period. On the other hand, a high loss during one particular twelve-

month period could be due to special random events in that period and,

therefore, the th firm's actual loss last year may provide no infor-

mation for its future losses. One could therefore express Le as:



              Le =   +   (La   —   )                                (12)



where L is the mean loss in the firm's cell, La is its actual loss and

S1is an adjustment coefficient that lies between zero and one. Infor-

mation on La is, of course, only obtained for those firms (40 per cent

of the sample) that had a positive loss during the twelve-month period.

Also La embodies the scale effect of output on L and size of firm must




                                                                            .
                                   — 28 —




therefore   be held constant in the regression. Of course the importance of

a $1,000 deviation will probably differ if L is $500 or $5,000 and there-

fore a more useful way of incorporating the firm's own loss is to consider

the relative deviation of its dollar loss, i.e.



              Le=L+l(LL)                                                    (13)



L (LOSS), and the expression in (13) are tested in Part III as empirical

estimates of the firm's   endowed loss.

2.   Estimate of the endowed probability (re)

       The two methods of grouping described above were also used to com-

pute        For the th firm, an estimate of its endowment probability is
                                   •
the ratio of the number of firms in the i
                                            . th
                                                   firm's cell that reported a

loss over the total number of firms in the cell (PROS). The second

grouping method, usinq region rather than industry, may be more appro-

priate since the fact that a bank in a given area experienced a loss

indicates to a retailer in the same area that businesses in the neighbor-

hood are incurring losses from crime; the fact that a retailer in another

area experienced a loss would not provide information on the local crime

rate but would indicate that retailers are more susceptible to crime than,

for example, service firms. Therefore, both methods should provide suit-

able measures for e whereas in the case of Le the industry grouping should

be far superior to the regional grouping.

       One problem with measuring e in this manner is that the actual

incidence of crime in a given cell is determined not only by endowment
                                  — 29 —




factors   like industry and location but also by the protection expendi-

tures of the firms in the cell.25 Therefore if p,     the   incidence of

crime, in one cell is greater than p   in   another cell this could in part

be due to the fact that the average protection expenditures of the firms

in the first cell are less than those of the firms in the second cell.

In order for p to measure e, the mean protection expenditures in the

cell must be held constant. The variable used to construct this mean

(AVG) is the totaléxpenditure of each firm on all protective devices

that it had purchased up until the date of the interview. Using the

average monthly expenditures on protective services would not have been

preferable since labor is a variable factor and one cannot be sure that

these same expenditures were beinq made eight or ten months ago since

the firm could have easily adjusted its expenditures in response to

new information about future losses. While total expenditures on pro-

tective devices may also reflect responses to recent events, they do

include past expenditures, e.q., an alarm system that was installed a

few years ago, so that this variable serves as a much better control

for the level of protection during the rrevious twelve-month period.

      Although the relationship between probability and protection expendi-

tures should be nonlinear (because protection has a diminishing marginal




   25This problem does not occur for Le, because according to the assump-
tions of the model in Part I, protection reduces the probability of a
crime, hut once the crime ta]•:es place, it has little effect on the size
of the loss incurred.




                                                                              .

product),    let us assume that we can express the observed probability in a

cell as:



               p. =         +    C,                                                       (14)



where p. is the observed incidence of crime for the                         cTroup, C. is the

mean protection expenditures for the qroup, and 8 is neqative. If C.

equals zero then p. perfectly measures p; hence                    =   1.    8, however, is

not independent of              since an increase in crime rates is assumed to raise

the marqina]. product of the nrotection inouts.26 In other words,



                                                                                          (15)



where A is negative since it measures the effect of orotection on nrob-

ability that is independent of the level of                    and y is also negative

because at a given C the slope of the p(C) function is steeper the hiqher

   ,e      Substituting for 8          in      (14) and solving for p we have:



                   =   --
                       p.         AC
                                                                                          (16)
                        l+y
and since the th firm's demand for guards can be written as:


                                       e
               G. = a       +              +                                             (17)

where p is measured by PROB and C is measured by AVG.

         The true partial effect of e on G. is b1, but we observe the co-

efficient on p which is

                            l+yC



Since the absolute value of yC is less than one27 the coefficient that we

observe overestimates the true effect of e on G.. This happens because

we underestimate the true difference between, for example, p and p, when

we use p and               To get b1, therefore, requires iterating on different

values of y that satisfy 1 > 1 + yC >                   0.     Note that equation (18) shows
                                                                     (—          A)

that the coefficient that we observe on AVG,                                          ,   will   be positive

since        is positive and A is negative.




   27Substituting (15)           into         (14) we have

  Since A is negative, in order to guarantee that p. lies between 0 and 1,
the quantity 1 + 1C        must         be a positive fraction.

      As with the endowed loss, the firm's own experience can be used to

modify the estimate of the endowment probability as follows:


             e   =     -    XC
                                  +    . POSLOS                               (20)
                           l+yC


where POSLOS eauals one if the firm had a loss durinq the previous twelve

months and zero if it did not. In Part III        e
                                                      is estimated by   the
expressions in (16) and (20).


3. Public protection

      The level of public molice protection in the firm's area is measured

by per capita nolice protection exnenditures by state and local aovernments

in the firm's state (PUB) for the qovernment fiscal year endinq June 30,

1968.28 In order to correctly measure the effect of public protection,

however, the crime rate in the firm's area must be held constant. For

each state it is possible to construct separate crime rates for SMSAs, for

other cities, and for rural areas. Since the property crime rate can have

an independent effect on the firm's decision to hire a quard or protective

service (apart from servinq as a control variable for public protection)

because it is an alternative way of measuririq a firm's e I include only

burqlarv, robbery, and larceny in the construction of the crime variable.

Then for the .th firm the value of the local crime rate (CRIME) is the

number of burglaries, robberies and larcenies per 100,000 inhabitants in

4.   Price and   nroductiviy     variables
       The real waqe of private guards (CDI) is measured by the ratio of the

median earnings of male full-time employed guards and watchmen in the state
in   which the firm      is located to a once index computed from the averaae

hourly   earnings      of manufacturing workers in the state.3°

       The education of guards is measured by the average number of '7ears of

school completed by male emplored protective service workers in the firm's

state (EDtJC) 3l Since the protective service worker cateory includes

oublic policemen and firemen as well as private guards, the ratio of muards

to all protective service workers in the state is included (PCT) in the
                           32

      The entrenreneur's experience must be proxied by the nuxrtber of years

the firm has been at its present location (YRS). This variable would he

hiahlv correlated with the aqe of the firm and the firm's aqe would be a

proxy for the owner's experience and hence his productivity as a businessman

and as a nrotector of his firm. There may be a bias due to the possibility of

non-mobile firms being in urban, hich—crime areas. This can be accounted for

by controllina for location in the reciression. A descrintjon of the location

variables is qiven below in number 6.




5. Insurance

      The model in Part I treats insurance as an endoaenous variable.

Unfortunately the available data do not enable me to identify a system

of protection and insurance equations and my empirical analysis assumes

that insurance can be used as an indenendent variable in the demand for

quards equation. The firms in the sample indicated whether or not they cur-

rently had burcTlary insurance, robbery or theft insurance, and vandalism in-

surance. Those firms that renorted nositive burqlarv losses also reported

how much the insurance company reimbursed them for their loss.

      A dummy variable (ANYINS), which equals one if the firm has any tvne

of insurance and zero if it has none, is used to emnirically examine the

relationship between insurance and protection. Simultaneity may haraner the

estimation of the ANYINS coefficient since if a firm hires a quard it is

able to purchase insurance at a lower rate and would therefore be more likely

to have insurance coverage; a positive coefficient could reflect the influence

of protection on insurance.
                                     — 35 —




      Tjsjna the dollar amount that the firm was reimbursed by the insur-

ance company after a burglary took place (At1T3INS) should avoid this

problem. Since the reimbursement took olace several months ago, ArITBINS

can he treated as an exogenous variable referring to an insurance decision

made by the firm in a previous period. GD (PSER) would not have any ef-

fect on AMTBINS as long as the firm did not have a guard (protective

service) at the time it purchased the burglary insurance policy. While

ANTT3INS   does   not really measure the amount of coverace the firm had since

the loss could have been less than the face value of the nolicy, it does

capture the effect of insurance on reducing the net loss to the firm.

Then if the value of the actual burqlary loss is held constant (BGLOS)

and a dummy variable for the presence of burqlary insurance is also used

(BINS), the coefficient on AMTBINS should be negative since it provides

information for the firm on how much it can exmect to he reimbursed if

future burglary losses occur, Of course, if the firm had a guard (or

protective service) at the time of last year's burglary then it may have

been more likely to have insurance coverage and would therefore report a

larger reimbursement; this would bias the coefficient on N4TBINS towards

zero. Note that the testing of AMTBINS can only be done on the subset
of firms that had positive burglary losses.


6. Other variables

      Some other variables not specified in equation (11) are also added.

They are as follows:




                                                                                 .

                          located in a metropolitan area of 50,000 or

                          more but not in a suburb; zero otherwise.


              GilT:       Dummy variable which equals one if the firm

                          is located in a ghetto in a city of 50,000

dichotomous   logit function must be employed.             The logit model, which

is estimated by the method of maximum likelihood, specifies the prob-

ability that the firm hires a guard as:



                      =            1
                                                                                 (21)

where X. is a vector of exogenous variables. Tables 3 and 4 contain the

results of the maximum likelihood estimation of equation (21) using GD




   33A linear probability function cannot be employed because the usual
tests of a significance of the estimated coefficients cannot be used;
predicted values of some observations may lie outside the zero to one
range since a linear function is unbounded, and the residuals are not
homoskedastic. The logit function avoids these problems.
                                          — 37 —




and PSER as the dependent variables. Analyzing these two tables simulta—

neously facilitates a comparison of the factors that determine the hiring

of a security guard and the subscription to a protective service. Insur-

ance variables are excluded from the regression in Tables 3          and   4;   since
their inclusion in the equation did not affect the other variables the
effect of insurance on the demand for protection is discussed later.

A. Endowed Loss, Endowment Probability, and the Effect
      of Protective Devices on the Probability of a Loss
1. Endowed loss
        In Tables 3 and 4 the firm's endowed loss is estimated by LOSS,             the

mean loss of other firms as described in Part II. Regressions 3.1, 3.2,
3.4   and   4.1, 4.2, 4.4   use   the industry grouping   method. LOSS1 has     a
positive    and significant34 effect in all the equations. When size of

firm and location are not held constant, an increase of $1,000 in the

endowed loss makes the firm 32 per cent more likely to hire a guard and

26 per cent more likely to subscribe to a protective service.35 When

size and location are held constant the partial effect of LOSS1 is re-

duced because size and location are used in the construction of the




   34The significance level in regressions 3.2 and 3.4 is 12 per cent.


   35These effects are computed by using the mean probability of hiring
a guard which is .059 and the mean probability of subscribing to a
protective service which is .069.

endowed loss variable. From regressions 3.2 and 4.2, a $1,000 increase in

the endowed loss results in the firm being 14 per cent more likely to hire

a guard and 16 per cent more likely to subscribe to a protective service.

When the endowed loss is estimated via the regional method in regressions

3.3 and 4.3 its effect is, as predicted, much smaller than that of the

industry loss and, moreover, the effect is not significant. An increase

of $1,000 in the regional endowed loss, not holding size and location

constant, makes the firm only 13 per cent more likely to hire a guard and

10 per cent more likely to subscribe to a protective service; these ef-

fects are about two—fifths the size of the industry loss effects.


2. Endowment probability

      In Tables 3 and 4 the firm's endowment probability is estimated by

PROB, the incidence of crime among "similar" firms. As shown in (19) the

coefficients on PROB overestimate the true effects of the endowment prob-

ability. Choosing values for y within the acceptable range

0 < 1 + y AVG < 1   enables one to compute the true effects. The largest

acceptable value for y under the industry grouping method is   -
                                                                   .0011
while for the regional method it is f—.0022. For comparative purposes,

the value - .001 is used to compute all the estimated effects of the

endowment probability.

      When size and location are not held constant an increase of ten

percentage points in the industry e (PROB') makes the firm 20 per cent

more likely to hire a guard and 29 per cent more likely to subscribe to
                                 — 41 —




a protective service. Holding size and location constant the effects are

reduced to 14 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. All of these co-

efficients are significant. Using the regional method to measure the

endowment probability, with size and location not held constant, we find

that an increase of ten percentage points in    makes the firm 29 per

cent more likely to hire a guard and 34 per cent more likely to sub-

scribe to a protective service. As predicted in Part II the regional

probability is a better measure of e than the industry probability but

both still have   significant effects on the firm's protection decisions.

Unlike the results for the endowed loss, both industry and region are

important determinants of the firm's endowment probability.


3. Effect of protective devices on reducing
    the probability of a loss

      As predicted by equation (18) in Part II, the coefficients on AVG

have positive and significant effects on the probability that the firm

hires a guard and on the probability that it subscribes to a protective

service. The ratio of the coefficient on AVG to the coefficient on PROB

is an estimate of A which is that portion of the effect of protection

expenditures on the probability of a loss,measured across cells, that is

independent of e (see equation (15) in Part II]. Table 5 shows the

estimates of A from Tables 3 and 4, the estimates of , and the full ef-

fect of protection on the probability of a loss when I = — .001 and

is computed as in equation (16). It should be emphasized that B reflects

the reduction in p due to expenditures on protective devices.




                                                                            S
                                   — 42 —




       From Table 5 we find, using the industry method,that if a     firm that
has already made outlays of $79 on protective devices (the mean AVG1)

spends one more dollar on a device it can reduce its probability of a

loss by approximately .0015. Ignoring diminishing marginal productivity,

an expenditure of $100 would reduce the probability by fifteen percentage

points. With the regional method, however, an expenditure of $100 is

estimated to reduce the probability of a loss by only ten percentage

points. The regional effects are smaller because of the strong positive

correlation (p =    .61) between PROB' and AVG1. While the theory predicts
that an increase in protection expenditures reduces the probability of

a loss, i.e. A is negative, I have measured A across regional groups,

and across groups the higher the probability the higher will be protec-

tion expenditures in that group. This is similar to the problem of

estimating the effect of public protection expenditures on crime rates

in a cross-section of states. While protection expenditures reduce

crime, if crime is high expenditures will be high, thus resulting in a

positive correlation. A positive bias therefore exists in the estimation

of A with   the regional method. Since the   correlation between PROB' and

AVG'   is only .28 larger absolute values   for A are   estimated with the
industry method.

4.   Elasticity   of Le vs. elasticity of
       Table   6 summarizes the elasticities of GD and PSER with respect to

the endowed loss and the endowment probability which are measured by the

loss experience of other firms. The probability elasticity is computed

at   the mean e36 In all the regressions                      is significantly larger than

CLe. As indicated in Part I (see footnote 19) this result can be con-

sistent with our original assumption that firms act as if they are risk

neutral or risk averse.


5. The firm's own loss experience

          In Table 7 the estimates of the endowed loss and the endowment prob-

ability are modified to consider the influence of the firm's own loss

experience in the previous twelve months. While RELDEV is statistically

significant in both regressions 7.1 and 7.3 its economic significance is

minimal. If a firm had a loss that was 50 per cent above the mean loss

of the group then it is only about 5 per cent more likely to hire a guard

and 6 per cent more likely to subscribe to a protective service. These

small effects could be due to one or both of the following:                  (1) Simul-

taneity exists since a firm that currently has a guard (protective service)

may also have had him last year and this firm would therefore be very

likely to have reported zero or very low losses for the year.                  (2) The

firm does not consider the value of its own loss a good estimate of the

value of future losses. By averaging the losses incurred by similar firms

this    particular firm obtains a less stochastic estimate of its endowed   S
loss.

        One way to test these alternative hypotheses is to include the

dummy variable POSLOS in the estimate of the endowment probability as

is done in regressions 7.2 and 7.4. These regressions indicate that if

a firm had a loss last year it is 88 per cent more likely to hire a

guard now and 84 per cent more likely to currently subscribe to a pro-

tective service.37 Obviously even if simultaneity is present it does

not affect the strong positive influence of the firm's having been

victimized. But the dollar loss that the firm incurred has no effect

in regressions 7.2 and 7.4 since RELDEV is not significant there.

This indicates that the absolute value of the loss incurred last year

is not a good estimate of the firm's future loss but the mere occurrence

of the crime is an important determinant of the firm's endowment prob-
           38
ability.

  381n regression 7.2, PROB1 is no lonqer significant. This could be due
to its correlation with POSLOS which is .4. However in regression 7.4,
PROB' is still quite significant. Since RELDEV is not 4gnificant in
reqressions 7.2 and 7.4 and RELDEV is a funrtion of LOSS', the effects of

LOSS'    in    these regressions are not significant. Because RELDEV adds
nothing to the regressions, however, the true effects of LOSS1 should not
be reduced by addinq an insignificant coefficient.

                                                                            .

B.   Public Expenditures and Crime Rates

1. Public expenditures

       The true effect of public protection expenditures on the demand for

private guards and protective services can only be measured if the crime

rate is held constant as is done in regressions 3.4 and 4.4. These

regressions indicate a public expenditure elasticity of -.32 for GD and

— .43 for PSER. The relatively larger and more significant effect for

PSER can be explained by the different nature of the tasks that the two

types of security personnel perform. A quard can work as a night watch-

man and thereby reduce the probability of burglary and vandalism. Or he

may be assigned to work inside the store or plant in order to protect

against shoplifting and employee theft. In the latter role his substitu-

tability with public policemen is almost nil since he performs a task that

could not possibly be performed by the policeman on the beat. A protec-

tive service, however, acts in a very similar capacity to that of

public policemen since it patrols outside the store, and therefore its

primary responsibility is to reduce the occurrence of burglary and/or

vandalism.

       However, even though CRIME is held constant, PUB is not really

significant in either regression 3.4 or 4439 A possible explanation

of these coefficients could be that the level of per capita public




       have also used the number of policemen per capita to measure pub-
lic protection and its effects were insignificant. See Bartel (1974).
                                    — 49 —




expenditures   or the number of policemen per capita does not correctly

measure the amount of public protection the firm receives. This prob-

lem was documented in a recent study of the police forces in several
                40
large cities.        For example, the study found that although the New

York City police force increased by 20,000 men over the last two

decades, or from 1.39 policemen per 1,000 inhabitants to 3.92 police-

men per 1,000 inhabitants, the number of police officers actually out

on patrol remained constant over the same period. Similar disparities

were reported in other large cities. To the extent that time series

coefficients and cross—sectional coefficients are comparable, this

phenomenon can explain why a firm will not necessarily reduce its

level of private protection when public expenditures increase.


2. Crime rates

      The coefficients on CRIME are noticeably different in regressions

3.4 and 4.4. CRIME has no effect on the probability that the firm will

hire a guard but it has a positive and significant effect on the prob-

ability that it will subscribe to a protective service. There are two

reasons for these diverse coefficients. First, since only a fraction

of the total property crime rate (about 43 per cent of burglary,




   40See David Burnham, "1,000 of the City's 31,000 Policemen Are Out
in Radio Cars at Any One Time," The New York Times, February 18, 1974
for a description of the survey's findings.




                                                                          .
                                   — 50   —




25 per cent of robbery, 10 per cent of larceny)41 refers to crimes against

business, firms would not use CRIME as a very reliable measure of their

own endowment probabi].ity.42 A firm would not be willing to commit itself

to the employment of a full-time guard based on imperfect information but

it may be more   willing to make a small outlay in the   form of a subscription

to   a protective service. Second, since CRIME primarily measures crimes

against non—businesses, household demand for protection will rise when

CRIME rises. One type of protection households could seek is that pro-

vided by a protective service and a substantial household demand for this

service could facilitate a firm's subscription to it. If a private patrol

car will be dispatched to police a neighborhood only if there are a cer-

tain number of subscribers in that neighborhood then an increase in crime

against both residences and businesses would enable them to agree on the

hiring of a protective service for their neighborhood.


C. Size of Firm

        Evaluating the effect of REC at its mean value, we find from regres-

sions 3.2 and 4.2 that a firm with gross sales of approximately $1.5




   41These percentages are based on information contained in Table 18 of
the 1967 Uniform Crime Reports. This residence/business breakdown was
only done for 673 cities with a population of at least 25,000 but the
figures can serve as general guidelines for the U.S. as a whole.


   421n fact, the elasticity of PSER withrespect to CRIME is only .66
while the elasticity with respect to PROB' (evaluated at e) in regres-
sion 4.4 is 1.26.
                                        — 51 —




million   would be 38 per cent more likely to hire a guard than one with

gross sales of $1/2 million but it would only be 28 per cent more likely

to subscribe to a protective service. Even though LOSS and PROB are held

constant in the regression and REC is used to construct these variables,

REC still has a positive effect because REC is only stratified into three

groups to compute LOSS and PROB. The coefficient on REC reflects the

complete size variation and thus the influence of size on dollar losses.

The theoretical model predicted, however, that small firms would be more

likely to subscribe to protective services since they expect a smaller

loss (everything else held constant) and would not require their own

guard. Although REC has a positive and significant effect on PSER, the

effect is 35 per cent smaller than the effect of REC on the demand for

guards; this would be consistent with the theoretical prediction.


D. Location of Firm

      The effect of being in an urban area and/or in a ghetto can be

analyzed as follows: Since ghetto firms must be in urban areas, the

ghetto dummy is actually an interaction term, i.e.



              P. =a+b 1URB+b URB*GHT+
                             2
                                      ....                                 (22)



Then the effect of being in an urban area is




                    =     + b2   GIlT                                      (23)




                                                                                  .
                                — 52 —




and the effect of being in a ghetto is




            ::   = b2                                                    (24)




Therefore, b1 measures the effect of being in an urban nonghetto area

versus a nonurban area; b2 measures the effect of being in a ghetto

versus an urban nonghetto area; and (b1 + b2) is the effect of being in

a ghetto versus a nonurban area. From regressions 3.4 and 4.4 where

CRIME is held constant we find that (1) ghetto firms are more likely to

hire both guards and protective services than are nonurban firms; (2)

ghetto firms are more likely to subscribe to protective services than

are urban nonghetto firms but they are not more likely to hire guards;

and (3) urban nonqhetto firms are more likely to hire guards than are

nonurban firms but they are not more likely to subscribe to protective

services.

      Ghetto firms are more likely to hire both guards and protective

services than are nonurban firms because they face higher endowment

probabilities and higher endowed losses from crime. This effect is
                        i        i                         i
not picked up in the LOSS and PROB coefficients because LOSS and

PROB' only distinguish between urban and nonurban firms without any

special provision for ghetto firms; and ghetto firms have significantly

higher endowment probabilities than urban nonghetto firms.43 The




   43From Table 10, regression 10.3, we see that ghetto firms are 73
per cent more likely to incur a loss than urban nonghetto firms.
However when the sante equation is run just on those firms with a loss
and the dollar value of the loss is used as the dependent variable,
GilT is not significant.
                                 — 53 —




magnitude of (b1 + b2) is about the same in both equations; ghetto firms

are 70 per cent more likely to hire guards and 78 per cent more likely

to subscribe to protective services than are nonurban firms.

      The fact that ghetto firms are more likely to subscribe to protec-

tive services but not more likely to hire guards than are urban nonghetto

firms is due to the size distribution of surroundina firms. Ghetto

firms are more homogenous in size than urban nonghetto firms.44 A small

ghetto firm has many other small firms in its neighborhood that also need

protection but whose size precludes them from hiring their own guard;

these firms would be anxious to subscribe to a protective service that

could patrol the entire area. The small urban nonghetto firm, on the

other hand, does not necessarily have many other small firms nearby with

whom it could hire a protective service; it is not unusual, for example,

for a small retailer to be located on the same block with many large

department stores that hire their own full-time guards.

      The reason that urban nonghetto firms are more likely to hire guards

but not more likely to hire protective services than are nonurban firms

relates to the urban nonghetto firm's higher probability of employee




   44The standard deviation of REC for ghetto firms is 339,380 and the
coefficient of variation is 2.1. The standard deviation for urban non—
ghetto firms is 2,753,558 and the coefficient of variation is 3.




                                                                             .

theft.45      When CRIME   is   not held constant (see regressions 3.2 and 4.2),

URB   is   significant for both forms of protection; obviously LOSS' and

PROB! do not completely capture the urban firm's vulnerability to crime.

The addition of CRIME provides more information on the urban firm's

probability of external theft (i.e. burglary, vandalism, robbery) and

thereby weakens the urban dummy in both regressions 3.4 and 4.4. How-

ever, CRIME does not measure employee theft and PROB measures the prob-

ability of         crime, not specifically employee theft. URB therefore

captures the higher incidence of employee theft among urban nonghetto

firms than nonurban firms and the demand for guards among urban non—

ghetto firms will rise; since protective services do not affect em-

ployee theft URB is insignificant in regression 4.4.


E. Other Independent Variables in Tables 3 and 4

           GDI is negative and significant in all the regressions in Table 3

because of the own price effect. While it is negative in all the

regressions in Table 4 it is not significant there and this is prob-

ably due to the Census category, "guards and watchmen," which was

used. Protective services are more properly classified as private

patrolmen but in the Census the wage rates of private patrolmen are




   45The observed probability of employee theft among urban nonghetto
firms is .081 while for nonurban firms it is .056. These numbers are
significantly different from one another at the 10 per cent level of
significance.
                                  — 55 —




indistinguishable   from those of public patrolmen.46 The inappropriate-

ness of GDI for protective services would therefore account for the

insignificant coefficients.

      EDUC is never significant in any of the regressions in Tables 3

and 4. This implies that education does not increase the productivity

of guards and protective services. An alternative explanation of the

insignificant coefficient is that since EDUC is highly correlated with

the deflator used for GDI (P =   .7)   the deflator could in part be pick-

ing up the positive effect of EDUC.47 The problem arises from the fact

that the deflator is a wage, not a price index, and it therefore picks

up productivity effects due to educationacross states the education

of manufacturing workers would be highly correlated with the education

of guards.

      STK is positive and significant in all regressions. This cannot

be interpreted as evidence of complimentarity between protective

devices and security personnel since the output of these factors of

production (they produce l-p) is not being held constant; PROB only




   46While the guards and watchmen category also contains public guards,
68 per cent of the category are private guards, and, in fact, many
"public" guards can really be treated as private security workers since
they do not have public peace officer powers. In the policemen category,
however, 96 per cent of the workers are public policemen.

    47When the wage rate of guards is not deflated by the index, EDUC is
 significant. See Appendix D in Bartel (1974). However, this is not the
 correct way to measure the price of guards and one can therefore not
 rely on the EDUC coefficient from this regression. A state price index
 is required for the proper estimation of these coefficients.



                                                                             .

holds the endowment probability constant. The positive sign may merely

reflect a scale effect, i.e. a movement from isoquant to isoquant rather

than a movement    along a given isoquant.
      Holding CRIME, URB, and GHT constant in regressions 3.4 and 4.4,

YRS has a positive but insignificant effect on the demand for guards

and a negative and almost significant effect on the demand for protec-

tive services. This indicates that an increase in the experience of

the entrepreneur raises his "output" productivity more than his "pro-

tection" productivity, and he reduces his time spent in protection.

He is then somewhat more likely to hire a guard but less likely to hire

a protective service because guards and entrepreneurial policing time

are, on balance, substitutes, while protective services and entrepre-

neurial time, are, on balance, complements (see   foothote 17). The
substitutability   between guards and the entrepreneur occurs because

they both operate inside the store (e.g. policing customers and employees)

or on the immediate grounds (e.g. checking gates to thwart burglars or

vandals). A protective service acts as a complement to the entrepre-

neur's policing time because (1) by patrolling outside during the day it

frees the entrepreneur to more effectively police his employees and cus-

tomers inside and (2) since private patrol cars also respond to alarms

(triggered by burglars) that ring either inside the car or at the dis-

patch center the entrepreneur's time is required to maintain the effi—

ciency of the alarm system (i.e. he must periodically check to see if it

is working).

F.   The Relationship Between Protection and Insurance

      Table 8 contains coefficients for the two insurance variables,

ANYINS and AMTBINS, each of which was added to the GD and PSER regres-

sions. Both coefficients on the dummy variable ANYINS are positive

and significant. Firms with insurance are 60 per cent more likely to

hire guards and 53 per cent more likely to subscribe to protective

services.

This is a clear rebuttal of the moral hazard argument; of course the

causality could be in the opposite direction since a firm may have hired

a guard (protective service) in order to be able to purchase insurance.

      When the continuous variable, ANTBINS, is used, insurance has no

effect on GD and PSER. The relationship between protection and the price

of insurance that was the basis for the positive signs on ANYINS no longer

exists because ANTBINS refers to last year's insurance. The more the




                                                                             .

firm   was reimbursed last year the lower its expected net loss this year48

and hence the smaller its demand for guards and protective services. The

absence of significantly negative coefficients on AMTBINS is probably due

to serial correlation in the dependent variable (see discussion on paqe

35).

        Table 9 contains coefficients for ANYINS which were obtained from

separate regressions run on urban and nonurban firms. For both dependent

variables, the positive effect of insurance is much larger for nonurban

firms   than for   urban firms. Nonurban firms with insurance   are 82   per cent

more    likely   to hire guards than nonurban firms without insurance while

urban firms with insurance are only 33 per cent more likely to hire guards

than urban firms without insurance. Similarly, nonurban firms with in-

surance are 69 per cent more likely to subscribe to protective services

than nonurban firms without insurance while urban firms with insurance are

only 28 per cent more likely to subscribe to protective services than

urban firms without insurance.




   48Note that a dummy variable for the presence of burglary insurance is
included in these two regressions so that AMTBINS is a proxy for the firm's
burglary insurance reimbursement this year.

      These differential effects for urban and nonurban firms can be ex-

plained by the fact that urban insurance would tend to be less fair than

insurance in nonurban areas. This is because the higher incidence of

crime in urban areas would make the provision of insurance more costly,

i.e. processing and administrative costs would increase as the probability

of crime increased. The more fair the insurance is, the stronger the

complementary relationship between insurance and protection because the

firm is able to qet a larger benefit (in terms of a premium reduction)

from the reduction in the probability of a loss. When insurance is

actuarially fair, the firm gets the full benefit from protection.


IV. AN ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENCE OF CRIME AGAINST BUSINESS

      This article has been concerned with analyzing the determinants of

the demand for private protection manpower. The Small Business Adminis-

tration data also make it possible, however, to analyze the factors that




                                                                             .

determine which firms will incur a loss from crime in a twelve—month period.
In order to conduct such an analysis several new variables are defined as

follows:


              SOUTH:    Dummy variable which equals one if the firm

                        is located in the South; zero otherwise.


              NW:       Dummy variable which equals one if the firm

                        is owned or managed by a black; zero other-
                                49
                        wise.


              YRSGHT:   Interaction term     = YRS * GHT.


              YRSURB:   Interaction   term = YRS    * URB.



A. Determinants of the Incidence of Crime
        Table 10 contains LOGIT regressions      on the dummy dependent variable

POSLOS. The firm's total expenditures on protective devices, STK, are

held constant so that the regression can measure the partial effects of

the exogenous variables on the probability of victimization. It is

possible, however, that STK may contain some recent expenditures for

devices that were not present on the date that the crime occurred and

the firm may, in fact, have purchased the devices in response to this




           per cent of the respondents to the SBA questionnaire were black.
89   per cent of this group were the owners of the firms and only 11 per
cent   were managers. Therefore NW basically measures black ownership.

crime; this would result in a simultaneous relationship. Since STK does
include past expenditures it is a better control for the level of pro-

tection in the previous twelve—month period than is GD or PSER since

we cannot be sure that a firm which had a quard on the interview date

also had him twelve months ago; simultaneity would be a more severe

problem with the latter variables.


1. Size of firm

     Even when protection expenditures and location are held constant,

large firms are more likely to incur losses than are small firms. The

elasticity, however, is only .10; a firm with qross sales of $1 million

is 10 per cent more likely to incur a loss than a firm with gross sales

of $1/2 million. This sales effect could be due to one or more of the

following:   (1) the entrepreneur's efficiency in policing his firm de-

clines as firm size increases; (2) small firms may be less likely to

report a loss for fear of being branded a poor credit risk; large firms

often have internal sources of funds and they would therefore have less

to lose from the reporting of a crime; (3) criminals find larger firms

to be more attractive targets.


2. Location and region

     Urban nonghetto firms are 21 per cent more likely to be victimized

than are nonurban firms while ghetto firms are 94 per cent more likely

to incur a loss than are nonurban firms. Moreover, ghetto firms are

73 per cent more likely to incur a loss than are urban nonghetto firms.
                                 — 63 —




    The regional dummy, SOUTH, has a negative and significant effect;

Southern firms are 14 per cent less likely to be victimized than firms

in other regions. This is because the South has a smaller supply of

property criminals than the other regions since illegal opportunities

are lower in the South.5° Even though CRIME is held constant the

significance of SOUTH indicates that CRIME is an underestimate of the

true rate of criminal offenses51 or at least of the true rate of

offenses aqairist firms.


3. Race of owner

     The racial characteristics of the firm may affect its probability

of property crime victimization. Since blacks have lower legal opportu-

nities than whites the proportion of property offenders among the black

population should be greater than the proportion among whites. Also

firms owned by blacks tend to be located in areas that are predominantly




  50Median family income in the South is $8,079 while in the non—South it
is $10,200.  (Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census,
General Social and Economic CharacteristicS, 1970 Census of Population,
Table 135). I. Ehrlich (1973) has used this variable as a measure of
illegal payoffs in order to predict the rate of crime across states.


   51The fact that the Uniform Crime Reports data understate the true
 crime rate has been documented by surveys currently being carried out
 by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. See David Burnhaxfl,
 "Federal Surveys to Gauge Crime Levels in Big Cities," The New York
 Times,January 27, 1974, p. 1 for a description of these surveys.
 Preliminary results from the surveys indicate that the true crime rate
 is at least twice that of the rate reported in the Uniform Crime Reports.




                                                                             .
                                  — 64 —




black.   Therefore, these firms would be close to a greater Supply of crim-

inal offenders than firms owned by whites. The dummy variable for owner-

ship by a black, NW, is not significant, however, when GHT is held constant.

This is because GHT measures the firm's proximity to a greater supply of

criminal offenders. When GHT is dropped from the equation, as in regres-

sion 10.2, nonwhite firms are 27 per cent more likely to be victimized

than are white firms.


4. Public expenditures and crime rates

     Even when CRIME is held constant PUB has no effect on whether or not

the firm is victimized. In Part III, although the coefficients were not

significant, PUB had a negative effect on the demand for guards and pro-

tective services with an elasticity ranging from -.32 to —.43. This

effect was said to be due to either a reduction in the firm's probability

of victimization and/or a reduction in the marginal product of private

security manpower. Since PUB has no effect on POSLOS in Table 10 this

implies that the negative coefficients in Part III were due to the

marginal product effect.

     CRIME has a positive effect (significance level is 17 per cent) on

the firm's probability of victimization. In areas where the overall

crime rate is high a firm is more likely to be victimized because it

faces a greater supply of criminal offenders.
                                 — 65 —




5.   Protection expenditures

      STK was used in the regression as a control for the amount of pro-

tection the firm had when the loss took place. STK should have a nega-

tive sign since, everything else constant, an increase in protection

results in a decrease in the probability of victimization. In all the

regressions in Table 10, however, STK has a positive coefficient. This

is due to simultaneity; after the firm incurred a loss it added to its

stock of protection. Part of the simultaneity, however, is indirect.52


6. Years at present location

      In regressions 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, YRS has a positive and signifi-

cant effect. One possible explanation is that firms that have been at

their present location for a long time tend to be located in high—crime

areas. The true effect of YRS would be dependent upon the firm's being

located in an urban area or a ghetto and the regresssion requires inter-

action terms between YRS and UPS and between YRS and GHT, i.e.




  521fl Part III we saw that STK had a positive and significant effect on
both GD and PSER. Moreover, POSLOS also had a positive and significant
effect, i.e. firms that incurred a loss during the previous twelve
months were more likely to have guards and/or protective services at the
time of the interview. To show that the positive and significant co-
efficients on STK in Table 10 are due to the above relationships, I
added a dummy variable, GDSER, which equals one if the firm has a guard
or protective service,to the regression. The result was that the co-
efficient on STK was reduced by 42 per cent and was no longer signifi-
cant. See Bartel (1974), Table 25.




                                                                             .

                          + b4 YRSURB + b5 YRSGHT +



The true effect of YES can be written as:



           a POSLOS   =          + b4 URB +      GHT                     (26)
                            b1


According to this hypothesis, b1 should be insignificant and b4 and b5

should be positive and significant; YES would be a proxy for the Un-

desirableness of a neighborhood given that the firm is in an urban (and

ghetto) area. This hypothesis is tested in regression 10.4. The co-

efficient on YES is still significant while the coefficients on YRSURB

and YRSGHT are not significant. Even if a firm is in a nonurban area

the longer it has been at its present location the more likely it is to

have been victimized. The fact that "old" firms are more likely to be

victimized than "young" firms is unrelated to the location of the firm.53

     The most reasonable explanation of the YES coefficient is one or both

of the following. One, firms that have been at their present location for

longer periods of time are in old buildings that are most vulnerable to




  53Moreover, even if we look just at the set of nonurban firms, i.e. let
GUT = URB = YRSGHT = YRSURB = 0, the positive effect of YES cannot be
attributed to crime in the area, because the youngest of the nonurban firms,
i.e. those in the suburbs (mean values for YES is 10.6 years for suburban
firms and 15.1 years for other nonurban firms), would have the highest
crime rates since they are closest to the urban areas and a large supply
of criminals.
                                 — 67 —




crime.   In other words, YRS measures the private protection level inherent

in the physical plant, e.g. special lighting and display cases, more dur-

able doors and windows, etc. These forms of protection would not show

up in the expenditure variable, STK, since that variable only includes

alarms, locks, and gates. Young firms, would, on average, be in newer

buildings which would have been built with more of a concern for crime

deterrence than older buildings. Two, YRS proxies the experience of

the entrepreneur both in producing his output and protecting his firm.

The regression results indicate that even if the entrepreneur becomes

more efficient over time in self-protection, he becomes relatively more

efficient in output production arid therefore reduces his time spent in

self-protection. This reduction is so large that it outweighs the

original absolute increase in protection productivity.

can be readily compared to Neil Komesar's study (1973) on the factors

affecting the incidence of household burglary. Komesar's important find-

ings were that family income has a positive but insignificant effect on

victimization; nonwhite families are more likely to be victimized;

distance from the center city has a negative and significant effect; a

dummy for the Southern region is also negative and significant; and

families whose head is older are less likely to be victimized.




                                                                              .

      These results are generally consistent with my analysis of the

victimization of firms. Although aross sales had a statistically

significant effect in Table 10, the elasticity was only .10 which is

a relatively minor effect. NW was not significant when I held GHT

constant and Komesar's significant coefficient is probably due to his

inability to control for location in a ghetto. Nonurban firms, like

nonurban households, are less likely to be victimized. Also, firms

located in the South are less likely to be victimized as are house-

holds located in the South. Komesar's negative coefficient on age

was explained by his argument that older heads are more efficient in

self—protecting and that they spend more time at home (a taste effect)

which is a form of self-protection. The time at home argument is of

course not relevant for firms. My results for YRS are consistent with

the entrepreneur, like the family head, becoming more productive in

self-protection, but another factor is at work. The entrepreneur be-

comes relatively more productive in output production and he then re-

duces his time in self—protection so much that this outweighs the

original increase in his protection efficiency.


CONCLUSION

      Before answering the three questions posed in the introduction to

this article it should be reiterated here that the analysis was able to

document the fact that protection expenditures reduce the incidence of

crime against firms. It was shown that if the average firm spent one
                                 — 69 —




more dollar on protective devices its probability of a loss would fall by

.0015; a $100 expenditure would result in a drop of 15 percentage points.

      The answers to our three main questions regarding the private sector's

demand for protection can be stated as follows:

      One, firms respond rationally to real economic forces in making their

protection decisions in that they are strongly influenced by increases in

both the probability of a crime and the loss incurred from that crime.

Firms place relatively more weight on the probability of a loss occurring

rather than on the size of the anticipated loss. This implies that if

criminals were to become more efficient, i.e. more able to steal larger

amounts, firms would not react as strongly to this as they would to a

general increase in the number of criminal incidents.

      Two, an increase in per capita public protection expenditures (or

in the number of policemen per capita) will reduce the demand for pri-

vate security manpower, but this negative effect is not significant.

A strong negative effect is dependent upon the proper allocation of the

increased public expenditures and public manpower. In the last decade

much of the increased public spending has been used to hire some police-

men to expand office staffs and to reduce working hours rather than to

increase police patrols. To the extent that a coefficient from a cross—

sectional analysis is a good predictor of a time—series coefficient, it

is therefore not surprising that a strong negative impact of public

spending on private guards and protective services is not estimated here.




                                                                               .

      Three, insurance is not being used as a substitute for private pro-

tection. Rather, firms are hiring guards or protective services in

order to be able to purchase insurance at lower prices. Giving a firm

the option to purchase insurance actually makes protection expenditures

a more attractive investment. The federal crime insurance programs that

are designed to supply insurance to firms in high—crime areas also re-

inforce this complementary relationship since they have established

stringent protective device requirements for the applicants.
