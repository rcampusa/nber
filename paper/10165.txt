                                            ABSTRACT

We explore the impact of the institutional environment on the nature of entrepreneurial activity

across Europe. Political, legal, and regulatory variables that have been shown to impact capital

market development influence entrepreneurial activity in the emerging markets of Europe, but not

in the more mature economies of Europe. Greater fairness and greater protection of property rights

increase entry rates, reduce exit rates, and lower average firm size. Additionally, these same factors

also associated with increased industrial vintage n a size-weighted measure of age n and reduced

skewness in firm-size distributions. The results suggest that capital constraints induced by these

institutional factors impact both entry and the ability of firms to transition and grow, particularly in

lesser-developed markets.

1.     Introduction


       The factors that foster the creation and growth of new enterprises remain of central

interest to scholars and policy-makers. New enterprises are considered vital to economic

growth and are increasingly important laboratories for scholars interested in settings where

a variety of market frictions – informational asymmetry, moral hazard, and liquidity

constraints, for example – are most amplified. At the same time, renewed interest in how

differing institutional environments impact the functioning of capital markets and the

investment behavior of firms has drawn attention to how economic institutions vary around

the world and how they influence economic growth and firm behavior.


       In this paper, we integrate these literatures by analyzing how institutional

environments impact the entrepreneurial environment. In doing so, we analyze a variety of

measures of entrepreneurial activity including traditional measures such as rates of entry,

rates of exit, and average firm size as well as more comprehensive measures such as

industrial vintage and the skewness of firm-size distributions.           These measures of

entrepreneurial activity are analyzed throughout Europe by exploiting a comprehensive

database of firms that includes a variety of private, smaller firms. The European sample

allows us to analyze a setting where there exists rich institutional variation (both between

Western and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and amongst countries in those regions)

and where comparable data is also available. Employing industry fixed effects in this

setting further allows us to control for factors associated with distinctive industrial patterns

across Europe.
        The results in the paper suggest that the institutional environment plays an

important role in shaping the nature of industrial activity and, particularly, the dynamics of

new enterprises. Specifically, greater fairness and protection of property rights is shown to

increase rates of entry, decrease rates of exit, and lower average firm size. These effects,

however, are not equally pronounced in all parts of Europe.             The CEE region is

characterized by particular sensitivity to institutional factors suggesting that these effects

may be second-order in more mature, developed economies.


        Industrial vintage and the skewness of firm-size distributions are also influenced by

the institutional variables. In contrast to the results on average firm size, vintage (a size-

weighted measure of age) increases with greater fairness, with particularly strong

relationships in the CEE. In conjunction with the results on size, entry and exit, these

results suggest that greater fairness alters not only firm starts but also their ability to

graduate into older, larger enterprisess. Greater fairness appears to reduce firm size but

increase vintage, suggesting that fairness both makes it easier to start firms, but also makes

it easier for firms to graduate into older, larger firms.


        We also examine the skewness of firm size distributions across the CEE and

Western Europe. Both the overall level of skewness and the relative skewness of firm-size

distributions for younger firms appear to be a function of fairness and protection of

property rights with particularly amplified effects in the CEE. These results are consistent

with capital constraints leading to skewness in firm-size distributions, with the relative

importance of these factors being greater in emerging markets.           Institutional factors

influence both firm entry and growth at later points.




                                                                                            2
       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 links this paper to the relevant literatures

on financial constraints, the nature of entrepreneurial activity, and the cross-country

variation in institutions. Section 3 motivates the empirical approach and describes the

various variables employed in the subsequent analysis. Section 4 presents the analysis of

institutional variables on the various characterizations of entrepreneurial activity. Section

5 is the conclusion.


2.     Motivation and Research Design


       Our examination of how institutional conditions determine the pattern of industrial

activity draws on the existing literatures on financial constraints, the nature of

entrepreneurial activity, and the new institutional economics literature. This section briefly

reviews these works.


2.1.   Financial Constraints Literature


       The examination of financial constraints has been an important topic within

corporate finance. Models such as Myers (1977), Townsend (1979), Stiglitz and Weiss

(1981), and Myers and Majluf (1984) point to factors in the financial markets that may

limit a firm’s ability to raise outside capital. This inability to raise capital may stem from

information gaps or an inability to contract on the outcomes of a venture.            In this

environment, good projects may find it impossible to get financing on reasonable terms.

Positive net present value projects may, in this setting, be forgone. These works also

demonstrates that firms prefer to finance investment with internal funds because it is less

costly than external funds. Graham and Harvey (2001) show that this type of pecking




                                                                                            3
order appears to figure largely in the minds of chief financial officers when they arrive at

investment decisions.


       Early empirical work on financial constraints explored the investment behavior of

firms and its sensitivity to changes in internally generated funds. Fazzari, Hubbard, and

Petersen (1988) found that firms with low or no dividend payout ratios were more likely to

have investment that was sensitive to changes in free cash flow. The authors interpret their

results as demonstrating that capital constraints likely affect companies that do not pay

dividends as they forego investment when internal cash is not available. Costly external

finance has been explored in multi-divisional firms and has been shown to play an

important role as well. Lamont (1997) looks at companies that have oil related production

and non-oil related businesses. He finds that investment in the non-oil related businesses

are dramatically affected by swings in the world price of oil. This is true despite the fact

that the firm’s non-oil businesses were largely uncorrelated with the prospects for their oil

businesses. Similarly, Shin and Stulz (1998) show that the investment in minor divisions

of multi-segment firms is affected by the operating performance of the larger divisions

even if the investment opportunity sets in each division are unrelated to each other.


       Other types of investment activity have also been explored in the literature on

capital rationing. Fazzari and Petersen (1993) find that low dividend payout firms have

higher sensitivities of working capital investment to cash flow. Similarly, Himmelberg

and Petersen (1994) show that small manufacturing firms have R&D spending that is

highly dependent upon operating cash flow. The research on capital rationing has been

extended to other countries as well. Hoshi, Kayshap, and Scharfstein (1991) find that




                                                                                           4
firms that are not part of a keiretsu have investment that is more sensitive to cash flows

than are member firms in which member banks can provide credit.               Devereux and

Schiatarelli (1990) find a similar pattern for small firms in the United Kingdom. Small

firms have investment-cash flow sensitivities that are greater than large firms. While most

of this work has been done in developed markets, capital constraints are perhaps even more

likely in developing and transition economies.


2.2.     Entrepreneurial Activity Research


         Entrepreneurial activity has received considerable attention in the economics

literature. The empirical work on the determinants of entrepreneurial activity is largely

focused on two streams of research. One body of work examines patterns of entry and

exit. The other stream focuses on the dynamics of firm growth. Our research effort

utilizes insights from both these streams of literature and combines the insights from work

on the importance of capital constraints discussed above. Given the nature of information

and uncertainty for entrepreneurial entities, new ventures have the potential for the greatest

asymmetric information and the largest restrictions on their access to capital.


         A large body of industrial organization work has explored the dynamics of firm

entry and exit.    In a series of papers, Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988, 1989)

examine the changing participants in four-digit U.S. manufacturing industries, highlighting

the heterogeneity of the rate of exit and entry across industries and the evolution of these

rates over time. These papers document the rapid pace of entry during the early phases of

a particular industry and that these rapid entry rates are also associated with rapid exit

rates.


                                                                                            5
       Another set of studies has focused on individuals’ transitions into self-employment

(e.g., Evans and Leighton (1989), Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen (1994a, 1994b)), with

particular emphasis on the influence of capital constraints on these decisions. These papers

show that the availability of personal capital is positively related to an individual’s choice

to become an entrepreneur. In addition, they show that entrepreneurs who have greater

“exogenous” resources (via an inheritance, for example) are more likely to survive. The

authors interpret these results as implying that credit constraints are a critical factor in both

the founding and survival of new firms.


       A third area of the entry and exit literature, most closely associated with Steven

Klepper (e.g., Klepper and Graddy (1990), Klepper and Simons (2000)), has examined the

empirical regularities associated with the changes in the number of firms active in an

industry over time. Over time the number of firms increases, reaches a peak, and then

declines as the industry consolidates.       Most of this research does not examine the

foundations of entry and exit rates across various industries or markets, rather explores the

time series changes within an industry over time. The results point to the importance of

controlling for industry in any examination of entry and exit. Country-level entry and exit

rates may vary considerably, but much of this variation could be due to the cross sectional

composition of industries active in those markets.


       A second theme of entrepreneurial research examines the determinants of firm

growth. Much of this literature has centered on the question of whether Gibrat’s law

holds: i.e., the proposition that firm growth is independent of firm size. As Sutton (1997)

details, this proposition is equivalent to firm-size distributions being approximately




                                                                                               6
lognormal. While initial studies (e.g., Simon and Bonnini (1958), Mansfield (1962)) were

quite positive about the possibility of such a relationship, later work with more detailed

data sets has taken a more skeptical view. A variety of studies, including Evans (1987),

Hall (1987), and Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996), show that growth rates and size

are inversely related.


       These works have inspired a number of theorists to develop depictions of the

evolution of industry dynamics. In models such as Lucas (1978), Jovanovic (1982),

Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994), and Ericson and Pakes (1995), the basic empirical

patterns are explained through such factors as gradual learning by entrepreneurs and/or

firms about their own ability and the nature of technological innovation in emerging

industries.


       More recently, capital constraints have been offered as an explanation for the

pattern in the size distribution of firms and the relation between size and growth. Cooley

and Quadrini (2003) examine violations of Gibrat’s law.         They develop a model of

financial frictions and investment. They are able to show that capital constraints can

potentially explain why small firms pay lower dividends, are more highly levered, have

higher Tobin’s q, invest more, and have investments that are more sensitive to cash flows.


       Cabral and Mata (2003) develop a model of firm growth that depends upon

investments and access to capital. Their model predicts that in the presence of capital

constraints, the firm size distribution will be skewed. As capital constraints worsen, firm-

size distributions will become more skewed. The intuition behind their result is that small

firms with good investment opportunities may be periodically unable to raise the resources


                                                                                             7
to exploit those opportunities. In that case, they will underinvest and grow slower than

larger firms with internal cash flow to fund their projects. They argue that the distribution

of firm size will be more highly skewed for younger firms because they are more likely to

be capital rationed. Cabral and Mata then explore the firm size distribution in a sample of

Portuguese manufacturing firms. They find that the distribution of firm size is indeed

skewed and that the skewness is greater for younger firms.


       Surprisingly few studies have sought to examine the patterns across nations in

industry structure. Many of these studies (e.g., Johnson and Loveman (1995)) have faced

challenges due to the limited number of industries and nations for which consistent data

could be found. Moreover, many of these studies have been focused on finding common

trends rather than explaining the diversity of patterns.       There are, however, some

interesting recent exceptions. Davis and Henrekson (1999) employ micro-data from the

U.S. and Sweden. Another recent exception is Kumar, Rajan, and Zingales (1999), who

look at average firm size and the dispersion in firm size across industries in 15 European

nations. In particular, they explore the role that legal environment plays on firm size in

capital intensive and non-capital intensive industries.


2.3.   Research on Legal and Institutional Regimes


       Our paper also draws upon the legal and institutional framework of recent papers in

the field of law and economics. Much of this work has focused on the role that the

institutional and legal regimes play on the development and functioning of capital markets.

In particular, work by La Porta, et al. (1998, 2000) and La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and

Shleifer (1999) has examined legal and institutional factors that influence the breadth and


                                                                                           8
depth of capital markets. These papers find that higher levels of corruption and better

functioning legal environments promote greater development of financial markets. In

addition, the legal and institutional factors and the overall level of capital market

development, in turn, have been shown to influence aggregate economic outcomes as in

King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic

(1998). The presumed channel for the impact of these variables is through the failure to

allocate capital to firms with worthy investment opportunities as a consequence of the

design of legal rules.    Capital constraints are more likely to affect younger, more

entrepreneurial firms in these environments.


       In a related literature, the nature of property rights and the prevalence of corruption

have been shown to influence the nature of investment and overall level of economic

growth as in Knack and Keefer (1995). Studies at the micro level have been more limited,

but Frye and Shleifer (1997) and Shleifer (1997), for example, show how variations in

guarantees for property rights protection vary within formerly Communist countries and

how this variation results in differing levels of entrepreneurial investment. As noted in the

survey evidence provided in Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff (2002), the nature of

property rights and the presence of external finance are distinct channels for how

institutional variables impact economic outcomes. Again, these effects are likely to be

more pronounced in developing and transition economies.


3.     Empirical Framework


       Our paper examines the role of capital constraints on entrepreneurial activity across

33 European countries. We look at the effect of country-level variation in economic, legal,


                                                                                            9
and institutional variables on a variety of measures of the importance of entrepreneurial

firm dynamics.    These variables have been shown to have important effects on the

development and functioning of capital markets. Our approach is to examine a variety of

measures that provide insights into various dimensions of new firm activity. In particular,

our unit of observation is at the country/industry level. Analyzing the determinants of

entrepreneurial activity across Europe at the country/industry level holds the promise of

controlling for industrial heterogeneity in a setting where technologies are relatively

homogenous yet where there is variation in institutional regimes and there is a sharp

difference in the stage of development between Western Europe and Central and Eastern

Europe.


3.1.   Measures of Entrepreneurial Activity


       For each industry within a country, we calculate the entry and exit rate, the average

firm size, the industrial vintage (a weighed-average measure of firm age discussed in detail

below), and the skewness of the firm size distribution. In this section, we first discuss the

dependent variables in our analysis and then describe the set of control variables that we

employ.


3.1.1. Firm Entry and Exit


       Firm entry and exit are important measures of entrepreneurial activity. Markets

that provide an opportunity for greater numbers of startup firms are said to be more

dynamic and entrepreneurial. Similarly, the rate at which firms die measures both the

competitive nature of the local market and the potential advantage that incumbents have.




                                                                                          10
We measure entry relative to the number of firms existing in the prior year. Our measure

of entry is the number of firms that enter our sample in 1998 that were not in the sample in

1997 divided by the total number of firms that existed in 1997 in the country/industry pair.

Similarly, we calculate the exit rate as the number of firms that were in our sample in

1997, but were not in 1998, divided by the total number of firms in that country/industry

pair in 1997.


       We expect that if capital constraints influence the entry decision, then more

developed capital markets will provide greater access to capital and hence have greater

entry rates. Institutional and legal variables associated with capital market development

should be positively related to entry rates. Similarly, the literature on startup survival

shows that reductions in capital constraints improve firm survival. We therefore would

expect that political and legal variables associated with greater capital market development

would lead to a lower exit rate.


3.1.2. Average Firm Size


       Because of the role small firms play in an economy, we also look at average firm

size. While this measure does not distinguish between small, old firms and small, young

firms, it does measure whether the local economic environment supports a large number of

small firms. Within each country/industry pair, we calculate the average firm size as

measured by number of employees. While the prediction is not unambiguous, we might

expect that lower levels of capital rationing would lead to greater number of small firms

that can enter and survive in the market. Hence, average firm size would be expected to be

smaller in markets with better economic institutions.


                                                                                         11
3.1.3. Industrial Vintage


       In addition to the more traditional measures discussed above, we are also interested

in the importance of entrepreneurial firms for overall economic activity. In order to

capture the importance of younger firms to industrial activity, we construct a measure of

industrial vintage. Vintage is constructed within each country/industry pair and is the

weighted average age of the firms in each industry where the weights are given by

turnover, assets, or employees. In essence, this measure shows how important young firms

are to the productive capacity of an industry. A high average vintage would imply that

most of the productive capacity is produced by relatively older firms in the economy. On

the other hand, a low vintage would indicate that young firms dominate the productive

capacity. While the results are not sensitive to the choice of weights, we emphasize

weighting by employees given the ability of this measure to obviate any accounting

differences across countries.


       How is vintage distinct from average firm size and why might these two measures

of industrial activity diverge in their response to institutional factors? In particular, given

that we expect younger firms to be smaller, won’t economies or industries that are on

average smaller also have a younger vintage? The distinction between the two measures

can be best understood by considering the ways in which they are constructed:


                                 I                                I
                                ∑ Si                             ∑ Si ∗ Agei
(1)             Average Size = i =1                   Vintage = i =1    I
                                  I                                    ∑ Si
                                                                       i =1




                                                                                            12
In this notation, i indexes firms within a given country industry-pair, Si is a measure of

firm size (in this case the number of employees) and Agei is the age of that firm. In order

to see how capital constraints might give rise to distinct effects on size and vintage, it is

useful to recast these measures in a setting where there are two cohorts of firms denoted as

old (o) and young (y). In such an example, the measures in (1) can be rewritten as:


                                    N o So + N y S y                       N o So Ageo + N y S y Age y
(2)                Average Size =                              Vintage =
                                      No + N y                                  N o So + N y S y



where N is the number of old or young firms, S is the average size of firms in each

cohort and Age is just the respective age of the two cohorts. In this setting, N o So is the

employment in the old sector and N y S y is employment in the young sector. For the

moment, assume that So > S y .


           To see the intuition behind how these measures may diverge, note that if, for

example, N o increases and So decreases such that the product, N o So , is constant (i.e., they

exactly offset each other, so employment in the old sector does not change), then vintage

will not have changed while average size will be smaller. More generally, it is useful to

consider examples where these two measures move in opposite directions.                                  As an

example, consider situations where vintage rises and average size decreases. This can arise

for at least two reasons:


      i)      If So goes down and N o goes up by more than enough to ensure that population

              shifts to the old sector ( So′ < So , N o′ > N o so that N o′ So′ > N o So ) then vintage will

              increase and average size will decrease.


                                                                                                            13
   ii)      If S y goes down and N y does not go up enough so that population in the young

            sector shrinks ( S y′ < S y and N y is kept at levels so that N y′ S y′ < N y S y ) then

            vintage will increase and average size will decrease.


As this example makes clear, average size simply measures the average size of firms and

vintage provides a broader measure of where the mass of industrial activity is. Institutional

variables need not have similar effects on these two characterizations of activity.


         Specifically, if lower capital constraints make it easier to get external financing at

earlier stages, the young sector would be smaller on average. At the same time, if firms are

able to graduate to being older, larger firms faster (or do not exit or fail as much) the

fraction of actual employment in the young sector could be lower. If institutional variables

change firm growth patterns in this way, average firm size would be lower and vintage

would be higher. The actual effect of capital constraints on these patterns is, consequently,

an empirical question.


3.1.4. Firm Size Distributions and Skewness


         While vintage provides a fuller characterization of the importance of younger firms

to economies than firm size, the fullest characterization of industrial activity is likely a

firm size distribution and age-specific firm-size distributions. As discussed above, studies

of firm-size distributions have tended to be industry specific or country specific. In this

paper, we examine the nature of overall and age-specific firm size distributions at the

regional, country, and country-industry level.




                                                                                                       14
       Specifically, we examine if the skewness of firm-size distributions is related to the

presence of institutional determinants of capital constraints. Additionally, to the degree

that skewness of overall firm-size distributions might be associated with other factors, it is

useful to consider the relative skewness of the younger firm-size distributions. If capital

constraints are operative in shaping the nature of industrial activity, we would expect

overall firm-size distribution and, especially the firm size distribution of the younger

cohorts, to be skewed.


3.2.   Control Variables


       The level of economic development is likely to affect the attractiveness of

becoming an entrepreneur. Greater gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is likely to

provide a larger market potential and greater infrastructure for start-ups. In our analysis,

GDP per capita is measured by purchasing power parity for residents at the national level.

If the level of economic development plays a role in supporting entrepreneurial activity,

then we might expect that GDP per capita to have a positive effect on the ability of

individuals to successfully become entrepreneurs.


       We also include several political and legal variables when available for both

Western Europe as well as Central and Eastern Europe. As the previous literature has

shown, corruption can play a role in corporate activity. Corruption is defined broadly as

“the misuse of public power for private benefits, e.g., bribing of public officials, kickbacks

in public procurement, or embezzlement of public funds.” Our fairness/corruption index is

tabulated by Transparency International and is utilized in Djankov et al. (2000). The index

averages the corruption scores given by the following sources: (1) Freedom House Nations


                                                                                           15
in Transit; (2) Gallup International; (3) the Economist Intelligence Unit, (4) the Institute

for Management Development, Lausanne; (5) the International Crime Victim Survey; (6)

the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, Hong Kong; (7) The Wall Street Journal’s

Central European Economic Review; (8) the World Bank and the University of Basel; (9)

the World Economic Forum. The index is coded on a ten point descending scale from 1

(most corrupt) to 10 (least corrupt).


       The second institutional measure that we utilize is protection of property rights. A

large economics literature has explored the role that property rights play on the ability to

attract capital and ownership structures. From the perspective of an entrepreneur, strong

property rights may serve two roles.      First, strong property rights might allow older

companies to prevent entrepreneurs from starting their own ventures. Alternatively, strong

property rights might give young startups an advantage as they compete against established

companies. Our measure of protection of property rights is taken from World Economic

Forum’s “The Global Competitiveness Report 2000,” and are defined on a seven point

scale, with one denoting nations where property rights are not clearly delineated nor are

strongly protected by law and seven indicating cases where property rights are clearly

delineated and strongly protected.


       We examine the functioning of the legal system in each country through a measure

called the Formalism Index.       The index, cited in Djankov, et al. (2002), measures

substantive and procedural statutory intervention in judicial cases at lower-level civil trial

courts, and is formed by adding up the following indices: (1) professionals vs. laymen, (2)

written vs. oral elements, (3) legal justification, (4) statutory regulation of evidence, (5)




                                                                                           16
control of superior review, (6) engagement formalities, and (7) independent procedural

actions. The index ranges from 0 to 7, where 7 means a higher level of control or

intervention in the judicial process.


           As discussed above, a number of papers have examined how well the legal system

functions. In particular, we look at an index of Interference of Courts that was tabulated by

the Survey of World Business Environment from the World Bank Group between 1998 and

2000. This variable captures whether the courts are fair and impartial. The index ranges

from 1 to 6, where 1 means always fair and impartial and 6 never. One might expect that

the legal system would be important for protecting new entrants that may be exploited by

larger, existing companies.       Finally, we include a measure of the procedural burden

associated with initiating an enterprise. As developed in Djankov, et al. (2000), the paper

employs the number of procedures that a start-up firm must undertake before it can operate

legally.


4.         Data and Descriptive Statistics


           The core data used in this paper are the Amadeus data on corporate activity across

Europe. Amadeus is a panel dataset of both public and private companies throughout both

Eastern and Western Europe.           In particular, the dataset covers nearly four million

companies in 33 European countries (including all the EU countries) and contains a variety

of financial and ownership details.


           The original data was provided by Bureau Van Dijk (BvD), a European electronic

publishing firm. It specializes in cleaning and organizing data supplied by information




                                                                                          17
providers in various countries to create a broader data set. BvD gathers the national data

through information providers of Amadeus data within each country (e.g., Companies

House in the UK, Kamers van Koophandel in the Netherlands, INPI in France, National

Bank of Belgium). These national companies collect the data from the national public

body in charge of collecting the annual accounts in its country.          In some countries,

particularly those in Central Eastern Europe, the information provider collects the data

directly from the companies because of the difficulty obtaining the data from government

sources as well as the relative unreliability of the government collected data.


       Because of different disclosure requirements, the amount and type of information

varies among countries. For instance, some countries have more data on income statement

items than on balance sheet items, while firms in other countries have more balance sheet

information than income statement information. The completeness of the data also varies:

for instance, German regulations are more flexible for small and median enterprises and

failure to disclose is not a punishable offence. Appendix A lists the providers of data for

the Amadeus Database.


       This sample construction method poses a challenge for our analysis. In particular,

it is likely that our computations of exit and entry rates, as well as of mean and median

firm size, will be affected by the inclusiveness with which the national statistical agency in

a particular country collects information. The thoroughness with which these data is

collected may vary systematically with other national characteristics that we employ as

right-hand side variables in the regressions below. This issue is particularly a concern for




                                                                                           18
Western European nations, as the Amadeus data compilers rely exclusively on government

databases in those countries.


       We address this concern in three ways. First, as discussed above, we employ a

variety of dependent variables, rather than simply relying on a single measure.    Second,

the regression analysis employs industry fixed effects to ensure that within industry

variation is emphasized, to counter any selection bias based on varying rules for industry

inclusion. Finally, we eliminate all firms with less than twenty employees from the

analysis. Because this cut-off point is above that of any reporting nation, it helps insure

comparable samples across countries.


       This final procedure reduced the sample size substantially, from 3.4 million to just

under four hundred thousand firms. We also repeat the analyses below using the entire

sample, and find that the results are little changed. The 394 thousand companies include

firms from the European Union (Ireland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece,

France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and

Luxembourg) and Central and Eastern European countries (Poland, Czech Republic,

Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia,

Bosnia H., Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Russia and Ukraine). In addition, Amadeus contains

data on companies in Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland.


       A number of EU-directives, which aim to harmonize filing requirements, are

slowly being implemented.       These result in more information being available in the

relatively more recent years within the data. Uniformity is achieved by the standardization

of accounting information and of industry codifications. BvD has manually allocated a


                                                                                        19
CSO code (derived from the UK Statistical Office SIC codes) and an English translation of

the trade description for each company allowing activity searching across the database. All

national activity codes are cross-referenced to allow cross border searching by a common

code. Greater detail on the nature of the Amadeus data and a number of decisions made

regarding regional and industrial classifications is provided in Appendix B.


4.1.   Summary Statistics


       Before we start the empirical analysis in the next section, we explore some of the

initial summary statistics. In Table 1, we examine summary information by country.

Panel A summarizes the data for Western Europe. We tabulate the number of firms in

1998, the number of regions within the country, the number of industries that have

companies listed in the national database, the mean and median turnover, mean and median

assets, as well as mean and median employees for companies included. The data summary

shows the wide variability in the number of companies represented. For example, we only

have data on 154 companies in Luxembourg and 152 in Iceland. On the other hand, we

have information on 95 thousand companies in Germany and 49 thousand companies in

France. These differences reflect both the size of the country, the nature of economic

activity, and the criteria for inclusion in the individual national sample.


       In addition, regional information varies by countries and seems to be weakly

related to the number of companies included in the data. For example, France, Germany,

and the UK have the most regions (26, 28, and 37 respectively) and they also are the three

largest countries in terms of reporting companies. In addition, the data within each country

generally include information on a large number of industries (between 150 and 215). The


                                                                                         20
two exceptions are Iceland and Luxembourg, in which the number of firms reporting in the

data is quite low.


        In Panel B we present the same summary statistics for countries in Central and

Eastern Europe. In most countries, except for Romania, which has 18,000 companies in

1998, the number of companies reporting is somewhat smaller than we saw in Panel A for

Western Europe. When we look at the number of regions in the country, we find that the

average number of regions per country is quite a bit smaller than Western Europe.


        Data on turnover, assets, and employees demonstrates that the data is highly

skewed. Mean values of turnover, assets, and employees are typically substantially larger

than the median values. This is not surprising given that we expect a skewed distribution

of firm size.


        Mean turnover is lowest in Macedonia with a mean turnover of just under $500,000

and a median turnover of $119,000. The largest mean turnover is Switzerland with a mean

of $321 million and a median of $51 million. Assets show a similar skewness. The lowest

average asset levels are again in Macedonia, with the largest average assets are in

Switzerland. Finally, dispersion on the number of employees is quite large. Average sizes

are relatively small in all countries. The largest average number of employees is 727 in

Luxembourg, a country where only 154 companies reported. In Estonia ,the other extreme,

the average company had 81 employees. Median numbers of employees are substantially

lower for all firms.




                                                                                      21
        Table 2 presents the same summary statistics, but now by industry, not country.

For example, the first industry listed is coal mining. The Amadeus data has information on

coal mining companies in 26 countries. These firms are, generally, quite large, 2,460

people, although the median is substantially lower, 403. This likely is a result of a small

number of very large mining companies and a large number of small firms. The largest

numbers of companies fall into the wholesale trade category (44,000 firms) with firms

listed in every country. These firms tend to be quite small, having an average of 194

employees and a median of 44 employees.


5.      Analysis


        In order to understand the nature of entrepreneurial activity across economies, the

analysis that follows considers the determinants of entry, exit, average firm size, industrial

vintage, and the skewness of the firm-size distributions throughout Europe and,

subsequently, in Western and Eastern Europe separately.         While entry and exit rates

capture activity in a given year, the other measures reflect longer-run determinants of

industrial activity.


5.1.    The Determinants of Entry and Exit


        Studies of entrepreneurial activity have often examined entry and exit rates. Within

an economy, higher entry rates have typically been viewed as an indicator of dynamic

economies. Our goal is to understand how legal, institutional, and regulatory factors affect

entry and exit. Our measures of entry and exit examine that activity within a particular




                                                                                           22
industry for a particular country. We thus use countries crossed with industries as our unit

of observation.


       In Table 3, the dependent variable is the rate of entry within each country-industry

cell for 1998, calculated as the ratio of new firms in 1998 to all firms in 1997. In all

specifications presented in Table 3, industry fixed effects are included to control for the

distinctive nature of industries. Similarly, GDP per capita is employed in all specifications

to control for the overall level of economic development.


       Independent variables measure the quality of legal and political institutions. In

particular, coefficients are reported for an index of fairness (the inverse of corruption), a

measure of the strength of property right protection, a formalism index, an index of the

interference of courts, and a measure of start-up procedures. Because some of these

measures are highly correlated with each other, we use only one of these variables in each

regression. Thus, each column presents the results of five separate regressions.


       In this first specification of Panel A, negative but statistically insignificant

coefficients are associated with the fairness index and the property rights index. The

measures associated with the judiciary are more mixed. In nations characterized by higher

levels of formalism, there is no significant effect, but those characterized by greater

degrees of interference by the judiciary have significantly lower entry.


       Column 2 incorporates a dummy variable for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).

This measure is consistently negative and significant, suggesting that this region is

characterized by lower rates of entry. Inclusion of the CEE dummy has little effect on the




                                                                                          23
level and significance of the coefficients on the other independent variables, but suggests

the need to separately consider Western Europe and the CEE. In particular, given the

recent transitions of many CEE economies, the effects of political, legal, and regulatory

variables may be more pronounced.


       Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 employ the same empirical framework employed in

Column 1, but separately estimate entry regressions for Western Europe and the CEE.

Several results emerge from this separation:


   •   The dominant pattern is that political, legal, and regulatory institutional structures

       matter far more in Central and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. All five

       variables are statistically significant in the CEE regressions; while only one (the

       measure of court interference) is in the Western Europe regressions. This pattern

       reflects the relative importance of the differing institutional environments. In the

       CEE, differences in institutional environment are clearly first order while in

       Western Europe these considerations seem second order.

   •   Greater fairness and stronger property rights are unambiguously associated with

       higher rates of entry in Central and Eastern Europe. Similarly, greater judicial

       interference and formalism are associated with lower entry. Somewhat puzzlingly,

       in nations where more start-up procedures are required, there is more entry as well.

       This reflects the fact the measure of start-up procedures is highly correlated with

       the fairness index. Not surprisingly, when both measures are used in a multivariate

       regression, the measure of start-up procedures is usually significantly negative.




                                                                                           24
   •   The only measure significant in Western Europe is that more interference in the

       courts is associated with greater entry.


Taken together, the results indicate that the dynamics of entry are distinctive in Western

Europe and CEE, with institutional considerations having a far more profound effect on

entry in Central and Eastern Europe.


       Panel B repeats the analysis.        Instead of estimating ordinary least squares

regressions, we now employ median regressions, which should be less sensitive to outliers.

The results are similar to those from before. Greater fairness and protection of property

rights are only associated with more entry in Central and Eastern Europe. The two judicial

measures are now consistently significant and negative in the CEE, while they are

significant and positive in the Western Europe.       More start-up procedures are now

associated with more entry throughout Europe.


       The dynamics that affect entry are also likely to have an impact on the rate of exit

for a given industry with a country. Table 4 takes a similar empirical approach to that in

Table 3 to examine exit in Europe. Columns 1 and 2 suggest that greater fairness and

stronger property rights are associated with lower rates of entry, but the significant

coefficient on the CEE dummy suggests the importance of considering Western Europe

and CEE separately. Segregation of the two sub-regions in columns 3 and 4 demonstrates

that, much like in the case of entry, different dynamics of exit exist in Western Europe and

the CEE. Specifically, fairer countries are associated with lower rates of exit throughout

Europe, but the effect is about thirteen times larger in the CEE. Nations with stronger

property rights have significantly lower exit rates, but only in Eastern Europe. Finally,


                                                                                         25
greater legal formalism and more interference by courts are associated with lower exit rates

in Western Europe while no pattern is seen in the CEE. Results are similar in the median

regressions in Panel B.


       These patterns are consistent with those seen in the analysis of entry above. The

institutional environment appears to matter more in Central and Eastern Europe.            A

consistent pattern appears in these nations, with stronger property rights and greater

fairness being associated with a more favorable environment for entrepreneurs (more entry

and less exit). The results of our political, legal, and regulatory variables in Western

Europe are far less consistent and are more difficult to understand. It appears that there is

no consistent effect of these institutional variables on entry and exit. It may be the case

that other factors – distinctive levels of human capital investment, for example – matter

much more in more mature economies.


5.2.   The Determinants of Average Firm Size


       Average firm size offers another perspective on the dynamics of firm growth by not

emphasizing entry and exit in one year, but by considering a snapshot of overall industrial

activity. As noted above, greater fairness and stronger property rights are associated in the

CEE countries with greater entry and lower exit. This pattern may lead to either larger or

smaller average firm size.


       Table 5 considers the determinants of average firm size, employing the same

empirical framework as we did for entry and exit. Once again, the dependent variable is

the average firm size for firms within a given industry in a particular country. As with




                                                                                          26
Tables 3 and 4, columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 consider the pooled European sample with and

without a CEE dummy. In both specifications, fairer countries and those with stronger

property rights are associated with smaller firms. Lower levels of legal formalism, greater

levels of interference by the courts, and more start-up procedures are associated with larger

average firm size.


       These results, however, differ when we consider Western Europe and CEE

separately.   Specifically, higher levels of fairness and stronger property rights are

associated with smaller average firm size in CEE. This result is consistent with the

analysis above: the institutional environment appears to matter critically in creating a

favorable atmosphere for entrepreneurship in Central and Eastern Europe.


       The results in Western Europe are far smaller in magnitude.          Moreover, they

suggest that nations with greater fairness are associated with larger, not smaller, firms. As

before, the results for the legal variables are different in sign: lower levels of legal

formalism and greater levels of interference by the courts are associated with larger firm

size in both sets of nations. The results on columns 7 and 8—when we estimate median

regressions—are quite similar. Once again, we find that the institutional factors matter

more for entrepreneurial activity in CEE, but have much weaker effects in Western

Europe.


5.3    The Determinants of Industrial Vintage


       As discussed in Section 3, the measure of industrial vintage offers a summary

measure of industrial activity that integrates average firm size with measures of age.




                                                                                          27
Industrial vintage captures the relative contribution of entrepreneurial firms to overall

industry output. This measure may be closely correlated with average firm age, or may be

quite distinct, if institutional variables affect firm growth patterns differently in various

nations.


       As above, the analysis of industrial vintage presented in Table 6 considers the

effects of fairness, property rights protection, legal variables and startup procedures on the

relative importance of young firms to industrial activity. The analysis presented here

employs a measure of vintage based on employees, given the greater consistently with

which this measure is reported. Unreported analyses using vintage measures based on

turnover and assets are, however, not significantly different, as are those using different

weighting schemes. We once again use industry-country pairs as our unit of analysis.


       The first two columns of Table 6 consider the overall pooled European sample with

and without the presence of a CEE dummy. Greater fairness is associated with a higher

vintage, while results for protection of property rights is inconsistent. More interference in

the courts and less formalism are also associated with a higher vintage. When we look at

the sets of nations separately, greater fairness and stronger property rights are associated

with higher vintage in both of the two regions. In Western Europe, greater formalism is

associated with lower vintage.     In CEE nations, greater inference with the courts is

associated with higher vintage.      The results are similar when we estimate median

regressions.


       What do the distinctive results on vintage and average size indicate? As noted

before, in CEE nations, greater fairness is associated with more entry and less exit. When


                                                                                           28
we look at average firm size, fairness is associated with smaller firms, but the opposite

effect holds when we look at vintage. This suggests that while fairer nations, particularly

in Central and Eastern Europe, are not only associated with higher rates of entry, but that

fairer countries allow the surviving firms to grow large. In general, the distinction between

the results on vintage suggest two things: the inadequacy of any one measure at capturing

the nature of entrepreneurial activity and the importance of institutional factors in

influencing both the birth of firms and their transition into older, larger firms.


5.4.   Skewness of the Firm Size Distribution


       Finally, we turn to the effect of the institutional environment on the distribution of

firm sizes. As noted in Section 2, Cooley and Quadrini (2002) and Cabral and Mata

(2003) argue that in the presence of capital constraints, the firm size distribution will be

skewed. In this section, we examine the distribution of firm size across various industries,

following the same approach as above.


       Figures 1 through 3 provide a graphical preview of the results. Figure 1 shows the

distribution of firm size in Western Europe, with the number of firms plotted against the

logarithm of sales. The overall distribution is skewed, with a skewness of 0.87. When we

break down the distribution by firm age, we find that the distribution of firms under 10

years of age are the most highly skewed and that skewness decreases with age. Figure 2

provides a similar representation for Central and Eastern Europe. The comparison between

the regions is instructive. First, the overall distribution is more highly skewed, with a

skewness of 1.18. Moreover, when we break down the distribution by firm age, we find

that firms under 10 years of age are even more highly skewed and that firms that are more


                                                                                          29
than ten years old have size distributions that are very close to a lognormal distribution. In

Figure 3, we provide a similar analysis for one country - Great Britain, a country in

Western Europe with a highly developed capital market.              Not only is the overall

distribution much less skewed (0.37), but the differences in skewness by cohort are much

less pronounced.


       These figures motivate the analyses reported in Tables 7 and 8. The dependent

variable in the first table is the skewness of the firm size distribution in each industry in

every sample country. In the latter one, we employ the difference between the skewness of

the distribution of firms below the median age and those above this threshold. Once again,

each industry-country pair is employed as a distinct observation.


       When we examine the level of skewness in Table 7, we find that nations with

greater fairness and stronger property rights are associated with less skewness. Similarly,

firms with a higher level of formalism are associated with more skewness. The results

regarding fairness and property rights, however, stem exclusively from the CEE nations in

the sample. No significant effects are seen in the Western Europe. In both sets of nations,

more formalism is associated with greater skewness.           More judicial interference is

associated with less skewness, but only in Western Europe. The results are very similar

when we estimate median regressions in Panel B.


       Table 8 examines the difference in the skewness of the size distribution in

particular industries for firms that are below the median age compared to firms that are

above the median age. Greater fairness reduces the difference between the skewness of the

size distribution for younger firms compared to the skewness of the size distribution for


                                                                                           30
older firms. The results are consistent with the capital constraints explanation. In nations

where institutions are less fair and property rights weak, the presence of capital constraints

may lead to a particularly skewed distribution for younger firms, who are less likely to be

able to finance all positive net present value investment opportunities from internally

generated cash flows.


6.     Conclusion


       This paper seeks to demonstrate the effects of institutional constraints on the real

activities of firms, with a focus on entrepreneurship. These firms are of interest for two

reasons.   First, entrepreneurial firms in many respects represent testing grounds for

scholars interested in how frictions can affects the workings of companies and markets.

Second,    encouraging    entrepreneurship    is   of   intense   interest    to   policymakers.

Understanding the critical links between institutional development and entrepreneurial

activity is critical, especially in emerging and transitioning economies.


       Our focus on political, legal, and regulatory factors is motivated by work that has

demonstrated their importance to the development of capital markets. The results suggest

a strong influence of the institutional environment in shaping firm dynamics. The results

regarding entry, exit, firm size, vintage, and skewness tell a consistent story. Greater

fairness and stronger protection of property rights are critically important in encouraging

both the emergence and growth of new enterprises, particularly in emerging markets. The

results are much less clear-cut in Western Europe. To us, this suggests that in more

developed economies, these institutional effects may be second order to the many other

unobserved factors that may affect entrepreneurial dynamics.                 Examples of such


                                                                                              31
considerations that have been highlighted in earlier studies include tax codes (Gentry and

Hubbard (2002) and Cullen and Gordon (2003)), labor market conditions (Gromb and

Scharfstein (2001)), and the supply of new ideas.


       Our results suggest several avenues for further research. First, while studies of

entrepreneurship typically emphasize entry, our results suggest that there may exist another

critical point in firm maturation where institutions impact the ability of firms to graduate

into larger firms. As a consequence, entry rates alone are an inadequate measure of

entrepreneurial dynamism.     The identification of the determinants of how institutions

impact this maturation process must be better understood. Second, the inability of our

institutional variables to explain many of the patterns seen in Western Europe raises the

question of what factors influence entrepreneurial activity in more developed markets.

Finally, establishing the links between these measures of entrepreneurship and broader

economic growth remains a central open question in this literature.


       It is our hope to continue to explore these important issues in a European setting.

The high degree of disclosure of information on privately held firms in Europe, in

combination with the broad scope of the Amadeus dataset, will hopefully provide greater

insight into these questions of entrepreneurial dynamics.

                       Appendix B: Characteristics of the Sample

B.1 Company-Level Data
        The Amadeus data contains over 130 variables of information for the companies
within the data set. Company profile variables include the geographical location,
identification number, legal form, etc. In addition, industry codes are included. Because
of differences across countries, there are more than 15 different industry codes and its
corresponding descriptions (see next section for greater details on industry codes). The
data also provides information on the firms’ managers and auditors. Typically, the data
would include information on up to 10 managers. In addition, standard balance sheet and
income statement items are tracked. The exact financial information captured differs
depending upon the data collected within the country.
        One of the interesting aspects of the data is information on ownership and
subsidiaries. These data include owners’ and subsidiary’s identification number, country,
turnover, date of acquisition, and percentage of ownership (up to 10 owners and
subsidiaries per company). Ultimate holding company data is also available for some
companies. Depending upon the country, these data is available for both public and
private companies.
B.2. Types of Companies
        The inclusion criteria used by Bureau van Dijk Amadeus differs by country, relying
on individual national filing requirements for the core data. State-owned companies as
well as privately owned firms are included. Banks and insurance companies are not
included. Two different types of companies are included in the Amadeus data. Type 1
companies are those whose capital is divided into shares which can be offered to the
general public and whose members are only liable for its debts to the extent of any amount
unpaid on their shares. Type 2 companies are those whose capital is divided into shares
that cannot be offered to the general public. The liability of its members is limited to the
amount of their shares. Finally, the database includes information on other entities
including partnerships (IHG, KG, K/S, Ky, Kb, SNC, SC, G,bH &Co, KG, SapA, Sas, Snc,
ANS, K/s, HB, KB) and sole proprietorships (SURL, EVBA, Sole proprietorships, OE,
EE), and cooperatives. Table A-1 illustrates a breakdown of Type 1 and Type 2 companies
by country.
B.3. Industry Classifications
        Our analysis exploits industry level information in the data across countries. As
such, we need to have common industry definitions within the data. All firms in the
Amadeus data have an identifier used by the national body collecting the data. Typically,
these codes are unique to the individual country. In addition to the national industry codes
assigned by the information provider in each country, detailed uniform 7-digit CSO
activity codes are assigned by Bureau van Dijk to all of the companies in the database. The
CSO activity codes have been assigned to each company from the standard list of 8,000
activities produced by the British Central Statistical Office (CSO). All the codes (NAF,
ATECO, WZ, SIC-UK, BIK, ISIC, SIC-US, etc.) are cross-referenced to the CSO activity
code. In addition, NACE codes (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the


                                                                                         38
European Community) are the basis for many of the new updated and more harmonized
national codes. All countries in the EU are now obligated to create new classifications
whose first three digits are based on NACE 1.
       Bureau Van Dijk has provided a spreadsheet with conversion codes between the
various industry classifications. Also, Amadeus online allows users to obtain all the
corresponding codes to a particular code.
B.4. Ownership and Subsidiary Data
       Bureau Van Dijk merges ownership data that it receives from all its information
providers into one large database. This information is then analyzed to identify each cross
border holding/subsidiary link by the national identification number of the companies
involved.
        This means that all subsidiaries that European companies have in countries outside
Europe that are not reported to the national statistical office do not appear in the subsidiary
section of the company. Those subsidiaries overseas disclose information to their national
office. Thus, if a French company has one subsidiary in Spain and two in Canada, the
Spanish Information provider will report data on its French parent company that will be
then linked to the French company as a subsidiary. Because Amadeus has no information
provider from Canada, there is no way to find out if the French company has a Canadian
subsidiary unless the company reports it.
        Ownership and subsidiary data are dated corresponding with the latest statement
available for the parent company. Ownership and subsidiary data usually include the name
and identification number of both the parent and the subsidiary, which can be then tracked
within the database, percentage of ownership (direct and total), turnover, and date of
acquisition. If a company has more than 10 owners or subsidiaries, only the largest 10 will
be reported. There is also information on ultimate shareholder, including identification
number, country, type, and turnover.
B.5. Regional Information
        The data by country is further divided into regions. The regions within the
Amadeus dataset are based upon the definitions of regions defined in the European
Commission’s Eurostat. Eurostat’s regional statistics cover the principal aspects of the
economic and social life, such as demography, economic accounts, employment,
unemployment, and so forth. Eurostat attempts to group together population or places with
sufficient similarities to comprise a logical unit for administrative purposes. Eurostat, in
collaboration with the other Commission departments, set up the Nomenclature of
Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS) at the beginning of the 1970s as a single, coherent
system for dividing up the European Union’s territory.
        As of yet, the NUTS classification has no specific legal basis, i.e. there is no
regulation that sets rules for compiling and updating the system of regional reporting and
boundaries. These matters have been settled so far by “gentlemen’s agreements” between
the Member States and Eurostat, sometimes after long and difficult negotiations. The
NUTS scheme is then published by Eurostat (the latest edition came out in 1999). NUTS
is a hierarchical classification scheme, with three levels of aggregation referred to as
NUTS Levels 1, 2, and 3 (the finest partition).

Note: The table presents the results of univariate regressions where the dependent variable is the average firm size, measured by employees, in 1998 as defined in the text. In the left panel,
specifications are estimated via ordinary least squares and the right panel median regressions are presented. In each panel, the first two columns employ all of Europe while the the third and fourth
column restrict attention to the Eurozone and CEE, respectively. In the second column of both panels, a dummy variable set equal to one for CEE observations is also included. In all specifications,
industry fixed effects and gdp per capita countrols are employed. The independent variables are the fairness index, the formalism index, a measure of interference by courts, a measure of start-up
procedures, and a measure of property rights protection as described more fully in the text. Each cell provides the coefficient on independent variable, the standard error and the number of
observations for that regression. In OLS specifications, the standard errors are heteroskedastiicty-consistent and in the median regressions, standard errors are bootstrapped.

Note: The table presents the results of univariate regressions where the dependent variable is the skewness of the firm-size distribution in 1998 as defined in the text. In the left panel, specifications
are estimated via ordinary least squares and the right panel median regressions are presented. In each panel, the first two columns employ all of Europe while the the third and fourth column restrict
attention to the Eurozone and CEE, respectively. In the second column of both panels, a dummy variable set equal to one for CEE observations is also included. In all specifications, industry fixed
effects and gdp per capita countrols are employed. The independent variables are the fairness index, the formalism index, a measure of interference by courts, a measure of start-up procedures, and a
measure of property rights protection as described more fully in the text. Each cell provides the coefficient on independent variable, the standard error and the number of observations for that regression.
In OLS specifications, the standard errors are heteroskedastiicty-consistent and in the median regressions, standard errors are bootstrapped.

Note: The table presents the results of univariate regressions where the dependent variable is the difference in skewness of the firm-size distributions for firms above and below the median age in 1998 as
defined in the text. In the left panel, specifications are estimated via ordinary least squares and the right panel median regressions are presented. In each panel, the first two columns employ all of Europe
while the the third and fourth column restrict attention to the Eurozone and CEE, respectively. In the second column of both panels, a dummy variable set equal to one for CEE observations is also
included. In all specifications, industry fixed effects and gdp per capita countrols are employed. The independent variables are the fairness index, the formalism index, a measure of interference by courts,
a measure of start-up procedures, and a measure of property rights protection as described more fully in the text. Each cell provides the coefficient on independent variable, the standard error and the
number of observations for that regression. In OLS specifications, the standard errors are heteroskedastiicty-consistent and in the median regressions, standard errors are bootstrapped.
