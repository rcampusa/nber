       Capital Accumulation and Annuities in an Adverse Selection Economy




                                    ABSTRACT



This paper suggests that adverse selection problems in competitive annuity

markets can generate quantity constrained equilibria in which some agents

whose length of' lifetime is uncertain find it advantageous to accumulate

capital privately.    This occurs despite the higher rates of return on

annuities. The welfare properties of these allocations are analyzed.    It is

shown that the level of capital accumulation is excessive in a Paretian

sense. Policies which eliminate this inefficiency are discussed.

1.   Introduction


     This paper investigates the nature of annuity markets and the

composition of private portfolios when there exists cx ante private

information    regarding individual specific survival probabilities. The
existence     of such private information leads to equilibrium annuity
contracts which constrain subsets of agents with respect to the quantity

of annuities that they can purchase. When the magnitude of agents'
investments in some non—annuity type asset is non—observable, these
quantity constraints may be sufficiently binding to lead sane agents who
do not have bequest motives to finance a portion of their old age
consumption via bequeathable wealth. This can occur despite the fact that

the equilibrium rate of return on bequeathable wealth is lower than the
equilibrium rate of return on annuities • Given uncertain lifetimes, the
voluntary private accumulation of bequeathable wealth generates
involuntary bequests.
     In contrast to Kotlikoff and      Spivak   (1981), Abel (1985) and Eckatein,
Eichenbaum and Peled     (1985a), emong   others,   who exclude annuity markets on
an a riori basis, the quantity constraints on purchases of annuities in
our model emerge    as   an equilibrium response    to   adverse selection problems.
The explicit derivation of the nature of equilibrium annuity contracts
allows us to identify the types of agents who will be quantity—constrained
with respect to annuity purchases. In addition we are able to discuss the
welfare properties of decentralized equilbria in our adverse selection
economy.      Given a characterization of the set of informationally
constrained   Pareto optimal allocations, we briefly discuss a welfare

improving role for government when involuntary bequests exist.

      In the particular model that we consider individuals do not have
 bequest motives.      This does not reflect any belief on our part that

 bequest motives do not play an important role in generating
 intergenerational transfers.           Instead, this assumption is made for

convenience and because the qualitative features of our results will be

robust to the inclusion of standard types of bequest motives (see for

example Barro (1974), Shezhinski and Weiss (1981) and Abel (1984)). It is

true that if agents had bequest motives, not all intergenerational

transfers would be involuntary.         However some individuals would still be

quantity—constrained with respect to annuity purchases so that some

personal    consumption would be financed from bequeathable wealth.           Put
somewhat differently, bequeathable wealth uld not be held solely for
bequest purposes • This is consistent with findings by Diamond and Hausman
(1982), King and Dicks—Mirseaux (1982), Bernheim (1984) and Bernheim,
Shleifer and Sunmers (1985) which imply          that retired people dissave from

non—annuity    type assets in order to finance their consumption.            Such
behavior is inconsistent with models in which agents can purchase, without
quantity constraints, actuarially fair annuities, regardless of whether or
not they have standard types of bequest motives.
     The remainder of   this    paper is organized as followe. In section 2 we
present    the basic features of the model.          Decentralized equilibria are

discussed in section 3 while welfare considerations and the policy
implications of our   results   are   analyzed   in section 4. Finally, section 5

contains   some concluding remarks.

2.   The Model
     The population is partitioned into two distinct groups, A and B. For
each type A agent there are r                type   B agents, y > 0. The members of each
group live at most two periods, the first of which they survive with
certainty. Death can occur at the beginning of the second period with
probability         h £ {A,B}, o < A < B < 1. With a continuum of
agents, a proportion (lIIh) of the old members of group h will die at the
beginning of the second period. Throughout, we assume that the survival
probability of iy         agent is known only by the agent in question.
                             given

Thus *iile each agent correctly perceives that his probability of dying at
the beginning of the second period is (luh), h £                        (A,B}, he does not know
thether any other given agent is a member of group A or B.
     Let         denote the consumption of a type h agent in period i, hc{A,B},
ia   1,2.    We assume       that      is zero if       the agent is not alive in period         2.
Preferences over lifetime consumption (C,C) of a type h                           agent   are given
by U(C) + IhU(C),              h c {A,B}, where U() is strictly increasing and

strictly     concave.         In    addition lim        U'(x) a   0   and urn   U'(x) a    . The
                                                                          x0
marginal rate of substitution between C1 and C2 for a type                             h agent is
given by
      Agents of both types are endowed with W units of a storable

consumption good        in    the    first   period     of   their lives.       The technology of

storage     is such that one unit stored in              the first     period yields       units of

the good    in   the   second period, d > 0.
     Let qh(ee)              denote the      optimal storage undertaken by           a    member of
group h, given exogenous good endoaents of e1 and e2 in periods 1 and 2.

Since TB>           it folloi that qB(e1,e2) > qA(ee) for all (e1,e2) c

with strict inequality whenever qB(e,e) > 0. Agents' indirect utilities

defined over (e1,e2), to be denoted by '(','), are defined as



               U(e1 — qh(e1,e2)] + IIhU(e2 +
Vh(e1,e2)                                    sSqt'(e1,e2)], h c (A,B}.        (2.2)



       Given   these definitions we proceed now to describe the competitive
equilbrit.mi of this economy.


3.   Competitive   Annuity Markets
      In this section we consider the competitive provision of annuities in
the economy described above. In doing this we utilize two related
concepts of equilibrium in adverse selection environments due to
Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977).               Competition     ong
annuity providers involves the specification of both "prices" and
"quantities" in the sense discussed by Rothschild and Stiglitz and
Wilson.2       Under both of     the definitions of an equilibrium which we
consider,   an annuity contract is viewed as a two—dimensional vector (S,R)

where S denotes the premium      paid    in the first period of a purchaser's   life
and SR is the corresponding return to the agent if he is alive in the
second period.
      We define
      L.h(SIR) =   MaxIU(W..S—q) +   nU(RS+dq)}, h c (A,B}                    (3.1)
                   q>0
                                           5




as the indirect utility that a member of group h derives from the annuity
contract    (S,R), taking into account         his optimal non—insurance portfolio
decisions.


A Rothschild/Stigj.itz (El) equilibrium is a set of contracts such that

   (1)       agents choose contracts and non—insurance assets to maximize

             their expected utility;

  (ii)       all contracts in the equilibrium set       earn   zero profits;

 (iii)      there is no contract outside the equilibrium set that is

            preferred by some    agent    and   which makes non—negative expected
             profits when   offered   by one firm under the assumption that the

            set of contracts offered by other firms        remains   unchanged.

A Wilson (E2) equilibrium is the seme as the El equilibrium except that

firms'   expectations are modified by assuming that each           firm will   correctly
anticipate which of those policies that are offered by other firms will
become unprofitable as a consequence of          any   changes in    its   own policies.
The firm then offers a new policy only if              it makes   non—negative profits
after all the other firms have maie the expected adjustment in their
policy offers.
    It is convenient to divide annuity contract equilibria into one of
two catagories, (a) pooling equilibria in which all agents buy the seme
annuity contract, and (b) separating equilibria in which agents with
different survival probabilities purchase different annuity contracts. We
begin by noting     that, as in standard adverse selection insurance contexts,

there    does not   exist an El pooling equilibrium.3          Consequently, if    an El

equilibrium exists, it is a separating one. Since each contract offered
must earn zero profit, each group's contract is actuarially fair in the
sense that its rate of return equals 61h' h c {A,B}.
                                            6




     The fact that some agents may choose to finance second period
consumption by holding bequeathable wealth follows from the nature of the
equilibrium annuity contracts. In particular, as Theorem 1 indicates, the
competitive provision of annuities guarantees that agents with high
survival      probabilities will not be constrained regarding annuity

purchases. However, agents with low survival probabilities may be

sufficiently constrained with respect to annuity purchases that they find

it advantageous to hold capital as veil as annuities, despite the fact

that capital is dominated with respect to its rate of return.                         The

following theorem         which is   proved in Appendix A, characterizes the
equilibrium    of this economy.


Theorem   1


     If an El equilibrium exists, the equilibrium contracts are given by
     (SA,6/UA) and (S8,6/lIs) where  is the solution to

    Problem 1: Max U(W — S) +
                   S >0
                                     BU(6S/!B)

    and       is the solution to

    Problem 2: Max U(W — S — q'(W—S,            4S/fl ))   + UAU(•SS/nA+6qA(w_S,6s/IIA))
                                                    A
               s>o

                                                                                   (3.2)

    subject to

                   U(W_.SB)+118U(6sB/118)

                   U(W..qB(W5,6S/fl))+fl9U(dS/I+SqB(w..3,65/u))                    (3.3)



    The set of El     equilibrium contracts is affected in an important way
by the possibility of unobservable capital accumulation by agents.
                                             7




Specifically, group B's incentive cpatibility constraint must reflect
the fact that the members of that group can invest in capital as well as
buy the group A annuity contract. As a result, the possibility of
unobservable capital accumulation may make the members of group A worse
off without affecting the welfare of the members of group B.                          This

possibility    is depicted in Figure 1.            When the capital technology is

unavailable to private agents, the El separating equilibrium consists of

the contracts defined by points B and G.              These are given by Theorem         1



assuming that q(,')           0.     bwever, when agents of type B wish        to    store

privately   from allocation        G, the equilibrium contracts are    given   by points

B and H.       The point H corresponds to the group              A equilibrium annuity
contract    that   solves   problem   2 of Theorem    1•   The   allocation H has the
property    that if a member of group B          optimally invested from that       point,
by moving     down from H     on     the broken line, he could obtain the final
allocation represented by point D which lies on the seme indifference
curve as the point B.
     Let     (SG,/IIA) and                        denote the annuity contracts

corresponding  to the points G and H respectively. While the annuity
contract for group B specifies that group's rina]. allocation, this is not
necessarily the case for group A, since q&(W...SH,SH6/u) may be positive.
Hence, because of quantity rationing in the group A equilibrium annuity
contract, the members of that group may hold positive quantities of t
distinct assets, one of which has a higher rate of return from their point
of view. This possibility is depicted in Figure 1, where the members of
group A attain the allocation H' by storing privately from H. Put
differently, the members of group A may hold capital and annuities even in
the absence of bequest motives.

        Until now our discussion has assumed that an El equilibrium exists.
The following theorem, which is proved in Appendix B, provides necessary
and sufficient conditions for the existence of an El equilibrium.

Theorem 2
        Let (Ci,C) denote the consumption allocation chosen by consumer A if
he must buy the contract (SA,6/TA) which solves problem 2 of Theorem 1.
An El equilibrium does not exist if and only if A's indifference curve

throih (Ci',C) intersects the budget line C1 +                     c2/! : W,       where   is the

economy—wide       actuarially fair rate of return given by =
        Theorem    2 implies that the existence of an El equilibrium is made
more tenuous by agents' ability to privately store capital. This follows
from the       fact that    the condition        mentioned in Theorem 2      is more likely to

be    satisfied the rse is the             initial position of       the   members of group A.

The   possibility of private capital accumulation has precisely this adverse
effect on the incentive compatible annuity contract for group A.
        As Wilson (1977) has shown, the E2 equilibrium concept complements
the   Rothschild—Stigljtz El concept in the following my: when the economy

is one for which an El equilibrium exists, it is also the E2 equilibrium;

when the El equilibrium does not exist, the £2 equilibrium contract is a

pooling       one which,   in   our   context,   solves



        Max    U(W_3_q1(W_S,S)) + U(S!+IsqP(W_S,S))                                         (3.)
       s)o


where         is the economy-wide actuarially fair rate of return (defined in

Theorem 2).         Since the choice of S is unconstrained (aside from the

non—negativity condition), the solution                   to   (3.14),   denoted    Si', has the
                                                 9




property    that   q5!,5)       =   0.    Since qB(5P5P) > qA(5P5P), group B may
store positive amounts of the consumption good in an E2 pooling

equilibriii. This        is   to be contrasted with the separating equilibrium in

which the members of group A, but               not   the members of group B, may engage

in private storage.

       The result that        agents     who   do not have bequest motives may hold
bequeathable wealth was derived under                 the   assumptions that private storage

activities and individual, survival    probabilities are private information.
In   order to validate our claim that involuntary bequests can be attributed
to the unobservability of certain forms of bequeathable wealth, we now
examine the equilibrium of our model under the alternative assumption that
private holdings of capital are publicly observable.                               Under these
circumstances one can condition the terms of                     an   annuity contract on the
level of capital held by the purchaser of the contract.
        In genera], different levels of private capital held by agents will
reveal their types. We assume therefore that the members of group B, the
high risk group from the point of view of annuity issuers, will be offered
the El group B equilibrium contract, which coincides with the full
information group B contract, whenever their type is revealed.                        It follows
that the members of group B will, always hold the same                    amount   of capital as
a member of group    A   when both purchase the same contract.
        Consider first the situation in which bequeathable wealth                    is   held in
a    E2 pooling equilibrium when           private      storage is unobservable.          At the
allocation which corresponds to th. annuity pooling contract,
represented by point F in Figure               2, only      members of   group   B wish to   store

privately since MRS(eP.eP) =             l/    < l/. Since qA(eF,eP) = 0, agents who

store   positive amounts of the good,            will be revealed as members of group B
                                      10




 if storage is observable and receive the contract (5B6/) which
 corresponds to point B. However, the members of group B prefer (e,e) to

 (e,e) since otherwise the equilibrium uld have been a separating one
 tobegin with. It follo that the members of group B prefer the pooling
contract even if they cannot engage in private storage.      Thus, the
observability of private non—annuity type assets suffices to eliminate
private capital accumulation (and involuntary bequests) when there is an
E2 pooling equilibrium in annuity markets. However the equilibrium
pooling annuity contract itself does         not   change.    Instead, the
observabi],jty of private storage simply eliminates the ability of certain
agents to engage in additional. non—insurance savings activities.
      Consider next the situation depicted in Figure 1, in bthich the
separating equilibrium with unobservable storage involves the holding of
bequeathable wealth by the members of group A. In that equilibrium
private holding of capital allows the members of group A to increase their
utility by moving from allocation H to allocation H'.        In order to be
incentive compatible, the equilibrium group A annuity contract must have
the property that the final group B allocation obtainable from it lies     on
the indifference curve (labelled 'B in Figure 1) passing through the group
B annuity contract. Thus, when storage is observable, the binding
constraint on group A's final allocation is that it lies along      13.   From
group A's point of view the best actuarially fair allocation on that curve
is denoted by the point G. An annuity contract attaining allocation G may
require the imposition of no private storage in order to be incentive
compatible. Such a constraint on private savings may be binding for the
members of both groups at allocation G. However, this constrained annuity
contract is still preferred by the members of group A to any other
                                          11




contract    which is   both incentive compatible and allows     positive storage of
the   good (such as the annuity contract H and the corresponding consumption

allocation represented by the  point H'). Thus, as in the case of the E2
pooling    equilibrium, agents will not hold bequeathable wealth if all
non—annuity   type assets are observable.
      In concluding this section we briefly consider an additional market
that is made possible when agents with uncertain lifetimes hold capital.
Specifically, suppose that in the first period of their lives, agents
issue claims to one unit of the consumption good, redeemable in the second
period only if the issuer of the claim is not alive. Since the level of
private capital holdings, which backs such claims, is not observable in
the first period, the supply of these claims will be infinite at any
positive price. It is possible, however, to get around this difficulty by
considering the following extended annuity contract. In addition to a
first period contribution level and .a rate of return payable if                the

annuity holder is alive in the second period • the purchaser of the annuity
agrees to preocit ownership of his private capital holdings —— whatever
they may be —to the annuity issuer if he dies in the second period. This
precoemitment of estates potentially allowe for rates of return in excess
of group specific actuarially fair rates. If the equilibrium turns out to
be a separating one, then this extension is superfluous; the group B
contract makes private capital holdings unattractive for members of            that

grotç, but the implied incentive compatibility constraint prevents any
improvement in the rates of return for group A. Moreover, without cross
subsidization of contracts across different groups, precommitment of

estates    by members of group A cannot be used to improve the terms of group
B contracts •    On    the other hand, the nature of   the   pooling equilibrium may
                                          12




change as a result of introducing this type of extended annuity contract.
In particular, the rate of return payable on annuity investments will be
higher than ! if the members of group B choose to hold capita]. privately.
In this case, private capital acci.anulation by the members of group B does
not       to involuntary bequests. Instead, their estates revert to
       lead

annuity issuers and are re—distributed, in the form of higher rates of
return on annuities, to the surviving members of groups A and B.

4 The Inefficiency of Multi—Asset Portfolios
       In this section we establish the result that   any equilibrium in which

some     bequeathable wealth is held by private agents cannot be
(infortuationally      constrained) Pareto optimal. We then show that a
mandatory annuity program, which is actuarially fair in an economy—wide
sense, results in an equilibrium without involuntary bequests which Pareto
dominates the   initial   equilibrium.
       Pareto optimal allocations are defined to be the solutions to
particular types of social planning problems. The choice variables of
these problems are referred to as type—specific handouts of t period
consumption levels,     and are   denoted by (C', C), hc{A,B}.     The important
feature of this social planning problem is that the          ability of private

agents   to accumulate capita]. in an unobserved manner prevents the social
planner from specifying final consumption levels.
                  first period endoirenents and
       Assuming that                                 the    proceeds from   stored

output are the only sources of goods in the         first    and second periods
respectively,   the resource   constraints on the choice variables, expressed
in   per capita terms, are given by,

where K   is   per   capita    storage. Thus,          the   consumption handouts to agents
must satisfy the

aggregate consistency condition:

     The    set of Pareto optimal allocations is given by the solutions to
the following family of programming problems for all :

       The following theorem, which is proved in Appendix C, characterizes
the unique pooling allocation which can be Pareto optimal.


Theorem 3                                                             -



       If c     =       =       and             =         solves   Problem   3,   then   (!1,!2) is
the    unique solution to the equations



(1)    21 + TZ2/6 =         W


and

(ii)   U'(Z1) = SLJ'(22).



       Notice       that condition      (ii) of Theorem 3          implies   that   MRSh(11,22) =

h''     hc{A,B}.        Since           <   1/6, he{A,B}, it follows that no agent will
wish to store privately               at the unique candidate for an optimal pooling

allocation.         The following theorem, which is proved in                Appendix D, states

that   no allocation which induces private storage is Pareto optimal.

Theorem


       If                       solves Problem 3      then qA(CA,CA) = qB(CB,CB) =         o.


       It follows that an equilibrium cannot be Pareto optimal if
involtitary bequests are generated.                       Since the members of group A may
store privately in an El separating equilibrium and the members of group B
may store privately in an E2 pooling equilibrium, neither of these
equilibria will, in general, be Pareto optimal. Unlike the separating
equilibrium which may be optimal if no private storage occurs an E2

pooling equilibrium never results in an optimal allocation regardless of
whether or not individuals engage in private storage. By Theorem 3, a
pooling allocation can be Pareto optimal only if it coincides with the
(!1,Z2) allocation, which has the property that MRSh(!1,!2) =
ha{A,B}.    }bwever at the E2 pooling equilibrium, MRSA(C,C) =
Thus this   equilibrium cannot be Pareto optimal.

effects of such a policy conditional on the initial non—intervention

policy to be analyzed requires that each agent contribute X units of the
consumption good in the first period in return for ffx units of the good in
the second period if he is alive. Thus agent's effective lifetime
endoent of the consumption goad is (W—X,!X). We now show that it is
possible to choose I so that the resulting equilibrium Pareto dominates
the   initial   equilibrium which corresponds to I equal to zero.
      We first consider the case in which the equilibrium corresponding to
Iz     is an £2 pooling equilibrium, with pooling contract (#,ff) and
       0

qB(i_sP,sP) > 0. This situation is described in Figure 3 by the point ,

which   corresponds to the   equilibrium     pooling   annuity   contract, and   point B

which corresponds to the       final   allocation attainable by the        members   of
groi B by privat, storage from the point P.
     Consider a mandatory annuity progrem with I = S. Under these

circumstances the residual demand for annuities results in a separating
equilibrium      in which no agent engages in private accumulation of

bequeathable     wealth. Group B's     final allocation in the new equilibrium is

         originating at P.
                         This allocation is represented by point B' in
 Figure 3. Since this budget line represents a higher rate of return than
 the one used to obtain allocation B from the point P, the members of group
 B are clearly made better off.                The indifference curve of type B agents
 through B' intersects the budget line of group A that passes through the
 point    P (which has a slope of                  at G'. Notice that at B, U'(C) =

5. Conclusion

      This paper has investigated the existence of involuntary bequests

when agents, who have no bequest motive, live an uncertain anount                    of    time

and agent—specific survival probabilities are private information.

Involuntary     bequests emerge as      an equilibrium phenomenon             because of    the

nature     of the equilibrium annuity contracts in our model economy.
      Two assumptions are     quite    important      for   our   results •    First, it   must

be   the   case that the issuers of annuities must be able to monitor the

number  of annuities purchased by any given agent. Secondly, it is
critical for the existence of involuntary bequests that there be some
forms of bequeathable wealth that are not observable to annuity issuers.

The importance of the first assumption can be seen by noting that it is a
necessary condition for the existence of quantity constraints. In
particular, the applicability of the Ibthschild and Stiglitz (1976) and

Wilson     (1977) definitions of competitivf equilibrium In adverse selection
markets depend crucially on the monitorability of contracts. The role of
the first assumption is highlighted in this paper by considering the
equilibrium then this assumption is not true • ()ir results are consistent
with other findings in the literature which indicate that the
non—observability of private capital accumulation can                 change   the nature of
optimal contracts in fundanenta].       ways.      For ezanple, Scheinloiian and       Weiss

(198$) consider a class of economic environments in rEiIch individually
optimal savings     and                market clearing interest rates
                          limited borrowing      at

completely exhaust the opportunities for feasible risk sharing anong
agents with Idiosyncratic and privately observed income.                       These authors
analyze a two    period       iIich agents have the possibility of saving
                          model   in

(but not borrowing) at the sane rate as financial intermediaries and where
                                        19




the level of saving is not observed by financial intermediaries. Optimal
contracts in this envirornnent involve letting agents borrow or lend at
market interest rates, subject to the constraint that debt is limited to
the maximun present value that an agent can repay in the second period
with probability one. This is not the case hen the magnitude of private
savings are observed by financial intermediaries.
     We   conclude by reiterating that the paper abstracts from the
                                        reflect any belief on ow
existence of bequest motives. This does not

part that bequest motives are unimportant in explaining the total
magnitude of intergenerational transfers. The assumption that agents have
no bequest motives is made only to simplify the analysis and because our
qualitative results will not be affected by the presence of standard types
of bequest motives. It is certainly     true that the ratio of involuntary to

voltmtary   bequests will be affected by the existence of bequest motives.
However, that ratio will not necessarily be zero as existing models of
agents with izicertain length of lifetimes tho have access to actuarially
fair annuity markets Imply. Put sewhat differently, se agents with
bequest motives may continue to finance their oi future consumption by
holdir    se bequeathable wealth in their portfolios despite the existence

of fully organized   annuity markets.

Appendix   A: Proof of Theorem 1

      The requirement that each contract earns zero profit implies group
     specific actuarially fair rates of return on each group's annuities.
     We prove the rest of the theorem by contradiction. Suppose that
               and
                             6/IrA)
                                       are   the El equilibri contracts, and that
     does not solve problem 1.               By the definition of problem 1 the members
     of    group     B    prefer (5B6/) to               (B/)                Thus LB(SB,4/IIB)           >
                         > LB(A6/u) so that (SB,4/irB) and (A6/)                                do not
     violate group B's incentive ccpatibility condition. Regardless of
     the sign of LA(,6/IIA) — LA(sB6/n) the contract (3B,6,/) makes
     nonnegative          profits.       Thus (A6/) and (Bd/u) violate the
     definition      of an El eiilibriiz           set   of    contracts. Consequently the
     l    group B equilibriizi contract must solve problem 1.
     Consider      the proposed El equilibritm (P6/UA) and (S3,6/fl8) where
          does not solve      the     following   problem:



Problem   I:
                      Max 1!(S,6/u)

    The solution to problem I is                                      (S,6/ll)

Appendix B: Proof        of    Theorem 2


        Define the sets           =                                                 and r =
                                       ((C',C)cR2I VA(Ci,C) >
                 +  = W}. We first show that an El equilibrium does not
CCClC2)ICA
exist if Q () r i . Consider the contract (3P,) where S solves


        Max              U(ifS)
        3>0
              U(Wr3)+n

Then (WS,Sif) £ £2A fl 1' if this intersection is non—empty. It followe
that LA(SP,R) > LA(SA,d/n) f. A            0.   The contract (S,) will
therefore      be purchased by        members of group A if offered, and it will         earn
positive profits if       they    alone purchase it,     and   zero profits otherwise.

        We now prove that if               r =   , then an El equilibrium exists. This
is    accplishedby systematically showing that no single contract (S,R)eR
can break the equilibrium set of contracts ((SA,d/nA),(SB,d/IIB)} defined
in   Theorem 1.


     Msizie then that there exists a contract (S,R) that attracts members
of grot A or B or both awey fr their respective contracts. Then one of
the following must       occur:


    Ci) L.B(s,R) >            4/fl)


(ii) LB(S,R) < L.B(SB,d/fl)                LCS,R) >

UnderCi), (S,R) makes non—negative profits only if it is purchased by
members of both groups, so that we also have LA(S,R) > L&(SA,4/iiA). But
because QAf)     0, the last inequality can hold only if
                     r                                                      R > if, in   which
case (S,R) must yield negative profits.

        To see that (ii) cnot hold we show that any contract (S,R) yielding
non—negative profits and satisfying LA(S,R) >                  L(SP,4/nA)   implies LB(S,R)
>
     LB(SB,4/nB).
                         This is achieved by considering two                exhaustive and
mutually exclusive       cases for       private storage activities fr the contract

Finally, since q'(W—S,SR) < qB(w_s,SR) we have that
LB(S,R) =      V8(i,)       > U()+3U() >
By construction, IP(S8,4/113) = LB(SPa,6/UA)                       so the desired contradiction

Appendix     C: Proof of Theorem 3

       The   set of zero profit pooling allocations is given by
$ = ((C1,C2) IC1 + TC2/6               =   W}, where T =

       Let                                  X3 =   (X,4)      be         most preferred allocations
                    =

on ,   by    the members of groups A and B, respectively. It follows that X

                    (X1X2)         ,       solves Problem 3 then X = X(t)          =
                                                                                      (X1(t),X2(t))
                                                                                                          =

       + (1—   t) X          for some t c          [0,1].     This can    be   verified by observing

that MR?(X1(t),X2(t))              > T/6, (MRSh(X1(t),X2(t)) < T/), for both h:A and
h:B if t>1, (t<0). Consequently, MRS&(X1,X2) < T/6 < 1/6 for any                               solution
(X1,X2)
         to Problem 3 in $.      Moreover,                          it can also be sho that
MRSB(X11X2)
                    < 1/6 for such             solutions.       Specifically, if at       any pooling

there       exists a Pareto dominating, incentive compatible allocation
(C4,C,C,C) which is obtainable from (X1,X2) as folloi:


               (C,C2) $ (Xl—cB, X2+dtB), B>°


               (C,C) z (X1.c, X2••4CA) 'A>0•

To insure that 'A and                  'B do    not violate aggregate consistancy they must
satisfy

But (C.2) implies only that 'A                      (lEB).r(B/(lIIA) < 'B so           that   given £3>O
one can choose 'A a

        Suppose now that thereexists a pooling allocation (C1,C2),$ which
solves Problem 3 but Fails to satisfy U (C1) = 6U (C2). We prove the
existence of a Pareto dominating, incentive compatible allocation for each
of the possible two cases, U'(C1) ( 6U(C2) and U'(C1) >

                (C,C) = (Cl+CA,   C2_rGA), CA > 0.                            (C.3)


 For (C,C) and (C,C) to dinate (C1,C2) for the members of group A and
 B respectively, r must be chosen such that MRS8(C1,C2) > hr >

            MRSB(C1,C2)

     Aggregate consistency requires (C.1) and IIArCA +
so   that                           By the choice of r, (6—113r) > 0, and
         (t%_lIAr)GA    (6_UBr)TGB.
since 113 >       we also have (11Ar) > 0. Consequently, for mall

         and an r that satisfies (C.k), choose CA>O such that 0 < CA

        It remains to show that                      is incentive canpatible given
agentst ability to store           privately from      any allocation.       It was
established that for any      pooling solution to Problem 3,     1/   > MRS3(C1,C2)
> MRSA(C.C2). Since C < C and C > C2, we have h/s > MRS3(C1,C2) >
MRSB(C,c), so that q (C,C)0. Also, r was                  chosen such that hr      <
MRS3(C1,C2) < 1/i, so that        (C,C) lies to the right of          the locus   of
allocations attainable by private storege from (C,C); i.e., C +
> C + (h/)CA. Consequently, by choosing tB small enough, we     (h/6)C
                                                                  have
v3(c,c) >                     Finally, note that q3(C,C) =        0 implies that
qA(C)       =    0,   so that VA(C,C) > U(C1) + nAtJ(C2) > U(C) +

Appendix   D: Proof of Theorem

     If C = C,        j =      1,2 then the result followe immediately from Theorem
3.   Forthe remaining (separating) solutions to Problem 3, we prove the
theorem by deriving a contradiction in each of the following cases:

        Case a: q'(C,C) > 0 and q3(C,C) =             0.


        Case   b: qA(CA,,CA)     > 0 and   qB(CBCB) > 0.

Case a

                       =   (C&_qA(C&,C&), cA .,. 6qA(cA.cA)).


Then,    aggregate   consistency, (i.3), requires that

If we let           = (C—t,C+rc) then for any r > 0 there exists c > 0
such that           satisfies aggregate consistency. Next we show that r
and c can be chosen in an incentive compatible way to yield a strictly
better allocation to agents of type B.

        Recall that qB(CBCB) =         o                 By continuity of
                                           implies qA(CB,cB) = 0.
qA(.,.) and the fact that B > 11A' there exists a neighborhood of (C,C),
denoted by D, on *ich q'(,') is zero.

follows that qA(B,B) = 0.    Notice that VA(,) =           >

is obtained from (C,C) by storing too much from A's viewpoint. At the
same time, vBP,) =            vB(c,cA) < v3(C,c) = B(3B)               Thus
                is incentive compatible. Then, given the slack in group A's
incentive compatibility condition and the resources available for
distribution in the first period, it is straightforward to show that there
always exists an allocation (,C) such that vBcc,c) >                  which
does not violate group A's incentive compatibility constraint. This
establishes   the contradiction for case b,

1.   This time separable specification of preferences is consistent with
     Yawl (1965) and Barro and Friedman (1977), among others, who adopt
     such a specification in order to parameterize utility over lifetime
     consumption   bundles in the face of uncertain lifetimes.

2.   Our use of these equilibrium definitions is motivated by the
     assumption that annuity providers can fullymonitor all annuity
     purchasesmate by their clients. In
                                     contrast, when the monitoring of
     contractsis not possible, it is more natural to model canpetition
     emong annuity providers as occurring solely with respect to the rate
     of return on annuities with no restrictions on coverage levels. Abel
     (198'3) and Jaynes (1978), among others, analyze different adverse
     selection markets under the assumption that monitoring is not
     possible. Some qualitative features of the equilibrium derived in
     this paper are quite sensitive to the equilibrium concept which we
     use.
3.   This result is proved in Eichenbaum and Peled (1984). Since agents
     can undertake private storage in addition to purchasing annuity
     contracts, verification of the incentive compatibility of the
     breaking contracts must take into account the possibility of
     nonobservable storage by private agents.

7.   Since the indifference curve of a member of group A through H' does
