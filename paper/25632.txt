Information Source and Cigarettes: Experimental Evidence on the Messenger Effect

                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the importance of information source (the ‘messenger’) on consumer choice in the
context of cigarettes, electronic and tobacco. We proxy choice with intentions to use cigarettes
and risk perceptions. We experimentally vary the messenger across three information sources:
government, physicians, and private companies. We compare effects relative to a no source
control in a sample of adult smokers. Neoclassical theory predicts that the information source, or
the messenger, should not influence choices. Behavioral economics suggests that the messenger
can have important implications for how consumers process information and, in turn, make
decisions. Our findings provide evidence in line with behavioral economics: the messenger
influences intention to use e-cigarettes, and risk perceptions about e-cigarettes and tobacco
cigarettes. Private companies appear to be particularly important messengers and are potentially
the economic agents most likely to shape the future adult demand for cigarettes.

1       Introduction
Electronic cigarettes (‘e-cigarettes’) are battery-operated devices that simulate smoking. The
device heats a liquid, which often contains nicotine – the addictive ingredient in e-cigarettes,
tobacco cigarettes, and many other tobacco products – and flavors, into a vapor which is
inhaled by the user (called ‘vaping’). These products were developed in 2003 (Riker, Lee,
Darville, & Hahn, 2012) and are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. Global sales of
e-cigarettes exceeded $11B in 2016 (BIS Research, 2018). In the United States, the focus of
our study, 5.5% adults currently use e-cigarettes (Coleman et al., 2017) and 15% of adults
have ever used these products (Weaver et al., 2016).
    E-cigarette use has progressed in a largely unregulated environment and there is con-
troversy regarding the health effects of these products. On the one hand, e-cigarettes are
generally believed to be less harmful than tobacco cigarettes for both smokers and non-
smokers, and may assist at least some smokers in quitting (Bullen et al., 2013; Hajek, Etter,
Benowitz, Eissenberg, & McRobbie, 2014; Dinakar & O’Connor, 2016; Shahab et al., 2017;
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2018). The potential for harm
reduction – that is addicted smokers who cannot quit tobacco products can consume nicotine
in a less harmful manner for themselves and those around them – could be important as,
despite numerous anti-smoking campaigns, tax increases, and use bans over several decades,
15.5% of U.S. adults continue to smoke (Jamal et al., 2018). Alternatively, there are con-
cerns among some public health advocates that e-cigarettes may re-normalize smoking, help
smokers circumvent indoor smoking bans, act as a gateway product to tobacco cigarettes,
and that the health benefits of e-cigarettes are over-stated (Zhong, Cao, Gong, Fei, & Wang,
2016; McKee & Capewell, 2015; Allen et al., 2016; Shi, Cummins, & Zhu, 2017).1
    Faced with this controversy, governments in many countries are determining whether and
how to establish e-cigarettes policies. In particular, communication strategies based on the
risks of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes are emerging. For instance, in the U.S., the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded its ‘Real Cost’ youth anti-smoking campaign,
initiated in 2014, to include e-cigarettes in 2018. At the same time, e-cigarette companies
spend millions of dollars each year advertising these products to consumers; e.g., in 2012
these companies spent $18.3M on advertising and this number is escalating (Kim, Arnold,
& Makarenko, 2014). Tobacco cigarette companies are increasingly entering the e-cigarette
market (Kamerow, 2013) which suggests that advertising efforts may become even more
    1
     We note that the importance of the gateway effect is debated within the public health community. See,
for instance, Etter (2018).


                                                    1
aggressive in the future. Recent data shows that an increasing proportion of U.S adults have
misconceptions about the harmfulness of e-cigarettes and that risk perceptions are associated
with product use (Viscusi, 2016; Czoli, Fong, Mays, & Hammond, 2017). This confluence of
factors suggests that there is substantial scope for communication efforts, public or private,
to shape the demand for e-cigarettes.
    Understanding how consumers incorporate information on the relative risks of e-cigarettes
and tobacco cigarettes is important to inform government policies related to these products,
and to understand how advertising from private companies may influence consumer demand.
Neoclassical economics predicts the format in which new information is conveyed is irrele-
vant for consumer choice. Behavioral economics suggests that format, ‘choice architecture’
(Thaler & Sunstein, 2008), has an important role in consumer decisions (Thaler & Sunstein,
2008; Oullier, Cialdini, Thaler, & Mullainathan, 2010). Dolan et al. (2012) highlight the
importance of information source (the ‘messenger’). For instance, consumers are more likely
to incorporate information from authority figures into decision making and are less likely to
incorporate information from individuals or groups that they dislike.
    We provide the first evidence on whether and how information source, the messenger,
affects adult smokers’ intentions to use e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, and risk percep-
tions about these products. Given the rapid growth of the e-cigarette market, controversy
over the relative health effects of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, and large-scale commu-
nication efforts by both public and private agents, studying this question is important from
a policy, public health, and economic perspective. We take an experimental approach in
which we present adult smokers with information on the health benefits of e-cigarettes vis-
a-vis tobacco cigarettes. We vary the messenger and compare intentions to use e-cigarettes
and tobacco cigarettes, and product risk perceptions in the various experimental arms. We
select three plausible messengers for cigarette information: government (which we proxy
with the FDA, the federal agency with the authority to regulate tobacco products in the
U.S.; through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009), physicians
(an important source of health information), and private companies (which we proxy with a
fictitious e-cigarette company). We compare each messenger to a no source control.
    Our findings support behavioral economic theories that suggest that messengers play
an important role in how consumers incorporate information into decision making and their
choices. In particular, our findings imply that private companies have a substantial influence
on smokers’ intention to use e-cigarettes, but not tobacco cigarettes, and consumers risk per-
ceptions of both products. Our findings suggest that government and physician messengers


                                              2
are generally not important predictors of our outcomes. These findings imply that private
companies may play a substantial role in shaping future adult demand for e-cigarettes.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on messengers and outlines
hypotheses that will be tested in the empirical work. Data, variables and methods are
described in Section 3. The main results are listed in Section 4. Robustness checks and
extensions are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.


2       Background and hypotheses
A large literature that overlaps economics and psychology explores deviations from neoclassi-
cal economic theories of consumer choice (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1990; Loewenstein,
O’Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003; Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). While it is beyond the scope of our
paper to describe this voluminous literature, we simply note that over several decades nu-
merous scholars have made important advancements in our understanding of choice behavior
that often depart from standard neoclassical theories.
    We consider one aspect of choice architecture – the manner in which information is
presented to consumers – in our study: the messenger effect. A messenger is an agent
who delivers information to the consumer (Dolan et al., 2012). The messenger effect is
understudied within economics broadly and cigarettes specifically.2 The dearth of economic
studies on messenger effects is surprising as the vast majority of public and private media
campaigns include a messenger. Put differently, someone or something must communicate
the message to the audience. Further, the importance of information in consumer choice is
well-studied in economics (Stigler, 1961; Arrow, 1963; Akerlof, 1970; Spence, 1973; Cawley,
Susskind, & Willage, 2018). This question is particularly relevant in an emerging market such
as the market for e-cigarettes as it can offer insight on the agents most likely to shape future
consumer demand and the associated health implications. For instance, if private e-cigarettes
companies have the ability to shape demand, then we may expect substantial increases in
e-cigarettes which may induce non-smokers to use these products and/or current tobacco
cigarette smokers to switch to using e-cigarettes. These changes will likely influence public
health in heterogeneous ways. We outline the messenger concept and develop hypotheses
based on the available evidence to test in our experiment. We focus on the economics,
psychology, and marketing literature, all of which have considered the messenger.
    2
    We are not aware of any economic or non-economic studies that address this question empirically.
We note that Schmidt, Ranney, Noar, and Goldstein (2017) explore the messenger conceptually from an
epidemiological perspective.


                                                 3
2.1    The messenger effect
Dolan et al. (2012) describe the messenger effect and discuss empirical evidence for its im-
portance. The concept is straightforward: the same information received from different mes-
sengers can have differential effects on consumer beliefs and choices. Messenger credibility is
particularly important: consumers are more likely to respond – i.e., to view the information
as accurate and incorporate it into decision-making – to information from sources deemed as
credible (i.e., trustworthy and believable). Several studies have linked messenger credibility
to authority and congruence, or likeness, between the source of information and the indi-
vidual, with congruence defined broadly as common values, ideologies, backgrounds, shared
experience, and so forth (Kelman, 1961; Wilson & Sherrell, 1993; Durantini, Albarracin,
Mitchell, Earl, & Gillette, 2006). In general, information from messengers who are perceived
as authorities or experts to, sharing similar characteristics with, and likeable to consumers
will have a greater effect on consumer choice than alternative messengers.
    Messenger effects have been documented across a range of economic activities. Nurses
have been shown to comply with physicians’ (authority figures) instructions, even when the
instructions are clearly incorrect (Hofling, Brotzman, Dalrymple, Graves, & Pierce, 1966).
Karlan and List (2012) document that charitable donations are larger when the donation
solicitation is linked to a perceived authority figure (e.g., Bill and Melinda Gates, prominent
U.S. philanthropists). Meer (2011) shows that university donations are larger when an alumni
(which proxies for similarities in background) requests a donation than an otherwise similar
individual. Boddery and Yates (2014) document that shared political affiliation is important
for individuals’ probability of agreeing with U.S. Supreme Court decisions (where shared
political affiliation refers to congruence between the surveyed individual and the Supreme
Court Justices forming the majority opinion). On the other hand, if the consumer dislikes
the messenger, then the consumer is less likely to incorporate received information into their
decision-making (Cialdini, 2007). Numerous marketing studies investigate messenger effects
for government, private companies, and citizen groups; which includes physicians (Trumbo
& McComas, 2003). Government and private companies are perceived as less credible for
risk-based information than citizen groups (Frewer, Howard, Hedderley, & Shepherd, 1996;
Kunreuther, Easterling, Desvousges, & Slovic, 1990; McCallum, Hammond, & Covello, 1991;
Slovic, Flynn, & Layman, 1991). Consumers are least likely to view government and private
companies as credible messengers if consumers believe these messengers have hidden agendas
(Kasperson, 1986; Mitchell, 1992).
    Overall, the literature suggests that messengers can have important effects on consumer


                                              4
choice. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis H1 : Information from the FDA and physicians will have a greater effect on
consumer intention to use and risk perception than information provided with no source as
the FDA and physicians will be perceived as authority figures.
Hypothesis H2 : Because consumers will view these agents has having an agenda (sell-
ing e-cigarettes), information from an e-cigarette company will have no effect, relative to
information provided with no source, on intentions to use and risk perceptions.
    However, if the FDA is viewed as a direct arm of the government, rather than an indepen-
dent scientific agency, this messenger may be viewed as less credible and thus have a muted
effect on consumer choice (hypothesis H1 ). This behavior may be particularly important as,
during our study period, there was a growing wave of anti-government and anti-science senti-
ment (American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2018). We note that hypothesis H2 may not
hold if consumers view e-cigarette companies as ‘combating’ or taking business away from
tobacco cigarette companies. Within the U.S., due to revelations of misconduct and false
advertising claims (Brandt, 2007), tobacco cigarette companies are viewed unfavorably by
many individuals. We note that many e-cigarette companies are owned by tobacco cigarette
companies (Kamerow, 2013), but consumers may not be aware of this fact.


3     Data, variables, and methods
3.1    Data
We focus on adult smokers to study the importance of the messenger within a homogeneous
group of established smokers. Further, adult tobacco cigarette smokers are at greatest risk
for health problems associated with smoking and reducing smoking in this group is likely to
have a substantial effect on public health (Levy et al., 2017). Data were collected through
an online platform by the survey firm Qualtrics on adult smokers 18 to 64 years between
April 6th, 2017 and May 26th, 2017. This survey platform is commonly used by economists
to study health-related outcomes, including e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes (Bradford,
Courtemanche, Heutel, McAlvanah, & Ruhm, 2017; Marti, Buckell, Maclean, & Sindelar,
2018; Buckell, Marti, & Sindelar, 2018).
    We constructed our sample to match a sample of adult smokers in the 2014 Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). At
the time of survey development, the 2014 BRFSS was the most recent year of this data set

                                             5
available. The BRFSS is a large national and state representative health survey conducted
annually, and is used within economics to study smoking (Courtemanche & Zapata, 2014;
Horn, Maclean, & Strain, 2017). We matched our sample to BRFSS on sex, age (18 to 34,
35 to 49, and 50 to 64 years), education (less than a college degree and a college degree or
more), and region (New England, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, South, Mountain, and Pacific).
Our survey instrument is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
    We conducted an experiment in which we varied the messenger of cigarette risk infor-
mation and then compared outcomes across the experimental arms. We included three
messengers: the FDA, a fictitious e-cigarette company developed by the authors for the
purposes of this study (called the ‘Ave’), and physicians. Cigarette risk information pro-
vided with no messenger seved as the control group. We choose these messengers as they
are important economic agents in the e-cigarette market and/or common sources of health
information. For instance, the FDA is the federal government agency within the U.S. that
has the authority to regulate cigarettes; e-cigarette companies manufacture, sell, and market
e-cigarettes; and physicians are important sources of health information, in particular for
smoking-related information (Hesse et al., 2005). We operationalized the messenger with an
image representing each source. We do not test the effect of information directly received
from a messenger. For example, we did not examine the effect of receiving information from
the consumer’s physician in a professional healthcare consultation. Instead, our experiment
mimics the type of information that is plausibly conveyed through a real-world advertising
campaign, a common communication mode for governments and private companies. For
instance, in 2012 59% of e-cigarette advertising expenditures were allocated to magazines
(Kim et al., 2014). We view our ability to capture information that could be conveyed in a
real-word advertising campaign as an advantage of our study.
    Respondents were randomized to one of four messengers and were shown the correspond-
ing image and were asked to carefully view the image. The survey paused for 30 seconds to
encourage viewing. Respondents could continue to view the image beyond this time period.
Each picture had an image of two hands holding e-cigarettes in the right hand and tobacco
cigarettes in the left hand. We altered the messenger by using different logos.3 The source
was placed in the upper right hand corner of each image. The information conveyed to smok-
ers related to the relative health harms of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes: ‘E-cigarettes
are much safer than tobacco cigarettes. If you switch to e-cigarettes now, you are likely to
   3
     We obtained permission to use the official FDA logo. We attempted to obtain permission from other
organizations (e.g., major medical organizations representing physicians), but we were not successful. For
this reason, we use a generic image of physicians. Details available on request.


                                                    6
live five years longer’ or ‘Tobacco cigarettes are much more harmful than e-cigarettes. If
you don’t switch to e-cigarettes now, you are likely to die five years earlier.’ Figures 1 to 4
present the images shown to respondents with the change in health status associated with a
transition to e-cigarettes as a health gain.4
    We selected life expectancy as this outcome is a relatively easy to understand and objec-
tive health metric, and is used within economics (Viscusi, 2016). Determining the changes
in life expectancy associated with switching from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes was not
straightforward. The clinical literature on e-cigarettes is nascent with no consensus on the
relative safety of e-cigarettes vs. tobacco cigarettes. However, there is general consensus
that e-cigarettes are the safer product. We selected a five year change in expectancy as we
deemed it plausible based on available clinical evidence (Jha et al., 2013).
    Prior to the survey, we conducted a 50-person pilot study. We asked respondents to note
any issues related to the viewing the images and/or any other problems with the survey.
Further, we had several research assistants complete the survey and report any problems, and
had the survey reviewed by Qualtrics programmers. We incorporated feedback to improve
our survey. In paritcular, no pilot respondent, research assistant, or Qualtrics programmer
noted any issues with the life expectancy measure, and we specifically asked these individuals
whether the life expectancy question was problematic.
    Our sample included 2,722 currently smoking non-elderly adults. We excluded several
respondents to improve data quality. Respondents who reported that they had difficulty
viewing the image were excluded. We asked ‘How hard did you find it to understand the
image you viewed?’ Response categories were: not difficult at all, not very difficult, somewhat
difficult, and extremely difficult. Respondents who found the image extremely difficult to
understand were excluded. We placed an attention test in the middle of the survey: we asked
respondents to select the number two (options one and two) with the two placed farthest to
the right (Krosnick, 1991). Respondents who failed this attention test were excluded. We
also excluded respondents who completed the survey in less than 1/3 of the median survey
time. Qualtrics recommends this practice in all online surveys as this is an industry standard.
Our analysis sample included 2,499 adults (or 92% of the full sample). This sample is large
relative to other online experiments (Pesko, Kenkel, Wang, & Hughes, 2016; Bradford et al.,
2017; Marti et al., 2018; Kenkel, Peng, Pesko, & Wang, 2017; Buckell et al., 2018).
    4
      We also randomized whether the information was framed as a gain or a loss. Our analysis of framing
health changes as a gain or loss generated inconclusive results, but these results are available on request. The
figures reported in this manuscript represent the health changes associated with switching to e-cigarettes as
a health gain. Figures that display the changes in health as a loss are available on request from the authors.



                                                       7
3.2     Variables
Our outcome variables were measured immediately following image viewing, and included
questions on intentions to use and risk perceptions about e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes.
These variables are established proxies for cigarette use and are grounded in the theory of
planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Godin & Kok, 1996; Harakeh, Scholte, Vermulst, de Vries,
& Engels, 2004; Rise, Kovac, Kraft, & Moan, 2008; Kleinjan et al., 2009; Czoli et al., 2017).
We asked respondents about their perceived likelihood of using e-cigarettes in the following
30 days. We constructed an indicator for reporting being extremely or somewhat likely to
use e-cigarettes in the next 30 days, and zero otherwise. Analogously, we constructed an
indicator for the likelihood of quitting tobacco cigarettes in the next 30 days. These two
variables proxy intentions to use e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes.
   We developed four indicators of tobacco cigarette and e-cigarette risk perceptions. More
specifically, the indicators were coded one (and zero otherwise) for strongly agreeing or agree-
ing with the following four statements: e-cigarettes are healthier than tobacco cigarettes,
people who switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes are healthier, the government
should encourage people to switch from using tobacco cigarettes to using e-cigarettes, and
the government should ban the sale of e-cigarettes. We adopted a forced response approach.


3.3     Methods
As we randomized respondents to treatments, we can compare outcome proportions across
arms. However, we apply a linear probability model (LPM) that controls for personal char-
acteristics to allow us to reduce residual variation in our outcomes and increase statistical
power (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). Equation 1 outlines our regression model:
               Ci,m = β0 + β1 F DAm + β2 P hysiciansm + β3 Avem + Xi,m β4 + µi,m                           (1)

    Ci,m is a cigarette outcome for respondent i assigned to messenger m. We include fixed
effects for the messenger; no messenger is the reference. Xi,m is a vector of demographic
variables. Demographics were collected in a survey following the experiment. We control
for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, region, family size, political affiliation, survey du-
ration (this variable measures the entire time between survey initiation and completion;
some respondents did not complete the survey in one sitting),5 reporting that the image
   5
    In robustness checking, reported later in the manuscript, we exclude respondents with both very short
and long survey duration: below the 5th percentile and above the 90th percentile of the empirical distribution.
Results based on this restricted sample are not appreciably different from the results reported here.


                                                      8
was somewhat hard to understand,6 excellent or very good health self-assessed health, daily
smoking, nicotine addiction (proxied by the number of minutes between waking up and first
tobacco cigarette (Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerström, 1991)), and current vap-
ing. We impute the mean/mode for observations with missing control variable information
and include indicators for missingness to maximize statistical power.
    µi,m is the error term. Heteroscedasticity robust standard errors are reported. Because we
randomize our treatment across respondents, we follow recent literature and do not cluster
at the treatment level (Abadie, Athey, Imbens, & Wooldridge, 2017). Results are unweighted
as Qualtrics does not provide weights.


4         Results
4.1        Summary statistics
Table 1 reports summary statistics. We assess balance across arms following Kruskal and
Wallis (1952). We reject the null hypothesis of no difference in mean rank across arms in
four of twenty-five variables (16%): age 18 to 34 years (p-value = 0.0810), age 35 to 49
years (p-value = 0.0747), Pacific region (p-value = 0.0038), and South region (p-value =
0.0258). However, the practical significance of these differences is small and we control for
these variables in our regression models.
    We asked respondents questions related to their knowledge of our messengers (Table 2).
96% report that they are familiar with the FDA and, interestingly, 18% report that they have
heard of the fictitious e-cigarette company. 80% have a regular physician. Familiarity with
the messengers is balanced across experimental arms with the exception of FDA awareness
(p-value = 0.0769). However, the differences in FDA awareness across experimental arms
are very small: 98% in the FDA arm, 96% in the fictitious e-cigarette company arm, 97% in
the physician arm, and 95% in the no source arm. In a robustness check reported later in
the manuscript we control for source familiarity in our regression model.


4.2        Regression results
Results for the effects of messenger on intentions to use cigarettes and risk perceptions are
reported in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. We report unadjusted (top panel) and adjusted
(bottom panel) regression results.

        We exclude respondents who report that the image was very hard to understand from the sample.

    52% of the sample plans to use an e-cigarette and 54% plans to quit tobacco cigarettes
in the next 30 days. We observe that receiving information from the fictitious e-cigarette
company increases the probability of reporting an intention to use e-cigarettes in the next
30 days. In particular, we observe that information from the fictitious e-cigarette company
raises intentions to use e-cigarettes by 8.0 percentage points (ppts) in the unadjusted model
and 6.5 ppts in the adjusted model. Relative the sample proportion these estimates imply
a 15% and 12% increase in intentions to use e-cigarettes (all relative effects are calculated
compared to the relevant sample proportions throughout the manuscript). We observe no
other statistically significant relationships.
    In our sample 62% agree that e-cigarettes are healthier than tobacco cigarettes, 58% agree
that switching to e-cigarettes from tobacco cigarettes will improve health, 47% agree that the
government should promote switching to e-cigarettes, and 20% agree that the government
should ban e-cigarettes. We observe that receiving information from the fictitious e-cigarette
company has a statistically significant effect on the probability of agreeing with our risk
perception variables. In unadjusted models, we observe that receiving information from
the fictitious e-cigarette company increases the probability of agreeing that e-cigarettes are
healthier than tobacco cigarettes by 8.5 ppts (14%) and increases the probability of agreeing
that switching to e-cigarettes will improve health by 6.4 ppts (11%), and decreases the
probability of agreeing that the government should ban e-cigarettes by 3.9 ppts (20%). In
adjusted models the estimates are very similar: 7.1 ppts (11%), 5.2 ppts (9%), and 4.3 ppts
(22%). No other coefficient estimates are statistically different from zero.
    We report covariate-adjusted results only for the remainder of the paper. Unadjusted
results are similar and available on request.


5     Robustness checking and extensions
5.1    Robustness checking
Our results are broadly stable across several different robustness checks. We lose precision in
some checks in which we exclude substantial shares of the sample. For brevity, we summarize
our analysis and note where findings depart from our main results.
   We apply linear probability models in our main analysis. Our outcome variables are
binary and therefore arguably more appropriately modeled with a specification that respects
the non-continuous nature of these variables. We estimate logit models and report aver-
age marginal effects (Tables A1 and A2). In our main analysis we impute the mean and

                                              10
mode for observations with missing information. We exclude observations with any missing
information on the control variables; n=110. Results are reported in Tables A3 and A4.
    We drop the 446 respondents who report having heard of the fictitious e-cigarette com-
pany (Tables A5 and A6). We note that receiving health information with physicians as the
messenger increases the probability of reporting an intention to quit tobacco cigarettes by
6.4 (ppts) or 12.5%. We control for messenger familiarity (Tables A7 and A8). We drop all
respondents who report that they find the fictitious e-cigarette company somewhat or very
trustworthy, n=922, and report results in Tables A9 and A10. As when we drop respondents
who have heard of the fictitious e-cigarette company, receiving information from a physician
increases the probability of reporting an intention to quit tobacco cigarettes. We exclude
respondents with survey duration below the 5th percentile and above the 95th percentile
of the empirical distribution. Results are listed in Tables A11 and A12. We observe that
receiving information from physicians increases the probability of reporting and intention to
use e-cigarettes in the next 30 days in this sample.
    We re-estimate Equation 1 using an ordered logit, which may better capture the ordinal
nature of our outcomes than an LPM or logit model. Results are reported in Tables A13
through A18. We convert beta coefficients to average marginal effects. The general pattern
of results that we observed in our main specifications holds when we use an ordered logit.
In particular, receiving information from the fictitious e-cigarette company appears to shift
intentions to use e-cigarettes and risk perceptions from the two bottom categories toward the
two top categories. As we observe in our main specification, no other sources of information
predict outcomes and no source predicts intentions to quit tobacco cigarettes. One exception
to this pattern of results is agreeing with the statement that the government should promote
switching from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes. In the ordered logit, we observe that receiv-
ing information from the FDA reduces (increases) the probability of agreeing (disagreeing)
with this statement.


5.2    Extensions
Given the importance of the fictitious e-cigarette company in our study, we wish to dig deeper
into the type of respondent who finds the fictitious e-cigarette company a credible messenger.
We separate respondents into those who report finding the fictitious e-cigarette company
somewhat or very trustworthy and those who do not. We then examine demographics for
these groups. Results are reported in Table A19. Members of these groups appear to be
broadly similar across age, gender, education, region, race, ethnicity, family size, political

                                              11
affiliation, and smoking. For instance, 57% of the group that finds the fictitious e-cigarette
company somewhat or very trustworthy is male and 55% of the group that does not find the
fictitious e-cigarette company trustworthy is male. There are non-trivial differences across
groups in terms of survey duration, difficulty viewing the image, self-assessed health, and
vaping. Average survey duration is 9,716 seconds, 9% have some difficulty viewing the image,
32% report their health as excellent or very good, and 35% are current vapers among those
who find the fictitious e-cigarette company somewhat or very trustworthy. In the sample that
does not find the fictitious e-cigarette company trustworthy these values are 16,998 seconds,
5.5%, 24%, and 16%. In unreported analysis, we conducted two-tailed t-tests for continuous
variables and differences in proportion tests for binary variables. Differences between the
two groups are often statistically different from zero, results are available on request.
     One interpretation of these results is that those who reported that they found the fic-
titious e-cigarette company trustworthy had more difficulty with the survey and spent less
time answering questions. Because we had various research assistants and programmers
at Qualtrics complete our survey, conducted a pilot study, and excluded those respondents
who had a great deal of difficulty with the image, failed our attention test, or spent very
little time completing the survey, we do not suspect that a problematic survey can fully
explain our findings. We note, in real-world markets, that many individuals exposed to in-
formation do not spend adequate time focusing on the communicated information and have
difficulty understanding information (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). Such consumers may be
particularly influenced by communication efforts by private companies. Alternatively, those
who reported finding the fictitious e-cigarette company trustworthy were more likely to vape
(35% vs. 16%). Vapers plausibly find e-cigarettes a valuable product, as evidenced by their
consumption of the product, and view all e-cigarette manufacturers favorably.
     We explore political affiliation and education heterogeneity. We interact messenger vari-
ables with an indicator for Republican/Republican-leaning, and college education, and esti-
mate an augmented version of Equation 1. To classify political affiliation, Independents were
asked whether they more so agreed with Democratic policies or Republican policies, and were
coded as Republican- or Democrat-leaning based on their response to this question. Results
from this analysis are reported in Tables A20 and A21 (political affiliation), and A22 and
A23 (education). We find no statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity in messenger
effects. We note that our experiment was not designed to test interactions and we may be
under-powered for this analysis.

6    Discussion
We provide experimental evidence on the of the importance source (the ‘messenger’) to con-
sumers in influencing intention to use and risk perceptions about e-cigarettes and tobacco
cigarettes. While neoclassical theory predicts that choice architecture, including factors
such as the messenger, should not affect choice, behavioral economic theory highlights its
importance. Our findings support behavioral economic theory: the messenger is empiri-
cally important for consumer intentions to use cigarettes and risk perceptions about these
products. In particular, private companies, proxied in our study by a fictitious e-cigarette
company, appear to be important messengers for adult smokers. On the other hand, infor-
mation provided by government agencies and physicians, common sources of health-related
media campaigns and health information generally, does not have a discernible effect on
intentions to use and risk perceptions versus a no messenger control. These findings have
important implications for governments attempting to develop communication strategies re-
lated to cigarettes. In addition to developing the message of the campaign, the selection of
the messenger, the conveyer of the information, is important for improving public health.
    The importance of a fictitious e-cigarette company that we document deserves some
discussion. While we cannot test the reasons why this messenger appears to be important
for adult smokers we can propose possible explanations. First, congruence between the
messenger (an e-cigarette company) and the follow-up questions (intentions to use cigarettes
and risk perceptions of these products) may play a role. Respondents may expect cigarette
questions after viewing an image of an e-cigarette company but may not have this expectation
if they are presented with a different image. Second, tobacco cigarette companies are viewed
unfavorably by many Americans (Brandt, 2007). Respondents may interpret e-cigarette
companies as taking business away from tobacco companies and/or offering a new cessation
product, which respondents may view positively, leading to the importance of the fictitious e-
cigarette company. Recall that we focus on a sample of adult current smokers, many of whom
want to quit smoking but cannot as smoking is addictive (Babb, 2017). Smokers may have
particularly negative views toward tobacco cigarette companies. Finally, respondents may
simply have found the fictitious e-cigarette company image appealing, credible, or important
for other intangible reasons.
    The generally null findings for a government agency (the FDA) and physicians as messen-
gers run counter to our hypotheses. In particular, we expected that information received from
these sources – who we hypothesized would be viewed as authorities able to provide credible
information by respondents – would influence consumers’ intentions to use cigarettes and risk

                                             13
perceptions relative to a no source control. In general, our findings did not support these
hypotheses. Our survey was conducted during a time of general distrust towards science and
the government among many segments of the U.S. population (American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, 2018), which may have influenced how respondents viewed these messengers.
For instance, consumers are less likely to find a messenger credible if that source is perceived
as having a hidden agenda, which may apply to a non-trivial share of the U.S. population
in terms of the government at the time our survey was fielded. Similar to public sentiment
towards government, many Americans were distrustful towards science generally at the time
our survey was fielded, which may extend to physicians. In addition, some respondents may
not have interpreted the associated image as capturing physicians, and instead viewed the
image as representing healthcare workers generally who may, as a group, not be viewed as
authorities in the context of the relative risk of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, leading
to diluted effects.
    We can use our estimates to understand how advertising may shape future demand for
e-cigarettes among adult smokers. To this end, we consider our findings for intentions to use
e-cigarettes and quit tobacco cigarettes in the next 30 days. Using our estimates, if future
advertising were provided by private companies, we could expect a 12% increase in intentions
to use e-cigarettes among current adult smokers with no corresponding increase in intentions
to stop using tobacco cigarettes. One of the potential health benefits of e-cigarettes is the
ability for addicted smokers to substitute from tobacco cigarettes to (arguably) less harmful
e-cigarettes. A concern is that, rather than substituting to the less harmful product, smokers
will use both products and consume e-cigarettes in situations where tobacco cigarette smok-
ing is prohibited (e.g., public venues) or discouraged (e.g., in close proximity to children). If
we assume that 25% of smokers who report an intention to use e-cigarettes in the next 30
days transition to regular use of these products,7 then our estimates would suggest an 3.0%
increase in dual use among adult smokers. The most recent estimates suggest that 15.5%
of adults smoke (Jamal et al., 2018), combining this estimate of the smoking prevalence
with our findings implies a 0.5% increase in dual use in the population. Our findings for
risk perceptions also suggest that advertising by private companies will increase dual use.
Collectively, our findings do not suggest that advertising by private companies will lead to
substantial reductions in tobacco product use among adult tobacco cigarette smokers.8
   7
     We are not aware of studies that link intentions to use e-cigarettes to future vaping among established
adult smokers.
   8
     Of course, our analysis does not allow us to speak towards changes in the intensity of e-cigarette vs.
tobacco cigarette use. For instance, it is possible that while smokers use both products they may reduce



                                                    14
    We note that, while the studies apply different identification strategies, our findings are
in line with Dave, Dench, Grossman, Kenkel, and Saffer (2018) who find no evidence that e-
cigarette magazine advertising influences quitting behavior among U.S. adult smokers. The
authors do provide evidence that exposure to television e-cigarette advertising may prompt
some smokers to quit smoking. However, we believe the images in our experiment are more
reflective of a magazine advertising campaign rather than a television advertising campaign.
    Our study has limitations. We use an online sample and the generalizability of our find-
ings is unclear. We do not study product use and rely on proxies. Finally, while we emphasize
messenger effects when interpreting findings for our source of information, we acknowledge
that the messenger could be interpreted as a signal of information quality. While our data
does not allow us to isolate messenger vs. signaling effects, our findings strongly imply
that the organization or person who conveys information to consumers plays an important
role for intentions to use cigarettes and risk perceptions about these products. Future work
could further explore the extent to which our findings are attributable to messenger and/or
signaling effects.
    These findings suggest that subtle differences in message presentation can lead to different
outcomes. In line with previous research on tobacco cigarette smokers – e.g. Gruber and
Köszegi (2001), Giné, Karlan, and Zinman (2010), Halpern et al. (2015), and Bradford et al.
(2017) – our findings imply that neoclassical theory may not fully explain consumer choice in
the context of cigarettes. We build on this line of literature by focusing on choice architecture
in the context of cigarettes, in particular the source of information. As has been documented
in the context of tobacco cigarettes (Avery, Kenkel, Lillard, & Mathios, 2007), our results
suggest an important role for private companies in shaping the trajectory of e-cigarette use.




tobacco smoking on the intensive margin (e.g., smoke less but continue to smoke), which would likely reduce
smoking-related health risks.
