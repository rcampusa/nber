                        Targeting Rules for Monetary Policy




                                     ABSTRACT

       This paper develops an analytical framework for the analysis of

targeting rules for monetary policy. We derive the optimal money supply rule

and analyze the implications of other monetary rules including rules that

target nominal GNP, the price level, the monetary growth rate and the interest

rate. An explicit welfare criterion is used in order to rank the alternative

rules. In the model monetary policy is needed because labor market contracts

set nominal wages in advance of the realization of the stochastic shocks. The

principal result is that the welfare ranking of alternative targeting rules

depends on whether the elasticity of labor demand exceeds or falls short of

the elasticity of labor supply. Specifically, it is shown that if the demand

for labor is more elastic than the supply, then targeting nominal GNP produces

a smaller welfare loss than targeting the CPI which in turn produces a smaller

welfare loss than interest-rate targeting.

         This paper develops an analytical framework for the analysis of targeting rules

for monetary policy. We derive the optimal money—supply rule and analyze the im-

plications of other rules governing the money supply process including the rules that

target nominal GNP, the price level, the monetary growth rate and the interest rate.

We use an explicit welfare criterion which permits ranking of the alternative rules.

In our model, as in Fischer (1977), the need for monetary policy arises from the

existence of labor market contracts which set nominal wages in advance of the reali—

zation of the stochastic shocks. We show that if the demand for labor is more elas-

tic than the supply, then targeting nominal GNP produces a smaller welfare loss than

targeting the CPI which in turn produces a smaller welfare loss than interest—rate

targeting. We also explore the conditions under which a constant money—growth rule

produces larger or smaller welfare losses than the nominal GNP targeting rule.



I. The Model

         Output is assumed to be produced by a Cobb—Douglas production function using

labor as the variable input. Hence, for period t,



(1)          log    =   log   B +   log Lt +   ,   0 <   < 1,




where         denotes output, Lt denotes labor input, B denotes a fixed parameter and

      denotes a stochastic i.i.d. productivity shock assumed to be distributed normally

with a fixed known variance a2. In the subsequent analysis we suppress the time

subscript and use lower—case letters to denote percentage discrepancies of a variable

from the value obtained in the absence of shocks.. Accordingly, equation (1) can be

rewritten as



(1')        y =    +
                                                      2


where y and Z denote the percentage deviations of output and employment from their

corresponding non-stochastic levels. It is assumed that due to cost of negotiations

nominal wages are set in advance at their expected market clearing level, and employ—

inent is determined by the demand for labor. Profit maximization along with the

assumption that producers satisfy their demand for labor yields



(2)         y =        [(p—w)      +




where    r =    1/(1—)           is the elasticity of labor demand (defined to be positive) and

where p and w denote, respectively, the product price and the nominal wage rate

(all measured as a percentage deviations from their non—stochastic levels).

        This specification reflects the assumption that            9..   and thereby y are

determined exclusively by the demand for labor rather than by the interaction between

the demand and the supply. As a result actual employment and output may not be

optimal. We evaluate the various rules for monetary policies in terms of their

impact on the expected welfare loss arising from sub-optimal output. As a benchmark

we first determine the undistorted equilibrium.

        Let the supply of labor (measured in percentage deviations) be



(3)            9.5 =    c(w—p)



where c denotes the elasticity of labor supply. Substituting (3) for 9.. in (1')

yields the value of y consistent with the supply of labor; equating it with the value

of y that is consistent with the demand for labor (eq. 2) yields the equilibrium

level of output, y (measured in terms of deviations):


            —          (1+c)ri
()                               11.
                                               3

Equilibrium     output, y, may not coincide with realized output, y. The latter is de-

termined by the contractual nominal wage and by the realized price. The difference

between the two inflicts welfare loss which is proportional to the squared discre-

pancy [see Aizenman and Frenkel (1985)J. Thus, the expected welfare loss, H, is



(5)         H     cE[yyJ2



where c is a positive proportionality factor.

        Money—market equilibrium requires that the supply of money, m, equals the

demand:




(6)         m     k + p +   y—          ia).

In equation (6), 1 denotes the nominal rate of interest, 10 denotes the nominal

interest rate in the absence of shocks, k denotes a stochastic com—ponent of money

demand which is distributed normally and independently with zero mean and a fixed

known variance a, denotes the income elasticity of the demand for money and cz

denotes the interest rate semi—elasticity of money demand. The real rate of interest

also contains a stochastic component, p, which is distributed normally and independ-

ently with zero mean and a fixed known variance a2. It can be shown1 that the spe-

cification of the stochastic shocks Imply that i—i0 =   p—p   and, therefore, equation

(6) can be written as:



(6')        m =   k + (1+a)p   +   y—
II.    Active Money-Supply Rules

       In this section we analyze the welfare implications of alternative active

money—supply rules starting with a determination of the optimal rule.

11.1 The Optimal Money—Supply Rule

      The optimal money—supply rule aims at eliminating the welfare loss. As seen

from equation (5), the welfare loss is eliminated only if y =                 y.   Since nominal wages

are assumed given by wage contracts, the equilibrium price p must generate an

output level, y, equal to the optimal output, y. Equating y (from equation (2)) to y

(from equation ('4) yields



(7)        p=—----ii


Using equations (14) and (7') in (6') yields n as the optimal money—supply rule



(8)        in =   k   —   +   [(1c)    —
                                              (1+CL)]fl
                                      C+ fl



Equation (8) also shows that the optimal monetary rule requires a complete accommoda-

tion to money—demand shocks. As is evident in the special case for which                     = c = 0

and   =   1, monetary policy should not respond to real shocks. This case corresponds
to the one examined by Fischer (1985).

      The optimal monetary rule can also be expressed in terms of the observable

variables p and y. Since at the optimum in — k                 =   (1+ct) p + y—ap, it can be shown2

from (7), (8) and (6') that



(9)         cp+ (p+y) =0.


Thus, a monetary rule that targets the sum of (p+y) +                  p   to zero, eliminates the

welfare loss. Equation (9) also reveals that in the special case for which c=O, a

nominal GNP targeting rule is optimal; likewise, in the special case for which y = 0

(.i.e., in the absence of real shocks), a price level targeting rule is also optimal.

11.2 Nominal GNP Targeting

       The preceding discussion specified the optimal money—supply rule. Suppose

alternatively that the monetary authority targets nominal GNP.3 With this rule

p÷y=O. Using equation (2) and recalling that w=O, the realized price is —.i and,

correspondingly, y          p. Using the loss function (5) and the expression for y from

(14), the welfare loss associated with this targeting rule is




(ivi       H
               p+y=O
                          _rEc+ii

                                               p



where the notation indicates that this loss results from the stabilization of nominal

income and where a =



11.3 CPI Targeting
       With CPI targeting p=O. In that case the value of the loss function (5)

becomes



                                  2
(11)       H         =   a(—--)       a2

11.14 Interest—Rate Targeting

       With interest—rate targeting monetary policy assures that 1=10. Equivalently,

since i—i0      p—p,, this targeting rule sets p=p. In this case y = n(Bp+p) and the

loss function (5) becomes



                         = a a2 +

III. Ranking the Targeting Rules

             A comparison of (11) and (12) shows that price targeting produces a smaller

welfare loss than interest-rate targeting (they are equivalent only in the case in

which there are no interest—rate shocks). A comparison between the welfare cost

associated with these rules and the cost Induced by nominal GNP targeting (equation

(10)) shows that the ranking depends on whether n exceeds or falls short of

If il>c        then


(13)             m =
                       rn p +   y =   Op     =
                                                 Oi         10



where the symbol x. z indicates that x produces a smaller welfare loss than or is

equivalent to z. On the other hand if                  ri <          then price targeting produces a

smaller welfare loss than both nominal GNP and interest-rate targeting. Nominal GNP

targeting in turn produces a smaller welfare loss than interest—rate targeting if

             > (e'-Tl)/(c+fl) and vice versa.

IV.      A Constant Money—Growth Rule

             In sections II and III we analyzed the implications of alternative targeting

rules requiring active policy actions. In this section we analyze a targeting rule

which does not allow for a policy response to the stochastic shocks.                       Specifically,

we consider a constant money—growth rule by which in=O. Using equations (2) and (6')

and recalling that rn=w=0, yields the value of p which, together with equation (2)

implies that the value of y associated with the constant money—growth rule is

r [8(ap—k) +          (1+a)p]/(1+c    +   Fi). Using       equation (5), the welfare loss associated

with the constant money-growth rule is



                                a                                                     2
(1)             dlm=O =          2 k             +   a2)   +
                                                                   ([(1)(1+C)]fl)
                          (1+a+)
                                              7



As is evident from equation (114) one of the components of the welfare loss arises

from shocks to the demand for money. This may be contrasted with the welfare cost of

the CPI and the nominal GNP targeting rules in which money demand shocks did not play

a role. This assymetry stems from the fact that these targeting rules respond In one

way or another to the realized price and, thereby, neutralize the welfare effects of

the monetary shocks.

         Using equation (11) we can also write equation (114) as



                          1
             H                              2) + [(1+ct)   (1+c)]2 H
                                 2 {a(a +
(114')
                 m                          p                          p
                     (1+cx+n8)



In general, the relation between this welfare cost and the cost associated with the

other targeting rules depends on the value of the parameters and on the variance of

the shocks. It may be seen, however, that for a relatively high value of         the

constant money—growth rule produces a larger welfare loss than the other targeting

rules. Similarly, for a relatively high value of           the constant money-growth rule

produces a smaller welfare loss than the interest-rate targeting rule. In these two

cases both rules produces a larger welfare loss than the CR1 and to the nominal—GNP

targeting rules.
