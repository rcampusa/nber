I.     Introduction.

       This paper extends the existing theory and empirical investigation of unitization

contracts. It highlights the importance of incentive-compatibility and self-enforcement and

the bargaining problems faced in achieving viable, long-term contracts. Essential contract

elements are identified, and the conditions that promote their inclusion in unit agreements are

described. Less complete and effective arrangements are introduced and linked to specific

geological and market conditions that complicate bargaining. Hypotheses are derived about

when complete unit contracts will be observed and about the rent-dissipating behavior that

will occur when alternative arrangements are adopted. The empirical investigation makes use

of the largest data set of unitization contracts compiled to date—60 unit contracts in the

United States and Canada.

       We argue that if the parties to a unitization contract have unit production shares that

are the same as their cost shares, the contract will be incentive compatible. This follows

because the allocation formula makes each party a claimant to the unit’s net profits and as

such, motivates them to support a production plan that maximizes unit profits. Our survey of

units that have only one production phase and that are relatively homogeneous (no clustering

of oil and gas in separate parts of the reservoir) reveals that such equal sharing rules are

always found and they appear to encourage the parties to behave optimally. The contracts are

simple, do not require detailed provisions to address potentially serious moral hazard

problems, and conflicts over production and investment are minimized. The unit operator

develops the field and administers the contract. In more complex units with multiple

production phases and/or separate concentrations of oil and gas (gas cap) we argue that the

equal sharing rule still is necessary for effective unitization. Negotiating conditions, however,




                                                2
are more complicated and these affect the ability of the parties to reach agreement on the

required allocation formula. In multi-phase units, we find equal cost and production shares

within each phase, but not across phases. We show that this condition can still lead to optimal

behavior among the parties if there is a pre-set trigger for shifting from one production phase

to the next. For gas cap units, however, we generally do not find the equal sharing rule.

Although the parties have incentives to draft incentive-compatible contracts, they may not be

able to do so. Conflicts and rent dissipation follow as illustrated by the case of the Prudhoe

Bay Unit.

       Our contribution is useful because it describes the desirable contract rules for avoiding

moral hazard. It also shows how the effects of those rules can be replicated in difficult

situations through the use of a trigger. Finally, the analysis reveals the cases where complete

unitization contracts are unlikely to be written.

       Unitization contracts have been of interest to scholars in transactions costs economics,

political economy, and the law for some time. Unitization is the most straightforward

solution to a serious common-pool problem in oil and gas production. Under the common-law

rule of capture, private property rights to hydrocarbons are assigned only upon extraction.

Production rights are granted to firms through leases from those who hold the mineral rights,

often landowners. Each of the producing firms has an incentive to maximize the economic

value of its leases, rather than that of the hydrocarbon reservoir as a whole. As firms compete

for migratory oil and gas they dissipate reservoir rents with excessive capital, too rapid

production, and lost total recovery.1 With a complete unitization agreement among the

producers, however, a single firm is designated as the unit operator to develop the entire

reservoir.2 The other firms share in the unit profits according to negotiated formulas. The




                                                3
gains from agreement can be huge both from savings in capital costs and from increases in

overall production that can be from two to five times unregulated output.3

       With so much at stake, oil firms are motivated to reach agreement to form complete

units. Yet, despite this motivation, complete unitization is much more limited than

neoclassical theory would predict (Bain, 1947, p. 29). For instance, Libecap and Wiggins

(1985) report that as late as 1975, only 38 percent of Oklahoma production and 20 percent of

Texas production came from reservoir-wide units. Achieving consensus on a unit contract is

difficult with agreements often completed only after years of negotiation, when many of the

efficiency losses already have occurred. And, as we show even when unitization agreements

are reached, not all are complete, leaving the potential for various forms of competition

among owners that dissipate rents.4

       To be successful, a unit agreement must align the incentives of the oil-producing firms

over the life of the contract to maximize the economic value of the reservoir without repeated

re-contracting.5 Unit contracts involve a number of difficult issues that have to be addressed

by negotiators. Because remaining production often lasts 20 years or more, unit agreements

must be long term and be responsive to considerable uncertainty over future market and

geological conditions. They must allocate unit production and costs among the many firms

that otherwise would be producing from the reservoir.6 Additionally, they must authorize

investments that may be made later to expand reservoir production, and distribute the ensuing

costs among the individual parties.

       Unit contracts generally involve two documents. One is the Unit Agreement that is

between the firms (lessees) that plan to unitize the reservoir and the property or royalty

owners (lessors). This document describes the terms for the formation of the unit.7 The other




                                                4
document is the Unit Operating Agreement, which is the more detailed contract among the

working interest owners (WIOs) for forming and operating the unit. It includes the

designation of the location and limits of the reservoir or formation to be unitized and the

procedures to expand the unit as necessary; a definition of key terms such as development

wells, injection wells, and test wells; the identity of the unit operator and procedures for

removal of the unit operator; start date of the agreement; and identity of the working

interests, including their holdings (leases) on the reservoir.

       Unit Operating Agreements have additional provisions that define the operating

relationships among the working interests. These provisions include governance mechanisms

such as voting rules, notification requirements, grievance and arbitration procedures, unit

operator reporting and accounting practices, and establishment of a supervisory committee;

compensation for private capital equipment (typically, wells, pipelines, and possibly injection

plants) taken over by the unit; and the sharing formula by which produced substances, capital,

and operating costs are distributed among the working interests. Achieving agreement on the

sharing formula is very contentious, often requiring intense negotiations with many votes

taken by the working interests on various cost and production sharing options. Indeed,

arriving at a consensus on shares is the most difficult issue faced in unit negotiations. Discord

among the negotiators can delay unitization for years or lead to an incomplete agreement.

Uncertainty and asymmetric information among the parties about unobservable lease

characteristics hinder agreement on individual lease values and corresponding unit shares.

       Unit Operating Agreements also define the phases of production as primary (when

natural, subsurface pressures flush oil to the surface) and secondary (when various injection

procedures are used). Based on engineering reports agreed to at the time the unit is




                                                 5
established, the negotiating parties have some sense of how the various leases will fare in

each phase of production, and different sharing or ownership percentages may be defined for

each phase. General physical benchmarks are specified, such as a particular gas/oil ratio or

production level. As we show, these benchmarks typically are not controversial and they play

a very important role in maintaining incentive compatibility within the unit.8

       Finally, Unit Operating Agreements describe the mechanism by which parties are

added or dropped from the unit. If the Unit Agreement is written during exploration or early

development (when the full extent and nature of the subsurface formation are unknown)

parties may be mistakenly included or excluded from the unit. Hence, Unit Operating

Agreements include provisions for drilling test wells to confirm hydrocarbon deposits and

justification for participation in the unit. With these adjustments, the new (or remaining)

parties participate in production and costs according to the sharing formula.9 These

provisions define the working structure of the unit, and they are spelled out ex ante.10

       Unit Operating Agreements contain both specific benchmarks and general terms.

Certain contingencies are laid out, primarily the sharing formula under different production

phases, and mechanisms for adding or subtracting membership. But day-to-day operation of

the unit is left unspecified in the contract, with the unit operator bound only to a “best efforts”

standard of performance, a standard that would be costly to monitor without self-enforcing

provisions. It is not possible ex ante to define strict performance criteria for the unit operator

because far too much remains unknown at the time the contract is written, particularly about

future reservoir geological dynamics, market conditions, and production technology. Under

those circumstances, it is desirable to provide the unit operator with considerable latitude in

reservoir development.




                                                 6
       Importantly, many potential long-term contracting problems are not addressed

explicitly in Unit Operating Agreements. For example, procedures to address potential

extortion by some parties of the value of fixed, capital assets (non-moveable wells, injection

plants, and pipelines) typically are not described. This is a potential problem. Hypothetically,

any working interest could engage in opportunism and extort the unit for the value of those

assets by threatening to withdraw from the agreement or otherwise hinder unit operation

unless certain extortion demands were met.11 Also absent are discussions of how to deal with

threats by some strategically-located parties to withdraw from the unit. Because of the nature

of hydrocarbon deposits and changes in their flow with unit production, certain lease owners

can be essential for viable unit operation because of their position on the formation.

Theoretically, a small number of strategically-positioned parties could force a re-negotiation

of the unit once it was put into place and became profitable.

       These conditions could lead to opportunistic behavior and a breakdown in the unit’s

operation. But in practice, extortion of the value of fixed assets and strategic behavior to

force a re-negotiation of the unit agreement are uncommon. We argue that the profit-sharing

formula specified in the Unit Operating Agreement reduces the incentive of the parties to

engage in these actions. If the sharing formula has the characteristics described below and if

it applies to all communicating hydrocarbon deposits, then each party becomes a residual

claimant to the profits from effective operation of the entire unit. Under these circumstances,

the working interests would not want to hold up needed investment or delay new production

practices (such as drilling injection wells) in order to force a re-negotiation of the contract.

Such actions would not only reduce unit profits, but would invite similar strategic behavior by

other parties, eroding the basis for any long-term cooperation to maximize the value of the




                                                 7
unit. As such, the profit-sharing formula provides for self-enforcing cooperative behavior

among the working interests and expands what Klein (1996) refers to as the “self-enforcing

range” of the contract.12 Accordingly, although reaching agreement on the sharing formula

involves long and costly negotiations, once established the formula reduces ex post

enforcement costs.

       Our argument proceeds as follows: In the next section, we summarize the common-

pool problem in hydrocarbon reservoirs and then show how unitization with a profit-sharing

formula having specific characteristics solves the problem. Section III examines two

empirically-important issues that complicate agreement on the unit sharing formula--very

skewed holdings of oil and gas and multiple production phases. Section IV presents empirical

evidence. Section V summarizes the results and provides generalizations for understanding

the functioning of oil and gas unit agreements.

II.    The Common Pool in Oil and Gas Reservoirs and Necessary Provisions for
       Complete Unit Contracts.

       A. The Common-Pool Problem.

       Competitive extraction from common-pool oil and gas reservoirs generates potentially

large efficiency losses, and unitized operations can provide a remedy.13 The particular form

of the unitization agreement, however, determines whether that remedy will be effective.

The common-pool problem arises when multiple firms extract from a reservoir where the

underlying resources are in communication via interrelated pressure gradients and resource

migration. Under these conditions, extraction by one firm affects the volume and cost of

production elsewhere within the reservoir.14

       Absent any type of cooperative effort, the outcome of competitive extraction is well

known. Each firm determines the number of wells it will drill and sets output from each well



                                                  8
so as to maximize its private profits, ignoring the cost and production externalities it inflicts

on other producers. It raises overall costs by releasing natural gas or other substances during

production, thereby reducing the underground pressures that push oil to the surface. As

pressures fall, pumping and injection of other propellants become necessary. Further, the

firm’s production encourages migration of oil from elsewhere in the reservoir, allowing it to

extract its neighbor’s oil. Since all firms recognize these conditions, they have incentive to

competitively drill and drain the reservoir. Accordingly, at any point in time, individual

production decisions are made to enhance the value of firm leases rather than to maximize the

economic value of the overall reservoir.

       B. Characteristics of Complete Unit Contracts.

       To avoid the loss associated with competitive extraction, the lease owners may attempt

to reach consensus on a more optimal production plan to avoid rent dissipation. There are,

however, several possible forms that unitized operations might take, and not all are equally

effective. Under unitization the unit operator will drill wells and produce oil and natural gas

from the reservoir. The associated costs and production are allocated among the lease owners

according to a pre-arranged sharing rule. Negotiating an agreement on the unit-sharing rule,

however, can be particularly difficult. But successfully addressing the common-pool problem

requires more than agreement on a sharing formula. The allocation formula must take a

particular form in order to align incentives and insure that the unit production plan maximizes

the economic value of the reservoir.

       For each lease owner a single equity share or participation factor must be adopted that

applies equally to both costs and production throughout the reservoir. If each member’s share

of production is matched by his share of expenditures over the life of the reservoir, then all




                                                 9
parties will be residual claimants to the net economic profits from unit-wide production. Each

party will be motivated by individual incentives to pursue a common plan of efficient

development.15 Only if this condition is met can we say that the reservoir has been completely

unitized and that the common-pool problem has been remedied.

       If shares are assigned in this manner during unit negotiations, maximization of the

value of the reservoir (economic efficiency) becomes a common goal at the outset.

Alternatively, if there is a wedge between the cost and production shares assigned to any

party, then the consensus will fail and conflicts emerge. For example, if the sharing fomula

does not uniformly allocate each type of cost in the same proportion as production, certain

owners will advocate actions that would skew development in the direction of those

expenditures (e.g., injection wells) in which they carry a relatively light load—even if that is

inconsistent with maximizing the overall value of the unit. Dissention, violation of the unit

agreement, and rent dissipation are likely results.

       To resolve such disputes, some parties (typically those with the largest leases and the

most to lose) may devise side payments that restore consensus and allow development to

proceed. Although side payments may balance interests at one particular point in time and

persuade all parties to support a common course of development, they do not assure incentive

compatibility over the remaining life of the unit. New disputes and conflicts will emerge (and

the need for additional side payments will ultimately arise) if cost and production shares are

not made equal. Interests can easily fall out of balance as soon as circumstances (expected

prices, costs, or production possibilities) change, which they inevitably do. Further,

efficiency losses inflicted on the unit from disagreement and non-optimal production practices

may be irreversible due to resulting changes in reservoir dynamics. Accordingly, ex post




                                               10
efforts to align interests via side payments are not apt to be as effective as the ex ante

proportionate assignment of costs and production to each party.

       Importantly, aligning incentives through a profit-sharing formula reduces the

information necessary for implementing a unit agreement. The contract can be left relatively

simple because new information will be incorporated and plans adapted by consensus over the

life of the unit in a manner that maximizes its value and the returns to the parties. For

example, new information about the configuration, extent, and communication of reservoirs is

revealed through production. This knowledge may require extension or contraction of the

unit with the corresponding addition or dropping of interests from the unit. When parties are

added or deleted, the relative position of the incumbent interests is maintained as outlined in

the initial profit-sharing formula. Re-negotiation of the formula is not required. Similarly,

the allocation formula is robust against unexpected changes in oil prices, costs, or recovery

methods. The incentives of the working interest owners remain aligned (without side

payments or re-contracting) even as these features of the project are unpredictably altered.

       Because each party will favor a production plan that maximizes the economic value of

the unit, execution can safely be left in the charge of a single unit operator without detailed

performance provisions or enforcement guidelines defined at the initiation of the contract. 16

Any firm with a lease interest in the reservoir and the technical competence to develop it

would provide incentive-compatible management. Beyond this, reliance on a single unit

operator reduces the transaction and coordination costs that would arise if there were multiple

unit operators and as such, further enhances the overall net value of the reservoir.

       In practice, the unit operator is usually the largest lease owner on the reservoir. This

firm has the most at stake in unitization, thus minimizing any incentive for opportunistic




                                                11
behavior that would harm other interests. If discovered, this deception could lead to the break

down of the unit. Supervision of the unit operator also is formally addressed in the Unit

Operating Agreement with requirements for a governing board and votes on production and

investment decisions. The governing board is composed of the other interests, and voting

weight is defined by the profit-sharing formula, again granting those with the greatest stake in

the unit the greatest role to play in production and investment decisions. Super-majority

voting rules are described with the requirements increasing with the significance of the issue

at hand.17

III. Geologic/Information Problems and Alternative Unit Agreements.

       Despite the attractive attributes of a complete unit contract, not all unit agreements are

written with these provisions. Disagreements during unit negotiations can impede acceptance

of a sharing formula that aligns the incentives of the parties. An alternative, less effective

contract can be the result. The negotiation of unit shares is burdened by uncertainty regarding

the volume and value of the assets (leases) that each party brings to the unit. We are not

concerned here with the possibility that negotiations may simply fail, leading to the

alternative of competitive extraction. The potential for contractual failure has been examined

elsewhere.18 Rather, we consider the impact of certain provisions that lease owners

commonly adopt in practice to avoid contractual failure, but which subsequently alter the

fundamental structure of the unit in ways that can threaten its effectiveness.

       Negotiating over unit shares amounts fundamentally to the trading of disparate assets

among the working interest owners. Because the reservoir has distinct physical properties

that are not uniformly distributed, the respective leases generally reflect assets that differ very

much in kind, as well as quantity. Some lease owners may have mostly gas beneath their




                                                12
leases while others have mostly oil. In order to completely unitize the reservoir, the two sides

have to adopt (at least implicitly) agreed terms of trade by which an interest in gas is

exchanged for a compensating interest oil. Similarly, certain parties may hold leases that

provide natural sites for production wells (e.g., high on the formation) during primary

production, while others may hold leases that are better candidates for water or gas injection

(e.g., low on the formation) during secondary production. Again, it will be necessary for the

parties to adopt terms of trade based on the lease locations and the potential for enhanced

recovery efforts to supplement the natural reservoir drive

       Through repeated negotiations, WIOs typically are capable of translating differences

in quantity of resources into ownership shares in the unit. However, here we argue that

differences in kind are more problematic. The basis for placing relative values on the oil and

gas assets may not be obvious to the bargaining parties. Gas ownership presents a particular

problem. The valuation of gas in the reservoir depends on whether it is assumed to be

marketed, as opposed to being re-injected in support of enhanced oil recovery efforts. Due to

limited transportability in some cases, the existence of any external market for the gas may be

doubtful, especially in remote locations. To the extent that the imputed value of gas is

speculative, WIOs may find it difficult to adopt any definite terms of trade of oil for gas and

be unable to agree on any particular distribution of equity in the unit as a whole.

       The difference in kind between gas and oil is not simply imagined. The volatility of

short-term gas price movements exceeds that of oil, at least as reflected in futures market

trading of the last several years. Indeed, in recent years natural gas has exhibited the highest

volatility of any commodity traded on organized U.S. futures exchanges.19 Not only are gas

values more volatile, they do not always tend to parallel movements in the value of oil. For




                                               13
example, the correlation between the real wellhead values of gas and oil produced in the U.S.

during the past two years (monthly values) is only 38 percent.

       Over the longer time spans relevant to the units included in our data base (which date

between 1938 and 1992) there were other disparities between oil and gas prices. One was a

lack of pipeline technology of the type needed to move large volumes of remote natural gas to

major markets. This condition meant that many natural gas markets were local, whereas oil

markets were national and international. Another was the effect of the Federal Power

Commission’s distortive regime of price controls that held natural gas prices below market

value throughout most of the 1950s through 1970s. Consequently, gas markets developed

differently, as Paul MacAvoy (1983, pp. 78-120) has noted, from most other raw-material and

fuel markets. Until fairly recently, natural gas tended to be accumulated as an unwelcome by-

product in the search for oil, and to be sold at prices not much more than gathering costs.

       Differences in valuing the contribution of leases during secondary versus primary

recovery operations may pose similar difficulties for the working interest owners. The value

of leases that are strategically important to secondary recovery efforts depends very much on

the presumed effectiveness of enhanced recovery techniques. The performance of those

techniques can vary significantly from reservoir to reservoir and can be substantiated only

through actual testing. The relevant tests cannot be performed until the reservoir has been

developed and depleted—several years perhaps after the unit has been in operation.

Consequently, lease owners who hold a relatively large interest in primary production may be

unwilling during equity negotiations to trade a portion of that asset away if the compensation

is to take the form of an expanded interest in secondary recovery.

       In sum, lack of information and differences in expectations may undermine the




                                               14
working interest owners’ ability to trade in assets that are different in kind or quantity and are

highly uncertain in value. Such circumstances would impede the ability of the interests to

write complete unit contracts. They are most likely to occur when there are very skewed

holdings of oil and gas or when production involves both primary and secondary recovery.

       In response, the working interest owners may elect to partition the unit in a way that

isolates differences among tracts and permits them to be negotiated separately. The simplest

example of this occurs when a reservoir is spatially partitioned into separate gas cap and oil

rim participating areas (PAs), based on the preponderance of oil or gas in various parts of the

reservoir.20 Individual sharing formulas are then negotiated for each PA.

       Under these arrangements, each working interest owner is assigned a distinct share in

the operations of the participating area, rather than the unit as a whole. The party whose lease

overlies a relatively large share of the oil, for example, is assigned a relatively large share of

equity in the oil rim PA, and perhaps little or none of the equity in the gas cap PA.

Alternatively, a reservoir may be partitioned across time, as when production efforts are

divided into primary and secondary recovery phases, with each working interest owner

accepting distinct interests in reservoir operations during each of the two phases. Both types

of partition (dual PA and multi-phase recovery) are quite common in the industry because

they reduce the costs of reaching initial agreement on the unit. But they may weaken the

ability of the Unit Operating Agreement to align incentives and hence, maximize the

economic value of the reservoir.

       When the reservoir is partitioned along any dimension, a boundary is created that may

incite competition for resources and for value. The existence of such partitions may render

the unit incomplete and hence, create conflicts of interest that must be managed by the lease




                                                15
owners in order to avoid inefficient, competitive development. We now turn to the two most

common forms of partitioning, dual PA (gas cap and oil rim) units and multi-phase units to

identify where the problems are most severe.

Dual Participating Areas: Gas Cap vs. Oil Rim

       Often, a reservoir will hold a large accumulation of oil with a distinct pocket of

associated gas positioned at the very top of the formation. If individual lease holdings are

distributed unevenly across the boundaries of such a reservoir, certain lease owners may have

a disproportionately large share of the gas concentrated beneath their leases, while other

owners hold leases that are predominantly associated with oil. If the parties are unable to

reach agreement on the relative values of these two resources, they may chose to partition the

unit into dual participating areas. In this case, each member accepts an equity interest in the

oil rim production that is distinct from his interest in the gas cap production. All produced

substances and costs are first allocated between the two participating areas and then assigned

to individual lease owners on the basis of equity shares within the respective PAs. The

problematic aspect is that, when considering a lease owner’s combined stake in the unit as a

whole, production and cost shares for any one member will not necessarily coincide.

       Efficient unit-wide production requires that each member’s share of the oil rim be the

same as that member’s share of the gas cap. Whenever a single reservoir is partitioned

geographically into multiple participating areas, any deviation in equity shares across the

partition will create conflict. For example, members holding greater shares in the oil rim than

in the gas cap would favor actions that promote oil recovery at the expense of gas. This

could, for example, include opportunistic support for projects to re-inject produced gas into

the reservoir, as opposed to sending it to market. It could also include opposition to projects,




                                               16
like construction of gas treatment plants, designed to extract natural gas liquids to be mixed

with oil for pipeline shipment. Similarly, gas owners could promote excessive natural gas

production and early sales that would impair pressure maintenance in the reservoir and reduce

the recovery of oil.

Multi-Phase Units: Primary vs. Secondary Production

       In the case of multi-phase units, the reservoir partition corresponds to the transition

between primary and secondary recovery efforts. A consensus on efficient extraction from the

multi-phase unit requires that each owner hold a uniform share across phases. Otherwise, an

owner who holds a relatively large interest in primary recovery would favor shifting a greater

proportion of extractive effort into the primary phaseperhaps by obstructing efforts to

initiate the transition to secondary recovery methods. Conversely, those members holding

relatively large interests in secondary recovery would favor a shortening of the primary phase,

or perhaps a less intensive primary recovery effort (e.g., wider well spacing).

       In practice, each member’s share typically differs across phases, depending on how

each lease initially is expected to perform during primary and secondary production. Due to

variations in geological conditions within the reservoir, the performance of any lease can vary

significantly across phases.

       Different allocations across phases raise the question of whether the members employ

some alternative contract arrangements to mitigate the potential efficiency losses that would

result from discord. The key provision in this regard appears to be an objective pre-

determination of the events that will trigger the transition from primary to secondary

recovery. When a unit is originally formed, members agree that secondary recovery will be

initiated when reservoir production or alternatively, the gas/oil ratio, reaches a certain level,




                                                17
signifying a critical level of exhaustion of the original oil resource. Gas production tends to

rise, relative to oil, as the reservoir is depleted. The total production or gas/oil ratio triggers

are objective and based upon mutually agreed engineering assessments. Moreover, the nature

of the trigger tends to automatically defeat any subsequent efforts to opportunistically

manipulate recovery efforts in either phase.

         For example, the incentive of an owner with a relatively large share of secondary

production to minimize primary production is tempered because such action would, under the

agreed transition criterion, only extend the primary recovery period. As primary production is

reduced, the anticipated rise in the gas/oil ratio is delayed, and this condition postpones the

transition to secondary recovery. Thus, reliance on this type of fixed transition rule can be

understood as a contractual device designed to restore (approximately) the incentive

compatibility that would otherwise be destroyed by creation of the partition.21 If the partition

did not exist, there would be no need or value in pre-committing to a fixed transition rule.

Through this contractual mechanism, the lease owners can align incentives for cooperative

behavior through the productive life of the reservoir. Notice, however, that it is still

imperative even with the trigger that within each recovery phase each member holds a single

equity share. If not, disputes would persist regarding the optimal plan for recovery within the

phase.

IV. Empirical Analysis.

         A. Evidence from 60 Unit Operating Agreements

         Our examination of the structure of Unit Operating Agreements suggests that the

following key features would tend to be observed in practice:

         a). A complete Unit Operating Agreement will have a profit-sharing formula that




                                                 18
assigns costs and production in an equal manner for each of the parties to the agreement.

       b). The partitioning of a unit between production phases (multi-phase) and between

oil rim and gas cap (dual PAs) potentially results in incomplete contracts. Proportionate cost

and production shares for the unit as a whole are less likely to be observed in these units than

in single-phase, single PA units.

       c). Dual PA units will have different individual cost and production shares for the unit

as a whole, and hence, be incomplete.

       d) If multi-phase units have individual cost and production shares that are equal at any

point in time, the use of a fixed transition rule from phase to phase will allow the unit contract

to be complete.

       e). Complete units will have routine production histories with little or no evidence of

discord and rent dissipation.

       f). Incomplete units will have discord among the operating interests and rent

dissipation will be observed. Such behavior will be most pronounced for dual PA units.

       The empirical investigation begins with an examination of 60 unit operating

agreements from oil and gas reservoirs in Alaska, Alberta, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma,

New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming. Unit Operating Agreements often are placed on file with

the state regulatory agency, such as with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Other files

were made available to us from company records. These operating agreements include many

important reservoirs in the United States and Canada, and the reservoirs represented range

from strictly oil or gas to both oil and gas and from relatively simple geological formations to

more complex ones. Moreover, there is considerable variation in the number of parties

involved in the units, from two working interests in the Cole Creek, Wyoming Unit to 113




                                               19
working interest owners in the Empire Abo, New Mexico Unit.22 The unit operating

agreements span a wide time range, including the July 3, 1934 Fourbear, Wyoming Unit and

more recent units, such as the May 1, 1992 Rocky Ford Upper Mannville F Pool Oil Unit,

Alberta. Hence, we believe that the empirical record from this diverse sample of operating

agreements is reflective of the general pattern of unitization contracting.

       Other studies indicate that regulatory environments across states, including that of the

federal government, affect the incidence of unit agreements. Further, the size of company

holdings and whether or not companies are repeat contractors across many reservoirs

influence their willingness to agree to unitization.23 Our examination focuses on a different

question. Once parties write a unitization contract, will that contract have the characteristics

that are necessary to successfully align incentives, and how do geological/informational issues

affect the parties’ ability to write such contracts?

                                           Table 1 here

       Table 1 summarizes key aspects of the unit operating agreements: whether and how

each reservoir has been partitioned, whether members’ cost and production shares are

equalized at each point in time, and whether (in the case of multi-phase units) a trigger was

adopted ex ante to balance and control the transition from primary to secondary recovery. As

shown in the table, 78 percent (47 of 60) of the Unit Operating Agreements include the

provisions that we have identified as being essential for incentive compatibility in a

unitization agreement. This finding underscores the importance of aligning the interests of the

parties behind a production plan that maximizes the value of the reservoir over the life of the

contract. At the same time, 22 percent of the sample do not have the characteristics required

to ensure incentive compatibility throughout the life of the unit. We now turn to a closer




                                                 20
examination of the individual units to see if the potential bargaining problems associated with

formation of the various types of units help explain the observed contracting patterns.

       In Table 1, 27 of the 60 cases (45 percent) represent simple, unpartitioned units. Of

the 33 partitioned units, 19 are multi-phase units and 11 are dual PA units. In addition, 3 units

are hybrids, being partitioned into multiple production phases and separate gas/oil

participating areas. We see signficant differences between these categories.

       First, among the group of unpartitioned units, all 27 cases satisfy the equal shares

criterion for incentive compatibility. In each of these cases, where the geological formation

and development concepts were straightforward enough to allow the owners to pool and trade

all assets within a single category, the theoretical prescription of equal cost and production

shares throughout the unit was followed invariably.

       The 19 multi-phase units also satisfy the equal shares criterion during each production

phase. By design, these units were structured to permit variation in the owners’ shares

between phases, and in all but one case the units include an ex ante trigger to balance and

control the transition between phases.24 Of the 11 dual PA units, however, only one case

satisfies the equal shares criterion. These units represent reservoirs where the positioning of

individual lease holdings was skewed enough to produce an unbalanced distribution of oil and

gas among owners, and where the marketability of oil and gas resources differed so much in

kind that the owners could not establish common terms of trade. Only in these conditions

would we expect the difficulties in bargaining over initial shares to loom so large that the

owners would adopt a contractual framework that actually jeopardizes the incentive

compatibility of the agreement.25

       We have finally the 3 hybrid cases that involve both spatial and temporal partitions of




                                               21
the unit. These units incorporate contractual features from both types: they all include ex

ante triggers to balance and control the transition between primary and secondary recovery

phases, but also they all involve skewed and disparate gas and oil holdings that the owners

were unable to pool among themselves. These hybrid units do not have the requisite sharing

requirements for incentive compatibility, and hence, closely resemble the dual PA units in our

sample.26

       Why would the parties write a contract with provisions that create potential conflicts

of interest? Previous research on unitization contracting has shown how difficult it is to

reach agreement in general to unitize oil fields. Wiggins and Libecap (1985) showed that

negotiations took from four to nine years in the seven units they examined. Further, in five of

those seven, only partial units were formed because not all parties could agree on the sharing

formula. This general contracting problem explains why unitization overall is less common in

the United States than one would expect, considering only the benefits of agreement and not

the corresponding negotiating costs. The evidence presented here reveals more precisely the

kinds of problems that oil and gas firms face in negotiating unit contracts.

       The analytical framework suggests that negotiating parties will have greatest

difficulty reaching agreement on lease values and, hence, unit shares when holdings of oil and

gas are highly skewed. Thus, we observe units partitioned into dual participating areas when

firms have concentrated holdings of oil or gas. To illustrate we outline the owners’ shares in

the oil rim and gas cap PAs in the Prudhoe Bay Unit of Alaska in Table 2.

                                          Table 2 here

       When ownership across firms is concentrated in oil or gas, formation of a complete

unit will require that large volumes of oil be traded for gas among firms. It is hard to




                                               22
negotiate that trade if there is uncertainty about the value of gas production. Uncertainty in

valuing skewed holdings in gas and oil leads to bargaining disputes in arriving on a single

share formula. As a fall back, firms can more easily agree on the valuation of their holdings

within more homogeneous sections of the reservoir. The result, however, is the creation of

dual participating areas with distinct share formulas. Although such units agreements are not

complete, the parties may chose those contracts over the alternative of no unit agreement.

       The reason that multiple phases appear not to be a serious obstacle to negotiating share

formulas is that the firms are dealing primarily with differences in quantity (between primary

and secondary production) not kind (oil and gas). Accordingly, there is less uncertainty

involved in estimating and agreeing to the value of unit shares within each phase, especially

when phases are inaugurated by a pre-set and uncontroversial trigger. The parties have

another important incentive to agree to collective action beyond solving the common-pool

problem. Absent a unit to coordinate injection and production, effective reservoir-wide

secondary recovery typically is not possible, and the economic life of the reservoir will be

drastically shortened.

       Another contributing factor to contracting success in multi-phase versus dual PA units

could be that individual share differences across phases typically are smaller than differences

across oil and gas holdings in gas cap reservoirs. We hypothesize that when firms have

similar shares across partitions it will be easier for them to reach agreement on a unit-wide

profit sharing formula. The reasoning is that they will have less at stake in moving from one

partition (participating area or phase) to another and hence, be more flexible in unit

negotiations.

       To empirically examine this issue, we calculated the absolute difference in each firm’s




                                               23
share across partitions in dual oil and gas PAs and multi-phase units. We have data on

individual firm shares in each phase or participating area, as relevant, for nine dual PA units

and for five multi-phase units.27 The mean of the absolute share differences is 1.04 percentage

points (S.D. 1.75) for 129 firms in the five multi-phase units and over three times greater at

3.41 percentage points (S.D. 9.60) for 157 firms in the nine dual PA units. A t-test of the

difference in the means allows for rejection of the hypothesis that the means are the same.28

Differences in the productive value of leases within the unit across phases are smaller than are

the differences due to the geological concentration of oil and gas deposits when there are gas

caps.

        B. The Case of Prudhoe Bay.

        If we are correct that equal individual cost and production shares effectively align

incentives, then units with those characteristics should have comparatively routine, non-

controversial production histories. Tests of this claim are difficult to perform because of the

limited data available. Disputes within private unit operating agreements generally are

resolved through mediation with no public record. Only the most hotly contested agreements

will involve litigation and/or appeals to state regulatory agencies.

        Our search of court cases involving the units included in Table 1 provides a lengthy

record for the Prudhoe Bay Unit (PBU) in Alaska.29 Examination of regulatory records at the

Texas Railroad Commission and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission provides little

indication of protracted conflict among the working interests within other units in these two

states. By contrast, the public records of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission

(AOGCC) clearly show that the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement has had a history of

intense and costly disputes among the working interests.




                                               24
       The Prudhoe Bay field was discovered in early 1968. Unit negotiations began in

1969, and the first unit agreement was not completed until 1977.30 It has been revised several

times since then.31 One serious problem facing the negotiators was how to value the natural

gas in the gas cap, where ARCO and Exxon’s leases happened to be clustered. Most of the oil

was located in a zone below the gas cap, in a region referred to as the oil rim where BP’s

leases were concentrated. Given the remote position of the field and the absence of a natural

gas pipeline, it was not clear whether gas would be sold in large amounts or kept in the

reservoir to maintain natural subsurface pressure to assist in oil extraction.

       Since the economic value of the gas resources was highly speculative, the parties

sought in vain for a formula that would allocate to each party a fixed share of all

hydrocarbons produced from the reservoir.32 After eight years of bargaining, an agreement

was reached among the lease owners that designated two separate participating areas within

the reservoir: each lease owner was allocated a fixed share of oil rim production and costs and

a separate and numerically different share of gas cap production and costs. As Table 2 shows

BP, for example, was allocated 51 percent of production from the oil rim, but only 14 percent

of production from the gas cap.33

       Under this arrangement, gas cap owners became residual claimants to gas cap profits

and oil rim owners became residual claimants to oil rim profits. None of the parties was made

a residual claimant to the unit-wide profits. The formation of dual, competing participating

areas within the single reservoir brought conflicts of interest, opportunistic behavior, and an

intense battle over how the reservoir would be developed.

       At the heart of the conflicts has been the inevitable competition between gas and oil

lease owners. From the outset, the lease owners have been aware that the sale and removal of




                                                25
gas from the reservoir would impair ultimate recovery of oil because of the consequent loss of

reservoir pressure. That cost falls disproportionately on BP (as majority owner of the oil rim).

On the other hand, any gas re-injection program designed to maintain reservoir pressure or

otherwise enhance the recovery of oil has the potential to divert marketable gas that could

perhaps be sold elsewhere, and this burden falls disproportionately on ARCO and Exxon.

These two companies have favored processing the gas that was produced in association with

oil to extract as much natural gas liquids (NGL) as could be blended with oil for shipment and

sale down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. BP has favored processing the gas to produce miscible

injectant (MI), which could be re-injected into the reservoir to enhance the recovery of

remaining oil.34

       The ensuing competition among the respective firms illustrates the costs incurred

when interests are not aligned. For example, on February 9, 1995 ARCO (acting as operator

of facilities in the eastern region of the reservoir) unilaterally increased the production of

NGLs for shipment down the pipeline. To offset ARCO’s initiative, BP (acting as operator of

facilities in the western region of the reservoir) unilaterally restricted the volume of NGLs

that it blended with the stream of crude oil entering the pipeline, thereby leaving the total

shipment of NGLs from the Prudhoe Bay Unit unchanged. In retaliation, ARCO then

increased its own blending of NGLs into the crude oil stream, but BP again took offsetting

action. In addition, BP filed a claim in the Alaska Superior Court that would permit the

company to take its share of reservoir production in kind, thereby preventing ARCO from

using that oil as a vehicle for increased blending of NGLs. BP also filed a request with the

Alaska Public Utilities Commission for permission to construct a new pipeline within the

reservoir to segregate and convey its share of the oil for shipment off the Unit, prior to any




                                                26
further blending of NGLs. The pipeline was not necessary to develop the unit, only to protect

BP’s interests.35

        It is obvious that none of these actions was designed to increase the economic value of

the PBU as a whole; indeed, these actions by the various parties in their own private interest

have served to dissipate the rents of the unit. It was not the depletion of reserves that set

Prudhoe crude oil production into decline in 1988. Rather the turning point in the life of the

reservoir was caused by lack of agreement on who would pay for facilities to handle the

growing fraction of gas that was produced in association with oil as the reservoir matured. 36

        Although the parties have disagreed publicly about the ultimate cost of the contested

plan to sell rather than re-inject the produced NGL, the potential impact is apparently

significant. By BP’s estimate, maximum re-injection of the gas would boost ultimate

recovery of liquid hydrocarbons by some 150-200 million barrels. In BP’s view, ARCO’s

proposal to divert a portion of the injected gas for sale as NGL would decrease ultimate

recovery by 60-80 million barrels.37 To put these numbers in perspective, consider that any

single oil reservoir with as much as 100 million barrels of recoverable reserves is considered a

“giant” relative to the size distribution of all U.S. oil and gas reservoirs.38

V. Concluding Remarks.

        In this paper we have extended the theory and empirical analysis of unitization

agreements that address common-pool losses in oil and gas production. We have isolated the

key elements of the Unit Operating Agreement that are necessary to align incentives among

the working interests in order to maximize the economic value of the reservoir. We also

identified the geological/informational conditions that could impede agreement on complete

unit contracts and lead instead to the writing of different contracts where production and



                                                 27
investment incentives would differ among firms. Such differences would lead potentially to

conflicts and behavior that dissipated reservoir rents. Evidence from 60 unit operating

agreements has been used to examine implications of the theoretical framework. Additionally,

the case study of the Prudhoe Bay Unit illustrates the discord and waste that occurs when the

interests of the parties are not aligned.

        The analysis highlights the importance of achieving incentive compatibility in drafting

unit contracts and the corresponding self-enforcement of cooperative group behavior such

contracts can bring. Agreeing upon a profit-sharing formula that binds the interests of the

parties over the long term, however, is not always possible. This condition appears to be

particularly evident when holdings on the reservoir are heterogeneous with respect to kind—

when some parties own primarily oil and others primarily gas. Disagreement on the terms of

exchange of gas for oil typically result in the partitioning of the reservoir into distinct and

competing participating areas with separate production and cost allocation formulas. In

effect, the parties become separate groups of share holders in segments of the same oil and

gas reservoir. The potential for wasteful competition is clear.

        Firms write unit contracts with dual PAs when there are very skewed holdings of oil

and gas within a reservoir and when agreement on a single participating area and profit-

sharing formula is not forthcoming. State regulatory agencies then are faced with a trade

off—endorsing a unit agreement with a dual PA in order to facilitate earlier, albeit

incomplete, cooperative development of the reservoir or forcing the parties to continue to

negotiate until a complete unit agreement can be written. Hence, regulatory agencies must

weigh the costs of conflicting incentives and associated rent dissipation with dual PA units

against the costs of delaying the formation of a unit until a complete, incentive-compatible




                                                28
agreement can be written. This latter case might mean delaying reservoir development and

production. The outcome of balancing of these costs likely will vary from case to case.

Nevertheless, this paper has made clear for the first time the contracting problems and costs

that are linked to dual PA units. This information can be of use in the regulatory process.

       Our analysis has also shown that by contrast, multi-phase units do not typically have

the same incentive problems found in dual PA units. When production is partitioned across

primary and secondary recovery periods, with different sharing formulas during each period,

Unit Operating Agreements still have profit-sharing arrangements for the whole unit during

each period. The transition from one phase to the next is managed through the use of a preset

contractual trigger, and there is little apparent effort by the owners to opportunistically

maneuver across phases. In effect, the parties are share holders in the entire reservoir during

each phase, although their shares may differ by small amounts from one phase to another.

       The theory and analysis presented here provides new insights into the process of

unitization and the writing of oil and gas contracts. We are not arguing that cooperative

agreements for other empirical settings, such as crop share contracts, have the same profit-

sharing characteristics we have described here.39 In particular, the geological/informational

aspects responsible for the partitioning units in our sample may be unique to the oil and gas

context. Rather, our examination of oil and gas unitization contracts illustrates the important

role that the content of contracts can make in aligning incentives ex ante to reduce

enforcement costs and promote wealth maximizing behavior ex post. Further, the analysis of

unitization contracting points out the dangers of partitioning heterogeneous parties into more

homogeneous subgroups during contract negotiation. Although, such clustering may facilitate

agreement within the subgroup, the agreed-to provisions may not be incentive compatible for




                                                29
the entire group. Hence, the overall contract will be incomplete and faced with compliance

problems.

     There is a considerable literature on the common-pool problem in oil and gas production
and efforts to counter it. See, for example McDonald (1971), Libecap and Wiggins (1984),
Weaver (1986), Smith (1987), Lueck and Schenewerk (1996), and Libecap 1998).

2
    Units generally apply to common reservoirs of hydrocarbons. An oil and gas “field” may
have multiple, separate reservoirs from different geologic formations. Typically, separate
reservoirs have separate units because there is no common-pool problem across them.

    Oil Weekly (April 13, 1942; May 3, 1943). The Oil and Gas Journal (December 7, 1964)
predicted that unitization would raise oil recovery by 130 million barrels on the Fairway field.
The increase is valued at over $200 million using prices compiled by Manthy (1978: 111).
See also, McDonald (1971: 24-5, 237). The benefits of unitization are emphasized in unit
documents. For example, see Anshutz East, Wyoming Unit Agreement, December 1982, on
file with the authors.

6
    Unit Operating Agreements typically allocate volumes of produced substances, as opposed
to revenue, among the parties to the contract. A fixed allocation of unit revenues would
require the joint marketing of output, which may raise anti-trust issues that companies would
be anxious to avoid.

Institute, third edition, January 1970.

    There may be multiple secondary phases, and the type of injection--water, natural gas,
carbon dioxide, depends upon the nature of the reservoir.

    Exxon, for example, has recently applied as operator of the Point Thomson Unit in Alaska
for the state’s permission to add one of its adjacent leases to the unit, thereby raising its
working interest while proportionately decreasing the interests of other owners. See
Petroleum News Alaska (September 28, 1998: 3).

11
     The problem of asset specificity arises because significant investments will be made in the
unit that have value or most value only under an operational unit. Hence, those parties who
make the investment are vulnerable to holdups by the other parties to capture some of the
rents.

12
      As described by Klein and Murphy (1997: 417), “the self-enforcing range measures the
extent to which market conditions can change, thereby altering the gains to one or the other
party from nonperformance, without precipitating nonperformance.”

13
     The common-pool problem would be circumvented if landowners agreed to coordinate
production. In cases where surface ownership is large enough to cover all or nearly all of an
entire reservoir, unitized production is routine. Where surface holdings are more fragmented,
the problem increases. For discussion, see Libecap and Wiggins (1984).

14
     For general discussion of the common-pool problem using fisheries to illustrate the issues,
see Gordon (1954) and Cheung (1970). Smith (1987) focuses on the problems of oil
production from a common pool.

15
      Operating firms typically lease the mineral rights from surface land owners, and they often
have multiple sectors. For discussion of the proportionate allocation of production and costs,
see Plan of Unitization, East Binger (Marchand) Unit, Caddo County, Oklahoma, Article 17.

      There may be differences in opinion regarding geological conditions or technical
capabilities that affect the production plan. The single-equity provision, however, means that
such differences will not arise due to strategic behavior.

     Partitions within units also may be made to segregate highly permeable sections of a
reservoir (where the underlying resources will be easier to recover in primary recovery) from
sections that have low permeability but are useful for secondary recovery.

     The Burke Ranch Unit Operating Agreement does not indicate an explicit trigger, although
it may have been part of an attachment that is missing from our files.

25
     Examination of the production and cost sharing rules for the Clive D-3 Unit in Alberta
illustrates the incentive problem found in dual PA units. Effectively, the oil interests share in
the oil reserves and costs and the gas interests share in the gas reserves and costs as if these
were distinct entities within the unit. But of course, they are not. There are cost externalities
from gas production for oil producers and vice versa. Under this arrangement, the parties will


                                                33
have to concern themselves with competing maximization problems and strategies, rather than
the value of the unit as a whole. Our subsequent discussion of the Prudhoe Bay Unit indicates
where this may lead.

26
     To formally test for the statistical relationship between the frequency of observing an equal
cost/production allocation rule and the frequency of observing dual PA units, we created a
2x2 contingency table. A chi-square statistic with 1 degree of freedom was constructed with a
calculated value, χ2 = 54.53. With a critical value of 6.64, we can reject the null hypothesis
that observing the equal equity allocation rule and observing a dual PA unit are independent at
the 99% confidence level. This result supports our argument that dual PA units are unlikely
to have equal cost and production sharing rules. For discussion of our approach, see
Dudewicz and Mishra (1988: 533).

27
      The nine dual PA units are Prudhoe Bay, Virginia Hills Belloy, Namao Blairmore, Bonnie
Glen, Minnehick, Harmattan-Elkton, Harmattan-East, Rocky Ford, and Clive D-3. The five
multi-phase units are Graham Deese, Wildhorse, Grass Creek Curtis, County Line, and
Collums.


28
      The t-statistic is –3.03 (assuming unequal variances) and the critical value is 1.97. The
results are similar if Prudhoe Bay is dropped from the analysis. The mean share difference is
2.98 with a standard deviation of 9.12. The mean share difference for the dual PA units is still
about three times that of the multi-phase units.

     A useful description of the Prudhoe Bay reservoir is found in Szabo and Meyers (1993).

     A letter of intent to unitize was signed by the principal lease owners in August 1969.
Negotiations continued on and off until final agreement was reached in April 1977.

31
     At least seven significant amendments to the Prudhoe Bay Unit Operating Agreement were
adopted in the 1980s and 1990s largely to address disputes over natural gas and oil valuation,
investment, and production. At times, outside arbitrators, the courts, and various state


                                                 34
