                                             ABSTRACT

Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) examined commodity futures returns over the period July 1959 to
December 2004 based on an equally-weighted index. They found that fully collateralized commodity
futures had historically offered the same return and Sharpe ratio as U.S. equities, but were negatively
correlated with the return on stocks and bonds. Reviewing these results ten years later, we find that
our conclusions largely hold up out-of-sample. The in- and out-of-sample average commodity risk
premiums are not significantly different, nor is the cross-sectional relationship between average returns
and the basis. Correlations among commodities and commodity correlations with other assets experienced
a temporary increase during the financial crisis which is in line with historical experience of variation
of these correlations over the business cycle.

1.   Introduction

Commodity futures play an important role in the global economy, allowing companies to insure the
future value of their outputs or inputs. This future price risk is shifted to investors who receive
compensation for bearing it. Gorton and Rouwenhorst [GR] (2006) examined commodity futures
returns over the period July 1959 to December 2004 based on an equally-weighted (EW) index.
This is the longest data set of commodity futures. They found that a portfolio of fully collateralized
commodity futures offered the same average return and Sharpe ratio as U.S. equities, and,
depending on the investment horizon, had low or negative correlation with equity returns and
bond returns. Distinct from stocks and bonds, commodities have a positive correlation with
inflation. Since the writing of that paper, ten years’ worth of new data has accumulated, which
presents an opportunity to examine whether the basic results reported in the original paper have
changed. The out-of sample period includes the global economic expansion led by the
industrialization of China, a housing boom and bust in the United States, the largest financial crisis
since the Great Depression, followed by a monetary policy stimulus response which has driven
interest rates towards zero. It is against this rich background that collateralized commodity futures
gradually gained acceptance as an asset class. The decade has also seen an increased interest by
academics in questions concerning the behavior of commodity prices, and the effect of changes in
the composition of participants in commodity futures markets (see Rouwenhorst and Tang (2012)
and Cheng and Xiong (2014) for recent surveys).

While acknowledging that ten years of data is not always sufficient to draw definitive conclusions,
we find that most of our original findings hold up out-of-sample. Between 2005 and 2014, the
average risk premium of the EW index was 3.67% per annum, which is somewhat lower but not
significantly different from the in-sample average of 5.23% during the 1959-2004 period. The out-
of-sample ten year risk premium is close to the median of the distribution of all possible ten year
blocks for the period July 1959 to December 2004, with 49% of the decades showing a risk
premium lower than 3.67% and 51% yielding a higher risk premium. The finding of a positive risk
premium is consistent with the fundamental economic function of futures markets.

The correlation among commodities and the co-movement of commodities with other asset classes
has varied during the out-of-sample period, and increased substantially during the financial crisis.
Experience from previous episodes of economic turmoil shows that these correlation increases
tend to be temporary in nature, and it appears that they have since returned close to their long-
term sample averages. Correlations between commodities and inflation have been positive in the
past decade, albeit in a low inflation environment. Finally, the futures basis, an indicator of scarcity
of physical inventories, has been reliably correlated with the cross-section of futures risk
premiums.

Exchange traded futures markets have experienced substantial growth during the out-of sample
period. Despite the temporary contraction during the financial crisis, the open interest for the
average commodity has more than doubled since 2004. At the same time, the composition of
market participation has stayed relatively stable.
                                                                                                    2


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains an update of the equally-
weighted commodity index of the 2006 paper, and compares the risk premium over the past decade
to its long-term average since 1959. Section 3 examines the cross-section of commodity risk
premiums to the basis. In section 4 we examine the correlations among commodities and the
correlation of commodities with stocks, bonds and inflation. The fifth section analyzes the growth of
commodity markets since 2004. Section 6 concludes.

2.   Historical Returns and the Risk Premium on Commodity Futures

2.1 Commodity spot returns versus futures returns

The source of value to an investor in commodity futures is the risk premium received for bearing
future spot price risk. Consequently, providers of insurance in the futures market are concerned
with deviations from the expected future spot price, and futures prices embed these expectations
(see Black (1976)). Futures prices can increase during a period when spot prices decline if the spot
price declines are anticipated. Unexpected fluctuations in spot prices affect spot and futures prices
alike. Spot prices are different from futures prices for these reasons.

portfolio of collateralized commodity futures that is monthly rebalanced.1 The bottom time-series
represents the corresponding index of spot prices. Both series are normalized to 100 in 1959/7 and
are presented on a log scale. The shaded area represents the out of sample period 2005/1 –
2014/12. The advantage of a log scale is that is facilitates a direct comparison of the slopes across
time and indices to measure return differentials. For example the narrowing of the distance

(2006).

between the lines in the out-of sample period illustrates that spot returns have exceed futures
returns over the past decade.

To put the recent decade into perspective we examine the performance of the equally-weighted
spot and futures indices in prior decades back to 1959. Table 1 shows the returns to commodity
futures and the equally-weighted spot return for different sub-periods.

In the most recent decade:

      Inflation-adjusted collateralized commodity futures returns have been relatively low, and
       spot price growth relatively high.
      Spot returns have exceeded collateralized futures returns.

                                     Nominal                    Inflation-Adjusted

       1/1995 to 12/2004          8.55%              8.20%             6.13%           5.78%
       1/1985 to 12/1994          9.69%              6.66%             6.15%           3.13%
       1/1975 to 12/1984          9.01%              7.08%             1.91%           -0.02%
       1/1965 to 12/1974          19.23%             13.18%            14.10%          8.07%
       7/1959 to 12/1964          3.88%              2.98%             2.62%           1.71%
Note: The table gives the (arithmetic) average annual return on an equally-weighted portfolio of
collateralized commodity futures that is monthly rebalanced, as well as the corresponding index of spot
prices. The monthly average return is annualized by multiplying by 12.

The high average spot returns relative to futures returns over the past decade suggests that high
spot price growth was partially anticipated by investors markets when setting futures prices. This
is consistent with a widespread belief in the markets of growing demand for commodities in Asia,
especially before the financial crisis.

Note that the comparison does not imply that holders of physical commodities fared better than
futures investors. Unlike the collateralized futures return, the spot price return does not
correspond to a feasible investment strategy in physical commodities, which requires calculating
spot returns net of the cost of carry (e.g. storage costs, insurance, etc.). Figure 2 plots the front
month futures price of crude oil (a proxy for the spot price) against the total return (including
collateral) on rolling oil futures during the period 2006-2011 which includes the financial crisis.
The figure illustrates the dramatic rise and decline of the price of WTI crude oil during this period.
A second striking feature of the graph is that spot and rolling futures tracked closely from 2006 to
2008, but diverged subsequently. A common way to describe this shift is that “the roll yield turned
negative” in 2008, or that “the oil market moved into contango”. While both statements are true,
they are not always helpful to investors in trying to understand why their futures investment in oil
did not seem to benefit from the spot price appreciation of oil since 2008. A different perspective is
provided by the realization that the spot price appreciation is not a feasible investment return,
because the holder of physical oil would have incurred storage costs which are not subtracted in
                                                                                                               4


figure 2. A fair comparison of collateralized futures to spot returns net of carrying cost would
indeed show that both tracked closely following 2008. This same comparison would illustrate that
investors in oil futures did much better than spot investors on a net basis between 2006 and 2008.

2.2 The Influence of Rebalancing

Conclusions about the performance of an (commodity) index are sensitive to the methodology of
index construction. Periodic changes of index weights by rebalancing will cause the return to a
rebalanced index to deviate from a buy-and-hold index that does not rebalance. As pointed out in
GR (2006), outperformance can be positive or negative depending on whether the “trading
strategy” embedded in the rebalancing rule is profitable or not. Moreover, rebalancing can affect a
spot index different from a futures index due to differences in the time-series properties of spot and
futures prices. For example, commodity spot prices often exhibit predictable mean reversion due to
seasonality (heating season, crop cycles, etc.) that is anticipated by futures investors and therefore
not a feature of futures prices.

Table 2 shows the average annualized returns for the full sample between 1959 and 2014, broken
down by in-sample (1959-2004) and out-of-sample (2005-2014) periods. The table compares
average spot and futures returns of the monthly rebalanced EW index to indices that are rebalanced
annually or not rebalanced (i.e. buy-and-hold).

In addition to our discussion of Table 1, we note that:

       Average futures returns have been lower in the out-of-sample period compared to the
        period prior to 2004. This could be due to a lower risk premium, lower collateral (T-bill)
        returns, or both.
                                                                                               5


      Monthly rebalancing lowers the performance of our futures index relative to permutations
       of the index that are not (or less frequently) rebalanced.
      Unlike futures indices, the performance of spot indices is greatly enhanced by more
       frequent rebalancing
      The opposite impact of rebalancing on average returns is consistent with short-term
       momentum in futures returns and predictable mean-reversion of commodity spot prices.

Subject to the important caveat that 10 years of data is generally insufficient to make definitive
statements about the statistical significance of risk premiums, we note that:

    Risk premiums to stocks, bonds and commodities have all been positive during the past decade.
     In a statistical sense, excess returns on bonds have deviated the most from their average
     historical risk premium (t-stat = 1.2), followed by commodities (t-stat = -0.35) and stocks (t-stat
     = 0.28).
    The lower out-of-sample average return for commodity futures was in large part due to lower
     collateral returns over the past decade. The average historical risk premium of 3.67% was
     about 1.5% lower than its historical mean over the 1959-2004 period.
    In a statistical sense the out-of-sample risk premiums on all asset classes (stocks bonds, and
     commodities) have been insignificantly different from their historical in-sample averages (and
     also from zero from that matter).
    All markets have experienced an increase in volatility (standard deviation of returns), with the
     increase significant in a statistical sense for Commodities and Bonds.

3.    The Behavior of the Basis: Link to the Fundamentals of Scarcity

The basis refers to the difference between the current spot price and the futures price.2 It is also
sometimes called backwardation or the roll yield. The basis (and backwardation) can be observed
on a trader’s futures screen, and is distinct from normal backwardation which refers to difference
between the futures price and the expected future spot price (i.e. the expected risk premium, which
is unobservable).

Several papers have linked the basis (backwardation) to the risk premium (normal
backwardation).3 One suggested logic behind the relationship is that the basis is a measure of the
scarcity of a commodity. Scarcity leads to price volatility, which is the risk that is transferred
(insured) through commodity futures markets. When physical inventories of a commodity are high,
and the risk of a shortage or stock-out is low, futures prices will trade at a premium to spot prices
(contango). However, with the threat of a shortage, the spot commodity price will be bid up relative
to the futures price to secure supply by those who use the commodity as an input in the productive
process. If this convenience premium becomes large enough, and exceeds the full cost of storage,
the futures curve will become inverted (backwardation). Scarcity is the exception rather than the
rule, as can be seen in figure 4, which plots the percentage of backwardated commodities in the
equally-weighted index since 1959.

The figure illustrates that:


2 Basis is calculated as the slope of the futures curve. If F1 is the futures price of the front contract, and F2 is
the futures price of the next contract, the basis is calculated as [(F 1−F2)/F1] × 365/(T2−T1), where T1 and T2
refer to the time (in days) to expiration of the two contracts.
3 See, for example, Fama and French (1987), Erb and Harvey (2006). This literature is surveyed by

Rouwenhorst and Tang (2012).

      In the majority of months since 1959 the median commodity has been in contango. For this
       reason, an upward sloping futures curve is considered a “normal curve.”
      Predominance of contango does not preclude a positive risk premium, i.e. normal
       backwardation.
      The proportion of commodities in backwardation dropped from an average of 37% per
       month to 26% post 2004 in part due to a decline during the financial crisis.

The predictability of the risk premium by the basis is more robust in the cross-section of futures
returns than in the time-series. Figure 5 shows that using the percentage of commodities as a
market timing signal for the market is relatively weak.
                                                                                                         9


 By contrast, cross-sectional predictability is stronger: if variation in the basis reflects differences in
 required risk premiums, then a trading strategy that selects commodities according to the size of its
 basis would make positive profits in expectation.4 At the end of each month, index commodities are
 ranked according to their basis and divided into two portfolios, each containing half of the
 commodities in the equally weighted index. Table 4 shows the in- and out-of-sample results from
 the original paper.

 The table suggests that the link between fundamentals and expected returns has been stable over
 time:
     Out-of-sample performance of the high versus low basis strategy has been very similar to
        the in-sample performance, and the spread continues to be wide (about 10% per annum).
     The hit ratio (% months with positive returns) is stable at just below 60%.

4.   Correlations of Commodities with Stocks, Bonds, and Inflation

4.1 Commodities and Inflation

In the original GR study, an equally-weighted commodity futures index exhibited positive inflation
correlations while stocks and bonds had low to negative correlations with inflation. These
correlations were more pronounced at longer horizons. Over the past decade inflation has been
very low, and the out-of-sample data provide little information about the behavior of asset classes
in an inflationary environment. Table 5 provides a recap of these results and an update through
2014, with the exception of the 5-year correlation with is not precisely estimated for the out-of-
sample period.

Note: Correlations are based on overlapping monthly returns data.

The table shows that the out-of-sample correlations with inflation have been somewhat higher for
both commodities and equities during the out-of-sample period, albeit in a decade of a low inflation
environment.

4.2 Commodities and Diversification

Unlike the inflation correlations, the correlation of commodities with equities has deviated from its
historical average during the out-of-sample period. The summary statistics are in Table 6:

        Commodity-equity correlations that were negative during the period up to 2004 turned
         positive and above 0.5 during the 2005-2014 period
        By contrast the correlation between commodities and bonds has been more stable, and the
         additional decade of data had little effect on the estimated correlation.

Some observers have linked the increase of the stock-commodity correlation to the
“financialization”5 of commodity futures markets. While this term has not been precisely defined, it
attributes changes in the behavior of commodity prices to the increased participation of financial
investors in commodity futures markets. Financialization, it is argued, has also contributed to an

increase in correlations among commodities (i.e. corn versus natural gas). If the average pairwise
correlation among individual commodities were to go up, a portfolio of commodities would benefit
less from natural diversification.

Figure 6 summarizes the average correlation of individual commodity returns with our equally-
weighted index. With the exception of the Animal Products sector, out of sample correlations have
exceeded the correlations prior to 2005. Soft commodities have experienced the largest increase
among all sectors.

In the next section we examine the average pairwise commodity correlations, which appear to be at
the heart of the financialization debate.

5.   Investor Interest in Commodity Futures Markets

The increased interest of financial investors and the volatility of commodity prices over the past
decade have fueled the debate on the influence of speculative capital on commodity futures prices.6
The category of index investors (investors taking a long exposure to commodity futures via an
index of futures) has received special scrutiny by policy makers.7 The extent to which such
financialization has influenced prices has been debated.

In principle, there are several ways in which speculative capital could influence the properties of
returns:

     1. Risk premium: to the extent that index investment represents a new source of (long) futures
        market participation, this increase in the supply of price insurance can lower the price paid
        by hedgers to obtain protection. To the extent that index investments are merely a new
        mechanism for financial intermediaries to lay off their producer hedging book in the futures
        market, index investment would simply displace the hedging by these intermediaries with
        little effect on the price of insurance. Because non-index speculative investment in
        commodity futures can be either long or short, its effect on the risk premium is ambiguous.

     2. Return correlations: As in other asset markets, large investment flows can put pressure on
        prices.8 If financial investors would become the marginal investor in commodities markets
        and trade simultaneously in various markets (through baskets, or index trades) their
        sentiment could increase the co-movement of prices relative to fundamentals.

5.1 Investor flows

Inflow of investment capital by institutional investors, money managers, and other speculators has
to be evaluated against changes in the size of the overall market. The analysis is complicated by a

paucity of data. First, a large fraction of commodity trading takes place over-the-counter. The Bank
for International Settlements conducts a bi-annual survey of the overall size of the OTC derivatives
market, but does not provide details of positions by participants. Position data information about
futures is available to the exchanges and regulators, and the weekly CFTC report on positions
provides a snapshot at a very high level of aggregation.

Note: The figure is based on weekly futures open interest as reported in CFTC’s commitment of traders report
for 27 commodities in our dataset. The commodities covered are: Heating Oil, Crude Oil, Gasoline, Natural
Gas, Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Palladium, Wheat, Corn, Soybean, Soybean Oil, Soybean Meal, Oats, Rough
Rice, Pork Bellies, Live Cattle, Lean Hogs, Feeder Cattle, Milk, Cotton, Orange Juice, Lumber, Cocoa, Coffee, and
Sugar. For each commodity we create an index of open interest, standardized such that December 28, 2004 =
100. The plotted index is the average index level across all 27 futures markets.


Figure 7 gives the growth of open interest, averaged across all futures markets for which the CFTC
reports data.9 It illustrates the growth in overall futures market participation during the out-of
sample period. Despite the temporary contraction during the financial crises, the open interest for
the average commodity has more than doubled since 2004.

Figure A1 in the appendix shows the breakdown of the futures open interest by commodity. It
dramatically illustrates that growth in open interest occurred in almost every commodity futures
market, with the notable exceptions being Pork bellies and Orange Juice. What does speculative
participation look like as a fraction of open interest? A breakdown of the positions according to the
CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report is given in Figure 8.

Note: The figure is based on weekly CFTC’s commitment of traders report for 27 commodities in our dataset,
see notes to figure 7. CFTC reports long and short positions for commercials (hedgers), non-commercials
(speculators) and non-reportable. The report provides spread positions of non-commercials. Total open
interest is the sum of long (short) positions across the three categories of traders and the spread positions of
non-commercials. For each commodity and category we calculate the total gross positions (long plus short
and twice the spread positions) as a ratio of twice the open interest. The figure plots average share for each of
the three categories across the 27 commodities.


The CFTC does not classify market participants as speculators or hedgers, but instead groups
participants according to their participation in physical markets (commercials versus non-
commercials).10 Subject to caveats regarding misclassification of positions, the figure indicates that
commercial activity has been a stable proportion of open interest over time. The same picture also
emerges from more recent classification of positions that separates out swap dealers from the
commercial category in Figure 9.

The patterns that emerge from this data are:

            Open interest has more than doubled for the average commodity since 2004. The drop
             in open interest of 50% during the financial crisis has been temporary. It has reversed.
            The composition of the open interest has remained remarkably stable throughout the
             out-of-sample period.

There is little evidence that one or more categories of futures market participants have grown
disproportionally relative to the market such as to shift the distribution of interests in the market.


10Bona fide hedging activity would be classified as a commercial position, as would swap dealers laying off
their OTC book in the futures markets would also be included in the category. If the futures hedges were for a
commodity index swap, it would be recorded as a long commercial position which is speculative in nature.
This is a commonly mentioned drawback of the CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report.

commodities in figures 7 and 8. The CFTC reports long and short positions for producer/merchant
/processor/user, swap dealers, money managers, and other reportables. It also provides spread positions of
swap dealers, money managers, and other reportables. Total open interest is the sum of long (short) positions
across the four categories and non-reportables and the spread positions. For each commodity and category
we calculate the total gross positions (long plus short and twice the spread positions) as a ratio of twice the
open interest. The figure plots average share for each of the categories across the 27 commodities.


5.2 Behavior of Prices and Correlations

In the previous sections we showed that in many respects futures markets behaved similarly during
the past 10 years as in the prior history. The risk premium has been comparable to its long-term
historical average, and, despite the more than doubling of the market, the composition of the
market participants has been stable. But what has been distinct during the 2005-2014 period has
been the average co-movement among stocks and commodities, and to a lesser degree commodities
with each other. The question is whether this marks a permanent change – perhaps due to
financialization – or whether the change is temporary, similar to the drop in open interest during
the crisis. Figure 10 shows the year-by-year average correlation of commodities with equities.

The figure shows that:

       The correlation between equities and commodities spiked during the crisis 2009-2011, but
        has since fallen back to a level close to zero.
       There have been earlier spikes in the correlation of similar magnitudes as the recent spike,
        most notably in the early 1980s and 1960s.

The fact that the spike in the correlation has been temporary, and that the composition of
participants has been relatively stable (Figure 9), seems inconsistent with the financialization
interpretation of the correlations.

Figure 12 provides further detail by presenting the distribution of pairwise correlations by
calendar year. Calendar years are further sorted into quartiles according to the fraction of their
probability mass lies to the right of the median of 0.117. Years of lowest weight are colored in
green, and the top quartile is colored red. The figure shows that:

       In addition to the 2008-2011 period which include the crisis, the 1973-1984 stands out as a
        period of high intra-commodity correlations (9 of 13 years are in the top quartile).
       The 2004–2007 period experienced inflow of institutional investor money into
        commodities, but does not stand out as a period with high intra-commodity correlations.

Yet another perspective is to ask whether the rise in correlations was limited to commodities that
were part of a major commodity index. Figure 13 compares the average pairwise correlations of
index versus non-index commodities, where “index” is defined as belonging to either the Bloomberg
Commodity Index (BCOM) or the Standard and Poor’s Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (SPGSCI)
indices in the year 2014. This comparison would be of interest for the question whether index
investment was responsible the rise in correlations.

       The intra-commodity correlations are marginally higher for index commodities than non-
        index commodities, although no correction has been made for the different sector
        composition of the two groups
       The figure shows that non-index commodities similarly experienced an increase and
        subsequent decrease in correlations in recent years, albeit somewhat less pronounced than
        index commodities.
       Both correlations among index and non-index commodities has fallen in recent years

Tin. Over the years Milk, Butter, Coal and Electricity were added to our set of non-index commodities. We
start the figure in 1991 when Goldman Sachs first published the GSCI, BCOM was launched later in the decade.

Marginally higher correlations among index commodities is consistent with a form of
financialization that is also observed in other asset classes. Wurgler (2011) discusses this in
relation to the S&P 500. He points out, for example, that when a new company is added to the S&P
Index “it begins to move more closely with its 499 new neighbors and less closely with the rest of
the market” (p. 5).11

Financialization is harder to reconcile with time-series variation of correlations, as it suggests a
permanent regime shift for commodity futures markets that is not easily reversed.12 We can ask
whether the pairwise correlations of commodity futures returns are significantly out of the
ordinary.

5.3 Commodity correlations and the Business Cycle

The variation of the average pairwise commodity correlations shown in Figure 11 is hard to
rationalize with “financialization.” Although one could attempt to imagine a scenario under which
markets cyclically became “de-financialized” and then “financialized”, it seems reasonable to
explore what alternative explanation may be offered for the rise in correlations that could also
account for its subsequent decline. We examine whether the average pairwise commodity
correlations and the average stocks and commodities’ correlations primarily represent business
cycle movements.

Are risk premiums earned for macroeconomic risks? If this is the case to any significant extent then
the risk premiums for different commodities should move together. “Business cycles” occur when
there is a high pairwise correlation among a number of important macroeconomic variables (see,
e.g., Sargent (1987)). The problem is that there are hundreds of macroeconomic series, making
analysis difficult via, say, a vector-autoregression. For this reason, economists tend to focus on an
index or factor structure. The simplest way to do this is to simply select series that capture the
factor structure of the macroeconomic variables. One variable that is often used to do this is the
default spread, the difference between Baa and AAA corporate yields. Chen (1991), for example,
shows that the default premium tracks the health of the economy as measured by the recent growth
rate of GNP and consumption.13


11
   Also, see Barberis, Shleifer and Wurgler (2005), and Vijh (1994). And, Sullivan and Xiong (2012) show that
average pairwise correlation for price and volume changes for all stocks (on NYSE, Amex and NASDAQ)
increased from October 1983 to April 2010, but there are two distinct regimes: a relatively flat regime of
1980-1996 and a positive sloped period of 1997-2010. In fact, there is a very large literature on this. Some
examples include Hau, Massa and Peress (2010) show this for the MSCI Global Equity Index. Greenwood
(2008) and Greenwood and Sosner (2001) examine the Nikkei 225 index.
12 Kupiec (1991) examines the increase in the inter-market correlations for 15 OECD countries, arguing that

there was a regime shift associated with the founding of the Euro zone.
13
   The importance of this variable is in line with other more recent research. Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012)
study the predictive power of credit spreads for business cycle fluctuations. Phillippon (2009) also shows the
predictive content of corporate bond spreads for the real economy. Others haves studied predicting asset
returns with default spreads. Chen, Roll and Ross (1986), Keim and Stambaugh (1986), Fama and French

Bond Yield (BAA), and Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield (AAA) monthly observation, Source:

Bailey and Chan (1993) use the default spread to explain co-movement of the futures basis of
individual commodities. Figure 14 plots the average pairwise commodity correlation against the
average annual default spread, a measure of expected (downside) risk in the overall economy. The
correlation between the two series is 0.56, which suggests an alternative explanation for the rise of
commodity correlation.

Figure 14 has an intuitive message:

              Intra-commodity correlations have a strong business cycle component. Not only does the
               perceived downside risk explain the rise of the commodity correlation during the period of
               “financialization”, it also explains the subsequent decline in correlations.
              The default spread seems to track temporary fluctuations in correlations in prior decades in
               a way that financialization does not.


To briefly examine this further, Table 7 shows the correlations of several macroeconomic time-
series with the Intra-Commodity correlations and the Stock-Commodity correlation.14 The table
shows that both the intra-commodity and the stock-commodity correlations move substantially
with business cycle indicators – the default spread and the annual unemployment rate in particular.


(1989) and other researchers have documented the ability of the ex-ante default premium in the bond market
(and the dividend yield in the stock market) to forecast realized asset returns due to risk premiums that vary
with the business cycle.

6.     Conclusion

GR (2006) made the point that most research on commodity futures has been done “with the use of
short data series applying to small numbers of commodities” (p. 47). This statement still
characterizes much of recent research. GR (2006) constructed a data set covering July 1959
through December 2004. The length and breadth of the series was important for reaching
conclusions. For that reason we update the research in this paper.

In the original study we found that commodities had historically offered a risk premium similar to
equities, and at the same time would provide diversification to a traditional portfolio of stocks and
bonds. What set commodities apart from these traditional assets was their positive correlation with
inflation. Here we provide 10 years of additional data. Although a decade is sometimes too short to
draw firm conclusions, our-of-sample period is rich because it includes a global economic
expansion led by the industrialization of China, a housing boom and bust in the United States, the
largest financial crisis since the Great Depression, followed by a monetary policy stimulus response
which has driven interest rates around the world towards zero.

Commodity markets have continued to grow during this period, although the composition of
traders has been remarkably stable over time.

Many of the basic conclusions of the original study continue to hold. The average risk premium to
commodity futures was 3.7% per annum. The risk premium has been comparable to its long-term
                                                                                                          23


historical average, and, despite the more than doubling of the market, the composition of the
market participants has been stable.

The longer time series history of commodity markets shows that the rise in correlations occurs in
periods of heightened financial risk/turmoil associated with macroeconomic activity. This feature is
shared by many asset classes.15 Commodity correlations have spiked during the financial crisis, in a
way that resembles other episodes of increased risk in history. The fundamental relationship
between return and risk (as measured by carry) has been similar across the in-sample and out of
sample period.

There are many areas for future research. We indicate three.

First, how does the growth of commodity futures markets affect the required risk premium for
transferring price risk? Our preliminary analysis of the CFTC data in this paper suggests that
futures markets for the “average” commodity have grown proportionally, attracting at the same
time both new hedgers as well as new speculators. Does this mean there was a latent demand for
hedging, limited by speculative participation? If growth in open interest had been entirely fueled by
increased speculation, the new supply of insurance capital would likely reduce the cost of
insurance. Was the growth of futures markets paralleled by growth in the OTC markets? Or is the
futures growth replacing OTC activity? For example, as banks reduce their appetite for hedging
future commodity price risks for clients over-the-counter because of Dodd-Frank and other
regulations, this hedging demand may end up at futures exchanges (Etula (2013)).

A second area of research concerns the impact of “speculation” on market prices. The economic
function of a futures market is to transfer price risk. Those shedding risk are often considered
hedgers and those assuming the risk are usually called “speculators.” Since the beginning of
organized futures markets in the 1870s in the U.S, there has been controversy about the influence
of speculators on the level and volatility of prices. The work of Working (1953, 1960), Gray (1960,
1967), and Hieronymus (1971) has been influential in framing relevant questions in this area. What
is the effect of futures transactions other than those intended to accommodate the demands by
hedgers? The debate is complicated by the fact that we lack a proper definition of hedgers and
speculators. As noted by Hart and Kreps (1986): “Despite the many attempts [define speculation] in
the literature, a satisfactory general definition is still not available (and probably never will be. . .)”
(p. 928). For example while transactions by commercial traders (under the CFTC trader
classification) are typically considered hedging activity, some of their trading is likely speculative in
nature.




15 For example, King and Wadhawani (1990) test for an increase in stock market correlations between the
United States, the United Kingdom and Japan following the U.S. market crash of 1987. They find a significant
increase in cross-market correlations. Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel and Xu (2001) show that the average
pairwise correlations of individual stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ are trending downwards, due to an
increase in idiosyncratic volatility, the correlations increase in recessions. Aggregate market volatility is
countercyclical.
                                                                                                   24


Both of these research areas could tremendously benefit from access to data that is collected but
not widely available to academic investigators. Unlike other financial markets, futures markets are
unique in that exchanges (CME, ICE) and regulators (CFTC) have access to holdings data of all
participants, and provide a near complete transaction history.

Finally, why do some commodity futures contracts succeed, while others do not? Commodity
exchanges are increasingly for-profit enterprises which in part will need to compete by answering
this question. Gray (1966) identifies three reasons why a contract might fail (see also Black (1986),
and Till (2014)). First, the contract may be poorly designed. Second, parties with market power
might boycott a futures contract, and use the over-the-counter forward market instead. Third,
there may be a failure to attract speculators. This is a practical question of security design as well
as an issue of where the latent demand for insurance lies.
