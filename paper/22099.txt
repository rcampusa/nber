The wealthiest 10% of donors now give 90% of charitable dollars in the U.S., but little is known
about what motivates them. Using a natural field experiment on over 5,000 high capacity donors,
we find persistence in giving patterns, that signals of program quality influence giving, and that
the price of giving is not unduly important. Unlike typical small donors, our givers respond only
on the intensive margin, and often with a longer time lag. Our study highlights the value to
practitioners of partnering with academics, as our intervention has generated $30 million in
incremental donations to the University.

         As federal, state, and local budgets continue to tighten, the provision of
public goods by charitable organizations has increased dramatically. Total
charitable gifts of money have roughly doubled in real terms since 1990 in the
U.S., and the number of nonprofits grew by nearly 60 percent from 1995-2005
(see Andreoni, 2006). The import of non-profit fundraising is witnessed in a wide
variety of sectors. Non-profit hospitals and healthcare systems raised more than
$9 billion in 2013, and there were 36 capital campaigns at colleges and
universities in 2014 targeting $1 billion or more in donations.
         One of the dominant features of the charitable sector is the large and
increasing fraction of overall donations coming from the wealthiest donors. Havens
and Schervish (1999) report that households in the top 1 percent of the income
distribution (annual income above $250,000 in 1994) provided 33 percent of the
total charitable dollars in 1995. Auten, Clotfelter, and Schmalbeck (2000) note that
the wealthiest 1.4 percent of decedents are responsible for 86 percent of charitable
giving from bequests. These patterns have become even more extreme in recent
years. For example, what used to be known as the “80/20 rule” — that 20 percent
of the donors provide 80 percent of the money — has become the 90/10 rule, or
even the 95/5 rule (Worth, 2015). Almost all previous academic research, however,
has focused on the motivations of “ordinary” or “modal” givers (see, e.g., List and
Lucking-Reiley, 2002, and Frey and Meier, 2004, for early work). Answering the
same questions for the very wealthy has gone unexplored.
         This study takes this step by using a natural field experiment to explore what
motivates high capacity donors.1 Our partnership is with the University of Chicago
Booth School of Business, which sends an average of four donation request letters
per year to the individuals in our sample. We were permitted access to use one
such mailing, in the Fall of 2009, for a natural field experiment. Each of the nearly

 Related work by Andreoni, et al. (2015), Eckel et al. (2015), and Kessler, et al. (2015) also
explores high capacity donors.




                                                 2
6,000 potential donors in our sample was assigned to one of five different treatment
cells or to the control group. In an effort to provide a direct link with the current
literature, we follow two approaches in our design. First, we use both a warm and
a cold list of potential donors, as in Landry et al. (2007). Second, in the five
treatments we varied both the price of the good—through different match rates,
consistent with Karlan and List (2007)—and used various signals of charitable
quality—via the use of donor gifts and available match dollars (see Landry et al.,
2007). By using these treatments, we learn about certain motivations of high
capacity donors, while simultaneously measuring if the insights in the received
literature generalize smoothly to a high capacity donor pool.
       Another unique feature of our data is that we are permitted a chance to track
the potential donors over a 3½ year period, allowing us to go beyond measurement
of short run substitution effects and determine if long run giving patterns are
influenced by treatment. We report several insights. First, our treatments generated
over $30 million in incremental donations to the University. This result, in and of
itself, lends credibility to using science to further philanthropic efforts. Second, in
many ways high capacity donors are similar to modal donors: warm list people are
much more likely to give than those on the cold list, signals of program quality
(match dollars and donor gifts) influence high capacity donors, and the price of
giving (different match rates) is not unduly important. Third, we find some
evidence of donor fatigue: too many contacts to high capacity donors can be
detrimental to fundraising efforts.

       While these insights provide some tentative support for the notion that the
received results in the literature might generalize to the right tail of the donor
distribution, there are important differences. First, most of the effects for modal
donors reported in the literature occur on the extensive margin whereas for high
capacity donors the treatment effects we find largely revolve around moving the




                                          3
intensive margin. Second, while the treatment effects reported in the literature are
typically drawn from gift differences within days or weeks of the intervention, our
data suggest small treatment effects in the first few months but large effects over
several years. This result suggests that there is much to gain by moving from an
experimental strategy that measures short run substitution effects to one that
measures long run impacts.

       The remainder of our note proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes our
experimental design. Section 3 discusses the experimental results. Section 4
concludes.

                                 II: Experimental Design

       In October 2009, we partnered with the Booth Business School at the
University of Chicago, a non-profit in Illinois, to run a natural field experiment
involving their high net wealth donor pool. The sample included nearly 6,000
individuals, approximately 48% percent of whom had made at least one gift in the
two years prior to our experiment. In a typical year our subjects’ aggregate
donation amount to the school is roughly $20 million. According to the Booth
school’s charity model estimates, our donor sample has a median annual giving
capacity greater than $25,000.

       The institution sends an average of four donation request letters per year to
our sampled individuals. We were allowed to use random assignment on one such
mailing in the Fall of 2009. Each of the 5,675 potential donors in our sample was
assigned to one of five different treatment cells or to the control group. We chose
the various treatments to provide a direct link to the literature, which has reported
estimates of how program quality can influence givers as well as how changes in
prices via different match rates can influence givers. For instance, Landry et al.
(2007) report that various mechanisms can be used to create an enduring signal of




                                         4
charitable quality. In their model, any upfront money—used for donor gifts, a
match program, etc.—can serve to signal that the specific fund raising drive is a
high quality effort. Note that even though the potential donors likely understand
the quality of the overall institution itself, it is the specific fundraising drive for
which these signals might have import. Landry et al. (2007) find that years after
the actual signal is sent they observe treatment effects for the modal giver. In terms
of different match rates, Karlan and List (2007) report that even though the
availability of match dollars has value, the rate itself does not have a significant
impact on donors.

       In the spirit of this literature, we design treatment groups varying these
elements. First, all of the 5,675 potential donors received a variant of a donation
request letter written by Steven Levitt (see Appendix A for the full text of the
baseline letter). In the treatment we denote as “SIGNED BOOK,” subjects also
received a signed copy of SuperFreakonomics (co-authored by Steven Levitt, and
which had just been published) along with the letter. In a second treatment,
“SPEAKING INVITATION,” individuals received an invitation to hear either
Steven Levitt or his co-author Stephen Dubner speak at one of their upcoming
engagements.        A third treatment “SIGNED BOOK AND SPEAKING
INVITATION” provided both a signed book and an invitation to attend a lecture.
In all three treatments, the gifts were unconditional, i.e. they did not depend on
whether the donor gave or not.

       The final two treatments did not involve books or invitations, but rather,
offered either a 1-1 match (“ONE TO ONE MATCH”) or 2-1 match (“TWO TO
ONE MATCH”) for any gift that was made after the receipt of the letter but before
the end of 2009. To ensure the alumni understood the effects of the match, we
included a sentence that stated the match would effectively double (or triple, in the




                                          5
case of the 2-1 match) the amount of the donation. Finally, there was a control
group that received a letter, but no book, no invitation, and no matching promise.2

         For each of the subjects, we know their state of residence, whether they had
received a degree from the University of Chicago (and if so when they earned that
degree), whether they had given a gift in the last two years, the size of gifts within
the last two years, the development office’s estimate of that subject’s giving
capacity, and the number of mailings sent by the institution to the subject in the
previous two years. About one-fourth of the subjects live in Illinois; 95 percent
received an MBA.

         Table 1 shows the extent to which our six assignment groups are balanced
on the observable characteristics. Each column of the table reports the results of a
different regression, where the dependent variable is provided at the top of the
column and the right hand side variables are treatment indicators. Column 1, for
instance, presents results for an indicator variable of whether the subject made a
donation to this institution in the prior two years. The control group is the omitted
category; thus the coefficient on the constant is the mean value of the dependent
variable for the control group. The coefficient on a particular treatment is the mean
difference relative to the control group, with the associated standard error in
parentheses.

         As the results of Table 1 demonstrate, our groups are well balanced. Only
one of the thirty coefficients on the treatment groups is statistically significant at p


2
  The book and invitation treatments have a smaller number of subjects than the matching treatments
because of concerns in the development office about the workload associated with packaging and
mailing the signed books, and concerns about accommodating large numbers of donors at future
speaking events. The latter concern turned out to be unfounded, as very few of the treatment subjects
chose to attend an event. There were slightly more than 200 individuals in each of the treatments
involving a book or invitation, roughly 1,700 individuals in each of the matching treatments and the
control group.




                                                 6
< .05 – roughly what one would expect in a balanced sample. It is worth noting,
however, that due to the lumpiness of gifts, rather large mean differences in past
gift sizes are present across some of our treatments. There is high variance across
gifts, however, so these differences are not unexpected. In the analysis that follows,
we include specifications that control for all of these observables and given the
lumpiness of data focus on long run treatment effects.

                            III: Experimental Results

       Table 2 reports the impact of our treatments on total giving (Appendix B
contains results during the experimental window).         Each column of Table 2
corresponds to a different regression. In each case, the dependent variable is the
total amount of money donated by an individual between November 1, 2009 (the
time of our intervention) and June 2013 (the latest data available to us). Columns
1 and 2 of Table 2 pool our five treatments; columns 3 and 4 report each of the
treatments separately. In all columns, the omitted category is the control group.

       We present empirical results both with no controls (columns 1 and 3) and
including controls (columns 2 and 4). The variables included as controls are the
dollar value of donations by that individual in the preceding two years, an indicator
for whether the individual had given in the preceding two years, a dummy for the
subject’s giving capacity as measured by the institution, whether the individual
resides in Illinois, whether the alum graduated from the full-time MBA program,
or a different program, and the number of mailings the institution sent the subject
during the year of the experiment. We report the coefficients on all controls except
for the categorical variable for giving capacity which takes on 19 different values.

       Focusing first on the pooled results in columns 1 and 2 of Table 2, we find
that exposure to our treatments led to an average increase in giving of roughly
$6,500 per person in the raw data and over $8,000 with controls. In spite of the




                                          7
huge magnitude of these coefficients – those in the treatment group gave on average
more than twice as much as the those in the control group over the next three and
one half years – the estimates are only borderline statistically significant at
conventional levels. Gifts from these high wealth donors have a long right tail,
which makes it difficult to estimate treatment effects with precision.

       There are two control variables that are statistically significant: being on the
institution’s warm list (i.e. having donated in the previous two years), which has
the expected positive effect, and the number of mailings sent in the previous year,
which has a negative, albeit small, effect. Larger previous gifts, living in the same
state as the institution, and being an alum all carry positive but statistically
insignificant coefficients.

       Columns 3 and 4 present results broken down by individual treatment.
Estimated coefficients on the two treatments that include books and the one-to-one
match are relatively small in magnitude, statistically insignificant, and flip sign
when controls are added. The other two treatments – speaking invitation and two-
to-one match – carry large positive coefficients and are statistically significant at
the p < .05 and p < .01 levels respectively. Given the size of the standard errors,
one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients on the book treatments
and the speaking invitation-only treatments are the same, but at least directionally,
it appears that the recipients were not very fond of Superfreakonomics.

       Table 3 further explores the sensitivity of the experimental results to
outliers, the time window post-intervention, sub-groups of donors, and more
extensive controls. The six columns of Table 3 correspond to the pooled treatment
(column 1) and the five individual treatments (columns 2-6). Each row reflects a
different cut of the data. For purposes of comparison, the top row of Table 3
presents our baseline estimates, including covariates, from Table 2.           So, for




                                          8
instance, the coefficient in the first column and first row of this table, 8,737,
matches the coefficient at the top of column 2 in Table 2.

        Row two in Table 3 shows the sensitivity of our results to excluding the
largest post-period donor from our sample. This individual, who was in the two-
to-one match treatment, gave a single gift of $10 million.3 The pooled treatment
estimate falls roughly in half, but remains significant at the p < .05 level because
the standard error falls as well. The two-to-one match coefficient falls, as would
be expected, but remains significant at conventional levels.                 The coefficient
estimates on the other treatments also all are reduced, despite the fact the large
donor was not part of these treatments (the treatments are mutually exclusive).
Omitting this donor indirectly affects the other coefficients through his impact on
the coefficients on the covariates.

        The third row of Table 3 further explores the impact of outliers more
generally, capping the value of post-period gifts at $1 million. This cap binds on
15 subjects, translating to 0.26% of our sample, or 0.62% of members who donated
during the post-period. All of the estimated values fall substantially, demonstrating
that much of the effect we observe in our data is operating through the channel of
gifts over $1 million in value. Whether we were “lucky” that these large gifts were
concentrated in the treatment subjects, or whether our treatments truly contributed
to these large gifts is a question we cannot definitively answer.

        The fourth row of Table 3 includes a fuller set of controls: indicators for
each subject’s graduation decade and whether the alum received an MBA. The
effects are very similar to the baseline results, both in magnitude and significance.

 This gift came after December 31, 2009, the end of the period which had two-to-one matching,
so was not matched.




                                               9
         The next two rows divide gifts by the timing of whether they were received
in 2009 (the two months after our mailing) or later. This distinction is particularly
relevant to the matching treatments, because the matches were only promised if the
gift was received in 2009. Surprisingly, we find that little of the effect, even for
the matching treatments, comes within the matching window. The matching
programs did not succeed in triggering large, immediate gifts. Further, consistent
with the extant literature, within the matching window the match rate does not
affect donors (see Karlan and List, 2007). Yet, in the long run having a match does
induce more philanthropic dollars, which is consonant with upfront monies serving
to signal the quality of the program (see Landry et al., 2007 and Karlan and List,
2007).

         Distinguishing between warm list and cold list demonstrates that all benefits
to the institution are concentrated among those on the warm list. This result is in
concert with the literature, which shows the importance of having a warm list (see
Landry et al. 2007). Our effects are driven by those donors with the highest giving
capacity, consistent with the shrinkage in the estimates earlier in the table when we
capped large gifts. Treatment effects do not appear to vary sharply according to the
current state of residence of the donor.

         All of the results presented thus far can operate through two different
possible channels: (1) changing the likelihood of a gift or (2) altering the size of the
gift conditional on giving. The final row of Table 3 isolates only the latter channel,
by restricting the sample only to the roughly 42% percent of the sample who made
a donation in the post period. The standard errors become quite large in some
columns.     The pooled treatment effect estimate is almost unaffected.            Our
interventions appear to have primarily altered the size of gifts conditional on giving,




                                           10
rather than the likelihood of a gift.4 This result represents a major departure from
insights gained from natural field experiments that explore giving patterns of modal
givers, where the treatment effects tend to be driven by the extensive, rather than
intensive, margin (see the summary in List, 2011). Our results are consistent with
the notion that increased giving occurs because our highest capacity givers donate
more due to treatment.

                                       IV. Conclusion

        This paper reports the results of a natural field experiment targeting high-
wealth donors. Those exposed to our treatments have given an average of more
than $8,000 to the institution in the ensuing years compared to the control group.
Taken literally, our intervention generated over $30 million in incremental
donations to the institution.         Interestingly, treatment effects are concentrated
amongst those donors with the highest giving capacity and those who had given to
the institution in the preceding two years. In this way, our treatment effects come
from larger gifts conditional on giving, rather than through changes in the
probability of a gift being made.

        Our results have import for academics, practitioners, and policymakers. For
academics, the finding that in many ways high capacity donors are similar to the
modal donor provides some tentative support for the notion that the received results
in the literature might generalize to the right tail of the donor distribution. Much
more work needs to be done to make any definitive statements, as we do find some
important differences across sampled populations. For practitioners, this study
provides key evidence that science can inform their efforts, even for high capacity
donors. In this manner, the effect on donor fatigue has immediate implications, as

  The coefficients on probability of donating for both the pooled treatments and the individual
treatments range between 0 and -.051, all of which are insignificant, when including controls.

do the insights gained on matches and donor gifts. For policymakers, as we begin
to understand the motivations of high capacity donors, we can start to provide
evidence necessary to calculate the benefits and costs of proposed policies.

               Notes: Each column of the table reports the results of a different regression, where the dependent
               variable is named at the top of the column and the right hand side variables are indicators for each of
               our treatments. Warm list is an indicator variable of whether the subject made a donation to this
               institution in the prior two years. Full time student is an indicator for whether the subject received an
               MBA in the full time program. The institution offers 2 part-time MBAs (evening and weekend), as
               well as an executive MBA, in addition to the full-time program. Illinois resident is an indicator for
               whether the subject currently lives in Illinois. Giving capacity represents a giving capability bracket
               determined by the institution. An average of 11.6 means that the average subject is rated to be able to
               give between $5,000 and $25,000. The control group is the omitted category, and the coefficient on a
               particular treatment is the difference in means relative to the control group, with the associated standard
               error in parentheses.

              Notes: Table 2 reports the impact of our experimental intervention on future giving. Each column of
              the table corresponds to a different regression. In each case, the dependent variable is the total amount
              of money donated by an individual between November 1, 2009 (the time of our intervention) and June
              2013 (the latest data available to us). Columns 1 and 2 pool our five treatments; columns 3 and 4 report
              each of the treatments separately. In all columns, the omitted category is the control group. We present
              the results both with controls (columns 2 and 4) and without controls (columns 1 and 3). In addition to
              the controls shown in the table, in columns 2 and 4 we also include indicators corresponding to each of
              the nineteen levels of giving capacity. Standard errors in square brackets.

               Notes: Table 3 explores alternative specifications and sub-samples of the data. Except where
               specifically noted, the included controls match those in Columns 2 and 4 of Table 2. The first column
               of the table pools all the treatments. The remaining columns correspond to the five treatments and are
               estimated, in each row, from a single regression. For purposes of comparison, the top row of the table
               presents our baseline estimates. Empirical results are robust to corrections for multiple hypothesis
               testing in the spirit of List et al. (2016).
