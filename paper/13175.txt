We study the adoption of Common Application membership by private four-year postsecondary institutions
and its role in explaining the growth in undergraduate applications. Using data from the College Board's
Annual Survey of Colleges, our estimation of proportional hazard models suggest that institutions
respond to the net benefit of adoption. We estimate that membership increases applications by 5.7
to 7.0 percent and decreases yield rates by 2.8 to 3.9 percent. Acceptance rates decrease for members
when their local networks are large. Membership is also associated with a decline in SAT scores and
an increase in the percentage of students of color. Finally, falsification tests indicate that membership
effects occur as a one-time adoption shock that persists thereafter.

1 Introduction
         Between 1975 and 2005, the share of first year students that applied to four or more

institutions the previous year grew from 12.0 percent to 38.6 percent (Pryor, Hurtado, Saenz,

Santos, and Korn 2007). Our own estimates over the same period suggest that the mean number

of applications received by private four-year institutions increased from 1,282 to 3,129. One

potential explanation for the growth in undergraduate applications is that the college wage

premium has increased since the 1970s, particularly for graduates of highly selective institutions

(Murphy and Welch 1993; Brewer, Eide, and Ehrenberg, 1999). Increasing market returns to

postsecondary education may induce risk-averse prospective students to apply to more colleges

and universities.

         An alternative explanation is that the market structure of postsecondary education has

transformed from a collection of local markets into a nationally competitive marketplace (Hoxby

1997).    This implies that colleges and universities have increasing incentives to increase

institutional prestige. Perhaps the most widely followed measure of prestige comes from the

U.S. News and World Report’s (USNWR) America’s Best Colleges which rewards higher mean

SAT scores, lower acceptance rates, and until recently, higher yield rates. Annual changes in

rankings have substantial consequences including the quality of students that enroll the following

year (Monks and Ehrenberg 1999). There is even some evidence that college and universities

manipulate admissions processes to boost USNWR rankings in otherwise counterproductive

ways (Avery, Glickman, Hoxby, and Metrick 2004).

         Our focus in this paper is on an institutional choice that enhances USNWR prestige by

generating advantageous changes in undergraduate admissions outcomes. Each year since 1975,




                                                1
the Common Application (CAPP) non-profit organization issues a standardized application form

that prospective students may submit to institutions that pay the membership fee. We present a

model where membership decreases the opportunity time cost of completing an application for

prospective students and increases the number of applications received by the institution.

Membership also exhibits network externalities because it reduces the application price at all

other member institutions causing membership effects to grow with network size.

       To empirically test our model, we analyze the diffusion of CAPP adoption among

private, postsecondary institutions between 1975 and 2005 using the College Board’s Annual

Survey of Colleges.      Estimates from proportional hazards models stratified by Carnegie

classification suggest the presence of network externalities: the probability of adoption

conditional on being at risk increases with the membership share in the state, division, or region.

We also find that higher membership fees decrease the conditional probability of adoption which

is surprising given that they are small relative to annual institutional revenues.

       We then directly estimate the effects of CAPP membership on a set of undergraduate

admissions outcomes. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to emphasize the effects of

application prices; the closest studies estimate the effects of list and net tuition on application

behavior (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002). OLS and two-stage least squares models show

that membership increases applications, admittances, and enrollment and decreases yield rates.

Interaction terms reveal differential impacts such as the presence of network externalities for

applications and acceptance rates. We also conduct a series of falsification tests that vary the

timing of adoption and show that membership effects occur as a one-time shock at adoption.

These dynamics and the presence of network externalities suggest that competition-driven CAPP

membership diffusion contributes to the growth in applications.




                                                  2
       CAPP membership may also affect the characteristics of applicants, admitted prospective

students, and enrolled students.      In fact, the mission statement of the CAPP non-profit

organization includes a commitment to promote equity and access (The Common Application,

2007). Unfortunately, data restrictions force us to focus on the characteristics of enrolled

students rather than on applicants or admitted prospective students.          We find that CAPP

membership results in a small decrease in mean SAT scores and large increase the percent

students of color. Membership thus not only affects the number of people at each stage of the

admissions process but the characteristics of those that ultimately enroll as well.


2 Application Prices and the College Admissions Process
       Recent studies of postsecondary education emphasize enrollment responses to the tuition

paid by prospective students (Leslie and Brinkman 1988; Dynarksi 2002; Van Der Klaauw 2002;

Avery and Hoxby 2004). Less attention is paid to the application stage, although there is some

evidence that the probability of applying to an institution decreases with list or expected net

tuition (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002). Our focus in this paper is on the effects of

application price changes on applications and admissions outcomes more broadly. Expanding

applicant pools is of increasing importance because to boost prestige, many institutions seek

lower acceptance rates and offer preferentially packaged financial aid to enroll the optimal set of

applicants.


2.1 Student and Institution Behavior with the CAPP
       Our model of college admissions begins with the decision to submit applications by

prospective students and builds on Manski and Wise (1983). Students choose whether to apply

to an institution by comparing the utilities with and without enrollment at the institution. We




                                                 3
assume that the utility of enrollment increases with institutional prestige based on institutional

characteristics the previous year. This is consistent with prospective students assessing quality

based current USNWR rankings. This also assumes that prospective students do not anticipate

any effects of CAPP membership on institutional quality.

          The utility of enrollment decreases with the application price which consists of the

opportunity time cost of completing an application form and the monetary fee assessed by the

receiving institution.1 Using the CAPP application form when it is accepted decreases the

opportunity time cost but has no effect on the monetary fee. The reduction in overall price

generates additional applications. This occurs both on the intensive margin, where existing

applicants increase the number of applications submitted, and on the extensive margin, where

new prospective students start applying for college because the overall cost is lower.

          A salient feature of the membership is that it exhibits network externalities. Network

externalities exist when the benefit of a good changes with the number of other agents

consuming the same type of good (Liebowitz and Margolis 2004). In this context, the time cost

savings to a prospective student occurs at every institution that accepts the standardized form.

Membership effects are greater when the network size is large.

          How do institutions respond to the increase in applications?     Colleges and universities

that accept the CAPP application form will receive additional applications from qualified

prospective students and prospective students who are likely to enroll if granted admission (such

as students applying to “reach” schools). Institutions that focus on selectivity and yield rates as

components of prestige increase admittances because there are newly desirable prospective

students in the applicant pool. This implies that CAPP membership will have an ambiguous

    Recently, some institutions issue fee waivers for online applicants.


                                                   4
effect on acceptance rates (admittances / applications). Lastly, we assume that institutions have

constant enrollment targets in the short-run to generate sufficient tuition revenue but not exceed

capacity constraints.   Thus, membership unambiguously decreases yield rates (enrollment /

admittances).


2.2 The Diffusion of CAPP
        Our model assumes that the membership benefits for colleges and universities are the

additional applications, and possibly lower acceptance rates, that are rewarded with USNWR

prestige.    The costs are the CAPP membership fees and the intended and unintended

consequences on student body characteristics. While we are able to measure some aspects of

student characteristics such as SAT scores, percent students of color, and percent low-income

students, we undoubtedly ignore others that may foster enthusiasm or resistance at some

institutions.2

        We employ the diffusion of innovations model to analyze the institutional adoption of

CAPP membership. Firms adopt an innovation when the net benefits of doing so are positive.

For example, net benefits may increase with firm size when the profit of successful adoption

exhibits economies of scale (Davies 1979 as described by Baptista 1999). Larger firms may also

be better able to bear the risk of unsuccessful innovations.

        In a representative reduced-form approach, Rose and Joskow (1990) show that larger

firms are indeed more likely to adopt coal-fired steam-electric generating technology in the

electric utility industry. Moreover, the probability of adoption conditional on being at risk

increases with the cost of pre-innovation technology. Adoption may also be more likely when


2
 The University of Chicago recently debated CAPP membership where opponents claimed that
membership would change the character of the institution. This institution has called its
undergraduate application the Uncommon Application since 1998.


                                                 5
the net benefit of the innovation exhibits network externalities. For example, controlling for

other economies of scale, banks with more local branches have higher probabilities of ATM

(automatic teller machines) adoption conditional on being at risk (Saloner and Shepard 1995).

This approach may also include the strategic components of adoption.               The conditional

probability of ATM adoption by banks increases when competitors adopt the previous period, a

phenomenon Hannan and McDowell (1987) describe as rival precedence.

        However, external validity may be a concern when studying the diffusion of industry-

specific innovations: it is not obvious that the diffusion of coal-fired steam electric technology or

ATMs operate like innovations in postsecondary education. We are only aware of one study,

Getz, Siegfried, and Anderson (1997), that applies this approach to postsecondary education.

For thirty technologies including library, computing, and classroom innovations, the probability

of adoption conditional on being at risk depends on public or private control, financial resources,

and institution type (liberal arts, research, or university).


3 Data and Empirical Methods
        The CAPP non-profit organization generously provided us with the complete adoption

history of all institutional members since its inception in 1975. Our sample, which includes

members and non-members, consists of four-year private colleges and universities in the College

Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges that meet minimal data requirements.3 We exclude public

institutions because they comprise only 4 percent of members in 2005 with the first adoption



3
  The sample consists of institutions that report in 1974 and 2005, respond for at least 20 years,
and contain at least 10 years of data on applications. Our empirical findings are robust to 5-year
variations in the latter two requirements. We drop other-type Carnegie classification institutions
and those missing mean SAT scores throughout the panel. There is no College Board data in
1975, 1977, 1980, 1981, or 1983. We impute missing values for interior points with linear
interpolation and exterior points with the outermost non-missing value.


                                                    6
occurring in 2001. The final sample consists of 638 institutions in each year from 1975 to 2005,

of which 250 adopt in some year. Each observation consists of institutional data for first year

undergraduate students in year t where their applications and applications submitted by those

denied admission or did not enroll were actually submitted in year t–1.


                            [Figure 1. Applications by CAPP Status]


       Figure 1 presents the mean number of applications per year for institutions with CAPP

membership in some year and those that never adopt. Institutions that never adopt experienced a

130 percent growth in average applications over the entire period from 836 applications in 1974

to 1,926 applications in 2005. In contrast, average applications at institutions with membership

experience grew 162 percent from 1,900 in 1974 to 4,996 in 2005.            While this suggests

differential trends in applications by membership, selection may be an issue because mean

applications for these groups were different before the CAPP non-profit organization was

created.


                                [Table 1. Sample Means in 1974]


       CAPP and non-CAPP institutions vary by other characteristics as well. Table 1 presents

mean institutional characteristics in 1974, one year before the onset of risk; we reject the

hypotheses that the means for the two groups are equal for each admissions outcome and

institutional characteristic except percent Masters and the location dummy variables. CAPP

institutions have greater applications, admittances, and enrollment.      They also have lower




                                                7
acceptance and yield rates and higher mean SAT scores.4 CAPP institutions are more likely to

be PhD institutions as designated by their Carnegie classification, where each institution is a

Doctoral (PhD), Masters (MA), or Bachelors (BA) institution. We also collect application fee

and list tuition data (in 2005 dollars) for 1985–2005 and find that CAPP institutions have greater

application fees and list tuition in 1985.5

        We describe the empirical diffusion strategy next because the resulting estimates will

inform the subsequent program evaluation section of the paper. Our analysis of adoption centers

on the hazard rate h in Equation 1. The hazard rate of institution i in state s in period t is the

instantaneous probability of adopting CAPP membership conditional on not having adopted by

period t.


                                                          f (t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist )
        h(t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist ) =                                                         (1)
                                                       1 − F (t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist )


        The hazard rate depends on the CAPP membership fee.                                  The CAPP non-profit

organization set constant price schedules for 1980–1982, 1983–1992, 1993–1999, 2000–2001,

and 2002–2005. Institutions are sorted into groups based on the previous year’s total number of

applications, and all institutions within a group are charged the same price. For example, the

price schedule in 1993–1994 charged institutions with 0–999 applications $550, 1,000–1,499

applications $600, 1,500–1,999 applications $650, and 2,000–2,499 applications $700, 2,500–

  Mean SAT scores are re-centered and calculated as the average of the 25th and 75th percentile
score at the institution. When missing, we convert ACT scores into re-centered SAT scores.
5
  We impute missing tuition in the Annual Survey of Colleges with values from the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). In cases where IPEDS reports tuition and fees
together, we subtract estimated fees based on within-institution averages of the fee to total cost
ratio over the entire period.


                                                             8
2,999 applications $750, and 3,000 or more applications $800.6                 We convert the price of

membership into the fee per first year enrolled student in 2005 dollars (memberfeeist). The mean

price across all years is $3.36 per first year student.

        The second variable of interest is our measure of network size, the CAPP membership

rate in the network (excluding institution i) in state s in period t (pctcappist). Ideally, we would

construct annual revealed-preference networks of the type described in Avery, Glickman, Hoxby,

and Metrick (2004), but such data were not available to us.                 Instead, we define network

competitors as other private institutions the state, although we experiment with specifications

using Census divisions and regions instead. Lastly, the hazard rate depends on a vector of

institutional characteristics Xist which includes mean SAT score (satist), mean SAT score squared

(satsqist), percent on-campus students (pctcampusist), percent in-state students (pctinstateist),

religious affiliation (religionist), urban location (urbanist), and rural location (ruralist).


                 [Figure 2. Smoothed Hazard Estimates by Carnegie Classification]


        We present two non-parametric estimates of the hazard rate in Figure 2 and Figure 3 to

guide our analysis. Each line is a kernel density estimator of the hazard rate for institutions

disaggregated by Carnegie classification or by SAT group with bandwidths that minimize mean

integrated squared error. The SAT groups are 0 to 33 (low), 34 to 66 (middle), and 67 to 100

(high) percentiles of the mean SAT score. To fix groups, we categorize institutions based on

their 1974 values.




6
  Members that use the CAPP application form exclusively were charged $100 between 1980–
1982 and 1983–1992. More recently, institutions are charged an additional membership fee for
each online application submitted and a surcharge for online supplements. Prices for 1975 to
1979 are unavailable and are imputed with 1980 prices.


                                                     9
                       [Figure 3. Smoothed Hazard Estimates by SAT Group]


       The hazard rates have three inflection points with local maxima just after the inception of

the CAPP non-profit organization and again in the mid-1990s.                       Wilcoxon tests reject the

hypotheses that the hazard rates by Carnegie classification or by SAT group are equal. PhD and

most selective institutions consistently have the greatest conditional probabilities of adoption.

The shapes of the hazard rates, particularly those of MA and BA institutions that cross between

periods 12 and 13, do not conform to any of the well-known functions (i.e. exponential or

Weibull).   This suggests that a fully parametric specification of these forms would be

misspecified. Thus, we estimate semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model stratified by

Carnegie classification as presented in Equation 2. Each Carnegie classification has its own

baseline hazard rate, but we assume that the coefficients of the explanatory variables are the

same across groups. Our discussion above leads us to expect that β1<0 and β2>0.


       h(t | memberfeeist , pctcapp ist , X ist ) = h0j (t )exp(β1memberfeeist + β 2 pctcapp ist + X ist γ )
                                                                                                               (2)
                                              j ∈ {PhD, MA, BA}


       The second part of our analysis estimates the effects of CAPP membership on a set of

undergraduate admissions outcomes: applications, admittances, enrollments, acceptance rates,

yield rates, mean SAT scores, percent students of color, and percent low-income students. We

calculate admissions outcomes for each first year cohort (combining full-time and part-time)

except for the percent low-income students which is not available. Instead, we use the percent of

all undergraduate students (both full-time and part-time) that receive Pell Grants as a measure of

percent low-income students.

         We employ a standard program evaluation approach in Equation 3 where we regress log

admissions outcome k for institution i in state s in year t on a set of institutional characteristics.

Our primary focus is on the coefficient on membership status in year t–1 (cappist–1), θ 3k . In this

section, we include Carnegie classification dummy variables as an institutional characteristic

( σ ck ). We also include the log of list tuition (log_tuitionist–1) in t–1 because previous studies

show it to be associated with applications (Savoca 1990; Curs and Singell 2002), yield rates

(Avery and Hoxby 2004), and enrollment (Allen and Shen 1999). We do not correct for the

effects of grants, loans, or other financial aid on tuition in this paper. A novel feature of our

analysis is that we include the application fee (log_applyfeeist–1) in t–1 in 2005 dollars which to

our knowledge has yet to be used in the literature.7 Our prior is that θ1k <0 for applications.

Because application fees are unavailable in the early years of the panel, we restrict the evaluation

sample to 1985 to 2005.

         The remaining independent variables are membership status and institutional

characteristics in t–1 with institution, state, and year fixed-effects. Institution fixed effects

control for unobserved time-constant characteristics such as the character of the student body, the

quality of athletic programs, and neighborhood amenities, and the state and year fixed effects

control for demographic and market structure changes.                                  We also restrict the sample to

institutions that report admissions data in both t and t–1 to match those used our falsification

tests described in the next section.



7
    We also include a dummy variable for no application fee.


                                                               11
          Because membership may be endogenous, we estimate two-stage least squares models

using the insights generated from our diffusion model estimates.              We approximate CAPP

membership status in t–1 with a linear probability model and use membership and membership

rate in the state in t–2 and t–3. With this approach, we assume that these characteristics have no

effect on admissions outcomes other than through their effects on membership in t–1.


4 Empirical Results
4.1 Diffusion of CAPP Adoption
          We present our estimates for the baseline proportional hazards model in Table 2. We use

time-invariant independent variables (t=1974) to fix groups as they were before the CAPP

program. Only membership fee and network size are time-varying independent variables. The

left panel uses the full sample of institutions where the baseline hazard is allowed to vary by

Carnegie classification. The first column excludes institutional controls Xist and shows that the

conditional probability of adoption decreases by 25 percent for a one dollar increase in the

membership fee per enrolled student.8 We find suggestive evidence of network externalities

where a one percentage point increase in the membership rate in the state raises the hazard rate

by 2.2 percent. Because the average state in the sample has 13.6 private institutions, this implies

that an additional member in the network raises the hazard rate by 16.2 percent.

          Column 2 adds the set of institutional controls. In general, institutions with higher SAT

scores are more likely to adopt CAPP membership conditional on being at risk with a peak at

1320 SAT points (95th percentile). Institutions with higher rates of on-campus residence are also

more likely to adopt, perhaps because they have greater financial costs of falling below

enrollment targets. Institutions with a religious affiliation are less likely to adopt membership

because they are typically interested in a specific subset of potential applicants.


                   [Table 2. Proportional Hazards Model, Coefficient Estimates]


         We disaggregate the sample by Carnegie classification and SAT group in the middle and

right panels respectively. This approach relaxes the assumption that the coefficients between

groups are equal. PhD institutions are the only group that does not respond to the price of

membership, although this may be due to small sample size. Nevertheless, these institutions

typically have the greatest financial resources at their disposal. The conditional probability of

adoption increases with network size only for MA and middle SAT institutions which suggests

that they are the ones that benefit most from the network externalities that accompany CAPP

membership.

         We also estimate several variants of these models which are not formally presented here

but are available from the authors upon request. First, the construction of the membership fee

opens the possibility that the negative effects presented in Table 2 are due to the number of

applications rather than the cost of the innovation. When we control for institution size with log

applications or log enrollment, the negative effect of membership fee persists. Second, we

experiment with defining networks as competitors in the Census division or region because

prospective students are increasingly applying to colleges and universities outside their home

states (Hoxby 19997). We find evidence of network externalities at these broader geographic

levels that are similar to those using state-based networks.9 We also estimate models that use the

number of members in the network or whether a member in the network adopted the previous

year but do not find any evidence that they predict adoption. We take this as evidence against

the rival precedence behavior found in previous empirical adoption studies (Hannan and

McDowell 1987).

       Our results are also robust to using time-varying measures of all independent variables.

Because the non-parametric estimates in Figure 2 show that the hazard rates for MA and BA

institutions cross, we verify that the results are not an artifact of our missing data imputation

procedure that allocates Carnegie classification in 1988 to 1975–1987. Our results are robust to

artificially left-censoring the data in 1988.

       The sample also includes 25 institutions that join and then drop CAPP membership. We

estimate a probit model for the probability of dropping membership for the set of institutions that

ever adopt.    Using the same set of independent variables described above, we find that

institutions with smaller networks that had become CAPP members are more likely to eventually

drop their membership.


4.2 Admissions Outcomes
       We now turn to estimating the effects of CAPP membership on admissions outcomes.

We present the results from our OLS estimates in Table 3 where each column is a separate

regression for undergraduate admissions outcome k. Our main finding is that CAPP membership

in t–1 is associated with a 5.7 percent increase in applications (reported in t but occurring in t–1).

This is the first evidence that a reduction in the application price generates an increase in the

number of applications. We also find that CAPP membership is associated with a 5.2 percent

change in admittances and a 3.7 percent change in enrollment. When we estimate the effects on

the acceptance rate directly, we find no evidence of any membership effect.              In contrast,

membership is associated with a –2.8 percent change in yield rate. Our interpretation is that



                                                 14
institutional membership expands the applicant pool but draws in some applicants who are less

likely to enroll if admitted.


                [Table 3. OLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes]


        We also control for log application fee and log tuition in t–1. An increase in the

monetary application fee reduces applications with an own-price elasticity of –0.062.            An

interesting result is that charging a higher application fee increases yield rates, and our

interpretation is that higher application fees limit the applicant pool to more “serious” applicants.

This result is consistent with the negative effect of membership on yield rates. List tuition is

weakly negatively associated with enrollment, although we do not emphasize the results here due

to usual omitted ability problems (Dynarski 2002). We also find that the yield rate decreases

with the listed tuition which is consistent with Parker and Summers (1993).

        Institutional membership in CAPP may also generate changes in the characteristics of the

students that ultimately enroll at the institution. CAPP membership in t–1 is associated with a

1.1 percent decrease in mean SAT scores. We also find that membership is associated with a

15.4 percent change in the percent students of color and a 2.4 percent change in the percent Pell

Grant recipients. These results suggest that CAPP membership enables institutions to enroll a

more diverse study body by enrolling more students of color and those from low-income

households. This is consistent with previous evidence that low-income applicants benefit most

from increased information on the college application process (Avery and Kane 2004), but a

more rigorous test of this hypothesis should be conducted with applicant micro-level data.


      [Table 4. OLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes, Interaction Terms]




                                                 15
         We test whether the effects of membership on admissions outcomes varies by two key

institutional characteristics in Table 4. The top panel presents estimates for OLS specifications

that include the interaction between CAPP membership in t–1 and network size in t–1. We find

evidence of network externalities in that a one percentage point increase in the network size is

associated with a 0.1 percent increase in applications for CAPP members. We find similar

evidence of network externalities in that the acceptance rate falls with the network size in the

state.

         The bottom panel presents estimates that include the interaction between membership and

mean SAT score. Membership increases applications more at lower SAT institutions, perhaps

because applicants apply to more “safety” schools once the cost of doing so decreases. These are

also the institutions that may have trouble attracting students. Admittances increase more at

lower SAT member institutions which suggests that they expect the newly admitted students to

be less likely to matriculate or are further from their capacity constraints. Member institutions

with higher SAT scores experience a decrease in the acceptance rate which provides evidence

that it is the most selective institutions that benefit from membership in terms of USNWR

rankings. In addition, the yield rate declines less in absolute value at higher SAT score colleges

and universities. As expected, applicants that get into the most prestigious schools enroll there if

admitted. These results confirm the positive effects of network size and mean SAT score on the

hazard rate of adoption.


                [Table 5. 2SLS Membership Effects on Log Admissions Outcomes]


         The diffusion estimates presented in the previous subsection indicate that CAPP

membership is endogenous. To control for this endogeneity, Table 5 presents the IV estimates




                                                16
using membership status and membership rate in the state t–2 and t–3 instruments for

membership in t–1. This procedure has little effect on the CAPP membership coefficients.

Membership increases applications by 6.0 percent, admittances by 5.7 percent, and enrollment by

3.5 percent. There is also –3.7 percent change in yield rates. Lastly, we continue to find that

membership decreases SAT scores and increases the percent students of color but that it no

longer has any effect on the percent of Pell Grant recipients.


                              [Table 6. First Difference Falsification Tests]


       As a robustness check, we estimate a series of falsification tests based on the first

difference equation presented in Equation 4. Differencing current and one-year lagged CAPP

membership (t–1+l and t–2+l) implies that we are estimating the effect of adoption and not

membership on admissions outcome k. This approach will show whether membership effects are

consistent with the timing of adoption and whether the effects persist over time. A membership

effect associated with adoption that has not yet taken place would suggest that the program

evaluation estimates are misspecified.

                        l ∈ {− 2,−1,0,1,2}


       The estimates in Table 6 indicate that the effects of adoption occur at adoption. Adoption

in t–1 increases applications by 7.0 percent and admittances by 4.3 percent in t. There is no

effect on enrollment, but adoption last year decreases both acceptance rates and yield rates. The

lack of systematic significant effects for two or three year lagged adoption suggests that the

dynamics of membership effects are a one-time persistent jump at adoption. The non-significant



                                                         17
coefficients in the future suggest that there is no Ashenfelter-dip phenomenon taking place here

(Ashenfelter 1978).


5 Concluding Remarks
       We find evidence that Common Application membership is a strategic decision by

private colleges and universities. CAPP membership increases applications by 5.7 to 7 percent

and admittances by 4.3 to 5.9 percent. We find evidence of network externalities in that the

effects on applications and acceptance rates change with our measure of network size. These

results are consistent with the diffusion estimates that show the net benefit as measured by these

characteristics increase the hazard rate of adoption. Our analysis of CAPP membership supports

the hypothesis that the postsecondary education market has structurally evolved into a more

competitive marketplace.

       We also find that CAPP membership affects the composition of students that ultimately

enroll. In both OLS and two-stage least squares specifications, membership is associated with a

small decrease in SAT scores and a sizeable increase in the percent students of color. We also

find some evidence that membership is associated with a small increase in the percent of Pell

Grant recipients at the institution. These results suggest that the Common Application non-profit

organization has had some success in meeting its goals of increased access and equity.

       There are at least two limitations to our analysis. First, we do not address the fact that

many institutional members require applicants to complete supplemental forms. These forms

provide institutions with idiosyncratic information unavailable in the standardized application

form. In fact, unpublished data from the College Board from 2000 to 2004 shows that over half

of all institutions that accept the CAPP application form require applicants to complete at least

one supplemental form.      A second limitation is that many institutions accept the CAPP



                                               18
application form without actually paying the membership fee. However, the prevalence of this

activity is likely to decline over time because applicants are increasingly applying online – online

applications are submitted directly to the CAPP non-profit organization rather than the

institution. Both of these limitations suggest that our estimates are lower bounds on the true

effects of CAPP membership.
