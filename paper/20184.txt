We model contests with a fixed proportion of prizes, such as a grading curve, as all-pay auctions where
higher effort weakly increases the likelihood of a prize. We find theoretical predictions for the effect
of contest size on effort and test our predictions in a laboratory experiment that compares two-bidder
auctions with one prize and 20-bidder auctions with ten prizes. Our results demonstrate that larger
contests elicit lower effort by low-skilled students, but higher effort by high-skilled. Large contests
also generate more accurate rankings of students and more accurate assignment of high grades to the
high-skilled.

    Consider a student deciding how much effort to devote to a course graded
on the curve. Aside from her intrinsic motivation, she must consider her
innate ability, the abilities of her classmates, and the percentage of students
she believes will receive each grade. So, while some elements of her choice are
unaffected by the choices of her classmates, many elements of her choice are
strategic. This paper explores one specific element of that strategic choice:
how the enrollment in the course affects the selection of effort. We will model
this environment as an all-pay auction, with the enrollment of the course being
the number of bidders in the auction and the number of “A” grades being the
number of prizes in the auction.
    Within the education community there is little discussion about the effect of
enrollment on student strategic incentives. The education literature examines
the impact of enrollment by proxy by exploring the effects of student-teacher
ratio on test scores (Mosteller, 1995), attendance (Romer, 1993), and future
earnings (Card and Krueger, 1996; Carniero and Heckman, 2003). The lit-
erature directly considers enrollment by estimating its impact on the grades
assigned to students (Kokkelenberg, Dillon, and Christy, 2006), but frames
the argument in terms of diseconomies of scale for teaching output, ignoring
changing strategic incentives for student effort.
    This gap in the literature can be attributed to the fact that much of the
education research explicitly or implicitly assumes non-strategic interaction
between students. Under this assumption, students will only react to changes
in enrollment to the degree that enrollment affects the inputs—such as stu-
dent teacher ratio—of their production function. Beginning with Becker and
Rosen (1992), however, another branch of the literature arose and formalized
students’ incentives to select effort strategically when a course is graded ac-
cording to an explicit curve. This framework generates testable predictions
for courses that move from non-strategic to strategic settings. Paredes (2012)
finds significant explanatory power in these predictions and discovers that
students are indeed sensitive to a change between strategic and non-strategic
environments. We hope to take this discussion of strategic sophistication in
the classroom one step further and investigate students’ reactions to subtle


                                       1
changes within the strategic classroom environment in a way that can be pre-
dicted by game theoretic models1 .
    In everything from college admissions2 , to scholarship awards3 , to teacher
salaries within schools4 we see contests that use proportional awarding despite
large differences in the number of participants. There appears to be an insen-
sitivity among mechanism designers to the impact of contest size on behavior.
We will show here, both theoretically and through an experimental test, that
there are significant effects of a contest’s size on individual effort even when
the proportion of awards to participants is fixed. To fix ideas, our discussion
will center on the application of this result to the practice of grading on a
curve, but the results apply to a much more general class of contests. We will
return to more general applications later in the paper.


1       Background
The branch of economics investigating competitive interaction with costly ef-
fort and uncertain payoffs began when Tullock (1967) and Krueger (1974)
adapted the strategic framework of Nash (1951) to generate analytical predic-
tions for wars of attrition and competitive rent-seeking, respectively. Within
this field, there are three prominent models of competitive interaction, the
rank-order tournament, the Tullock contest, and the all-pay auction.
    1
      While our model and experiment exist within an environment with a strict grading
curve, we believe that our results apply to all courses, even when instructors adhere to a
less-strict grading curve. This is because the reality of modern education is such that relative
position will always hold some influence over grades. Thus a rational student will certainly
be aware of the significance of her relative position regardless of what her absolute position
may be. Therefore, enrollment in a course affects not only the inputs to the student’s
production function, but also the strategic environment in which she operates.
    2
      For example, in Texas, House Bill 588 grants high school students automatic admission
to any state university if they graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. In Kansas,
the top 1/3 gain automatic admission. In California, high school students in the top 9% of
their graduating class are guaranteed admission one of the University of California schools.
    3
      As an example, the Bright Flight scholarship program in Missouri awards scholarships
to high school seniors who score in the top 3% on their SAT or ACT tests.
    4
      In North Carolina, Senate Bill 402 Section 9.6 (g) stipulates that each school admin-
istration must select the top performing 25% of their teachers to receive more favorable
contracts.


                                               2
    In the decades since this field began, the breadth of applications has ex-
panded well beyond the original motivating examples. Lazear and Rosen
(1981) explore tournaments as optimal labor contracts. Becker and Rosen
(1992) then consider relative grading to be a form of tournament and compare
its results to those of an absolute grading scheme. Hillman and Riley (1989)
and Baye, Kovenock, and de Vries (1993) model political rent-seeking as a
form of all-pay auction. Amann and Leininger (1996) expand, and simplify
to an extent, the model by introducing incomplete information as a form of
Harsanyi (1973) purification, which allows for an equilibrium in pure strate-
gies. It was not until Baye, Kovenock, and de Vries (1996), however, that the
all-pay auction received a full characterization of its equilibrium, though the
result offered no strong predictions, rather finding that there exists a contin-
uum of equilibria in the model.
    Moldovanu and Sela (2001) theoretically explore the optimal allocation
of prizes in a contest given different objectives of the mechanism designer.
Siegel (2009) makes great strides in generalizing the nature of contests and
the equilibrium actions of contestants. More recently, Olszewski and Siegel
(2013) theoretically address a very similar question to ours when they develop
equilibrium predictions for large but finite contests.


1.1    Experimental results
A complete recounting of experimental evidence on all-pay auctions, rank-
order tournaments, and related contests can be found in a review by Dechenaux,
Kovenock, and Sheremeta (2012). For the sake of brevity, we will discuss only
the most relevant experiments here.
    Bull, Schotter, and Weigelt (1987) first brought rank-order tournaments
into the laboratory, finding that bidders approached the equilibrium after
learning, but demonstrated surprisingly high variance. Equilibrium predictions
for all-pay auction experiments, on the other hand, have consistently missed
the mark. Potters, de Vries, and van Winden (1998), Davis and Reilly (1998),
Gneezy and Smorodinsky (2006), Barut, Kovenock, and Noussair (2002) all


                                       3
find substantial over-dissipation of rents, that is, aggregate bidding that ex-
ceeds the aggregate value of the prizes. Other papers introduce heterogeneity
in the valuations of bidders, (Müller and Schotter, 2010; and Noussair and Sil-
ver, 2006), and find similar over-dissipation, but also find that bidders begin
to separate themselves by type, with stark differences appearing in the bidding
strategies of high- and low-valuation bidders.
     With optimal contest design in mind, several papers have looked at the
impact of small changes in the number of opponents on the effort selection of
bidders (Gneezy and Smorodinsky, 2006; Müller and Schotter, 2010; Barut et
al., 2002), but each of these allows the proportion of winners to change with the
number of participants. Meaning that the ex ante equilibrium probability of
receiving a prize changes with the size of the auction. Harbring and Irlenbusch
(2005) make small variations in the size of tournaments while holding constant
the proportion of winners, but they employ a convex cost function, common
values, and a cap on the maximum effort choice. To our knowledge, no paper
has ever focused on the policy implications of combining or separating multiple
contests while maintaining the proportion of winners. We wish to address
this gap in the literature by restricting our analysis to situations where the
proportion of prizes to participants is fixed and testing the effects of a large-
scale change in the number of participants in the contest on the effort selection
of those participants. This specific focus allowed us to design the experiment
in a way that more precisely captures systematic effort changes across contests
of different sizes.


2    Theoretical Model
In an all-pay auction, players simultaneously place irreversible bids for one
of a limited number of prizes. Bidders must pay their bids regardless of the
outcome of the auction. Since prizes are awarded to the highest bidders, an
increase in the bid weakly increases the probability of receiving a prize.




                                       4
2.1    Grading on a curve as an all-pay auction
While the economic study of all-pay auctions began as a model motivated by
the examples of competitive rent-seeking behavior seen in lobbying efforts and
research and development contests, the intuition behind the all-pay auction
can naturally extend into other settings such as a course graded on a curve,
job promotions, the allocation of bonuses among workers in a firm, or the
method of awarding grants to applicants. Indeed, the framework of analysis
can be applied to any environment with costly, deterministic effort and proba-
bilistically awarded prizes. In a course graded on the curve, for example, each
student in a classroom casts a “bid” by studying a given amount. These bids
are measured against each other, and the students who cast the highest bids
are awarded the “prizes” of higher grades.
    There is an interesting question regarding changes in the number of par-
ticipants of the contest. What are the independent effects of the number of
participants on the effort chosen by each participant? Is the effect dependent
on the ability of the student? How well do outcomes of the contest reflect the
true relative ranking of participants’ abilities when only effort is observable?
Translated, does the course enrollment affect a student’s effort in studying?
Does it affect high-skilled students differently from low-skilled students? Is
there an enrollment level where effort choices are more or less reflective of
students’ abilities? For each of these questions we will provide a theoretical
prediction and a result from a controlled laboratory study. With these results
established, we hope to encourage contest designers to take into account our
insights about the independent effects of a contest’s size.


2.2    Definitions and procedures
Let us suppose a contest environment with independent private values in the
style of Vickrey (1961). Suppose the contest features N bidders competing for
M prizes, with M < N . For simplicity, call the number of participants the
size of the contest. Participants have varying levels of ability, and the cost
of a given level of effort decreases as a participant’s ability increases, making


                                       5
the surplus value of a prize higher for the higher ability participants. Since
effort choices are invariant to affine transformations of the utility function, we
can model heterogeneous costs of effort as heterogeneous values from winning
prizes. Call this value of winning a player’s valuation, vi , and suppose that it
is drawn privately from a commonly known distribution, F (vi ). Under incom-
plete information no participant has access to the vector of other participants’
true abilities, v⃗−i . Effort is measured by a participant’s bid value, bi , and is
costly regardless of the outcome of the auction. Auctions are one-shot, and
bids are cast simultaneously, so bidders have no ability to condition their effort
on other bids. The auctioneer determines the number of bidders and prizes in
the same way that an administrator might choose the enrollment of a course.
In order to optimally design the mechanism, the designer must take into ac-
count the effect that the number of participants has on the predicted effort
levels.
    With incomplete information about the valuations of other bidders, we
can generate a symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies. At
equilibrium, there exists a continuous optimal bidding function, B(vi ), that
maps from the valuation space onto the bidding space: B : vi → bi , where
vi ∈ [0, 1] and bi ∈ [0, 1]. Let PN,M (bi ) be the probability that bid bi will win
a prize in an auction with N participants and M prizes.


2.3    Bidder’s Utility
For simplicity, we assume risk neutrality. We show in the appendix that the
qualitative results generalize to risk aversion.5 A bidder’s utility is:
           U (bi ; vi , N, M ) =PN,M (bi )(vi − bi ) + (1 − PN,M (bi )) (−bi ),
                             =vi × PN,M (bi ) − bi                                (1)
    In this auction, the M bidders with the highest bids will each receive one of
the prizes. Therefore the probability of receiving a prize is weakly increasing
in the amount bid by construction.
  5
   The generalization, however, does require common knowledge of risk aversion, common
knowledge of rationality, and shared risk aversion parameters.


                                            6
Proposition 1: Optimal Bidding is Weakly Monotonic in Valuation

Proof: See Appendix6 .
    Under monotonicity, there exists a probability function that maps valu-
ations to probabilities of winning the auction. Denote this function ZN,M :
vi → [0, 1]. This function will represent the probability that a bidder’s valua-
tion is higher than the valuations of at least N − M of the opposing bidders.
Mathematically, this is expressed in the form of an order-statistic:

                             ∑
                             N −1    (                    )
                                           (N − 1)!
          ZN,M (vi ) =                                        F (vi )k (1 − F (vi ))N −1−k ,
                         k=N −M
                                         (N − 1 − k)!k!

where F (vi ) is the cumulative distribution function of the valuations.


2.4       Optimal Bidding Function
So far, we have assumed that a symmetric bidding function, B : vi → R+ ,
exists, is well-defined, and continuous. We then demonstrated its monotonic-
ity. Continuous, monotone functions are invertible, implying that there exists
a function, B −1 (bi ), that maps bids cast into the valuations implied by those
bids. Denote this inverse function V (bi ).
    To demonstrate the optimality of this bidding function, the bidding func-
tion must solve the first order condition of the bidder’s utility,

                              U (bi ; vi ) = vi × ZN,M (V (bi )) − bi ,                               (2)

where ZN,M (V (bi )) captures the bidder’s incentive to misrepresent his valua-
tion by casting a higher or lower bid than what his bidding function would
prescribe. At equilibrium this term must be equal to ZN,M (vi ). Maximizing
Equation (2) with respect to bi returns

                  [            (                     )                                            ]

                                                                    k

Since V (bi ) ≡ B −1 (bi ), it follows that, V ′1(bi ) = B ′ (vi ).

3         Experimental Model
Equation (3) provides general results and implications for any values of N
and M and cumulative distribution F (vi ). In our experiment, we will be
testing the following two pairs: (N, M ) = (2, 1) and (20, 10) with valuations
uniformly distributed, vi ∼ U [0, 1]. The distributional assumption is without
loss of generality, since the analysis is identical under any distribution, though
the exact values of our predictions will vary with the distribution chosen. We
will now proceed to derive closed-form solutions for the bidding functions of
these two pairs.


3.1       Bidding Functions
Proceeding from Equation (3) and substituting in N = 2, M = 1, F (vi ) = vi
gives us

                                             8
                                                 B ′ (vi ) = vi .

Solving the differential equation yields7

Solving this differential equation results in the optimal bidding function:

    Technically, B(vi ) = 2i + C, however, we can use dominance to show that C = 0.
Suppose that C > 0. Therefore, in equilibrium, a bidder with valuation vi = 0 will make
a bid, bi > 0. That bid guarantees a negative payoff, so the same bidder would be made
better off by deviating and choosing bi = 0 , which guarantees a zero payoff. Thus, C ≤ 0.
But, we restrict bids to positive values so C = 0.

    To understand the intuition behind the shapes of the bidding functions,
consider first the limit case where we maintain the proportion of prizes to
participants (M = N2 ), but let N → ∞. In this case, the bidding function will
look like a step function, where all bidders with vi < $10 bid near-zero and
all bidders with vi > $10 bid near bi = $10. This is because only the top half
of bidders receive prizes, so bidders below the median should best respond by
bidding as little as possible, and bidders above the median should bid only
just enough that they are guaranteed a prize.8 The minimum winning bid in
this case is equal to the valuation of the median participant, vi = $10.
    Since our large auction is ten times the size of the small auction, the Law
of Large Numbers will draw it closer to the limit case. That is, the distri-
bution of valuations in the larger auction is expected to be more reflective of
the underlying probability distribution than the distribution of valuations in
the smaller auction. This convergence will cause the median of the realized
distribution in the larger auction to be closer to the median of the probability
distribution, giving less uncertainty to the minimum bid required to win a
prize in the larger auction.
    Bearing in mind this lower level of uncertainty in the larger auction, con-
sider the net benefit of lowering a bid from the limit case of bi = $10 for a
bidder with vi > $10 in each of our auctions. These costs depend both on the
auction’s size and the bidder’s valuation. In either auction, the marginal bene-
fit of lowering a bid is constant, since bids are paid with certainty, so foregone
bids are recovered with certainty. On the other hand, the marginal cost of
lowering a bid is paid stochastically by lowering the probability of winning a
prize. For high-valuation bidders, this decrease in probability is greater in the
large auction than in the small auction, so bids cast by high-valuation bidders
are larger in the large auction.
    Bidders with low valuations face the constant cost of increasing their bid
from the limit case of bi = $0 and the probabilistic benefit of increasing the
likelihood of receiving a prize. At low enough valuations, bidders see greater
   8
   In the limit case equilibrium, the marginal player will be mixing to ensure that bidders
above the median maintain their bids of $10 instead of cheating down towards $0.

increases in the probability of winning a prize in the small auction, so bids in
the small auction rise above those of the large auction.910


4       Experimental Hypotheses
Principally, a test of our model is a specific test that bidders behave according
to the risk-neutral Nash Equilibrium displayed in Figure 1, but we can also
consider several more general predictions of the model. We will restrict our
focus to predictions that could serve as components of a mechanism designer’s
objective function. We have identified three such objectives for which our
model generates predictions that our experimental data can put to the test.
Objective 1 is the total effort of the subjects, Objective 2 is the distribution
of effort across subject types, and Objective 3 is the ability of the auction to
create an accurate ranking of subjects based on their effort alone.
    In the event that the equilibrium prediction holds exactly, these objectives
will also match their predictions exactly. But, even if the precise equilibrium
prediction is rejected by statistical tests, the relative predictions about the
effects of contest size may still be informative for the policy debate about
the merits of different class sizes. Thus, we will test the objectives of the
mechanism designer independently of the equilibrium test.

Hypothesis: Equilibrium predictions hold

Given the complexity of the equilibrium bidding functions, strict hypotheses
about equilibrium bidding seem overly restrictive. In addition to the computa-
    9
      Surprisingly, the equilibrium is not strongly affected by adding in risk-aversion to the
bidders’ utilities, as shown in the appendix. This results mainly from the fact that bidding
is driven mostly by changes in probability, which is unaffected by risk aversion, not changes
in surplus, which is affected by risk aversion. See Figure ?? for a graph of the equilibrium
bidding functions under common risk aversion parameters.
   10
      In the appendix, we also include a graph of the equilibrium under a common joy-of-
winning value. Trivially, this improves the fit of our model to the data. This is mechanical,
since the joy-of-winning specification is simply the Nash Equilibrium specification with an
added degree of freedom. We do not include this specification of the model in the discussion,
because it provides no alternative qualitative predictions for us to compare with the Nash
Equilibrium model.


                                             12
tional difficulty, there appears to be no obvious heuristic that subjects might
adopt. We might believe that our subjects could instinctively discover the
equilibrium through experimentation, but even with experience, the complex-
ity of the bidding functions makes a tight fit between the data and the theory
unlikely in either auction size. Nonetheless, we will consider equilibrium as a
starting point and move from there to the more general objectives identified
below.


4.1    Qualitative Predictions: The Designer’s Objectives
Objective 1: Maximize aggregate bidding.

In our education example, this means maximizing the total effort of students.
Our equilibrium bidding function predicts that aggregate bidding will be higher
in the larger auction. Increasing the size of the auction gives bidders less un-
certainty about the valuation of the minimum winning bidder. With tighter
predictions about the minimum winning bidder’s valuation, bidders face higher
probabilistic costs when decreasing their bids, which raises bids for the major-
ity of bidders and increases the rent dissipation.

Objective 2: Generate the desired distribution of bids.

Translated into the education context, this implies that the instructor may
value effort exerted by one type of student over another. For example, the
instructor may prefer a mechanism that promotes effort by low-ability stu-
dents. As the auction size increases and the uncertainty decreases, we expect
bids in the larger auction to dominate for high valuations. At the same time,
among bidders with low valuations, the decrease in uncertainty drives the bids
towards zero in the large auction. Therefore, we expect to see higher bids
in the small auction across low valuations. Our equilibrium predictions place
the crossover point at vi = $8.48. This point corresponds to the point of
intersection between the optimal bidding functions in Figure 1.




                                      13
Objective 3: Accurately order the valuations of bidders based only
on their bids.

An instructor may wish to employ the mechanism that generates the most
accurate ordering of his students’ unobservable abilities based only on their
observable effort. Indeed, any mechanism designer may have a desire to rank
of bidders, inferring their true abilities by their bids. Thus, regardless of the
outcome of any one auction, the designer wants to be able to infer the true
ranking of abilities across auctions from only the bids cast. Our theory asserts
that, in equilibrium, there should be a one-to-one, monotonic matching of bids
to valuations for both auctions, making the bids a perfect proxy for relative
ability. In practice, deviations from the equilibrium bid will almost surely make
the inferred ranking imprecise. Therefore, one objective of an instructor might
be to employ the mechanism that minimizes the impact of these deviations on
the accuracy of the ordering of bidders.


5     Experimental Procedures
To test the sensitivity of effort to a change in the size of a contest, we employ
an independent private value all-pay auction with multiple prizes. We use a
paired bidding design similar to Kagel and Levin (1993) and Andreoni, Che,
and Kim (2007) in which we elicit bids for both the large auction and the
small auction from all bidders every round. Using this design, we can pair
data perfectly and analyze the difference in bidding at each valuation rather
than relying on subject fixed effects for statistical power. These pairs also give
us more power to test our hypotheses about the relative levels of bids at any
point in the distribution of valuations.


5.1    Recruitment and Participation
60 undergraduate students from the University of California, San Diego partic-
ipated in our experiment. We recruited all of our subjects by means of online
advertisements on the EconLab website. The experiment was conducted in 3

                                       14
sessions in February of 2013 in the EconLab at UCSD. Each session required
exactly 20 subjects. All subjects received a $20 participation payment in ad-
dition to the money gained or lost in the experiment. Our sessions lasted
approximately 90 minutes, and subjects earned between $15 and $45.


5.2    Instructions
We first read the instructions aloud to all subjects and then administered a
quiz to test their comprehension of the auction formats and the payoffs from
different outcomes. The instructions and quiz can be found in the appendix.
    We designed instructions to clarify the means by which we awarded prizes
and the payoffs conditional on receiving or not receiving a prize. We carried
out the entire experiment on computers using the Z-Tree Economics Software
(Fischbacher, 1999). This allowed us to keep key instructions posted at the top
of every decision screen. Specifically, we reminded subjects that any bid would
be deducted from their winnings regardless of the outcome of the auction, and
that their final payment for the experiment would be based on one round
selected at random. We reinforced the number of opponents they faced and
the number of prizes available in each round. We also reminded subjects
that they would see two auctions for each valuation they drew, first the small
auction, then the large auction.


5.3    Auction Design
Every round, subjects received valuations drawn uniformly in 1 cent incre-
ments between $.01 and $20.00. That is, vi ∼ U [$.01 , $20.00]. With this
valuation, subjects participated in both a “2-Person Auction,” for which they
were randomly and anonymously paired, and a “20-Person Auction,” which
consisted of all participants.
   Subjects cast bids for both auctions in each round. Subjects were re-
peatedly reminded of the two auctions they would see and the order. Upon
submission of both bids, we revealed the auction outcomes to the subjects.
This included the subject’s own payoffs from both auctions as well as all bids

                                      15
cast by all bidders in both auctions that round. All bids were cast without
knowledge of opponents’ bids or valuations, so we consider them simultaneous
bids under incomplete information. No communication was allowed, and we
never revealed the valuations associated with any bids.
    The auction stage was repeated 20 times in session 1 and 15 times in ses-
sions 2 and 3. In every repetition, subjects drew new valuations and new pairs
were randomly assigned. For the sake of uniformity, we exclusively analyze
the first 15 rounds of each session, but our results only strengthen with the
inclusion of the final 5 rounds of the first session.11
    After completing the auction rounds, subjects made 3 incentivized choices
between gambles in order to elicit their preference for risk. We employed a
discretization of the method detailed in Andreoni & Harbaugh (2009). These
measures of risk aversion will be used as a control in the analysis.


6      Results
With 15 rounds in which subjects drew valuations and cast bids in two different
auctions, we collected a total of 900 different valuations and 1800 different bids.
For the analysis, however, we will drop any bid that exceeds the valuation of
the bidder. These bids guaranteed a negative profit for the bidders. There
are 14 such bids across both auction sizes. The dropped bids were evenly
distributed across periods and auction sizes. It is not clear if they resulted
from typing errors, confusion, apathy, or a desire to win at any cost. We will
indicate when our analysis is substantively affected by removing these bids.
    Figure 2 graphs the bidding behavior in the 2-Person and 20-Person Auc-
tions. We split valuations split into 10 different, equally sized bins. Adjacent
dots represent bidding in different auction sizes for bidders with the same val-
uations. They are placed alongside each other to facilitate comparison. Every
dot represents the mean bid for that bin with the 95% confidence intervals

    We planned each session to fit 20 rounds into 90 minutes. During the first session we
discovered that 20 rounds would not work due to a slow server. The second and third session
were shortened to accommodate this.

6.1           Hypotheses
It is clear from Figure 2 that, on average, our subjects performed rather closely
to the risk neutral Nash Equilibrium predictions. Despite this, when we test
the difference between observed bids and the bids predicted by the Nash Equi-
librium we can reject equilibrium bidding in both the small (t = 7.03, p < .001,
n = 893) and large (t = 4.73, p < .001, n = 893) auctions.12 If we employ a
  12
    We calculate the difference between the observed bid and the predicted bid and perform
an uncontrolled linear regression with standard errors clustered at the individual level. The
statistics of the constant capture the mean deviation. It is that set of statistics that are
reported.


                                             17
seemingly more conservative notion of over-bidding and consider the revenue
of a given round as the unit of observation, we can reject equilibrium bidding
at an even higher significance level in both the small (t = 10.46, p < .001,
n = 45) and large (t = 5.82, p < .001, n = 45) auctions.
    Of course, one should not be surprised that in this unique environment
with complex and precise predictions, our model fails these statistical tests.
As the literature on auction experiments reveals, the theory often provides a
good benchmark but seldom predicts precise outcomes. Indeed, as we noted
in regards to Figure 2, the qualitative features of the theory are captured by
the plotted bids. We frame our objectives in terms of the relative performance
of the two auction sizes, so, while noisy behavior may be enough to cause
our statistical tests to reject the equilibrium prediction, it may not affect the
relative performance with respect to our stated objectives. Therefore, the
question becomes whether, despite the lack of a precise fit, the qualitative
predictions of our model and the intuitions gleaned from our theory extend
to the observed data. We will explore this question within the context of the
following three objectives.

Objective 1: Maximize aggregate bidding.

In 33 of the 45 rounds, relative revenues were consistent with our theory. That
is, the larger auction generated greater bidding than the smaller auction. We
perform a paired t-test on the difference in total revenue between auctions and
find that the larger auctions generate significantly more revenue (t = 4.74,
p < .001, n = 45). Our paired design allows us to test this hypothesis on
the individual level and perform a paired t-test that matches each bid in the
large auction with its counterpart in the small auction. We can reject the
null hypothesis of equal bidding in both auctions, in favor of the alternate
hypothesis that bidding in the large auction is significantly larger than bidding
in the small auction (t = 5.02, p < .001, n = 888).13
  13
    These results are unchanged by including all outlying bids except one particularly ex-
treme outlier, where the bid was 9,900 times the valuation of the bidder.




                                           18
Objective 2: Generate the desired distribution of bids.

Our model predicts that bids in the small auction will be greater than bids in
the large auction for all vi < $8.48. Figure 3 graphs the predicted difference
along with the observed mean differences across 10 equally spaced bins. While
the magnitudes are clearly attenuated, the qualitative predictions appear to
be captured quite well.

                         Figure 3: Bidding Differences

    We test this prediction more formally in three ways. First by estimating
the point at which bids in the large auction cross over bids in the small auction,
second with a direct test of the sign of the bidding difference predicted by our
model at the theoretical and fitted crossover points, and finally with a test
of the relative revenues on either side of the theoretical and fitted crossover
points.

    To estimate the valuation at which bids in the large auction begin to dom-
inate those of the small auction, we perform a random effects regression of the
difference in bids on the valuation of the bidder to the first, second, and third
power.14 The regression results can be seen in Table 1.

    Using these results, we can predict the difference in bids at each valuation,
and determine at what valuation the predicted difference is equal to zero. Call
this point the fitted crossover point. The predicted difference in bids is plotted
in Figure 4. Notice that the shape of the predicted difference in bids captures
many of the characteristics of the equilibrium predictions, but with a smaller
magnitude. From Figure 4 you can see that our fitted crossover valuation is
vi ≈ $5.32, and our theoretical crossover valuation is vi ≈ $8.48.
    To test if our model accurately predicts the relative levels of bidding on
either side of the theoretical crossover, vi = $8.48, we will split our data into
two bins, one on each side of the crossover point. We generate a dummy vari-
able, LowerBin, to indicate valuations below the crossover. To best exploit
our paired data, our dependent variable will be the difference between the bid
in the small auction and the bid in the large auction. Our theory predicts
that the difference will be positive until vi = $8.48 and negative afterwards.
  14
    We can use random-effects instead of fixed-effects because our valuations were randomly
assigned and so are mechanically uncorrelated with other explanatory variables.

We regress this difference onto LowerBin and risk aversion controls using a
random effects regression with subject-specific random effects terms. Mathe-
matically,
                  Di,t = β0 + β1 LowerBini + ρRAi,t + ϵi,t ,             (4)
where

and

RAi,t = {α1,i , α2,i , α3,i , α1,i ×LowerBini,t , α2,i ×LowerBini,t , α3,i ×LowerBini,t }.
The results can be seen in the left-hand side of Table 2.
  15
    Here the set, RAI,t , is a set of risk aversion parameters and interactions between those
parameters and the lower bin. We generate the interactions because there is no overall
directional prediction for risk averse bidders as some bids are predicted to increase and
some predicted to decrease. The appendix includes a longer discussion of risk aversion.

   Repeating this analysis with the fitted crossover point is straightforward.
We generate a new dummy variable, LowerF ittedBin, for valuations below
the fitted crossover point, vi = $5.32, and replicate Equation (4) replacing
LowerBin with LowerF ittedBin, and interacting our risk aversion measures
with the new bin. The results are found on the right-hand side of Table 2.

    The difference in bids in the upper bin is captured by the constant, while
the difference in bids in the lower bin is captured by the sum of the constant
and the coefficient of the dummy variable for LowerBin. Clearly, the differ-
ence in bids in the upper bin is large in magnitude and highly statistically
significant. This difference in bids is also statistically distinguishable from the
same difference in the lower bin. However, the difference in bids in the lower
bin is not statistically distinguishable from zero. Recall Figure 3, which graphs
the predicted differences in the bidding functions. We can see that there are
not large differences in the equilibrium predictions for bidders with low val-
uations, so it is not surprising that we failed to find a significant difference
from zero for these bidders. For valuations just above the median, however,
we predict large differences between bids cast in the different auction sizes,
and this separation shows up strongly in both statistical tests, and graphical

analysis.16
   Finally, we consider the distribution of revenues for the two auction sizes.
We split revenues according to the same theoretical and fitted crossover points
as before, and report revenues from the large auction as a percentage of rev-
enues from the small auction. Our results can be seen in Table 3. The first
two columns represent either side of the theoretical crossover point, and the
second two columns represent either side of the fitted crossover point.


   Table 3: Mean revenue in the large auction relative to the small auction
                      vi ≤ $8.48       vi > $8.48        vi ≤ $5.32           vi > $5.32
 Large/Small             94%              114%              89%                  113%
 To calculate the percentage, we divided bidders using the cutoff valuation and summed all bids
 within a period in that interval in each auction. We then divided the aggregate bidding in the
 large auction by the aggregate bidding in the small auction for each interval. We report the
 mean of this percentage across all 45 pairs of auctions here.


   On average, the general predictions of the model with respect to relative
revenue hold quite well. The interval of valuations over which we predict
greater revenues from the large auction do indeed have greater revenues from
the large auctions, do indeed dominate, and the same is true for the small
auction. These results demonstrate that on aggregate and individually the
predictions of the model capture many distributional characteristics of the
data.

Objective 3: Accurately order the valuations of bidders based only
on their bids.

As indicated by Figure 1, we expect bidders in the larger auction with low
valuations to pool near zero, and bidders with high valuations to pool near
$10. In the smaller auction we expect a more gradual increase of bids, which
means that the predicted bids of any two bidders are less likely to be very close
to each other in the small auction than in the large auction. This provides
  16
    These results are also unchanged with the inclusion of all outlying bids except for the
particularly extreme outlier mentioned in objective 1.


                                               23
an advantage to the small auction with respect to maintaining a well ordered
sorting of bidders in the presence of errors. On the other hand, bids in the
large auction pool at opposite ends of the bidding space. This provides an
advantage to the larger auction as it creates a greater distinction between bids
by high- and low-valuation bidders.
    In venturing down the path of off-equilibrium dynamic responses to bid-
ding, it becomes clear that our model can no longer provide strong predictions,
and the intuition gleaned above represents the fullest extent to which we are
comfortable speculating.
    We test which auction best accomplishes Objective 3 with Kendall’s (1938)
tau rank correlation coefficient, K-T. The K-T coefficient measures the rela-
tionship between the number of concordant pairs, C, and discordant pairs, D,
in a sample with N observations. Mathematically, the K-T coefficient is

                                             C −D
                                    K=(                  ).
                                             N ×(N −1)
                                                 2

    A pair of bids in a given auction is concordant if the ranking of the two bids
is consistent with the ranking of the valuations of the bidders (bi < bj ⇐⇒
vi < vj ), while a pair of bids is discordant if it is inconsistent with the rankings
of the bidders’ valuations (bi > bj ⇐⇒ vi < vj ) 17 18
    The K-T coefficients and their significance tests for the pooled data are
reported in the first and second row of Table 4. We then split the data by
period and generate the K-T coefficient for each auction in that period before
running a pairwise analysis of the two auctions.19
  17
     We can also make a correction found in Kendall (1970) that accommodates ties in bids
or in valuations. The signs and significance of our results are maintained or increased under
this specification.
  18
     A possibly more recognizable test of rank-correlation is the Spearman (1904) coefficient.
We have chosen Kendall’s tau for two reasons: First, Spearman’s coefficient is more heavily
influenced by outliers. This will bias our results in the direction of the large auction, since
there are many more outlying bids in the small auction. Second, Kendall’s tau has a more
straightforward interpretation.
   Repeating the analysis using Spearman’s coefficient returns the same signs, but with
larger magnitudes.
  19
     Given that we have 45 pairs of K-T statistics, we invoke the Central Limit Theorem
and perform a standard t-test on the difference between the pairs.

    Our results show that the ability to generate a perfect ordering of valuations
based only on bids is compromised in both the large and small auctions, but
unevenly so. Observing a properly ordered pair of bids is roughly 55% more
likely than observing an improperly ordered pair of bids in the small auction,
while in the large auction the percentage is closer to 59%. The difference
in likelihood is highly statistically significant. Changing the unit of analysis
from individual bids to means across auctions has no meaningful effect on the
magnitude or significance of the coefficients.
    Digging deeper into the K-T coefficients reveals some of the mechanisms
that drive bids out of their well-ordered ranking. While the small auction
equilibrium bidding function showed a more gradual increase in Figure 1, the
larger auction showed starker contrasts between bids of high- and low-valuation
bidders. These competing mechanisms are clearly visible in the data.
    Consider two groups of bidders, those above the median of the distribution
and those below it, call them expected winners and expected losers. Rows 1
and 3 of Table 5 report the K-T coefficients for expected winners and losers,
respectively. Clearly, the coefficients within a group are much different than
the pooled coefficients reported in Table 4, and indeed are relatively more fa-
vorable towards the small auction. In the second row, we maintain the interval
length, but now compare sorting between expected winners and losers. This
sorting strongly favors the larger auction, indicating that bidders identified

                                           25
the probabilistic distinction of expected outcomes more in the larger auction,
causing them to separate based on the side of the median on which their valu-
ation lies. This separation is consistent with the predicted influence of the law
of large numbers. These two sorting mechanisms closely follow the intuition
of our model, which demonstrates that the larger auction should see pooling
among expected winners and losers, but strong separation of the two groups,
while the smaller auction should see more gradual separation of all types along
the distribution.

    Interpreting Table 4 in light of the results from Table 5 gives us insight
into the relative strengths of each sorting mechanism. It appears that as
the auction size grows, the superior sorting into expected winners and losers
dominates the diminished sorting within expected winners and losers.


7      Discussion
Our results show that subjects are sensitive to changes in the size of their
competitive environment in a way that closely follows many predictions of our
model. While choices are statistically different than the Nash equilibrium,
the comparative static predictions generated by our model served as useful
benchmarks in our analysis.


                                              26
    Taking our results from the abstract environment and returning them to
the environment of an undergraduate course will provide context and useful
policy recommendations. We would be remiss if we failed to offer a caveat to
our interpretation: our analysis takes all other inputs as held equal. That is,
we abstract away from systematic correlations between the quality of inputs
to the students’ production function and the size of the classroom. Of course,
in any discussion of policy these correlations will need to be weighed against
the effects we discovered. We do not feel that the effects we uncovered trump
other effects of classroom size, but by bringing them to light we will allow
policy-makers to factor them into the discussion of optimal classroom size.
    Recall that we supposed that administrators were restricted to fixed pro-
portions of students receiving each grade, but were given flexibility with re-
spect to the enrollment of the course. Since the larger auctions generated
more revenue, we predict that, conditional on a relative grading scheme, larger
classes will likewise generate greater effort from students. In smaller classes,
the greater uncertainty surrounding the minimum effort required for a given
grade may cause students to strategically lower their effort. This could be in
an attempt to exploit the randomness of the environment, an effect of loss
aversion, or a discouragement effect from previously receiving a low grade de-
spite substantial investment of effort. In larger classes, however, there is less
uncertainty about the minimum effort required for a given grade, and students
will likely respond by increasing their effort to match this minimum required
effort for their desired grade.
    Aggregate effort, however, may not be the primary goal of the instructor.
We demonstrated that the distribution of effort was strongly affected by the
size of the contest in the direction predicted by our model. From our results, we
can infer that high ability students will likely offer higher effort in larger classes,
while students with lower-middle abilities may exert slightly more effort in
smaller classes. Unfortunately, our data do not provide strong predictions for
how the lowest ability students will respond to changes in enrollment, since
they did not demonstrate any sensitivity to the size of an auction.
    Another advantage of the larger auction was its ability to sort bidders


                                          27
by their valuation when only effort was observable. In the classroom, student
abilities are unobservable and so assignments, test, and other evaluations in the
course must serve as a sorting mechanism, attempting to distinguish students’
abilities by students’ outcomes. What we discovered suggests that the ability of
a relative grading scheme to sort students could be systematically undermined
in courses with low enrollment. That is, a student’s ability seems to be less
correlated to her relative performance in courses with fewer students.
    With multiple grade levels (A,B,C,D,F, for example), each student will face
greater uncertainty with regards to their relative position in low-enrollment
courses. Our results indicate that this uncertainty may cause effort to diminish
and weaken the correlation between ability and performance. On the other
hand, with large enough enrollment, we still expect students to match the
minimum required effort, but at a finer scale, now matching the minimum
score required for the highest grade they can receive.20 With a finer grading
scheme, the ordering of bids will be more dependent on between-group sorting,
likely giving an even stronger advantage to courses with higher enrollment.
This speculation, however, needs to be verified by further studies.


8      Conclusions
We designed and executed an experiment to examine how the size of a con-
test will affect the effort choices by players of different types. We leveraged
the paired-auction design of our experiment to focus on the difference in bids
between auctions of different sizes and analyzed how that difference evolved
across the type space. With this approach we were able to abstract away from
the exacting question of on- or off-equilibrium bidding and focus on more
general, comparative static differences in bidding across auction sizes. We dis-
covered economically and statistically significant results that hold implications
for a broad category of contest design. These results will allow mechanism de-
signers to select the size of their contests in order to optimize with respect to
  20
   For a deeper discussion of optimally selecting the fineness of a grading scheme, see
Dubey and Geanakoplos (2010).

aggregate effort, the distribution of effort, and the well-ordering of players. In
addition to selecting the size of a contest, there is room for further research
to illuminate how adjusting other contest characteristics affect large and small
contests differently.
    Our equilibrium predictions correctly identified that a larger contest size
would lead to higher aggregate bidding, larger bids from high-valuation bid-
ders, and a more accurate between-group ordering of relative ability. These
predictions drew attention to some undesirable effects of smaller contests on
participant behavior that our results then verified. Specifically, as the size of
a contest decreased, the uncertainty faced by each bidder increased, causing
them to shade down their bids. Shrinking the size of a contest also limited the
ability of observers to determine an accurate ordering of contestants’ under-
lying quality, demonstrating that the ordering of bidders between groups of
expected winners and losers was relatively more important than the ordering
within groups, which was actually superior in the small contest.
    With respect to bidding levels and revenues, holding constant the propor-
tion of winners, a policy maker should seek to implement the largest contest
if maximizing total effort, or maximizing effort among high types is the goal.
The lowest types seem unaffected by the size of a contest, and offer similarly
low levels of aggregate effort regardless of their environment, while bidders
with lower-middle valuations exert more effort in smaller contests. An inter-
esting topic for study could address endogenous selection of a contest’s size,
because it is not clear from the data the degree to which players can predict
the responses of other players to a change in the contest’s size.
    As policy makers, administrators, and other mechanism designers continue
to employ contests, this research sheds light on the effect of contest’s size on
the effort exerted by its participants. While this study considered only two
sizes of a stylized contest, we believe it serves as a strong foundation for further
research on the independent effect of a contest’s size on the performance of its
participants. With specific focus on the classroom application of this model,
a field experiment testing grading schemes under different enrollment levels
could confirm the external validity of our results.
