In this chapter, we review and discuss the large body of research that has developed over the past 10-plus
years that explores the interconnection of macroeconomics, finance, and housing. We focus on three
major topics -- housing and the business cycle, housing and portfolio choice, and housing and asset
returns -- and then review the recent literature that studies housing and the macroeconomy during the
great housing boom and bust of 2000-2010. Our emphasis is on calibrated models that can be compared
to data. In each section, we discuss the important questions, the typical set of tools used, and the insights
that result from important papers. Although great progress has been made in understanding the important
role that housing plays in understanding macroeconomic phenomena, work remains. For example,
economists cannot fully explain all of the volatility in house prices during the unprecedented boom
and bust period of 2000-2010. At the end of the chapter, we discuss a new literature that assesses
the macroeconomic effects and welfare implications of housing policies.

1     Introduction

    Like disco and bell-bottomed pants, the study of housing has become fashionable among economists
again. The tremendous boom (2000-2006) and bust (2006-2010) to housing markets and subsequent
financial crisis precipitated by an unforeseen surge in mortgage defaults has left many economists
asking: What happened, why did it happen, and will it happen again? With this context at in
mind, the purpose of this chapter is to document what has been studied so far, what we think as
economists that we understand, and what we think we don’t understand. Prior to the dramatic
events of the past decade, economists have investigated the interplay of housing and the macroe-
conomy for the obvious reasons that housing accounts for a large fraction of wealth and investment
in housing accounts for a large fraction of overall economic activity. In addition, housing has some
unique features that distinguish it from other assets. Specifically, (a) housing is infrequently traded
and trades are subject to search frictions and large transaction costs (b) the dividends that housing
provides are unique to housing in the sense that only a structure can provide shelter and in the
case of owner-occupancy are hard to quantify, (c) the value of the asset class is enormous, and (d)
the federal government interferes significantly in housing and mortgage markets. The sheer size of
housing and mortgage markets suggests these peculiarities might affect macroeconomic outcomes
and all other asset prices.

    Many excellent papers have been produced on these topics and it is impossible to cover all ground
in one chapter. The papers and topics we write about reflect our tastes in research and the papers we
cover almost all focus on the data and experiences in the United States. Our goal is to document
the research methods and explain the results of quantitative models produced by researchers in
the fields of macroeconomics and finance. To this end, the chapter has six sections. We start by
highlighting key facts about housing in the United States. These facts typically serve as calibration
or estimation targets; or, in some cases, they are the focus of specific research questions. Then, in
order, we cover the topics of business cycles and housing; housing and portfolio choice in partial
equilibrium models; and housing and asset prices. We then focus on a recent set of papers that aim
to jointly explain business cycle facts, life-cycle portfolio facts, and equilibrium asset prices during
the great housing boom and bust of the 2000-2010 decade. We distinguish between papers that
fix house prices or take them as given and papers where house prices are determined endogenously

                                                   1
inside the model. The final section of the chapter reviews a small set of papers studying the impact
and implications of U.S. housing policy, with specific emphasis on the preferential tax treatment of
owner-occupied housing and recent foreclosure relief efforts.

        While we include quite a lot in this chapter, we do not cover everything. For example, we
omit discussion of: Search frictions in housing markets;1 the relationship of housing and long-run
demographic projections and the impact of housing on the long-run growth rates of output and
consumption;2 and papers with results that rely on agents having different expectations about the
path of house prices.3 We also omit discussion of the active empirical literature that investigates
the causes and consequences of the subprime mortgage crisis using techniques from applied microe-
conomics4 and papers investigating the role of mortgage finance in amplifying the housing boom
and bust.5 Finally, our chapter is largely focused on the U.S. experience. Home-ownership rates
and mortgage financing patterns differ across countries, and more work is needed to explain why
these differences occur and how they may affect affect macroeconomic outcomes.6



2         Stylized Facts

2.1        Levels of Aggregates

        We start by highlighting a set of stylized facts from U.S. data that models of housing and the
macroeconomy appropriate to understand outcomes in the United States should match. We begin
by defining a set of first moments, or level variables, that are key to identifying parameters related

Smith, and Vroman (2007), Albrecht, Gautier, and Vroman (2010), Head, Lloyd-Ellis, and Sun (2011), Wong and
Wright (2011), Head and Lloyd-Ellis (2012), He, Wright, and Zhu (2013), Hedlund (2014), Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and

countries are simply unavailable prior to 1990, hindering empirical analysis.

Notes: The figure plots the nominal value of housing, inclusive of land and structures, and the nominal value of
structures, both relative to nominal GDP. The housing and structures data are from Davis and Heathcote (2007)

nominal GDP data are from the National Income and Product Accounts.



to preferences and technology. Figure 1 shows the ratios of aggregate housing wealth to GDP and
housing structures to GDP. Housing wealth is defined as the sum of housing structures and the
market value of land, so the gap between the two series plotted in figure 1 is equal to the ratio
of the market value of land to GDP. These data are taken from Davis and Heathcote (2007) but
similar data can be constructed from the Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds Accounts tables.7
According to these data, over the 1975-2013 period the average ratio of housing wealth to GDP is
about 1.4 and the average ratio of the replacement cost of housing structures to GDP is 0.94. On
average, the market value of land is roughly 45 percent of GDP, but the land share is volatile: At
the height of the housing boom, the value of land was equal to 100% of GDP.
   7
    The data from Davis and Heathcote (2007) enforce that the capital gains to housing line up with changes in the
Case-Shiller-Weiss price indexes. This is not the case with the Flow of Funds data. The Davis and Heathcote (2007)
are available for download at http://www.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/price-and-quantity.asp.

       Figure 2 shows the ratio of residential investment to GDP over the same time periods.8 The
average value of this ratio is 4.5 percent. In most models, knowledge of the average value of the
ratio of structures to GDP and residential investment to GDP is sufficient to pin down the implied
rate of depreciation on residential structures. To see this, note that a capital accumulation equation
for the real stock of structures implies


                                          Kt+1 = Kt (1 − δK ) + It


If we if we abstract from inflation and any trends to structures prices, we can divide both sides by
GDP at time t, Yt , to uncover

Denote the steady state ratios of structures-gdp, residential investment-gdp and the growth rate of
real GDP (Yt+1 /Yt − 1) as K/Y , I/Y and gy respectively. The model-implied rate of depreciation
δK can be written as

                                                                      I/Y
                                                gy + δK =
                                                                      K/Y

Taking I/Y as 0.045 and K/Y as 0.95, gy + δK is equal to 0.047. If we think the growth rate of
real GDP inclusive of population growth is 3% percent per year, then this gives an estimate for δK
of 1.7 percent. Most studies use a number in the vicinity of this estimate.

       Some other first moments help to pin down parameters related to preferences. Figure 3 shows
the aggregate ratio of expenditures on housing rents and utilities (black line) and housing rents (or-
ange line) to total consumption expenditures on nondurable goods and services.9 About 21 percent
of aggregate consumption is accounted for by housing and utilities, 4 percent from utilities alone,
and this percentage has remained constant despite real increases in consumption and rental prices
   8
     These data are derived from National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) table 1.1.5. Residential investment
in the NIPA includes payments of brokers’ commissions on the sale of homes. Although we do not do it here,
occasionally authors remove these commissions from residential investment and adjust the estimate of the stock of
structures accordingly.
   9
     These data are derived from NIPA table 2.4.5.

over time. One typical objection to this evidence notes that, on average after 1975, more than
60% of measured aggregate spending on housing rents and utilities is imputed as rents accruing to
homeowners. Davis and Ortalo-Magné (2011) use micro data on renting households from the 1980,
1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses of Housing to show that, across metro areas and over time, the
median ratio for renters of rental expenditures and utilities to household income is nearly constant
at 24%. Although these results are not without controversy, researchers use the combination of evi-
dence from Figure 3 and from Davis and Ortalo-Magné (2011) to justify preferences for housing and
consumption that deliver constant expenditure shares on housing rents in the absence of borrowing
constraints and frictions.

       Finally, many researchers use data on price-rent ratios to help calibrate discount factors and
to understand expectations about the future growth rate of rents and prices. An example of an
estimate of aggregate price-rent ratios taken from Davis, Lehnert, and Martin (2008) is shown in
figure 4.10 The figure shows a slightly increasing ratio of prices to rents prior to 2000, a massive
surge (2000-2006) and collapse in the ratio (2006-2010) during the housing boom and bust, and
a return to trend after 2010. Of course, rents must be imputed to homeowners and therefore the
reported level can vary from study to study depending on the imputation procedure. Therefore,
Figure 5 plots five more measures of the national price-rent ratio. The first one (circle markers)
uses the ratio of aggregate housing wealth from the Flow of Funds divided by aggregate housing
consumption from NIPA and the next three series combine three different repeat-sales house price
indexes (the Freddie Mac, square, the Core Logic, up triangle, and the national Case-Shiller House
Price Index, down triangle) with the shelter component of the Consumer Price Index of the BLS.11
All series display a similar pattern. The Flow of Fund (FoF) series and the Freddie Mac series
(Freddie) display the least overall volatility, while the Case-Shiller (CS) and the Core Logic (CL)
series display the largest boom and bust.
  10
    These data are available at http://www.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/rent-price-ratio.asp.
  11
    Since both price and rental series are indices, we set the first observation (1975:4) of the price-rent ratio for
each of these three series equal to the corresponding quarter’s observation for the Flow of Fund series. Since the
Case-Shiller series only starts in 1987:1, we initialize this series at the 1987:1 value for the Flow of Funds series. For
an in-depth discussion of the properties of house price indices and repeat-sales methodology, see Ghysels, Plazzi,
Torous, and Valkanov (2013).

“Freddie Mac” is the ratio of the Freddie Mac Conventional Mortgage Home Price Index for purchases to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics’s price index of shelter (which measures rent of renters and imputed rent of owners). “Core Logic”
is the ratio of the Core Logic national house price index (SFC) to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s price index of
shelter. “Case-Shiller” is the ratio of the Case-Shiller national house price index to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s
price index of shelter. The data are quarterly from 1975.Q4 or whenever first available until 2013.Q4.

2.2       Cross-sectional facts

       Understanding differences across households with respect to choices and outcomes is often a goal
of researchers in macroeconomics and finance. In this section, we discuss those measures differences
and disparities as they pertain to housing-related variables. across households. Perhaps the most
important dimension of heterogeneity in models of housing involves renting and owning. Figure
6 shows the path of the home-ownership rate since 1975. In lock-step with the changes to house
prices over the 2000-2010 period, the home ownership rate displays a pronounced boom and bust:
A 4 percentage point increase and a 4 percentage point decline. Each percentage point represents
the experiences of approximately one million households.12

Notes: The figure plots the quarterly home ownership rate form the U.S. Department of Commerce: Census Bureau
(FRED series ID RHORUSQ156N).



       A second source of heterogeneity involves saving and lending: some households borrow to finance
a home purchase and other households, some abroad, lend those funds. The aggregate quantity of
U.S. mortgage debt has increased significantly over time. The value of mortgages was equal to 20%
  12
    As an aside, the home ownership rate increased dramatically between 1940, when it was in the low 40% range,
and 1960, when it was in the low 60% range; see Garriga, Chambers, and Schlagenhauf (2014).

Notes: The figure plots mortgage debt relative to real estate wealth of the household sector (solid line) and mortgage
debt of the household sector relative to GDP (dashed line) in the United States. Data are from the Federal Reserve
Board’s Flow of Funds Accounts tables B100.d and B103.d. Household real estate wealth excludes the real estate
wealth of non-profits but includes the value of rental housing owned by the household sector (listed in Table 103.d but
included in private business wealth in Table B100.d). Similarly, household mortgage debt includes the mortgage debt
of the non-financial non-corporate sector. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income
and Products Accounts.



of housing wealth in the 1950s, 30% by the mid 1970s, and 40% by the mid-1990s. Aggregate “loan
to value” ratios remained constant during the housing boom. After house prices crashed, mortgage
debt relative to housing wealth achieved its peak value of 62% in 2009. Household deleveraging
(including defaults) alongside recovering property values have pushed the mortgage debt-to-housing
wealth ratio back down to 50%. Figure 7 also shows the ratio of mortgage debt to GDP. It tracks the
ratio of mortgage debt-to-household wealth during the run-up, but shows a stronger deleveraging
effect because it does not directly reflect the improving real estate values. Over the last four years,
mortgage debt has fallen from 96% to 76% of GDP.

    Next, we document a few important stylized facts about household portfolios using data from
the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Figure 8 reports the home ownership rate by age for three
different waves of the SCF: 2003, 2007, and 2010. In each SCF wave, home ownership rates rise

with age until age 50 and then stay flat until age 80. Figure 8 also shows that home ownership
rates fell at almost every age between 2007 and 2010, indicating that changes in the aggregate
home-ownership rate between 2007 and 2010 reflect changes across much of the population.

Notes: The figure plots the home ownership rate by age for the 2003, 2007 and 2010 waves of the Survey of Consumer

       Figure 9 shows the average household’s net worth, defined as household assets less household
liabilities, by age for homeowners and for renters. All data in this figure are in constant 2010 dollars.
Clearly, average wealth is much higher for home owners than for renters. In addition, homeowner
wealth profiles have a clear “hump” shape over the life cycle, while wealth for renters is low and
relatively constant with age. Combined with the previous graph, the figure suggests that home
owners decumulate financial wealth but not housing wealth late in life. This graph also suggests
that home owners and renters have quite different life experiences.

       Figure 10 plots portfolio shares for major classes of assets by age using data from the 2010 SCF.
The left panels show data for homeowners and the right panels show the data for renters.13 The

       Homeowners are identified as households having positive housing wealth.

Notes: The figure plots net worth by age for the 2003, 2007 and 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances. All nominal
wealth is deflated by the Consumer Price Index of the BLS, based in 2010. Household wealth is expressed on a per
capita basis by dividing by the number of adult members of the household. Wealth is computed as the sum of all
assets minus the sum of all liabilities. Assets are pension assets, bank accounts, IRA accounts, bond holdings, mutual
fund holdings, stock holdings, the value of the primary residence if owned, other housing wealth, business wealth,
other financial wealth, and vehicles. Liabilities are credit card debt, mortgage debt for primary residence, debt for
other property, and other debt.

top panels look at the share of housing, stocks, bonds, and retirement assets in total assets.14 The
bottom panels plot home equity, stocks, bonds net of unsecured debt, and retirement assets as a
share of net worth.15 The top-left panel shows that housing wealth accounts for most (90%) of the
assets of home owners early in life. Because most young home owners take out a substantial amount
of mortgage debt, home equity accounts for a somewhat smaller but still very large fraction of net
worth (bottom left). As homeowners age, housing falls to about 50% of total assets by age 60 and
financial wealth becomes a larger share of assets and net worth. Late in life, retirement assets are
depleted and stocks, bonds, and housing all account for a significant fraction of wealth. In contrast,
renters have little stock market wealth; most of their wealth is in retirement assets and in bonds.



2.3     Volatilities and Correlations

    Macroeconomic researchers studying the properties of business cycle models typically force the
models to match key first moments, such as the first moments we discussed earlier in the chapter,
and then informally evaluate model performance by judging how well it can replicate important
second moments. This procedure is in the spirit of Kydland and Prescott (1982), who ask if a
macroeconomic model can simultaneously be consistent with the long-run growth facts of Kaldor
(1957) and simultaneously match the business cycle facts of Burns and Mitchell (1946).16 Through
the appropriate choice of functional forms for production and utility functions, many macro models
will, by definition, be consistent with first moments; this implies model evaluation should focus on
second moments. Table 1 shows some of these second moments for U.S. data – standard deviations
and correlations – that researchers try to match. Generating these moments requires, as a first step,
removing trends in the data. The standard procedure to remove those trends has been to use the
Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter.17
   14
      Retirement assets are difficult to split into stocks and bonds and so we leave them as a separate category. We
include bank accounts with bonds and mutual fund holdings with stocks. The four shares sum to one; for the
calculation of these shares, we ignore the asset categories of vehicles, “other” financial assets, and business wealth.
   15
      Bonds are defined as the sum of bonds and bank accounts less credit card debt plus other financial assets less
other unsecured debt. Home equity is defined as the sum of the values of “primary housing” and “other housing”
less all mortgage debt. Stocks and retirement accounts are defined as before. By construction, the graphed shares
sum to one.
   16
      For example, the ratio of consumption, investment and capital to output are stable, on average over many years,
but are all positively correlated over the business cycle.
   17
      The HP-filter removes a stochastic trend; see Hodrick and Prescott (1997) for details.

Notes: The figure plots portfolio shares by age for home owners (left panels) and renters (right panels) for the 2010
SCF wave. The top panel plots the share of four asset categories: housing, stocks, bonds, and retirement accounts.
Retirement assets are difficult to split into stocks and bonds and so we leave them as a separate category. We
include bank accounts as bonds and mutual fund holdings with stocks. The four shares sum to one. That is, for the
calculation of these shares, we ignore the remaining asset categories of vehicles, other financial assets, and business
wealth. The bottom panels plot home equity, stocks, bonds net of unsecured debt, and retirement assets as a share
of net worth. In these panels, bonds are defined as the sum of bonds and bank accounts less credit card debt plus
other financial assets less other unsecured debt. Home equity is defined as the sum of the value of all housing owned
less the amount of all mortgage debt owed. Stocks and retirement accounts are defined as in the top panels and the
four shares sum to one.



    Inspection of Table 1 yields several important stylized facts. First, consumption, non-residential
investment, residential investment and spending on durable consumption goods are all positively
contemporaneously correlated with GDP (column 6). The positive correlation of these major
macroeconomic variables is considered a key property of business cycles. Second, consumption is
about half as volatile as GDP (cell b2 of the table); non-residential investment is three times more
volatile than GDP (c2); residential investment is more than twice as volatile as non-residential

                                                           15
investment (d2); and house prices are more than 2.5 times as volatile as GDP (e2).18 Finally the
highest correlation of non-residential investment and GDP occurs when GDP is lagged once relative
to non-residential investment (c7); and, the highest correlation of residential investment and GDP
occurs when residential investment is lagged by one or two quarters (d4 and d5).19 Thus, residential
investment leads business investment by about two quarters.

* Data begin in 1975:1.
Notes: Data are quarterly. All data except the house price data are from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) as produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The house price data combine data from the
Federal Home Finance Agency House Price Index (1975-1986) and the Case-Shiller-Weiss index as made available
by Macromarkets, LLC (1987-2013). All variables have been logged and HP-Filtered with smoothing parameter
λ = 1, 600. Real house and durable prices are computed as the nominal price index divided by price index for
consumption of nondurable goods and services.




3        Housing and the Business Cycle

       The cyclical nature of housing has been a topic of interest for decades and many economists have
written on the topic. An active empirical literature studies lead-lag relationship of housing with
other macroeconomic aggregates, i.e. Green (1997), Leamer (2007) and Ghent and Owyang (2010),
and the relationship of house prices and housing wealth to consumption, for example Muellbauer
and Murphy (1997), Davis and Palumbo (2001) and Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2005).20 In this
  18
     Almost identical results are obtained for every statistic when real house prices are replaced with the price-rent
ratio (not shown).
  19
     Residential investment does not lead GDP in all countries, see Kydland, Rupert, and Sustek (2012).
  20
     See Cooper and Dynan (2013) for a recent summary of that literature.

                                                         16
section, we focus on one specific branch of the literature: Equilibrium aggregate models in the spirit
of Kydland and Prescott (1982), i.e. “real business cycle” (RBC) models, where housing prices and
quantities are endogenously determined inside the model alongside aggregate consumption, invest-
ment and output, and aggregate market clearing conditions are defined as part of equilibrium.21
We focus on these models because they reflect our tastes and research experience but also because
many macroeconomists currently studying housing use a similar framework.

       The first class of real business cycle models where housing variables entered as objects of in-
terest were models with home production (Benhabib, Rogerson, and Wright, 1991; Greenwood and
Hercowitz, 1991). Those models are two-sector extensions of the canonical real business cycle model
of Kydland and Prescott (1982). The key extension of these models relative to the original RBC
model is that households are assumed have three uses of time: market work and leisure, as in the
standard model, and work at home. Households combine work at home with a stock of home capital,
subject to a productivity shock to home output, to produce a good called “home consumption,”
that is complementary in utility with leisure and with consumption purchased in the market. A
justification for this approach (see McGrattan, Rogerson, and Wright (1997)) is that in time-use
surveys, households on average spend about 25 percent of discretionary time on activities that can
be classified as home work. When authors in this literature calibrate their models, they set the
stock of home capital equal to the sum of the stock of residential structures (housing less land)
and the stock of durable goods and set gross investment in home capital equal to investment in
residential structures and spending on consumer durables (see Greenwood, Rogerson, and Wright,
1995; McGrattan, Rogerson, and Wright, 1997).

       In the home production literature, it is typically assumed that home and market capital have
the same price per unit (except for adjustment costs), and that home capital can be modeled as a
simple aggregate of durable goods and residential structures. Figure 11, which graphs real house
prices, durable goods prices, and the price of non-residential fixed investment over the 1975-2013
period, shows that these assumptions are at odds with the data.22 The left panel of the figure plots
  21
     For example, we would not consider the models of Topel and Rosen (1988) and Grenadier (1995) to be part
of this literature, since in both of those models many aggregate variables are determined outside the model and
aggregate market clearing conditions for all variables are not specified.
  22
     The house price data start in 1975. All prices have been converted to real using the NIPA price index for
consumption of non-durable goods and services.

Notes: The price index for durable goods and for non-residential investment are from the National Index and Product
Accounts (NIPA). The house-price data combine data from the Federal Home Finance Agency House Price Index
(1975-1986) and the Case-Shiller-Weiss index as made available by Macromarkets, LLC (1987-2013). All prices have
been converted to real by deflating using the NIPA price index for consumption of non-durable goods and services.

the raw data while the right panel shows the logged, HP-Filtered data. The left panel shows that
the real price of durable goods and business investment has been falling rapidly, while the real price
of housing has been rising slowly. The right panel shows that cyclical durable goods prices and
non-residential investment prices are highly correlated, but the cyclical price of housing is more
volatile than and is not correlated with either series.

       These price data suggest that the productivity shocks affecting the production of housing may
be quite different than shocks affecting production in other sectors of the economy.23 To see this,
consider the following simple two-sector economy. In the first sector (subscript c), a general good is
produced that can be used for consumption or business investment. In the second sector (subscript
h), residential structures used for housing is produced. Firms in each sector rent capital K and

    “Productivity shocks” allow the level of output to vary even when the quantity of inputs is held fixed. These
shocks capture, in a reduced-form sense, changes to the methods by which firms manage and organize inputs (for
example logistics, management structure, etc.) to more efficiently to make output.

and denote the price of one unit of residential investment ph , the price of one unit of capital as r
and the price of one unit of labor as w. The profit maximization problems for the firms in each

These two equations imply that we can solve for the relative price of residential structures in
equilibrium as:

                                                                      zc
                                                            ph =         .                                   (1)
                                                                      zh

In this simple two-sector model, where we have assumed the capital share of production is the
same in both sectors, the relative price of residential structures is equal to the ratio of the two
productivity shocks.24 This result motivates why authors interested in the cyclical behavior of
residential investment and house prices have modeled the production of housing in some detail
inside a business-cycle model.

       The first paper to model shocks hitting the production of housing is by Davis and Heathcote
(2005), called DH hereafter. The model of DH is similar in spirit to the simple two-sector model
  24
   Adjustment costs can introduce a wedge between the price producers receive as computed in (1) and the price
households pay for additional installed unit of capital. See Fisher (1997) for more details.



                                                                 19
described above. The key difference is that DH design the production-side of the model such that all
the inputs and key parameters are identifiable using available data. Other papers that have adopted
a similar housing production are Kahn (2008), Iacoviello and Neri (2010), Kiyotaki, Michaelides,
and Nikolov (2011) and Dorofeenko, Lee, and Salyer (2013) to name just a few recent examples.

   In DH, one set of firms produces “intermediate goods” (similar to the paper of Hornstein and
Praschnik (1997)) and a second set of firms transforms these intermediate goods into final goods.
There are three types of intermediate-goods producing firms –one type produces construction out-
put (subscript b), a second type produces manufacturing output (subscript m), and a third type
produces services output (subscript s). Call each of these types of firms “industries.” Output x
from each industry is made from capital K and labor N rented from households and is subject to
a industry-specific productivity shock z according to:


                            xit = zit Kitθi Nit1−θi    for i = {b, m, s}


Notice that the capital share θi is allowed to vary by industry. DH identify θi for each industry
and then use data on Ki and Ni from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate the time-series
values of zit for each industry. These zit are the only shocks in the DH model.

   Continuing, DH assume three types of final-goods producing firms. The first type of firm
produces a good (subscript c) that can be used by households for either consumption or business
investment. The second type of firm produces residential investment (subscript d). The third type,
discussed below, produces housing (subscript h). The first two types of final goods producing firms
use construction, manufacturing, and services goods as inputs. These firms produce their output
(y) according to:

                                        B    M    S
                              yjt = bjtj mjt j sjtj    for j = {c, d}


Bj , Mj , and Sj are the shares of construction, manufacturing, and services value-add for residential
investment (j = d) and consumption and business investment (j = c).

   DH identify the production-function parameters Bj , Mj , and Sj using data from the Input-



                                                  20
Output tables of the National Income and Product Accounts. Since all three intermediate goods
are used in both final goods, shocks to all three industries affect both final goods production. To
the extent that residential investment is more construction-intensive than consumption and business
investment, Bd > Bc , the shocks hitting the construction sector will be relatively more important
for determining residential investment. Thus, residential investment will have a different price than
other goods and depending on the properties of the zit terms and the values of Bj , Mj , and Sj for
j = c, d.

       The third final-goods producing firm combines residential investment and new land to make
housing. Denote xd and xl as residential investment and land that the housing-producing firms buy.
The amount of new housing produced yh is equal to:


                                                  yht = xϑlt x1−ϑ
                                                              dt                                                   (2)


DH assume that the amount of new land available in the economy is fixed at 1 each period. This
assumption enables for a closed-form solution for the total quantity of housing in the economy as a
function of past investments in structures after accounting for depreciation and land accumulation.
The inability to produce new land acts like an adjustment cost to the production of new housing.25

       For the household side of the model, DH assumes a representative agent who receives utility
from market consumption ct , leisure 1 − Lt , and housing Ht of the form of:

                                                                        1−σ
                                         cµt c Htµh (1 − Lt )1−µc −µh
                                                       1−σ

In this expression, total hours worked Lt is the sum of hours worked in the construction, manufac-
turing, and services sector.

       Table 2 compares some key moments from the data and from simulations of the DH model. Row
(a) shows that the model under-predicts the volatility of hours worked. This finding is not surpris-
ing. Despite the fact that DH model three productivity shocks, all activity in the model occurs in
  25
     While the assumption of one unit of land available for development each period is convenient, it is not clear what
this quantity should be. Ultimately the quantity of new land available for development in the model determines the
aggregate elasticity of supply of housing. More research is needed on this topic.

the market, so the three productivity shocks once aggregated should have, roughly speaking, the
same properties as the one productivity shock of the canonical RBC model, and that model system-
atically underpredicts the volatility of hours worked. Rows (b) and (c) show the relative standard
deviations of non-residential and residential investment. Relative to the classic results from the
home-production literature such as Gomme, Kydland, and Rupert (2001), the model has great
success replicating the fact that residential investment is about twice as volatile as non-residential
investment. Additionally, the model replicates the positive contemporaneous correlation of non-
residential and residential investment (row f). This result arises from the fact that land acts as
an adjustment cost to building new housing rapidly. As noted by Fisher (1997), these kinds of
adjustment costs are necessary to generate positive co-movement of residential and non-residential
investment.

       The model fails to match the housing data along three dimensions. First, residential investment
tends to lead GDP and non-residential investment tends to lag GDP. The model fails to replicate
this finding. Second, the model under-predicts the volatility of house prices (row d).26 Third, the
model predicts a negative correlation of residential investment and house prices, whereas in the
  26
    The relative volatility of house prices is much lower in Table 2 than in Table 1 due to differences in sample
periods and source data. See the notes to Table 2 for details.


                                                       22
data the correlation is positive (row g).

       The fact that the model predicts that house prices and residential investment are negatively
correlated is likely due to the nature of shocks hitting the model.27 Consider again the result of
the simple 2-sector model without adjustment costs, ph = zc /zh . When residential investment
has relatively high productivity and zh is relatively high, house prices fall. But when zh is high,
it is a productive time to build housing. A simpler way to say this is that people should build
housing when it is cheap to do so. Ultimately, there are two offsetting effects in the model of DH
making the analysis more complicated. First, land acts as an adjustment cost and the fixity of new
land available for new housing boosts house prices when building activity is high. Second, income
effects can offset price effects. Referring again to the simple model, when zc is high and house
prices are relatively high, income is also high (since zc is used to produce consumption and business
investment, most of GDP). When income is high households want more of everything, including
housing.

       Some progress has been made on fixing the three counter-factual findings of Davis and Heathcote
(2005), but more work needs to be done. Fisher (2007) shows that when housing is included as
a separate capital stock in the market production function, the lead-lag properties of the model
are improved. Dorofeenko, Lee, and Salyer (2013) show that the inclusion of “risk shocks” to the
production of housing can help boost the volatility of house prices, but at the expense of other model
statistics. Kydland, Rupert, and Sustek (2012) demonstrate that properties of the pricing of fixed
rate mortgages may be critical to understanding why residential investment leads GDP. Favilukis,
Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), which is discussed in more detail later in this chapter,
generates considerably more volatile house prices in a heterogeneous-agent equilibrium model with
collateral constraints. It also improves on the lead-lag relationship between residential investment
and GDP, and generates a strong positive correlation between residential investment and house
prices.
  27
       The model of Fisher (1997) also predicts a negative correlation of house prices and residential investment.

4        Housing Over the Life Cycle and in the Portfolio

       A substantial literature researches the role of housing in households’ portfolios of assets. On
average over 1952-2013, housing wealth accounts for 35% of household assets and 40% of household
net worth (assets minus liabilities), while home equity (housing wealth minus mortgage debt) is
23% of assets and 26% of net worth.28 As shown in Figures 6, 8, and 10, two thirds of households in
the U.S. own their home and for most home-owning households, housing accounts for a substantial
portion of total wealth.

       Housing is not only an important asset in the portfolio, it also has several features that make it
different from investments in financial assets. First, it is illiquid in the sense that changing the quan-
tity of housing may take time and/or require incurring substantial transaction costs. Second, it is
indivisible: A limited assortment of types and sizes are available for purchase at any time (including
a minimum size). Third, home ownership and housing consumption are typically intimately linked.
Most households own only one home and live in the house they own. Fourth, housing represents
the main source of pledgeable capital against which households can borrow. Investment in housing
is much more leveraged than investments in other financial assets and the value of owned housing
limits the amount of leverage in households’ portfolios. Fifth, housing is tied to a particular labor
market: People usually live near where they work.

       For the past 15 or so years, researchers have developed relatively simple life-cycle decision
models with rational, forward-looking, optimizing agents able to reproduce systematic differences
in the data on the home ownership, housing, and portfolio choices of various groups of households
– sorted by tenant status (owner versus renter), age, income, and net worth. With this in mind,
we proceed by describing a model environment representative of many of the models studied in this
literature and describe the typical calibration of key parameters and processes. Finally, we discuss
in some detail the setup and results of many key papers in this now mature literature.
  28
     The data are from the Flow of Funds for 1952.Q1 until 2013.Q1, table B100. The calculations reassign the
portion of private business wealth in the household table that reflects households’ ownership of real estate available
for rent. The same is done for the corresponding mortgages. This reclassification is done based on information in
table B103.

4.1      A Typical Model

Utility

Most authors assume that finite-lived households receive utility from non-housing consumption c,
the quantity of housing services h, and whether or not those services are acquired through owning
o = 1 or renting o = 0, such that per-period utility can be written as u (c, h, o). In each period,
households act to maximize the present discounted value of remaining expected utility subject to
constraints we discuss later. That is, if the household dies with certainty in T periods, in the current
period t = 0 households maximize

                                    T
                                    X
                                          β t π (t) E0 [u (c, h, o)] .                              (3)
                                    t=0


In the equation above β is the rate at which households discount future utility, 0 < π (t) < 1
is the age-dependent probability of survival to period t, and E0 denotes an expectation taken in
the current period. Occasionally, authors assume that households have a bequest motive in which
they or their offspring receive utility if they die with positive wealth. In that case, the net present
discounted value of utility has one additional term equal to some payoff from wealth remaining at
death.

     The functional form for per-period utility can be generalized as a constant relative risk aver-
sion utility over a joint consumption bundle with risk aversion parameter σ ≥ 1, and where the
consumption bundle is a constant elasticity of substitution aggregate over housing and non-housing
consumption, with intra-temporal elasticity parameter −∞ < ρ < 1 and budget share parameter
α:
                                                                         1−σ
                                             (αcρ + (1 − α) ξo hρ )       ρ
                               u (c, h, o) =                                   .                    (4)
                                                      1−σ

The parameter ξ captures the extra utility from housing services that are owned rather than rented:
ξ1 > ξ0 .




                                                      25
Choices

In each period of the model households make a set of continuous choices and one discrete choice.
The continuous choices are related to consumption, quantity of financial assets, and quantity of
housing services. Studies vary in the treatment of financial assets. Some authors lump together all
financial assets into a net position; others allow for one positive financial asset and one negative
financial asset, typically a mortgage; others allow for a set of positive financial assets like stocks
and bonds; and finally some studies allow households to choose among multiple types of mortgages,
for example fixed payment (FRM) or variable payment (ARM). The discrete choice is whether or
not to receive housing services by owning or renting.

Constraints

Each period households are subject to a basic budget constraint, a net worth or home equity
constraint, and one or more constraints about housing choices. Below, we consider the case of
renters remaining renters and homeowners remaining homeowners. When homeowners in t − 1
become renters in t and renters in t − 1 become homeowners in t, constraints change in the expected
ways.

   Denote labor income as wt , financial assets (consolidated for convenience) as at , the rate of
return on financial assets as rt , and the rental price per unit of housing as qt . In all studies income
varies over time. In most studies, house prices vary over time. The basic budget and net worth
constraints for households that were renters in the previous period ot−1 = 0 and choose to rent in
the current period have the intuitive forms:


                            ct + qt ht + τt + at   =    wt + at−1 (1 + rt−1 )                        (5)

                                             at    ≥    at                                           (6)

                                             ht ≤ h̄                                                 (7)


The first equation is simple accounting – out of available resources, whatever is not spent on
consumption, taxes τt or rental housing is saved. For renters, taxes paid is usually a simple function
of age, income, and assets. The second equation imposes some discipline on spending. Consider



                                                   26
what would happen the period before death, T − 1, without a constraint like this: Each household
would spend as much as possible on consumption and housing. In many papers, at is set to 0 in
each period and in a few papers at is determined endogenously such that the household can repay
any debt with probability 1. The final constraint is that rental housing cannot be too large.

   The budget and net worth constraints for households that owned in the previous period and
choose to own in the current period are more complicated. The simpler models tend to have the
form


                 ct + pt ht + τt + mc + at = wt + at−1 (1 + rt−1 ) + pt (1 − δ) ht−1               (8)

                                      mc = ζptht−1 if ht 6= ht−1 , 0 otherwise                     (9)

                                       ht ≥ h                                                    (10)

                                       at ≥ − (1 − φ) pt ht .                                    (11)


The first equation is accounting. It states that out of available resources (income, financial assets,
and housing wealth after accounting for depreciation δh), whatever is not spent on consumption,
taxes or housing is saved. The amount spent on housing is the value of the house bought plus moving
costs mc. As shown in equation (9), moving costs, typically assumed to be a fixed percentage ζ
of the value of the house being sold, are incurred if the size of the owned house changes between
periods, i.e. ht 6= ht−1 . Some authors include a fixed component to the moving cost. The moving
costs allow models to capture the fact that households move infrequently.

   The term rt−1 at−1 reflects net interest received or paid (if negative) by households. The embed-
ded assumption is that homeowners can borrow and lend at the same rate r, so a is the value of all
savings net of any debt owed. In this stylized budget constraint, there are no costs to adjusting the
quantity of debt or assets, so households can vary their mortgage or other financial assets costlessly
over time as long as their debt isn’t too large. Some authors relax this assumption and allow for
participation costs or other costs when households change the size of their mortgage (refinance) or
adjust their portfolio between stocks and bonds. A sizeable literature studies costs households pay
to participate in stock markets, for example Vissing-Jorgensen (2002).

   Equation (10) specifies that owned housing cannot be too small. Equation (11) is a key constraint

                                                 27
which governs maximum homeowner debt. Homeowners can borrow up to 1 − φ fraction of their
house value; φ is sometimes called the downpayment fraction. The downpayment constraint (or,
transformed, the loan-to-value constraint) and the minimum-sized owned housing constraint allow
models to match low home-ownership rates for the young: The young need to save to afford the
downpayment on their first house. This class of models usually rules out default.29

       The budget constraints for homeowners, taxes paid and laws of motion for wealth and debt
can be more complicated in studies of how different mortgage types affect the demand for housing.
Some authors assume that homeowners cannot borrow and save at the same rate, and cannot add to
their mortgage debt without incurring a cost. In these papers, the constraint about the maximum
quantity of mortgage debt is typically only considered for first-time home buyers, or for homeowners
moving to a different house. That is, homeowners are (usually) not forced to move if the value of their
house unexpectedly declines and their loan-to-value ratio increases. The simple model also assumes
that mortgage debt has one-period maturity, resembling adjustable rate mortgages. Some authors
explicitly allow for long-term mortgages, usually modeled as perpetuities whose coupon payments
are set to match the average duration of fixed-rate mortgages. Authors that study mortgage design
also separately model interest and principal repayment schedules and mortgage interest on debt is
assumed to be tax deductible. Finally, some authors add debt-to-income constraints in addition to
loan-to-value constraints.

Expectations on Wages and Prices

Earnings in these models are almost always stochastic around a known age-specific hump-shaped
profile. Households are assumed to know the process for wages but not the future realizations of the
shocks. Assumptions about house prices vary. Sometimes they are fixed or growing at a predeter-
mined rate, but most of the time they are stochastic. If random, typically the level is assumed to be
persistent, either a random walk or a first-order auto-regressive process with a value for the auto-
regressive coefficient near one. In models where house prices are not determined endogenously, the
process for calibrating the covariance of shocks to income and shocks to house prices varies across
authors. Households in these models are forward looking with rational expectations.
  29
    We discuss models that allow for default later in the chapter. In these models, the downpayment constraint
limits the likelihood of default but does not rule it out.



                                                     28
4.2       Calibration and Estimation

These models are estimated or calibrated using a two-step approach. The discount factor β and
coefficient of relative risk aversion σ are set using standard values: β = 0.96 and σ ∈ [2, 6].30
When there is only one financial asset, the rate of return on this asset r, is typically set to 4
percent. Survival probabilities by age are exogenous and come from life tables. Tax rates are also
set exogenously, around 40 percent for non-retirees and 0 for households that are retired. Some
parameter values related to housing are also set outside of the model, specifically the transactions
cost of selling a house ζ is usually set somewhere between 5 and 10 percent,31 and the downpayment
constraint for home buyers φ is set to either 5, 10, or 20 percent.32

       The depreciation rate on owned houses is set between 1 and 3 percent, based on evidence
in the BEA. The remaining parameters – given sigma, the parameter determining the elasticity
of substitution between consumption and housing ρ, the expenditure share on consumption as
compared to housing α, the home ownership premium to utility, the maximum sized rental house h̄,
the rental price per unit q, and the bequest function are estimated or calibrated to match a set of
facts about housing and capital in the aggregate or over the life cycle. Most authors add parameters
or tweak their model specification until they decide the model fits the data along the margins they
feel are most important.

       The life-cycle profile and stochastic process for earnings is taken directly from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID) or from studies that use PSID data.33 For example, log earnings from
the PSID are regressed on age, age squared, marital status, household composition, and family fixed
effects to obtain the deterministic life-cycle component. The residuals of this regression can be used
to recover the stochastic component of labor income. Earnings processes are estimated separately

monetary and non-pecuniary moving costs.

for different educational attainment groups and earnings in retirement are the average of observed
income in each education group.

       The treatment of the process for house prices varies widely. Sometimes house prices are fixed;
sometimes house prices follow some exogenous process set outside the model; and sometimes house
prices are endogenously determined inside the model. When the path for house prices is set outside
the model, many authors specify a process that replicates the auto-correlation and variance of house
price indexes such as the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) or Case-Shiller-Weiss (CSW)
indexes. Other authors try to replicate the patterns for house prices that can be derived from
PSID data.34 The benefit of the PSID approach is that it can deliver an estimate of the variance of
prices of individual housing units. For example, Flavin and Yamashita (2002) construct real, annual
housing returns using self-reported housing values from the PSID in adjacent years from 1968-1992.
They estimate the mean return to housing (including imputed rents net of maintenance) is 6.6%
with a standard deviation of 14.2% and show the correlation of housing returns with stock, bond
and T-Bill returns is almost zero.35 It seems fair to say that the literature still misses high-quality
data to pin down the return correlation matrix between stocks, bonds, and individual houses.36

       The correlation of shocks to income and shocks to house prices plays a key role in portfolio
decisions in many of these models. Many authors assume there is zero correlation between individual
house price returns and individual income realizations. Based on 1970-1992 PSID data, Cocco (2005)
finds a 55% correlation between average house prices and the common part of household income.
In his model, he assumes that house prices are perfectly positively correlated with the aggregate
component of income and positively but imperfectly correlated with temporary labor income shocks.
Using Swedish data for 2000-2007, Vestman (2012) estimates a correlation of 63% between the
  34
     The literature has recognized that the PSID sample is small and that self-reported home values are noisy and
possibly upward biased. For example, an increase is self-reported house prices across time may be due to quality
improvements or pure appreciation. Nevertheless, some have argued that homeowners, on average, can guess the
value of their house within a few percentage points. See Goodman Jr. and Ittner (1992), Bucks and Pence (2008),
Benitez-Silva, Heiland, and Jimenez-Martin (2010), and Davis and Quintin (2013).
  35
     The imputed rent, or dividend, on housing is set equal to a proportion of the house value where the proportion is
equal to the real interest rate and the property tax rate multiplied by the marginal income tax rate. The short-term
interest rate is fixed to 5 percent.
  36
     Other studies measuring housing returns using micro data are Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007) who improve
on the methodology of Flavin and Yamashita (2002) and Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013b) who estimate
high-quality housing price appreciation rates for San Diego. Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011)
discuss measurement issues and compare several approaches.

common component of income growth and national house price growth. The overall correlation
with individual income growth is 14%. Summarizing commonly held views, (a) individual housing
returns contain modest but important metropolitan-level and national-components in addition to
a large idiosyncratic component and (b) the national components of house prices and income are
correlated with each other and with stock prices. We suspect that local labor income and local
house prices are also positively correlated at a fine level of geography, such as the level of Census
tracts or ZIP codes, but the micro evidence is lacking.



4.3     Major findings in the portfolio literature

   The ultimate aim of the portfolio choice literature is to produce a model that can match life-
cycle profiles for the incidence of home ownership, the incidence of stock market participation, total
wealth, and the percent of total wealth accounted for by housing, stock, and bond market wealth, i.e.
portfolio shares. The literature also increasingly seeks to match systematic differences in portfolio
shares across groups of households, sorted by tenant status (owner versus renter), age, income, and
net worth. In the remainder of this section, we discuss the major findings in three strands of the
literature: housing and consumption over the life-cycle, the interplay of optimal housing holdings
and optimal financial asset decisions, and mortgage choice. In this section, we study models that
(a) assume house prices are constant, or are stochastic but determined outside the model – we call
these models “partial equilibrium models” – and (b) do not explicitly study how government policy
affects housing decisions. In section 6, we discuss similar models that endogenize house prices, while
in section 7 we study the impact of tax and other policies on housing outcomes.


4.3.1   Housing and consumption patterns over the life-cycle


Home ownership over the life-cycle

   An early literature studies how various segments of the housing market are connected in simple
life-cycle models where housing comes in discrete and fixed sizes (Stein, 1995; Ortalo-Magné and
Rady, 2006). In such models, people move “up” the housing ladder, i.e., buy more expensive



                                                 31
housing, as they age or get richer. These models do not try to match the life-cycle data to the
same degree as the models we discuss in this section, rather they are designed to study equilibrium
differences in house prices across various segments of the housing market. We discuss these models
in more detail in section 6.3.

   Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) is one of the earlier papers in the literature: Although
the paper was published in 2011, it was last revised in 2001. The authors ask if a partial equilibrium
life-cycle model with housing and idiosyncratic income and mortality risk can fit the life-cycle profiles
of consumption spending (hump-shaped), spending on durable goods (hump-shaped), and housing
and financial wealth. The authors treat durable goods and housing interchangeably. Durable goods
provide service flows and act as the sole source of borrowing constraints. The main finding is that
the interaction of borrowing constraints (our equation 11) and consumer durables produces young
agents who accumulate durables early in life and increase non-durable spending and financial asset
positions later in life.

   Yang (2009) revisits the work of Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) and argues that
consumption of housing first increases over the life cycle but fails to decline in old age, unlike
non-durable spending (recall our Figure 8). She adds housing transaction costs to the framework
of Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011). Borrowing constraints are needed to explain the
accumulation of housing early, and transaction costs are necessary to explain the slow downsizing
of housing later in life.

   In related work, Nakajima and Telyukova (2012) study the standard model’s predictions for
retired households. They show that retired home owners spend down their wealth more slowly than
renters. This arises in their model because retired homeowners cannot easily borrow against their
house and because they want to stay in their current house as long as possible, rather than sell and
move. Relative to the standard model, the authors model medical expenses explicitly in the budget
constraint and allow for a consumption floor in the event of a large medical expense shock, as in
Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) and Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2010).

   Halket and Vasudev (2014) study the life-cycle patterns of home ownership and mobility across
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). The authors show that the standard model, modified


                                                   32
to allow for Lucas and Prescott (1974)-style job mobility, can account for the increase in home
ownership, increase in wealth, and decline in mobility over the life cycle. The young move more
frequently than the old because they rent. Uncertainty about family size can also affect the decision
to move.

   On the topic of home ownership over the life-cycle, Fisher and Gervais (2011) ask why home
ownership rates for young people declined substantially from 1980 through 2000. They show that
the trend towards marrying later and the increase in income risk can account for almost the entirety
of the decline. Unlike most of the papers in this literature, the authors allow for only three ages in
their model (young, middle aged, old) and households transition stochastically between ages.

Housing collateral to smooth consumption

   Hurst and Stafford (2004) and subsequent researchers study how households use home equity to
smooth consumption. In their model, housing does not enter utility. They show that a combination
of low liquid asset holdings and a bad income realization predicts borrowing against home equity, and
the borrowing allows for better consumption smoothing. The authors use PSID data to demonstrate
that the mechanism they describe is present in the data.

   In related work using Danish household panel data, Ejarque and Leth-Petersen (2008) demon-
strate that new first-time home buyers, who have depleted their financial assets and have borrowed
as much as possible to purchase their house, respond to income shocks by reducing consumption.
They show that a relatively standard model, such as the one described earlier, can replicate this
fact.

   Providing further empirical evidence on the housing-collateral channel, Hryshko, Luengo-Prado,
and Sorenson (2010) use data from the PSID linked to MSA geography to show that, after becoming
disabled or losing a job, households tap into home equity to smooth consumption when home prices
are rising. When home prices are falling, after disability or job loss households reduce consumption.
The authors predict how the empirical results would change if downpayment constraints, adjustment
costs, or the correlation of income and price growth were to change.

   A related literature studies the response of consumption to house prices using micro data.



                                                 33
Campbell and Cocco (2007) use U.K. Family Expenditure Survey data to estimate an elasticity of
new consumption spending to exogenous changes in wealth as large as 1.7 for old households that
own, but close to zero for young households that rent, after controlling for interest rates, household
income, and demographics. Consumption responds to predictable changes in house prices, which
is consistent with a housing collateral effect. Since it is predictable changes in aggregate and not
regional house prices that seem to matter, the collateral effect operates at the aggregate level. This
evidence is consistent with the results of Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2010), discussed later, who
find evidence for an aggregate housing collateral effect in U.S. MSA-level consumption data.

   Li and Yao (2007) also study the differential impact of exogenous changes to house prices on
various groups of agents in the economy. An unanticipated positive increase in house prices benefits
old home owners because their lifespan is short and they can afford more consumption. Despite
earning a capital gain, young homeowners are worse off because they have a longer horizon and face
higher borrowing costs for their housing. Renting households are strictly worse off after the shock.
Li and Yao (2007) also show that the relationship between the riskiness of house prices and the
probability of home ownership is ambiguous and depends on the degree of household risk aversion.

   Bajari, Chan, Krueger, and Miller (2013) estimate the parameters of the standard life-cycle
model presented earlier in this section using PSID data along with auxiliary data on mortgage
interest rates and house prices. The authors simulate the model and compare simulated household
responses to a negative house price shock and, separately, a negative income shock. The authors
show that in response to a negative shock to house prices, households accumulate more housing
later in life but do not change the basic shape of their life-cycle patterns of spending and saving. In
contrast, in response to a negative and unanticipated income shock households reduce both their
housing demand and their consumption.

   Attanasio, Bottazzi, Low, Nesheim, and Wakefield (2011) study the aggregate implications of
the life-cycle model described earlier. They show that an unanticipated increase in the level of house
prices leads to smaller housing units but not a decline in the home ownership rate; an increase in
consumption of the old; and a decrease in consumption of the young. Relative to Li and Yao
(2007), the authors add the restriction that the home equity constraint only binds at the time of
the purchase, such that households can have negative equity if house prices decline. The model is

                                                  34
calibrated to English data.

   Finally, Kaplan and Violante (2014) point out that the illiquidity of housing affects the propen-
sity to consume out of fiscal stimulus payments. Many households have substantial illiquid housing
wealth but limited liquid wealth. A fiscal transfer, which is an increase in liquid wealth, increases
aggregate consumption by a much larger amount than would be predicted from a model economy
in which housing and liquid assets are aggregated together and are both considered to be liquid.

House price risk and demand for housing

   Han (2008) studies housing demand when house prices are risky and housing incurs transaction
costs. Han emphasizes that although housing is risky, driving down demand, current housing is
a hedge against future housing demand shocks since price changes of housing units in the same
market are correlated. A related argument was made by Sinai and Souleles (2005). Han uses a
variant of the life-cycle framework to determine when, given (a) life-cycle profiles for income and
tastes for housing, (b) the probability of moving to a new market with a different level for house
prices, and (c) the inherent volatility of house prices in every market, the hedging demand for
housing dominates its inherent risk. Han (2008) concludes that the impact of uncertainty of house
prices on depends on households’ future plans. When households expect to increase their holdings
of housing in the future, they buy a bigger home today in response to an increase in house-price
uncertainty. If, instead, households expect to down-size in the future, they reduce their holdings of
housing today in response to an increase in house-price uncertainty.

   Halket and Amior (2013) study the relationship of housing risk and home ownership. They
document that house price volatility is negatively correlated with home ownership rates and low
loan-to-value ratios at the MSA level. They also show that house price volatility is high where
house price levels are high, because these areas are areas where land’s share of home value is high.
The authors find that a relatively standard model of housing predicts that home ownership rates
are low in high house-price areas. The model can also explain why loan-to-value ratios are low in
areas where house prices are volatile.


4.3.2   The role of housing on the financial portfolio


                                                 35
   Flavin and Yamashita (2002) is among the first papers in the housing and portfolio-choice
literature; it considers a simple mean-variance framework without labor income risk. In addition to
their data-based contribution discussed earlier, Flavin and Yamashita (2002) highlight that young
households who own housing have a highly levered position that should incentivize them to take
less risk in the rest of their portfolio. This intuition qualitatively explains why young households
hold fewer stocks. The paper also proposes a resolution to an asset allocation puzzle. Standard
portfolio theory prescribes that households combine the risk-free asset with the efficient portfolio of
all risky assets and vary the holdings of each to suit their level of risk aversion. Financial planners,
in contrast, advise clients to vary the proportion of risky stocks and bonds. In Flavin and Yamashita
(2002), the latter is optimal since households are at a corner of zero in terms of their risk-free rate
holdings.

   Yao and Zhang (2004) study how households optimally choose their portfolio of financial assets
when they also choose whether to rent or own housing. Agents in their model face the following
tradeoff: Housing is risky, leading households to want to have fewer stocks, but homeowners can
use home equity as a buffer against income shocks, leading households to want to have more stocks.
They show that renters and owners choose substantially different portfolios of financial assets,
highlighting that conclusions drawn about optimal portfolio allocations over the life-cycle from
models that do not include a rental/own housing choice may be misleading. For example, when a
household transitions from renting to owning in the model, the share of stocks in total wealth falls,
but the share of stocks in liquid wealth increases. The reason is that the low correlation of stocks
and houses and the high equity risk premium makes holding stocks relatively attractive.

   Cocco (2005) is similar to Yao and Zhang (2004), and some of the insights, for example, about
what drives changes to equity participation over the life-cycle, are similar. The study does not
allow for a housing tenure decision (everyone owns), but includes a fixed cost of stock market
participation. The model generates that younger and lower-wealth home-owning households do not
participate in the stock market because of the fixed cost of participation. Rather, their portfolios
are heavily tilted towards real estate and are highly levered, similar to the data. The large and risky
housing investment makes participation in risky stock markets relatively unattractive in the model.
Cocco (2005) shows that a small fixed participation cost in equity markets generates substantial


                                                  36
rates of non-participation. As households age, leverage declines, stock market participation rates
increase, and the share of liquid assets held as stocks rises, just like in the data. Thus, the paper
shows that stock market participation patterns in the data are less puzzling once the impact of
housing is considered.

       Vestman (2012) also studies stock market participation rates for homeowners and renters. His
model matches the hump-shaped life-cycle profile of home-ownership in the data and generates a
flatter and more accurate life-cycle profile of stock market participation than Cocco (2005). Relative
to the existing literature, Vestman (2012) considers Epstein-Zin preferences and allows preference
parameters to vary across households. He shows that households with low risk aversion and high
elasticity of inter-temporal substitution save less, invest less of those savings in equity, are more
likely to not participate in the stock market and are more likely to rent. Using Swedish panel data,
Vestman (2012) documents that stock market participation drops by one-fifth in the year of home
purchase; his model generates a similar-sized decline.

Introducing Geography

       One important feature of housing most of the literature abstracts from is its spatial aspect.
A households’ two largest assets, human wealth and housing wealth, are intimately tied to the
fortunes of the location where they live and work. A large literature in urban economics, discussed
elsewhere in this Handbook, centers around issues of geography. For our purposes, we highlight a
couple of papers that integrate spatial considerations into the financial portfolio choice literature.
In Ortalo-Magné and Prat (2010) and Hizmo (2012), households choose where to live once at the
beginning of life, and then each subsequent period they decide on portfolio composition.37 For
tractability, preferences exhibit constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) and consumption occurs at
the end of life. In Ortalo-Magné and Prat (2010), households must pay rent where they work but
they can invest in housing in every region, separating housing consumption from housing ownership.
In Hizmo (2012), households own a home of the same size in the location where they work. Markets
are incomplete in that there are not enough risky assets to span all the shocks that hit labor income.

    Van Nieuwerburgh and Weill (2010) and Davis, Fisher, and Veracierto (2013) study spatial equilibrium models
where agents optimally choose where to live and are mobile each period. However, while both papers study the
equilibrium interactions of housing and migration decisions, neither paper studies a portfolio choice problem. Han
(2013) also studies differences in expected returns to housing across metropolitan areas, but her study is largely
empirical in focus.

   Focusing on the results in Hizmo (2012), once location is determined households optimally hold
more of a stock whose returns hedge local income risk. Stocks whose returns covary strongly with
house prices are poor hedges and require higher risk premia. In addition to making risk sharing
incomplete, the unspanned regional risk distorts the efficient spatial allocation of labor. Risk-averse
households may end up in regions with lower house price volatility rather than where they will be
most productive. The normative implication of this work is that households are willing to pay-up
handsomely for securities that eliminate house price volatility.


4.3.3   Mortgage choice


   Campbell and Cocco (2003) is the first paper to discuss household mortgage choice, and by
extension household risk management. Their paper studies the risk and return features of the typical
mortgage contracts, fixed rate (FRM) or adjustable rate (ARM), when labor income, house prices,
and real interest rates are uncertain and the size of the house is predetermined. The expectations
hypothesis of the term structure is assumed to hold in their model: long-term bonds and FRMs
contain no term risk premium. Campbell and Cocco (2003) note that ARMs are risky because
payments might fluctuate more than income or might rise when incomes fall, forcing homeowners
to reduce consumption. FRMs are expensive even when inflation is relatively stable because the
cost of an FRM includes the value of a pre-payment option – if interest rates fall, households have
the option to refinance their FRM after paying a small monetary cost. FRMs are cheap only when
inflation is high; the authors refer to this as the wealth risk of FRMs. The authors document that
households with large houses relative to income, with volatile labor income, and with high risk
aversion have a preference for an FRM. Households with a high probability of moving typically
prefer an ARM to take advantage of the lower rate. The authors propose an inflation-indexed fixed
rate mortgage, a contract that removes the income risk associated with ARMs but also the wealth
risk associated with FRMs.

   The share of households that finances a house with a FRM fluctuates significantly over time.
To explain this phenomenon, Koijen, Hemert, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2009) solve a two-period
mortgage choice model where risk-averse households trade off the expected payments on an FRM
and an ARM contract with the risk of these payments. The model generates an intuitive risk-return

                                                  38
trade-off for mortgage choice: the ARM contract is more desirable the higher the nominal bond
risk premium, the lower the variability of the real rate, and the higher the variability of expected
inflation. The model predicts that time variation in the aggregate FRM share is caused by time
variation in the bond risk premium, defined as the difference between the long-term bond yield (or
FRM rate) and the expected average future short-term bond yield (ARM rate) over the life of the
contract. Koijen, Hemert, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2009) specify households form expectations over
future short rates inside the model using Vector autoregressions, Blue Chip forecaster data, or a
backward-looking weighted average of past short rates. All three produce bond risk premia whose
fluctuations line up with the observed fluctuations in the ARM share in the U.S., with the rule-
of-thumb giving the strongest results. Moench, Vickery, and Aragon (2010) provide out-of-sample
support for this theory by showing how the recent decline in rule-of-thumb bond risk premium
can help explain the unusually low ARM share between 2007 and 2010. Badarinza, Campbell,
and Ramadorai (2013) extend the analysis of term-structure determinants of mortgage choice to
multiple countries. Campbell (2013) studies mortgage market design around the world.

   A natural question to ask is how the asset side (portfolio choice) interacts with the liability side
(mortgage choice) of a household’s balance sheet. Van Hemert (2010) extends the basic framework
of Cocco (2005) and Yao and Zhang (2004) to include more interesting mortgage choice. He allows
households to hold stocks, 1- 3- or 10-year long-term nominal bonds, and an adjustable- or fixed-
rate mortgage. In his framework, ARMs are short positions in 1-year bonds while FRMs are short
positions in 10-year bonds. In the benchmark calibration, which features stochastic interest rates,
households prefer to finance their house with an ARM to avoid paying the bond risk premium present
in a FRM. Since young agents have most of their wealth in human capital, which is analogous to a
bond, they invest their financial asset portfolio mostly in stocks. Middle-aged households hold some
long-term bonds to hedge against real interest rate changes affecting their ARM. This long-term
bond position increases as investors age and the value of their human capital declines. A risk averse
investor in retirement holds a negative position in 10-year bonds and a positive position in short-
term bonds, similar to a hybrid ARM. That position hedges real interest rate risk while avoiding
exposure to inflation risk.

   In sum, the portfolio choice and life-cycle literature has taken great steps towards understanding


                                                  39
the economic forces motivating households’ observed asset and liability choices. Housing and mort-
gage choice are not only key components of households’ asset and liability structure, but also play
a crucial role in understanding household demand for financial assets and liabilities. In the next
section, we investigate how households’ demand for housing and financial assets affects equilibrium
asset prices.



5     Housing and Asset Pricing

    Given that housing importantly affects households’ optimal portfolio choices, such as stock
holdings, the presence of housing may affect how stocks and other assets are priced in equilibrium.
In this section, we review the insights from the asset pricing literature with housing. Specifically, we
study endowment economies and discuss models with production in the next section. It is well known
that the canonical endowment economies of Lucas (1978) and Breeden (1979) with constant relative
risk aversion (CRRA) preferences fail to match the asset pricing data. In particular, predicted risk
premia are too low and do not vary much over time and the risk-free rate is too high and too volatile
(Mehra and Prescott, 1985; Hansen and Singleton, 1983; Weil, 1989). Adjusting these models to
allow for production, as in Jermann (1998) and others, amplifies these problems.

    The asset pricing literature has made great strides in the past two decades understanding the
required properties of stochastic discount factors (SDFs) necessary to generate asset-pricing be-
havior that looks like the data. In summary, SDFs need to be persistent, counter-cyclical, and
heteroskedastic – in particular, higher conditional variance is required in bad times. The external
habit framework (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999), the long-run risk framework (Bansal and Yaron,
2004; Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron, 2012), and the variable rare disaster framework (Gabaix, 2012) all
deliver SDFs that have these properties, at least in endowment economies. Assumptions on prefer-
ences and technology in these frameworks are difficult to directly test. For this reason, economists
studying housing have asked if SDFs can be generated that look like the data in a relatively standard
model once observable housing-market constraints and frictions are considered.

5.1       Representative Agent Model

   The baseline model extends the representative agent endowment economy of Lucas (1978) to
allow for two distinct types of “trees” in the economy, one that yields non-housing goods and services
as “fruit” (dividends) and the other that yields housing services. The representative agent owns
both types of trees and consumes all fruits. For simplicity, call the non-housing goods and services
as non-housing consumption, denoted c, and housing services as housing, denoted h. In any period
t, households in this model choose consumption ct , housing to purchase ht at price per unit pt and
the quantities of each of i = 1, . . . , N assets Ait+1 to maximize the expected net present value of
utility

                                                ∞

                                                                   X
                          ct + pt ht +           Ait+1 ≤               Ait Rit + pt ht−1 + wt
                                            i                      i


where wt is income. ht−1 and Ait Rit for each i are pre-determined as of the start of period t; the
future realizations of Rit+1 may be random.

   Denote the Lagrange multiplier on the budget constraint at period t as λt . The first order
conditions for consumption at t and for the optimal choice of period t + 1 holdings of asset i are

                                                             ∂u

                                                             ∂ct
                                                                          
                                  Ait+1 :             λt   = βE λt+1 Rit+1

Since households can freely purchase any asset, the second equation above must hold for all assets
i = 1, . . . , N. When we combine the above first-order conditions, the return on any asset must
satisfy the following equation,


                                            1 = Et Mt+1 Rit+1 .
                                                            
                                                                                                 (12)



                                                              41
where Mt+1 is β times the ratio of the marginal utility of consumption at t + 1 to marginal utility
of consumption at t. Mt+1 is the stochastic discount factor. One way to read equation (12) is that
it specifies that all assets must pay the same expected return after accounting for risk. The term
that determines the required compensation for risk for each asset is the stochastic discount factor;
specifically, the required compensation for risk is largely determined by the covariance of M and R.

   Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007) explore the asset-pricing implications of this model when
households are assumed to have constant relative risk aversion preferences over a constant elasticity
of substitution (CES) bundle of consumption and housing:

                                         c̃1−σ                                 1
                         U(ct , ht ) =     t
                                               ,   c̃t = (αcρt + (1 − α)hρt ) ρ                       (13)
                                         1−σ

                                                                    1
where α is the weight on non-housing consumption and ε =           1−ρ
                                                                          is the elasticity of substitution
between c and h. Cobb-Douglas (ε = 1 or ρ = 0) is a special case discussed later.

   Given preferences as specified in equation (13), the log of the stochastic discount factor, call it
mt+1 , can be written as the product of the standard single-good factor (non-housing consumption
growth) and a new factor that captures the effect of the composition of the bundle of consumption
and housing:
                                                                         
                                          1−ρ−σ                1 + St+1                     ct
           mt+1   = log β − σ∆ log ct+1 +       log                            and St =               (14)
                                            ρ                   1 + St                     qt ht

qt is defined as the rental price of one unit of housing and thus St is the ratio of total non-housing
consumption to the rental value of housing.

   In the special case of ε = 1, i.e. Cobb-Douglas preferences, optimal budget shares on consumption
and housing are fixed and the ratio St is constant. In this case, the final term of the SDF in equation
(14) vanishes. The SDF reverts to that of the one-good endowment economy with its problematic
asset-pricing predictions.

   Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007) consider values for ε strictly greater than, but close to
one, i.e. ρ slightly positive. This choice makes the coefficient in front of the final term negative and
large in absolute value. Given this parameterization, consider the covariance of the SDF and the


                                                   42
return on an asset. An asset whose return is low when growth in the total expenditure to housing
expenditure ratio 1 + S is low is risky – thus, it will require a high expected return. When ρ is
slightly larger than zero, the two factor model with housing has the potential to explain equity
risk premia. The model also implies that the ratio of non-housing to housing consumption predicts
future stock returns, a prediction Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007) show is supported in the
data.

   Davis and Martin (2009) estimate the preference parameters generated by this model and argue
that it fails to simultaneously price a portfolio of stocks and T-Bills. Their generalized method
of moments (GMM) estimate of ρ is 0.2 (standard error 0.05). This value is too far from zero to
deliver the required amplification to the standard Lucas-Breeden kernel in order to simultaneously
price stocks and bonds. Davis and Martin (2009) expand their model to allow for leisure and home
production rather than housing to enter utility. In each of these cases, they show the model cannot
price a portfolio of stocks and T-Bills.

   In related work, Yogo (2006) studies a model with Epstein-Zin preferences over a CES aggregate
of nondurable and durable consumption. He shows that when the elasticity of substitution between
nondurable and durable consumption is higher than the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution
(EIS), the marginal utility of consumption rises when durable consumption falls, which is in bad
times. Using asset return data, he estimates a value of the intra-temporal elasticity ε of 0.5-0.7 and
a low value of 0.023 for the EIS (alongside an unappealingly high value for the coefficient of relative
risk aversion). If that 0.5-0.7 estimate for ε is valid for housing, too little action will be generated
by the SDF to deliver plausible asset pricing implications.

   Like the previous papers, Flavin and Nakagawa (2008) consider a model with CES-aggregated
preferences over nondurable consumption and durable housing. However, they study how the illiq-
uidity of housing alters the SDF, building on the seminal paper by Grossman and Laroque (1990).
The presence of non-convex adjustment costs makes the house a state variable, generating an SDF
that displays considerable volatility and that depends on the history of wealth. Furthermore, ad-
justment costs allow for a decoupling of relative risk aversion from the inter-temporal elasticity of
substitution while maintaining standard preferences, i.e. time-separable utility. Given the similar
properties of the SDF, the housing model with adjustment costs produces a structural interpretation

                                                  43
of an external habit. Furthermore, the housing adjustment model outperforms both the standard
external habit and CRRA model. The Euler equation for individual households’ housing returns
cannot be rejected, and the authors estimate a plausible parameter value of σ = 1.8. The authors
also estimate ε = 0.13 (ρ = −6.7), suggesting housing expenditure shares rise by a lot in response
to an increase in house prices, a result that is at odds with work by Davis and Ortalo-Magné (2011)
and others that estimate that the expenditure share on housing is roughly fixed.

   Finally, recent work by Giglio, Maggiori, and Stroebel (2014) compares the prices of freeholds
(indefinite ownership of property) to those of leaseholds (very long-term but finite ownership) in
England, Wales, and Singapore. They find that leaseholds trade at a substantial discount to free-
holds, implying that housing services in the distant future are discounted at a surprisingly low rate.
This result contradicts implications of the papers of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Bansal and
Yaron (2004); Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2012) and Gabaix (2012) discussed earlier. Combined
with the high average returns on housing, inclusive of the entire stream of housing services, the
work of Giglio, Maggiori, and Stroebel (2014) suggests that most of the reward for investing in
housing reflects compensation for near-term rather than long-term risk, consistent with the findings
of Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) for the equity market. Their result suggests future re-
searchers should search for preferences and constraints such that an asset-pricing model can generate
a downward sloping term structure of housing and equity risk premia.



5.2    Risk Sharing with Housing Collateral

   Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2007) study the asset-pricing implications when housing is used as
collateral. They model a heterogeneous agent economy two “Lucas”-type trees, non-housing goods
and housing, as in the model of Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007). The aggregate endowment of
dividends of both trees is stochastic, and households differ in their realizations of the non-housing
endowment (labor income). Households have access to a full set of securities to share their income
risk with each other. The key friction in the model is that households cannot commit to repay
their debt. This friction limits the degree of risk sharing that can be achieved as in the limited
commitment model of Alvarez and Jermann (2000, 2001). Unlike other models in which households


                                                 44
that default are denied access to financial markets, the punishment for default in Lustig and Van
Nieuwerburgh (2007) is the loss of housing collateral. As a result, in equilibrium households’
borrowing is limited to the value of the collateral. Equivalently, the housing collateral constraint
can be thought of as a solvency constraint which keeps households’ net worth strictly positive. Since
future labor income cannot be pledged, housing is the only collateralizable asset in the model.

       A key state variable of the model is the ratio of housing wealth to total wealth, the “housing
collateral” ratio. When the housing collateral ratio is high, risk sharing is nearly complete and
the economy’s allocations and prices are close to those of the representative-agent Lucas economy.
When housing collateral is scarce, risk sharing is incomplete. In this environment, agents who have
received persistent positive income shocks require an increase in their share of non-housing and
housing consumption to encourage them to continue to participate in risk-sharing arrangements.
Unconstrained agents experience a reduction in their share of aggregate consumption. The net effect
is that cross-sectional distribution of consumption growth widens and risk sharing deteriorates.

       Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2007) show that the log SDF of this economy contains a new
             a
term σ∆ log ξt+1 which measures the extent to which housing-collateral constraints bind in the
economy:38
                                                                                     
                                                1−ρ−σ                      1 + St+1                 a
                mt+1    = log β − σ∆ log Ct+1 +       log                                 + σ∆ log ξt+1          (15)
                                                  ρ                         1 + St

Note that the housing collateral effect operates even when preferences are separable between housing
and non-housing consumption, or when the aggregator of these two goods in utility is Cobb Douglas.
A key implication of this framework is that the degree of risk sharing and equilibrium asset prices
vary with the housing collateral ratio. The persistent and counter-cyclical movements in the housing
collateral ratio lead to persistent counter-cyclical movements in the SDF. Times of scarce housing
collateral lead to high market prices of risk and high conditional volatility (heteroskedasticity) in
the SDF. In addition, the model delivers a downward sloping term structure of equity and housing
risk premia, consistent with the findings of Binsbergen, Brandt, and Koijen (2012) and Giglio,
  38               a                                              i
    Specifically, ξt+1 is a cross-sectional moment of individual ξt+1 . The latter are cumulative Lagrange multipliers
on the housing collateral constraint. These multipliers increase over time whenever an agent’s constraint binds, but
                                                                      a
otherwise stay constant. When no agent’s constraint binds, ∆ log ξt+1    = 0.

Maggiori, and Stroebel (2014) cited above.

       Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2005) test three asset-pricing predictions of the model of Lustig
and Van Nieuwerburgh (2007). First, a low housing collateral ratio should predict periods of
high market prices of risk and therefore high future excess returns on stocks. Regressions on the
predictability of US stock returns confirm this. Second, in the cross-section, risky assets have
returns that covary strongly with aggregate consumption growth when housing collateral is scarce
and opportunities for risk sharing are limited, as predicted by the model. Third, as shown in
equation (15), the model predicts that an augmented “conditional” consumption-CAPM, that is a
consumption CAPM model augmented with a housing-collateral term, should be able to fit data
on returns. Using the housing collateral CCAPM implied by equation (14), the model is able to
account for more than 80% of the cross-sectional variation in size, book-to-market portfolios, a
long-term bond portfolio, and the overall stock market portfolio. It is also able to reconcile the
difference in expected returns between value and growth stocks.39

       An advantage of the limited commitment framework is that it gives rise to a unique SDF despite
the presence of endogenously incomplete markets. Because unconstrained agents price the assets
at each date and state of the world. The SDF is volatile, which is key for asset-pricing predictions.
A disadvantage of the model is that default only occurs for “strategic” reasons. In the data, many
households default due to liquidity reasons, i.e. low income realizations. The next section discusses
models of housing default in some detail.



6        The Housing Boom and Bust and the Great Recession

       A recent literature explores models that can simultaneously generate plausible business cycle
moments, as discussed in section 3, realistic life-cycle consumption-savings and portfolio profiles,
as discussed in section 4, and sufficiently volatile house and asset prices, as discussed in section 5.
Much of the work in this area focuses on the epic housing boom and bust of the 2000s and studies
how changes in the lending environment affected home ownership rates, house prices and other
  39
    In addition, Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2010) document using quantity data that the degree of risk-sharing
between U.S. metropolitan areas decreases when housing collateral is scarce.

macroeconomic aggregates. These papers usually depart from the representative agent framework:
Agents differ by age, income, and wealth; some agents rent and some own; and some agents borrow
and others lend. We start by discussing several papers that assume that house prices are fixed –
either they are set outside the model or are trivially pinned down by a simple production function for
housing. These papers differ from the portfolio literature discussed earlier in that they study events
of the past 15 years and focus on heterogeneity across agents. We then review studies where house
prices are determined inside the model economy. In both cases, we distinguish between models that
allow for default and those that do not. The models with default naturally focus on the housing
bust. While simpler to solve, the literature with exogenous house prices face the criticism that it
ignores the fact that changes in the model environment associated with the housing boom or bust
may well affect house prices.



6.1    Exogenous House Prices, No Default

   A first branch of the literature studies the consequences of innovation in housing finance, either
through lower downpayment constraints or the availability of new mortgage contracts. Silos (2007a)
studies an equilibrium model with owner-occupied housing where agents vary in age, income and
wealth and the price of housing is fixed. He shows that a relaxation of downpayment constraints does
not change the business-cycle properties of the model, but affects residential and non-residential
investment decisions of the young and poor. Silos (2007b) shows that adding rental housing as a
choice greatly helps models such as Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) and Diaz and Luengo-
Prado (2010) explain the distribution of wealth by age, since the choices of renters who are younger
and poorer on average are not well captured by models without renting.

   Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009a) study a model with different mortgage choices
to determine the extent to which reductions in downpayment constraints and availability of second
mortgages increased the home ownership rate in the United States between 1994 and 2005. Agents
in their model face idiosyncratic income and mortality risk, and idiosyncratic capital gains upon
house sales but no aggregate risk. The model also includes a market for rental services. The authors
show that most of the increase in home ownership rates over this time period is attributable to the


                                                 47
availability of second mortgages. In closely related work, Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf
(2009c) study how the multiple mortgage contracts that co-exist in equilibrium affect home owner-
ship rates, the size of owned housing, and risk sharing. They first assume the economy has one type
of mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, and then ask what happens if a second type of mortgage is
added to the economy. Different types of mortgages are considered in the experiment. The addition
of mortgage contracts that allow for lower down payments or increasing payment schedules over
time is what increases the home ownership rate.

   Iacoviello and Pavan (2013) study the business cycle properties of a life-cycle model with housing
where agents differ in their discount factor and preference for renting. House prices are fixed and
mortgage default is not allowed. They show that the model can replicate the basic life-cycle facts
discussed earlier but can also account for the pro-cyclicality of household debt. The heterogeneity in
the model is sufficiently rich to match observed inequality in wealth. The model attributes the Great
Moderation (a period of reduced volatility of major macroeconomic aggregates that occurred from
the early 1980s until the early 2000s) to lower downpayment constraints and increased individual
earnings volatility. On the one hand, the reduction in down payments leads to an increase in
home ownership and a reduction in the volatility of housing investment because homeowners face
adjustment costs in changing investment whereas renters do not. On the other hand, the increase
in earnings volatility makes people less likely to be homeowners and less willing to buy an asset
subject to transactions costs. Thus, the impact on housing volatility is ambiguous, since renters
adjust more but homeowners adjust by much less, again due to transactions costs. The authors
argue that the reduction of housing investment during the Great Recession was the consequence of
tightening financial conditions coupled with a bad aggregate productivity shock.



6.2    Exogenous House Prices with Default

   A second branch of the literature aims to understand observed mortgage defaults in the hous-
ing bust by studying optimal mortgage default models that take house prices as given. House
price shocks, unemployment shocks, home equity extraction, and new mortgage contracts are four
(interacting) channels of interest in this literature.


                                                   48
   Campbell and Cocco (2012) study how default rates vary by mortgage type (FRM, ARM and
interest only). They solve the problem of a household that must decide how much to consume and
whether to default on its mortgage. The household faces idiosyncratic income risk, as well as house
price and interest rate risk. When home equity becomes sufficiently negative, households default.
The negative-equity threshold for default depends on the degree to which households are borrowing
constrained, which itself depends on income shocks, interest rates, and the terms of the mortgage
contract (ARM vs FRM). Higher loan-to-value ratios affect default probabilities by increasing the
probability of negative equity and reducing incentives for repayment. A higher debt-to-income ratio
also increases default by reducing the affordability of mortgages, making borrowing constraints more
likely to bind and reducing the threshold level of negative equity that triggers default.

   Taking house prices, interest rates, and aggregate income as given, Chen, Michaux, and Rous-
sanov (2013) investigate why households increased mortgage debt during the recent housing boom.
In their model, agents can either rent or own housing, and if they own they can finance their house
with a mortgage. Every period, agents can invest liquid assets at the risk free rate, refinance a
mortgage, take out a home equity loan (HELOC), sell the home, or default. Both mortgages and
HELOCs are subject to loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits; mortgages are long-term contracts
that can be refinanced at a cost. The paper avoids the simplifying assumption made in most of the
portfolio literature that mortgages are negative bond positions. Under the set of housing-finance
frictions considered, the authors demonstrate that the model can replicate the observed quantity of
mortgage debt accumulation (our Figure 7) given observed dynamics for income and house prices.

   Like Chen, Michaux, and Roussanov (2013), Laufer (2013) studies the importance of home equity
extraction in accounting for the observed surge in mortgage defaults during the housing bust. In his
model, households can refinance their mortgage at a cost and are subject to collateral constraints.
Mortgages are non-recourse in the model, but on default households are forced to rent. He estimates
the parameters of his model using income data from the PSID, asset data from the SCF and data on
the experiences of a large panel of Los Angeles home owners. Given realized house-price dynamics,
the model can replicate the observed time series of home equity extraction, home sales, and mortgage
defaults at different loan-to-value ratios. In his model homeowners extract equity when house prices
increase and when liquid assets are close to zero. He shows that when homeowners have bullish


                                                 49
house price expectations, they use home equity extraction to finance additional consumption. The
model attributes the increase in mortgage defaults to negative house price shocks wiping out home
equity rather than to negative income/unemployment spells. Laufer (2013) runs counterfactual
experiments with his model to study the implications of two policies that might reduce default:
tighter borrowing constraints and stronger recourse. Under both policies, defaults fall sharply and
less home equity is extracted.

       Hatchondo, Martinez, and Sanchez (2013) add mortgage default to the standard life-cycle model
described in the previous section. Similar to Campbell and Cocco (2003), the size of housing is
fixed. The authors allow households each period to choose their downpayment (which then implies
a particular fixed mortgage payment) and then solve for the zero-profit mortgage rate associated
with each mortgage.40 Similar to Li and Yao (2007), the authors demonstrate that house price
shocks are not an important source of consumption inequality. The focus of the paper is on two
policies than can reduce default: tighter borrowing constraints and stronger recourse, as in Laufer
(2013). First, requiring a 15% downpayment relative to an economy without a downpayment
constraint minimally impacts the home ownership rate (it falls from 63.1 to 62.9 percent), but
lowers defaults on mortgages by 30 percent (from 0.6% to 0.4%). Young potential home buyers
are worse off because of the increase in downpayment constraints, but existing homeowners benefit
since they can refinance at the lower interest rate that arises as a result of lower default. Second,
a policy of temporary income garnishment as a punishment for default holds fixed the the variance
of consumption but otherwise reduces default rates, boosts home-ownership rates, and reduces
downpayment percentages.

       Corbae and Quintin (2014) study the rise in foreclosures in the housing bust and ask how much
can be explained by the large number of high-leverage mortgage contracts. They model households
who choose between different mortgage contracts and face exogenous income and house price shocks.
They show that the relaxation of credit constraints during the housing boom can account for more
than 60 percent of the increase in foreclosures during the housing bust. This result holds despite the
fact that each mortgage contract is priced such that mortgage originators earn zero expected profits,
so the surge in foreclosures does not represent ex-ante mispricing of loans. The result arises for
  40
   Since households with positive equity can refinance, they can essentially choose their sequence of mortgage
payments.


                                                     50
two reasons: The higher loan-value ratios allowed after relaxation of constraints imply households
are more likely to have negative equity in the event of a bad realization of house prices; and, the
relaxation of constraints allowed borrowers more prone to default (i.e. they had lower income and
less assets) to purchase housing.

   In related work, Garriga and Schlagenhauf (2009) argue than an essential feature to understand
the spike in foreclosures rate is leverage. An increase in leverage exposes homeowners to additional
risk in the event of declines in house prices. To test the quantitative importance of the leverage
channel, the authors develop an equilibrium model of long-term mortgage choice and default. The
model captures the pattern of foreclosure rates across loan products observed in the subprime crisis.
The decline in house prices can account for most of the observed increase in the foreclosure rate
and decline in home ownership in the United States.

   In sum, the combination of home equity extraction during the boom -facilitated by new mort-
gage contracts- and sustained by rising house prices, combined with a negative house price shock
during the bust, goes a long way towards accounting for the observed run-up in mortgage debt and
subsequent foreclosure rates. The natural next step in this literature is to endogenize house prices
in the boom and bust.



6.3    Endogenous House Prices, No Default

   Predating the housing boom and bust, Stein (1995) and Ortalo-Magné and Rady (2006) studied
the effect of downpayment constraints on equilibrium house prices and housing transactions. They
explain how changes to constraints or income for people purchasing at one end of the housing
ladder alter the entire distribution of house prices. The last few years have seen a burst of research
activity trying to account for the massive rise in housing prices during the boom in models with
down payment constraints.

   Recently, Kiyotaki, Michaelides, and Nikolov (2011) use a general equilibrium life-cycle model
to study the implications of an unexpected increase in land’s share of housing in an environment
where interest rates are set outside of the model. They show that when land’s share of the value
of housing rises, land and house prices become more sensitive to productivity shocks and to shocks

                                                 51
to world interest rates, causing a large redistribution of wealth between net buyers and sellers of
housing in response to these shocks. They show that after an increase in the share of housing
attributable to land, a tightening of financial constraints does not impact house prices.

   In contrast with the previous paper, Chu (2014) shows that a relaxation of credit constraints
can cause a big change in the purchase price of owned houses relative to the rental price of rental
properties if owner-occupied and rental properties are inelastically supplied and if conversion from
rental to owner-occupied and vice versa is costly. Chu (2014) also finds that changes in supply of
housing and changes in the process for income (an increase in the level and the volatility) importantly
affected house prices from 1995 to 2005. He shows that the transition path from an initial steady
state to a new steady state at different levels of income volatility and credit constraints produces
an “overshooting” of house prices – house prices initially rise above their new steady state value
and then slowly decline, as predicted by Ortalo-Magné and Rady (2006).

   In earlier work, Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), henceforth FLVN, aims
to explain why house prices are more volatile than rents. FLVN also seeks to explain the slow
but large increase in the price-rent ratio during the housing boom. FLVN study a two-sector
general equilibrium model of housing and non-housing production, using a production framework
similar to Davis and Heathcote (2005), but where heterogeneous households face limited risk-sharing
opportunities as a result of incomplete financial markets. A house in the model is a residential
durable asset that provides utility to the household, is illiquid (expensive to trade), and can be used
as collateral in debt obligations. The model economy is populated by a large number of overlapping
generations of households who receive utility from both housing and non-housing consumption and
who face a stochastic life-cycle earnings profile. Market incompleteness arises because heterogeneous
agents face idiosyncratic and aggregate risks against which they cannot perfectly insure, and because
of collateralized borrowing constraints on households, as discussed in section 4.

   FLVN study the macroeconomic consequences of three systemic changes in housing finance, with
an emphasis on how these factors affect risk premia in housing markets, and how risk premia in
turn affect home prices: The impact of changes in housing collateral requirements, the change in
borrowing costs (the spread of mortgage rates over risk-free debt), and the impact of an influx of



                                                  52
foreign capital into the domestic bond market.41 These changes are meant to capture important
changes to the U.S. economy after the year 2000.42 To model capital inflows, the third structural
change in the model, FLVN introduce foreign demand for a domestic risk-free bond into the market
clearing condition for that asset. Foreign capital purchases of the risk-free U.S. bond are determined
outside the model.43

       According to the model, price-rent ratios increased during the housing boom due to the simul-
taneous occurrence of positive aggregate productivity shocks and a relaxation of credit standards.
Both of these events generated an endogenous decline in risk premia on housing and equity assets
and the decline in housing risk premia generated the increase in house prices relative to (imputed)
rents. Risk premia in the model fell for two reasons. First, lower collateral requirements directly
increased access to credit, which acted as a buffer against unexpected income declines. Second,
lower costs of borrowing reduced the expense of obtaining the collateral required to increase bor-
rowing capacity (and provide insurance). The authors show that the housing bust was caused by a
tightening of borrowing constraints and a set of negative economic shocks – a reversal of the good
fortune leading to the housing boom.

       FLVN emphasize that the model attributes changes in price-rent ratios during the housing boom
and bust largely to changes in housing risk premia and not to changes in risk-free interest rates.
They point out that if credit standards become more lax, the need for precautionary savings falls
and that, by itself, generates an increase in risk-free interest rates. Thus, if price-rent ratios rise
after a relaxation of credit standards, absent any other changes the decline in risk premia must have
more than offset the rise in equilibrium interest rates.

       Of course, during the housing boom, risk-free interest rates declined. FLVN attribute the decline
in risk-free rates to an increase in foreign purchases of domestic bonds. By itself, the decline in
interest rates did not cause house prices to boom relative to rents. The reason is that foreign
  41
     Garriga, Manuelli, and Peralta-Alva (2012) also study the impacts of these changes on land and house prices,
but they assume a representative agent and do not allow for aggregate shocks to productivity.
  42
     Van Nieuwerburgh (2012) and Favilukis, Kohn, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) provide detailed
evidence on all three changes and supporting references
  43
     Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) estimate that such foreign governmental holders, such as central
banks, have a zero price elasticity for U.S. Treasuries, because they are motivated by reserve currency or regulatory
motives (Kohn, 2002).



                                                         53
purchases of domestic bonds forced U.S. savers to purchase more equity and housing than they
would have otherwise desired, thus increasing risk premia on housing and lowering house prices
and the price of other risky assets.44 In addition, foreign capital inflows stimulated residential
investment, raising the expected stock of future housing and pushing down house prices. The net
effect of all of these factors is that a large capital inflow from abroad into safe securities depressed
real risk free interest rates but only had a small effect on house prices.

       In summary, two opposing forces simultaneously affected the price of housing risk. During the
housing boom, credit standards relaxed, lowering risk premia, and foreigners bought more U.S.
bonds, raising risk premia. At the model’s calibrated parameters, the decline in risk premia from
the effects of the former exceeded than the rise in risk premia from the latter. During the bust,
modeled as a tightening of credit standards to their pre-boom levels but no reversal in the capital
inflows, risk-free interest rates remained low but risk premia unambiguously rose, driving down
house prices relative to rents.45

       Boldrin, Garriga, Peralta-Alva, and Sanchez (2013) explore the role of the construction sector
in explaining changes to aggregate employment and output during the housing boom. The authors
emphasize that the construction sector has important inter-linkages with other sectors of the econ-
omy, and that variation in the demand for residential investment propagates to aggregate output
through these linkages. After calibrating these linkages using input-output data, the authors esti-
mate that the construction sector accounted for 29 percent of growth of employment and 8 percent
of the change in GDP during 2002-2007. The authors also estimate the contribution of construction
to the decline in employment of 28 percent and 43 percent to the decline of GDP during the great
recession.

       In a detailed study of the housing market of San Diego, Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider
(2013b) emphasize heterogeneity in the quality of housing. They show that the areas of San Diego
that experienced the largest housing boom also experienced the greatest bust. The authors pro-
pose an assignment model of households to houses of various quality, and study how changes in
  44
     Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin (2009) show that prior to the housing boom and bust, the historical
covariance of risk-free interest rates and the risk-premium to housing was negative.
  45
     In related work, Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2012) study the welfare implications of a reversal
of (stochastic) foreign purchases of safe U.S. debt.



                                                        54
income and asset distributions changed assignments between 2000 and 2005. Landvoigt, Piazzesi,
and Schneider (2013b) show that a relaxation of credit constraints played an important role in
determining the cross-sectional patterns of capital gain to house prices. The study complements
the previous literature in that it infers the importance of the relaxation of credit constraints on
house prices using data from within one metro area. It also extends the housing ladder model of
Ortalo-Magné and Rady (2006) by considering more quality types of housing.



6.4       Endogenous House Prices with Default

       A final strand of the general equilibrium heterogeneous agent literature studies mortgage default.
These models add endogenous house price determination to the partial equilibrium framework of
the default papers discussed in section 6.2. The feedback between foreclosures and house prices is
important in accounting for the substantial house price decline in the bust. Particularly, Chatterjee
and Eyigungor (2009, 2011, 2012) and Hedlund (2014) build general equilibrium models of housing
in order to evaluate the effects of the drop in house prices and a change in housing supply on
equilibrium foreclosure rates. Like the default models with exogenous house prices, their focus is to
understand the underlying reasons for, and consequences of the recent foreclosure crisis.

       Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2009) attribute the foreclosure crisis to overbuilding: an increase in
housing supply not matched by an increase in demand. House prices must fall to absorb the excess
supply. Because of leverage, the initial fall in house prices pushes some households into foreclosure
and forces them to demand a smaller house in the rental market. For housing markets to clear,
house prices must adjust downward even further.

       Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013) assume mortgage contracts last one period and study the
effects of a specific government housing market policy, as discussed in the housing policy section
below. Combining the assumption that contracts last one period with perfect competition delivers
a sharp characterization of equilibrium mortgage interest rates and default policies.46 Minimum
downpayment requirements arise endogenously in the model of Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013).
  46
    In related work, Mitman (2012) considers the interaction of recourse and bankruptcy on the decision to default
in an environment with one period mortgages and costless refinancing.



                                                       55
The same result occurs in Arslan, Guler, and Taskin (2013) who study a model with default and
endogenous house prices and evaluate how the model’s predictions change when downpayment
constraints, interest rates, or unemployment rates change.

    Hedlund (2014) models a search friction and emphasizes that housing illiquidity, measured by
the probability of selling a home (or time on the market), increases the probability of default for
a financially distressed homeowner. Mortgage banks charge a higher default risk premium on new
mortgages in times of housing illiquidity, which tightens borrowing constraints and causes mortgage
illiquidity. Higher mortgage rates force some households to sell rather than to refinance their
mortgage. These tend to be households with high-LTV loans. With high asking prices, their homes
are unlikely to sell, worsening housing liquidity. More homeowners also go into foreclosure and the
selling delays associated with real estate owned properties further increase housing illiquidity. The
interaction between housing and mortgage illiquidity increases equilibrium house price volatility. It
generates house prices, mortgage debt, time on the market, and foreclosure dynamics in line with
the data. A policy that improves lenders’ recourse reduces house price and residential investment
volatility, increases existing sales volatility, and all but eliminates foreclosures.

    In sum, the literature has made great strides in accounting for the boom and bust in house
prices in models with heterogeneous borrowers and lenders, and borrowing constraints that depend
on endogenously determined house prices.



7     Housing Policy

    A host of government policies subsidize mortgage debt and provide financial incentives for home
ownership. Economists and policy makers are concerned with the welfare implications of these
policies and their impact on home ownership, house prices, mortgage debt, and financial stability.
In this final section of the chapter, we briefly discuss research that evaluates the effect of housing
policy on outcomes, such as housing demand and house prices, and welfare using the tools of modern
quantitative macro. In our view, this is an important topic where research is needed. In our view,
and speaking loosely, events of the past 15 years suggest the existing housing finance architecture has



                                                    56
proven deficient in providing a stable environment in which the young or poor would be comfortable
with the risks associated with home ownership. Studying the effects of a major overhaul of that
system requires a general equilibrium analysis, using the tools described in this chapter. We close
by discussing briefly a literature studying the interaction of monetary policy and housing/mortgage
markets, and a recent literature evaluating mortgage modification programs.

Mortgage interest rate deductibility

   The early literature focuses on the effects of the mortgage interest rate deductibility. One of the
earliest papers in this literature is by Gervais (2002), who studies the impact of the tax code on the
accumulation of housing and other wealth in a general equilibrium model. He finds that the failure
to tax imputed rents from owner-occupied housing and the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest
distort the rate of return on housing capital as compared to business capital. If the government
were to tax imputed rents, holding total revenue collected unchanged by lowering income taxes, the
stock of business capital would increase by 6 percent, the stock of housing capital would decrease
by 8 percent, and one-quarter of households that own would switch to renting. The elimination of
mortgage interest deductibility leaves the total stock of housing capital unchanged, but increases
the rental stock relative to the owner-occupied stock. Both policies would be uniformly welfare
improving. Note that Gervais (2002) holds house prices fixed – output can be costlessly transformed
at a one-one rate into consumption, business investment, or residential investment.

   Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009b) document that the majority of rental properties
in the U.S. are owned by households. They model the decision to invest in rental housing, clear
rental markets, and analyze the connection between the asymmetric tax treatment of homeowners
and landlords and the progressivity of income taxation. They find that eliminating the mortgage
interest deduction – assuming budget neutrality – has a positive effect on home ownership because
it lowers the average tax rate in the economy. This leads to an increase in average household income
and wealth. Under the assumption that house prices are fixed, the increase in wealth prompts a
switch from renting to owning.

   In contrast to the previous papers, Sommer and Sullivan (2013) endogenize not only rental but
also ownership prices. They include a very detailed treatment of the tax code in their model. They


                                                 57
show that repealing tax deductions causes house prices to decline but does not affect rents. The
decline in house prices and price-rent ratios boosts home-ownership as it encourages more young to
save for a down payment on a house. In some simulations of alternative government tax policies,
the home-ownership rate rises by almost 8 percentage points. Eliminating mortgage interest rate
or property tax deductibility also shifts housing consumption from the rich to the poor and is
associated with an overall welfare gain.

       Floetotto, Kirker, and Stroebel (2012) investigate the same policy changes but focus on the
welfare effects in the transition between steady states. Upon removal of the tax on rental income
and the interest rate deductibility of mortgage interest, a quarter of households suffer initial welfare
losses, driven by house prices that fall by 4% on impact before recovering to a 1.6% decline relative to
the initial steady state. The initial welfare losses are largely born by middle income earners in their
model. The alternative policy of eliminating the asymmetric tax treatment of owner occupied and
rental housing by taxing imputed rents leads to a larger fraction of initial losers (a third), and affects
wealthy households the most. This paper underscores the importance of endogenizing house prices
when evaluating how tax policy affects housing markets. In sum, abolishing current tax expenditures
that benefit home owners would substantially increase welfare, increase home ownership, and reduce
inequality, but may lead to temporary capital losses for existing home owners.

Housing finance intermediaries

       A conceptually similar question asks how the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, distort U.S. housing markets.47 Jeske, Krueger, and Mitman (2013) study
the effect of bailout guarantees to the GSEs, modeled as a 0.3 percentage point subsidy to the
mortgage interest rate and financed by taxes on income. This interest rate subsidy is regressive,
hurting low-income, low-asset renters and home owners with a small mortgage while benefiting the
wealthy. The subsidy affects the amount of leverage in the housing system and its distribution but
has little effect on the home ownership rate. Eliminating the subsidy increases aggregate welfare,
and is especially beneficial to low-income low-asset households. This conclusion is consistent with
that in the literature on the mortgage interest rate deductibility.
  47
   See Acharya, Richardson, Van Nieuwerburgh, and White (2011) for a discussion of the historical evolution of the
GSEs and a plan to reform them.



                                                       58
       Studying the GSEs is part of an important area of future research that takes seriously the role
that intermediaries play in the housing finance system. The financial regulatory reforms enacted in
the Great Recession prompted economists to understand better how regulation affects the behavior
of these financial intermediaries and the housing outcomes they influence. Quantitative research on
this important topic has just begun. Landvoigt (2012) models a banking sector that intermediates
mortgage credit between borrowers and savers, and studies the effects of bank capital regulation
and the cost of raising equity on house prices, risk sharing, and welfare. He also studies the
effect of lower cost mortgage securitization as an alternative to mortgage banking. He concludes
that securitization accounted for approximately 30% of the increase in mortgage debt during the
period in which collateral constraints to housing were relaxed. In the model, securitization lowers
borrowing costs, leading to more valuable collateral; and, the lower intermediation costs cause a
faster transition to a high-debt regime.

Housing and monetary policy

       A chapter on housing and the macroeconomy would be incomplete without mentioning a litera-
ture that explores the role that housing plays in transmitting monetary policy. The two best-known
papers in this area are by Iacoviello (2005) and Iacoviello and Neri (2010). The production side of
Iacoviello and Neri (2010) is similar to that of Davis and Heathcote (2005), but other key features
of the the model are different. Rather than a representative household, Iacoviello and Neri (2010)
have two types of households, patient and impatient, with impatient households always borrowing
constrained. An increase in house prices allows impatient households to borrow and consume more.
The model also has features common to the new-Keynesian framework: Monopolistically competi-
tive firms, sticky prices, and a monetary authority setting interest rates according to a Taylor rule.
The benefit of this additional richness is that the model can match many business cycle moments.
The authors demonstrate that monetary policy shocks account for about 15-20 percent of the cycli-
cal variation in house prices and residential investment. Iacoviello and Neri (2010) also show that
technology shocks and monetary policy shocks cannot fully account for the increase in house prices
during the housing boom. Rather, their model attributes two-thirds of the increase in house prices
during the boom to shocks to preferences for housing.48
  48
     Aruoba, Davis, and Wright (2014) also study the impact of monetary policy on housing in a model where housing
is a capital input to home production. Their focus is on the relationship between steady-state inflation rates and the


                                                         59
    Recent work by Garriga, Kydland, and Sustek (2013), building off the work of Kydland, Rupert,
and Sustek (2012), explores how monetary policy can affect the dynamics of residential investment.
Unlike the papers of Iacoviello (2005) and Iacoviello and Neri (2010), the authors abstract from
all nominal rigidities except one: Mortgage payments are specified in nominal terms. Changes in
monetary policy affect the the distribution of real payments of mortgages over the life of the loan
(the “price” effect) but also affect the amount of interest paid (the “wealth” effect). The authors
show that monetary policy has a great influence on housing in economies with ARM mortgages
rather than FRM mortgages: Price and wealth effects tend to reinforce each other with ARM
mortgages and offset each other with FRM mortgages.

    Midrigan and Philippon (2011) examine the cross-sectional relationship between household lever-
age, house prices, and unemployment, motivated by the empirical evidence in Mian and Sufi (2009).
They observe that the regions with the largest changes to household debt also experienced the largest
declines in employment and output during the financial crisis. To match this fact, they study a
model with a cash-in-advance constraint, but where households can borrow against their home eq-
uity using a home equity line of credit. The authors show that the presence of cash-in-advance
constraints generates a decline in employment after borrowing constraints tighten: The tighten-
ing of liquidity constraints reduces the velocity of money and triggers a recession. To account for
the cross-sectional pattern of leverage and employment in the data, the model also features wage
rigidities and labor reallocation frictions.

    Feroli, Harris, Sufi, and West (2012) argue that a physical overhang of existing homes, depressed
house prices due to foreclosures, and tight credit conditions all impaired the normal monetary
transmission mechanism. They argue that policies that subsidize the refinancing of underwater
mortgages and speed the transition from foreclosure to REO (real estate owned by banks) status
will improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

Mortgage modification programs

    A related literature analyzes the 2009 Housing Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and
asks how many foreclosures HAMP prevented and at what cost (Agarwal, Amromin, Ben-David,
level of house prices and aggregate welfare.



                                                 60
Chomsisengphet, Piskorski, and Seru, 2012; Scharlemanny and Shorez, 2013; Hembre, 2014). We
think a potentially interesting line of research embeds HAMP and other foreclosure-relief policies
into a general equilibrium model and studies the extent to which these policies altered the level of
house prices and overall welfare.



8        Conclusion

       The recent housing boom and bust and financial crisis has renewed the curiosity of economists
of all stripes about the interplay of housing, finance and macroeconomics. In this chapter, we have
surveyed the state of research in this field with an emphasis on its development over the past decade.
While much progress has been made, many challenges and interesting problems remain.

       One unsettled debate is on the origins of the housing boom and bust and, related, why a
relatively modest number of mortgage defaults precipitated a financial crisis and a severe recession.
A common explanation is that housing boomed due to the availability of exotic mortgage products
and an expansion of mortgage credit. This pushes the question back one level. Specifically, why
did these mortgage products become available or more widely adopted, and did the availability of
these products cause house prices to rise, or did the products emerge because market participants
expected continued appreciation to housing? Similarly, if house price expectations are to blame,
what triggered the change in expectations?49

       In our view, researchers should be focusing on the role played by housing and real estate in
causing financial crises, if any, and on the welfare consequences of government policies designed to
encourage home ownership and reduce foreclosures. In addition, more work also remains to be done
in integrating the local aspects of housing and labor markets into standard portfolio choice, asset
pricing, and macroeconomic models with housing.
