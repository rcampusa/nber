                                         ABSTRACT

The question of how firms build market share matters for firm dynamics, business cycles,
international trade, and industrial organization. Using Nielsen Retail Scanner data for the United
States, we document that in the consumer food industry, brands experience substantial growth in
market share in the first four years after successful entry into a regional market. However,
markups are flat with respect to brand tenure. This finding is at odds with a large literature on
customer markets which argues that firms acquire customers by temporarily offering low
markups, and later raise markups once customers are locked in. However, it is consistent with a
literature which emphasizes the importance of marketing and advertising activities for building
market share.

                                                 Abstract

           The question of how firms build market share matters for firm dynamics, business
        cycles, international trade, and industrial organization. Using Nielsen Retail Scanner
        data for the United States, we document that in the consumer food industry, brands
        experience substantial growth in market share in the first four years after successful
        entry into a regional market. However, markups are flat with respect to brand tenure.
        This finding is at odds with a large literature on customer markets which argues that
        firms acquire customers by temporarily offering low markups, and later raise markups
        once customers are locked in. However, it is consistent with a literature which em-
        phasizes the importance of marketing and advertising activities for building market
        share.



1       Introduction
A large literature on “customer markets” posits that firms initially offer low markups to
attract new customers, but later exploit customer lock-in due to e.g. search frictions to
increase the markups they charge.1 Some macroeconomists have argued that this behavior

may contribute to countercyclical markups and hence to a countercyclical labor wedge. How-
ever, an alternative literature in marketing and international trade posits that firms instead
use non-price actions such as marketing and advertising to build market share.2 In the con-
text of this literature, the procyclical behavior of advertising is a challenge to markup-based
explanations of the labor wedge.3
    We use Nielsen Retail Scanner data on consumer food products to test the customer
markets hypothesis by tracking how quantities and prices evolve following market entry,
controlling for marginal cost. Our test is based on the assumption that while entrants
have only new customers, the share of new customers in total sales decreases with tenure
in a market. We find that controlling for marginal cost, brands which successfully enter a
product segment in a particular regional market build market share significantly in the four
years following entry. However, markups do not rise over this time horizon. If anything,
there is a slight decline in markups with tenure, that is statistically, if not economically,
significant. This behavior of markups rejects the customer markets model of market share
acquisition in the consumer food industry.
    In addition to our baseline findings on the behavior of market share and markups, we
find that the extensive margin of stores plays an important role in sales growth within a
market. In the light of the fact that placing a product in stores is costly for firms, this is
suggestive evidence that marketing expenditures (rather than markups) play an important
role in building market share.
    The Nielsen Retail Scanner data set has several attractive features for our purposes.
Unlike consumer products such as household goods and apparel, the market for consumer
food is likely to be geographically segmented, allowing us to treat different regions as different
distinct markets. Meanwhile Nielsen-covered stores account for over 50% of grocery and
drug store spending in the United States. So while market entry is censored by the fact that
coverage is not 100%, nevertheless the degree of censoring is much less than in alternative
data sets such as the Nielsen Consumer Panel and the IRI data.
    Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that brands are not always introduced simul-
taneously across all markets in the U.S. Instead, entry is staggered, inducing variation in
tenure across regional markets within a brand. This allows us to use a fixed effects strategy
to control for supply-side factors such as marginal cost, and hence identify the behavior of
markups. We also use a fixed effects strategy to control for demand-side factors that affect
all brands selling a given product in a particular regional market equally. This implies that
our quantity results map into the behavior of market share.

    Our findings are consistent with recent work based on customs data, which also finds
that quantities grow while markups are flat in successful export spells.4 Our findings on the
slow growth of market share are consistent with those of Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson
(2008), who use U.S. Census of Manufactures data on a restricted set of industries producing
relatively homogeneous goods. In contrast to Foster et al, we focus on within-firm, cross-
market heterogeneity and find no role for prices in explaining differential growth of market
share across different markets. Meanwhile, our work is also related to Hottman, Redding and
Weinstein (2016), who use Nielsen data to argue that “product appeal” plays a key role in
explaining cross-sectional differences in firm size. We show that “product appeal” (i.e. the
behavior of market share conditional on cost and markups) has a striking dynamic pattern.
Our work is also related to Argente, Lee and Moreira (2018), who use Nielsen data to look
at the product cycle at the UPC level.
    The paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we describe the data and provide
relevant summary statistics. In the third section, we describe our empirical strategy. In the
fourth section, we describe our results. The final section concludes.


2         Data Description
2.1         Overview
Our primary data source is the Nielsen Retail Scanner database for the years 2006-2016. This
database contains data on the dollar value and volume (along with the relevant quantity unit)
of weekly sales at the store level for approximately 2.6 million barcodes (UPCs) in roughly
35,000 grocery stores, drug stores, and mass merchandisers located throughout the United
States. According to Nielsen estimates as of 2011, these data cover 53% of all-commodity
volume (ACV) in grocery stores, 52% of ACV in drug stores, and 32% of ACV in mass
merchandisers.

2.1.1        Markets

For each participating store, we know the parent chain, the 3-digit zip code, and the Nielsen
Designated Market Area (DMA) where it operates. There are 210 Nielsen-defined DMAs,
with coverage in nearly every major U.S. metropolitan area. For the purposes of our empirical
analysis, we treat each DMA as a geographically distinct market. We assume that customers
can only purchase from firms participating in their local DMA, that they have access to all
    4
        See Fitzgerald, Haller, & Yedid-Levi (2017).



                                                       3
UPCs sold in their local market, and that observing positive sales in the Nielsen Retail
Scanner database is a good measure of participation in a local DMA by a UPC.

2.1.2    Products and brands

The hierarchical structure of the data is as follows. There are ten Nielsen-defined depart-
ments. We make use of five of these departments in our analysis: Dry Grocery, Dairy, Deli,
Packaged Meat, and Fresh Produce.5 We focus on food departments because for the sample
period, the market for consumer food is more likely to be geographically segmented than the
market for non-food consumer goods. Within each department, there are Nielsen-defined
product groups, and within each product group, there are Nielsen-defined product modules.
For example, in the Dairy department “CHEESE” is a product group, while “CHEESE -
NATURAL - MOZZARELLA” is a product module within “CHEESE.” There are more
than 1,000 product modules in the full set of ten departments. Our baseline definition of a
product is a Nielsen-defined product module, and from now on, we refer to product modules
simply as “products.”
    Within products, the finest level of disaggregation is the UPC. For each UPC, we observe
the unit of quantity, e.g. “oz", “quart," etc., and the number of units in a package. This
allows us to compare quantities across UPCs within products. For example, if Dannon brand
yogurt is sold in 42 oz. tubs, while Chobani brand yogurt is sold in 4 oz. 6-packs, we can use
ounces as the common unit of quantity, with Chobani being coded as 24 units and Dannon
as 42 units. Sometimes, there are multiple units of quantity within a product. Generally,
this is because for some UPCs the quantity unit is “counts.” In our current analysis, we drop
all UPCs where the quantity unit is a count. These observations account for 5.1% of total
value in our five departments.6 Occasionally, we observe multiple units of quantity because
e.g. some UPCs within a product report quantities in weight, while others report quantities
in volume. In these cases, we split the UPCs in the product into two groups according to the
relevant unit of quantity, and treat each product-unit of quantity pair as a distinct product.
    Nielsen also classifies UPCs into brands. Brands may cross products: roughly one quarter
of brands have positive sales in multiple products. In addition, firms may have multiple
brands. Hottman, Redding and Weinstein (2016) make use of information embedded in
the UPCs to aggregate up to the firm level. To date we have not implemented this in our
analysis.
   5
     In future iterations of this work we plan to make use of Frozen Foods, which is the remaining food
department. The other four departments are Alcoholic Beverages, Health & Beauty Care, Non-Food Grocery
and General Merchandise.
   6
     This problem is even more severe in non-food departments such as Health and Beauty Care.



                                                  4
2.2       Aggregation
We use the product-brand pair as our baseline unit of analysis. This strikes a balance: it
allows us to aggregate quantities consistently, while ensuring that we do not have to deal
with entry and exit of UPCs that may be due to minor product or packaging modifications.
In addition, advertising takes place at the brand (rather than UPC) level, and it is likely that
individual brands have separate management teams.7 Given our focus on how firms building
market share, this makes the brand a convenient place to start. Of course, this means that
we do not control for quality as cleanly as an analysis based on UPCs. We return to this
issue in discussing the implications of our results. At this point, we do not address how firms
may build market share by adding new brands.
    We aggregate from weekly data to the annual level, to avoid spurious entry and exit for
seasonal products. As already noted, we work for now with the 210 Nielsen-defined DMAs
as our geographically segmented markets.
    Mechanically, we first aggregate store-level weekly sales value and volume for each UPC
up to the annual level. Then, we match UPCs with products, quantity units and brands, and
match stores with their respective DMAs. For each product, quantity unit, brand, DMA,
and year we record total sales value and total sales volume. Taking the ratio of total sales
value to total sales volume, we obtain unit values which we refer to as prices. In addition,
we record the number of UPCs and number of stores within the brand-product pair.
    Nielsen codes all private label brands as control brands and thus, we cannot distinguish
between the sales of two different private label brands in a given DMA. We drop all control
brands from the data. In doing so, we drop 20.6% of sales.


2.3       Summary statistics
Table 1 reports the number of distinct products, brands, markets, and product-brand-market
triplets present in the data in each year. Collapsing on these dimensions yields a data set
with 21 million observations which is the basis for our analysis. It is useful to note that
while in the full data set, there are 53 brands per product on average, at the level of the
individual market, there are only 18 brands per product on average. This tells us that
market penetration at the product-brand level is far from complete, in line with the findings
of Bronnenberg, Dhar and Dubé (2007). Our empirical strategy builds on this fact.
    In addition to imperfect market penetration in the cross-section, our empirical analysis
relies on the fact that the pattern of market participation is not static: we observe frequent
episodes of brand entry at the product-market level. We say that a brand enters a product-
  7
      See Bronnenberg, Dhar and Dubé (2011).


                                                5
market in year t if it has zero sales in that market in year t − 1, and positive sales in year
t. We say that a brand exits a product-market in year t if it has positive sales in year t,
and zero sales in year t + 1. Entry is censored in 2006, and exit is censored in 2016. Note
that brands can (and do) enter a product-market multiple times during the sample. For the
moment, we do not distinguish between entry and re-entry. Figures 1,2, and 3 are scatter
plots of the average entry and exit rates (across years) at the product, market, and product-
market levels. In addition, we report average entry and exit rates by year in Table 2. Notice
there is substantial entry and exit at all levels. Futhermore, the average share of total sales
accounted for by entrants in the year of entry is 1.80%, while the average share of total sales
accounted for by brand-product-markets where entry is observed in-sample is 12.5%.
   Our empirical analysis also relies on entry at the brand-product level that is non-synchronous
across markets. In Table 3 we report the distribution of product-brand-year triplets by the
change in the number of markets they participate in relative to the previous year. On av-
erage 44% of product-brand pairs either exit or enter into a new market in any given year.
Note that this is a lower bound on churn since product-brands may enter and exit the same
number of markets in a given year. This churn is critical to our analysis in that it induces
the within-product-brand variation in market tenure and spell duration that we utilize in
our empirical strategy.


3    Empirical strategy
The goal of our empirical strategy is to distinguish between competing models of how firms
build market share and, in particular, to examine the role played by markups. We do so
by tracking how quantities and prices evolve following market entry. We assume that while
entrants have only new customers, the share of new customers in total sales decreases with
tenure in a market, and hence the behavior of market shares and markups following entry
can shed light on the role of markups in building market share.
   Before describing our approach, it is useful to define two variables: market tenure, and
completed spell duration. Market tenure is the cumulative number of periods of continuous
market participation at the product-brand-market level. Completed spell duration is the
maximum market tenure achieved in a product-brand-market-level sales spell, i.e. the market
tenure on exit for that spell. Table 4 illustrates these definitions for a hypothetical product-
brand pair in a series of markets. In this table, as in our implementation, tenure and duration
are top-coded at 5 years. This allows us to assign a duration to (some) sales spells where
entry is observed, but exit is censored by the end of the sample.
   With those definitions out of the way, there are three elements to our empirical strategy.

                                               6
First, we purge the data of variation that is common to all markets served by a product-brand
pair, and variation that is common to all brands selling in a particular product-market. In
doing so, we remove the first-order effect of cost and quality heterogeneity: better brands
may sell more and at lower (or higher) prices in all markets. We also remove the first-order
effect of differences in market size and tastes: all brands sell more in bigger and richer
markets, and all brands selling a particular product sell more (and potentially at higher
prices) in markets with a strong taste for that particular product. This allows us to identify
the behavior of market shares and markups,
    Second, we focus on product-brand pairs which enter at least one market during our
sample period and we examine how quantities, prices, number of stores and number of
UPCs evolve with tenure in a market. This allows us to build an understanding of how
quickly entrants reach their steady state market share, and what role (if any) is played by
prices in this process.
    Third, we allow the evolution of quantities, prices, etc. with tenure to differ across sales
spells with different completed duration. There are two reasons to do this. Both rely on
the assumption that the completed duration of a sales spell depends on the permanent com-
ponents of product-brand-specific costs, product-market size, and product-brand-market-
specific idiosyncratic demand. If this is the case, controlling for completed spell duration
allows us to deal with potential bias in the relationship between quantity, price, etc. and
tenure due to correlation between tenure and unobserved idiosyncratic demand. In addition,
the efforts firms exert to build market share may to depend on the permanent components
of costs, market size, and idiosyncratic demand. By allowing the relationship between quan-
tities, prices, etc. and tenure to differ across firm-product-market observations based on
completed duration, we can test whether this is the case.
    More precisely, we simultaneously implement these three elements as follows. Let i index
brands, let j index products (product modules), let k index markets (DMAs), and let t index
time (years). Let wtijk be log quantity, log price, log number of stores or log number of UPCs.
We estimate:


                                                              
                      wtijk = δtjk + cij

                                                 a ijk
                                                   t   ⊗ s ijk
                                                           t     + censijk + εijk
                                                                              t              (1)

Here, δtjk is a product-market-year fixed effect that controls for demand side factors common
to all firms in a product-market-year. cijt is a firm-product-year fixed effect that controls for

in market k with product j, and sijk
                                   t   is a vector of indicators for the (topcoded) duration of


                                                  7
the relevant sales spell. censijk is a vector of indicator variables, for right- and left-censoring
of the relevant sales spell.8 Lastly, note that ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. Naturally,
we do not observe sales spells with market tenure greater than the completed duration so
redundant interactions are dropped.
    Notice that linear combinations of the coefficients in β allow us to map out the average
evolution of log quantities and log prices with tenure, for spells of different duration.
    In addition, we document the distribution of sales spells of different lengths by estimating
the following nonparametric exit hazard:
                          h                  i
                            ijk
                        Pr Xt+1 = 0|Xtijk = 1 = δtjk + cij   0 ijk
                                                        t + β at + cens
                                                                        ijk
                                                                            + εijk
                                                                               t               (2)

Here, Xtijk = {0, 1} is an indicator variable for participation. The other variables are as
defined above, except that observations from right-censored spells are assigned their market
tenure rather than being included through an indicator variable for right-censoring. In this
expression, censijk indicates observations from left-censored spells (for which tenure is not
observed).


4         Results
In Table 5 we report the distribution of sample value by sales spell duration and market
tenure. Clearly, the bulk of the data is accounted for by observations where either tenure or
duration, or both, are censored. Nevertheless, 12.5% of value is accounted for by observa-
tions where entry takes place in-sample. Similarly, in Table 6 we report the distribution of
observations by sales spell duration and market tenure. In these terms, observations where
entry takes place in-sample accounts for nearly half of the observations of the sample.
    Table 7 reports the OLS estimates of equation (1) with log revenue, log quantity, log price
as dependent variables. Table 8 reports the OLS estimates of (1) with log count of UPCs, log
count of stores, and log revenue per store and per UPC as dependent variables. In all cases,
the omitted category is sales spells that last exactly one year. The tables report intercepts
for spells of different duration, as well as the evolution of the dependent variable throughout
a spell relative to its value on entry. Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 illustrate the trajectories of
quantity, price, number of stores, and number of UPCs. These trajectories are calculated by
exponentiating the relevant sums of coefficients from Tables 7 and 8. Confidence intervals
for these trajectories are tiny.
    There are three points to note about these results. First, conditional on costs, higher
    8
        Spells that are both left- and right-censored are classified as left-censored.

quantities on entry forecast longer survival, while quantities grow by more a factor of 2.8
between the entry year and year 4 in the longest sales spells. Meanwhile, there are hump-
shaped dynamics of quantities in sales spells where exit is observed. As already noted, since
we control throughout for product-market-year effects, these are the dynamics of market
share. Since these dynamics of market share are conditional on product-brand-year effects,
to the extent that marginal costs are similar across markets, they cannot be driven by costs.
Instead, they must be due to movements along the demand curve through changing markups,
or shifts in the demand curve faced by individual product-brand pairs in individual markets.
    Second, since we condition on costs, we can infer the behavior of markups from the the
price equation. Higher markups on entry forecast survival longer than 1 year, though beyond
that they have little predictive power. Note that this is based on within-brand cross-market
variation after controlling for product-market effects. As such, this fact cannot be attributed
to all firms having higher prices in some markets. As regards dynamics of markups, to the
extent that prices vary with tenure, they fall with tenure. This is particularly pronounced
in the year prior to exit, when prices are on average 9% below their level on entry. For the
longest sales spells, prices are 1% lower in subsequent years than they are in the year of
entry.
    The joint behavior of market share and markups in the longest sales spells is contrary
to the customer markets hypothesis, which posits that firms charge low markups to attract
customers, and subsequently raise markups once customers are locked in. Upon entry into
a market, all customers are new. Presumably the share of new customers falls as a brand
ages in a market. But we do not find markups rising with tenure; on the contrary, they
appear to fall with tenure. This is a feature of the longest sales spells, where presumably
brands are likely to endure, and pricing is chosen to trade off current and future demand.
It is also a feature of exiting spells, where rather than taking advantage of the fact that
exit is imminent by raising prices to extract the maximum from remaining customers, prices
actually fall immediately prior to exit. Moreover, given the modest reduction in markups
with tenure in successful sales spells, it is unlikely that falling markups alone can account for
growth in market share - this would require remarkably elastic demand. Taken together, the
behavior of market share and markups in successful spells suggest that firms build market
share by shifting their demand curve rather than moving along their demand curve.
    Third, the evolution of number of stores and number of UPCs is qualitatively similar to
the evolution of quantities. Quantitatively, the number of stores rises more with tenure in
successful spells than does the number of UPCs. This suggests two things. First, at least
within the context of a brand, selling to more customers is quantitatively more important for
sales growth than selling a greater variety of products to the same customers. Second, since


                                               9
placing a brand in stores is known to be costly, it suggests a role for marketing expenditures
in acquiring access to more customers, and hence shifting demand to build market share.
    Table 9 reports the OLS estimates of equation (2). Figure 8 presents the exit probability
by market tenure relative to the exit probability of a one-year spell. The rate of exit peaks in
the second year following entry, and falls thereafter. This behavior of the exit probability may
be suggestive of a role for learning about idiosyncratic demand in explaining the behavior of
market share and markups.


4.1    Relation to the literature
Our empirical approach is very similar to that in Fitzgerald, Haller and Yedid-Levi (2017)
who use customs data on merchandise exports for Ireland to examine the dynamic evolution
of quantities and prices post export entry. Our findings are also very similar to theirs. High
initial sales forecast survival in a market, and sales grow substantially over the initial years
of long-lasting episodes of market participation. Meanwhile, markups are flat with respect
to market tenure. One difference between our findings and theirs is that in the Nielsen data,
we observe statistically significant price declines prior to exit, while this is not the case in
customs data.
    While the time horizon in our analysis is much shorter, our finding that cost does not
play a key role in the slow growth of market share is consistent with Foster, Haltiwanger and
Syverson (2008), who use U.S. Census of Manufactures data on a restricted set of industries
producing relatively homogeneous goods. In contrast to Foster et al, we focus on within-
firm, cross-market heterogeneity and find no role for prices in explaining differential growth
of market share across different markets.
    Our work is also related to Hottman, Redding and Weinstein (2016), who use Nielsen
Consumer Panel data to argue that product appeal plays a key role in explaining cross-
sectional differences in firm size. We show that “product appeal” (i.e. the behavior of
market share conditional on cost and markups) has a striking dynamic pattern, and that
this dynamic pattern of building market share is unlikely to occur through the mechanisms
emphasized in the customer markets hypothesis.
    Our findings are also related to those of Argente, Lee and Moreira (2018). They use
Nielsen Retail Scanner data to argue that the product cycle in consumer goods is very short,
and they emphasize the importance of adding products for firm growth. In contrast to
Argente et al., we focus on the brand rather than the UPC as the unit of analysis, and use
the sequential roll-out of brands across markets to identify the dynamics of quantities and
markups.

5     Discussion and conclusions
The customer markets literature argues that firms use markups as a tool to build market
share. More precisely, this literature argues that firms attract new customers by offering
them low markups, but then raise markups once customers are locked in. We show that the
market for consumer food products does not exhibit these types of dynamics. While there is
substantial growth in market share in the initial years of successful sales spells, these episodes
are not accompanied by rising markups as the customer markets theory predicts. Instead,
if anything, markups fall marginally as market share grows. These patterns in successful
episodes of market entry are consistent with what has been found using customs micro-data.
    The patterns we document point toward a potentially important role for marketing and
advertising activity in building market share. We show that the extensive margin of stores
plays an important role in the growth of sales in a market. Since we know from the marketing
literature that firms may incur direct costs in order to place their product in stores, this is
suggestive of a role for marketing. In future work will make use of the Nielsen Ad Intel data
to document the role played by advertising in building market share.
