I. Introduction

        In recent years, a substantial body of research has focused on the question of how

environmental policy should be set in an economy with pre-existing distortionary taxes, a

question with significant policy importance. A number of previous papers have shown that

interactions with pre-existing taxes raise the cost of environmental taxes. However, these

papers did not account for impacts of changes in environmental quality on individual health.

A recent paper by Schwartz and Repetto (2000) argues that, when health effects are

accounted for, the optimal environmental tax may exceed the marginal damage from

pollution. The present paper demonstrates that this is not the case.

        Previous papers have pointed out two contrasting effects on the costs of

environmental taxes in the presence of pre-existing distortionary taxes. Some early papers1

suggested that the cost of a pollution tax could be lower in such a context, because pollution

tax revenue could replace revenue from distortionary taxes such as the income tax, and thus

produce a welfare gain. This effect has come to be known as the revenue-recycling effect.

        More recent papers2 demonstrated the existence of a second general-equilibrium

effect, the tax-interaction effect, which works in the opposite direction. Pollution taxes drive

up the price of consumption goods, thus lowering the real wage and discouraging labor

supply. This exacerbates the tax distortion in the labor market, creating an efficiency loss.

Thus, the tax-interaction effect tends to raise to costs of environmental taxes. These papers

also show that this loss is larger than the gain from the revenue-recycling effect, because the

pollution tax has a narrower base than the labor tax, and thus is less efficient at raising

revenue. Consequently, in an economy with pre-existing distortionary taxes, the optimal

pollution tax is typically lower than in an economy without such pre-existing taxes.

        Schwartz and Repetto (2000) question this conclusion. They cite a large body of

evidence suggesting that a significant portion of the cost of pollution comes in the form of

damages to human health, and that such health damages tend to reduce labor supply. This

evidence is used to justify assuming a preference structure in which leisure and environmental

quality are substitutes, whereas the prior literature had assumed that environmental quality is

separable in utility. Their paper then shows that when environmental quality is a leisure

substitute, the optimal pollution tax will be higher than previous studies have indicated, and

that it could easily exceed the level of marginal damages.

        The present paper reexamines the implications of health effects from pollution.

Rather than simply assuming a preference relationship, as in Schwartz and Repetto, it uses a

model with an explicit representation of the ways in which health damages from pollution

affect labor supply.3 In this model, health damage from pollution may affect labor supply

through two distinct channels–by increasing spending on medical care, and/or by causing

individuals to spend time sick, thus reducing the time they have available for labor or leisure.

        The model confirms that health effects do indeed affect labor supply, and that this

results in an additional impact, here termed the benefit-side tax-interaction effect. However,

counter to Schwartz and Repetto’s results, the model demonstrates that this effect cannot

cause the optimal pollution tax to exceed marginal damages. In fact, it shows that, for typical

parameter values, this effect will cause the optimal pollution tax to be even lower than that

indicated by previous studies which assumed separability.

        To the extent that health damage from pollution causes households to spend more on

medical care, the benefits from reduced pollution are diminished by the benefit-side tax-

interaction effect. Thus, the optimal pollution tax will be less than previous studies have

indicated, and will be substantially below the marginal damage from pollution.

        In contrast, to the extent that pollution causes increased time lost to illness, the sign of

the benefit-side tax-interaction effect will be ambiguous, though for typical parameter values,

this effect will diminish the benefits of regulation. Furthermore, even if parameter values are

such that this effect does increase the benefits of regulation, the optimal pollution tax will still

be unambiguously less than marginal damages. These results differ sharply from Schwartz




3
 This model and the analysis presented here draw heavily on Williams (2000), which analyzes the
implications of health and productivity effects on second-best environmental taxation.

and Repetto’s conclusions, demonstrating the value of modeling such effects explicitly rather

than assuming a preference relationship.

        The next section of the paper presents an analytically tractable general-equilibrium

model that explicitly models health damages from pollution, and derives expressions for the

welfare effect from and optimal level of a pollution tax. The final section summarizes and

concludes.



II. The Model

        A representative agent model is assumed, where households divide their time

endowment (T) between leisure (l) and labor (L), which is used to produce the two

consumption goods, X and Y. Households divide their income between consumption of X

and Y in order to maximize the utility function

(1)     U( V( l, X, Y ), H, G)

which is continuous and quasi-concave. G is the quantity of a public good, and H represents

consumer health.

        X, Y, G, and medical care (M) are all produced using labor as the only factor of

production. All production is assumed to follow constant returns to scale, and units are

normalized such that one unit of labor can produce one unit of any of the four goods.

(2)     L = X+Y + M +G

        Pollution from consumption of good X reduces environmental quality. Good Y is

nonpolluting. Environmental quality is simply equal to an exogenous baseline level minus

emissions, with units normalized such that the production and consumption of one unit of X

results in one unit of emissions:

(3)     Q = Q− X

        Pollution has two effects. First, consumer health depends on environmental quality

and the level of medical care consumed.

(4)     H = H ( M, Q)

It is assumed that ∂H ∂M > 0 , ∂H ∂Q > 0 , ∂ 2 H ∂M 2 < 0 , and ∂ 2 H ∂M∂Q < 0 .




                                                3
        Second, pollution causes households to lose some time to sickness, thus reducing the

time they have available for work or leisure. This implies the following household time

constraint

(5)      L + l = T − S (Q)

where S(Q) represents time spent sick, which is decreasing in Q.

        The government levies a corrective tax on good X, and also imposes a tax on labor

income. We normalize the gross wage to equal one, which yields the consumer budget

constraint

(6)      (1 −τ ) L + I = (1+ τ )X + Y + M
                L                     X


where I is lump-sum income, which is assumed to be zero.4

        Revenue from the two taxes is used to finance provision of the public good. 5 For

simplicity, we assume that the level of the public good is fixed.6

(7)      G = τL L + τXX

        Households maximize utility (1) subject to their time constraint (5) and budget

constraint (6), taking the quantity of the public good, the tax rates, and the level of

environmental quality as given. This yields the first order conditions:

                                                                                      ∂H
(8)      UV VX = (1 + τ X ) λ ; UV VY = λ ; UV Vl = (1− τ L ) λ ; UH                     =λ
                                                                                      ∂M

where λ represents the marginal utility of income.

        These first-order conditions, together with the other equations given thus far,

implicitly define the uncompensated demand functions:

(9)      X( τ X ,τ L , Q, I ) ; Y (τ X ,τ L , Q, I ) ; l( τ X , τ L , Q, I ) ; M( τ X , τ L , Q, I )


4
  The reader may wonder why the budget constraint includes I , given that households do not have any
lump-sum income. This is necessary in order to provide a rigorous expression for income effects later in
the paper.

5
 If government revenue were instead used to provide a fixed lump-sum transfer to households, as in
Schwartz and Repetto (2000), the model’s results would be unchanged, as long as the value of the transfer is
held constant in real terms.

6
 Assuming instead that the government provides the optimal level of the public good would substantially
complicate the analysis. The paper’s results, however, would be qualitatively the same.



                                                                     4
       Taking a total derivative of utility with respect to the corrective tax (τX), substituting in

the consumer first-order conditions, dividing through by λ, and using dG = 0 yield

                                                             1 ∂U ∂H dQ

the two distorted markets.

           This is the marginal cost of public funds (MCPF), or the cost to the household of

raising one dollar of government revenue through the labor tax. The numerator in the first

term is the marginal deadweight loss in the labor market, while the denominator is the

marginal revenue from a change in the tax rate. The cost to households is the deadweight

loss plus the revenue; hence the MCPF is this first term plus one. This is a partial equilibrium

definition of the MCPF; it ignores the effects of the labor tax on deadweight loss in the

market for good X, revenue from the corrective tax, and environmental quality. We will

assume that labor supply is not backward-bending and that marginal revenue from the labor

tax is positive, which together imply that η >1 .

           This expression decomposes the welfare effect into four components: the primary

welfare effect, (dW P ), the revenue-recycling effect, (dW R ), the (cost-side) tax-interaction effect

( dW I ), and the benefit-side tax-interaction effect ( dW IB ). The primary welfare effect is the

effect of the tax on the pollution externality, equal to the wedge between the social cost of

emissions (the Pigouvian tax) and the private cost (the tax on good X). The revenue-

recycling effect is the efficiency gain from using pollution tax revenue to reduce the labor

tax rate, which equals the marginal cost of public funds minus one times the marginal

pollution tax revenue.

           Finally, two tax-interaction effects result when the pollution tax alters households’

labor supply decisions, thus altering the welfare loss from the income tax distortion in the

labor market.7 The cost-side tax-interaction effect dW I , which is by now well-known from

the prior literature, results when the pollution tax drives up the costs of producing consumer

goods, lowering the real wage and discouraging labor supply. The benefit-side tax-

interaction effect dW IB expresses the impact of improved environmental quality on labor

supply decisions.

    Schwartz and Repetto (2000) treated these two effects together, but this paper will treat them separately.


                                                        6
        Each of the two tax-interaction effects is equal to the distortionary wedge in the labor

market (the income tax) times the change in leisure. Added to this is the gain or loss from

changes in labor tax revenue, equal to the change in tax revenue times the marginal cost of

public funds minus one. Summing those elements for the effect of the pollution tax on

consumer good prices gives the third term in (22), and a similar sum for the change resulting

from improved environmental quality gives the fourth term.

        The prior literature (Parry (1995), for example) has shown that the cost of

environmental regulation depends on the degree of substitutability between the polluting

good and leisure. For simplicity, we consider the neutral assumption that good X is an

average substitute for leisure. Given this assumption, the cost-side tax-interaction effect can

be expressed (see appendix for derivation) as

(17)    dW I = −( η −1 ) X

        The benefit-side tax-interaction effect can be expressed (see appendix for derivation) as

                           ∂S ε LI  ∂M  −1  ∂S            ∂M  dQ
(18)    dW IB = −( η − 1) τ L +    1−          (1− τ L ) + 
                           ∂Q ε L    ∂I   ∂Q             ∂Q  dτ X

where εLI is the income elasticity of labor supply and εL is the uncompensated labor supply

elasticity. Examining this expression shows that if an improved environment results in lower

spending on medical care, the benefit-side tax-interaction effect will reduce the benefit of

regulation. In this case, environmental quality is a substitute for a private good (medical

care), and thus increased environmental quality increases leisure consumption, causing a

general-equilibrium welfare loss.

        In contrast, if an improved environment results in less time lost to illness, then the sign

of the benefit-side tax-interaction effect is ambiguous. Reducing time lost to illness increases

both leisure demand and labor supply. The first term in brackets is the welfare gain that

results because the increased labor supply boosts labor tax revenue. However, there is an

offsetting welfare loss (part of the second term in brackets) because increased leisure demand




                                                7
exacerbates the labor market distortion. Therefore, the sign of the total effect is ambiguous,

and depends on tax rates and elasticities.8

         Substituting (17) and (18) into (16) and canceling terms yield

         1 dU                   dX               ∂S ε LI           −1

         Setting this expression equal to zero and rearranging, using dQ = −dX , yield an

expression for the optimal pollution tax

         The first term on the right-hand side of this equation–the Pigouvian tax rate divided

by the marginal cost of public funds–is the optimal environmental tax rate found by previous

studies which assume that environmental quality is separable in utility. The second term

represents the effect of benefit-side tax interactions.

         Is it possible that the optimal pollution tax exceed the Pigouvian tax rate? For this to

be the case, the term in brackets must exceed the Pigouvian tax rate. Inspection reveals that

this is impossible. The second term in brackets is negative, and the first term is at most equal

to the labor tax rate times the Pigouvian tax rate. Thus, Schwartz and Repetto’s claim–that

health effects may cause the optimal tax rate to exceed the Pigouvian level–is invalid.

         But is the optimal pollution tax above the level suggested by most other prior work,

which assumed that environmental quality is separable in utility. For this to be the case, the

term in brackets must be positive. Assuming that the labor tax rate is 0.4, the uncompensated

labor supply elasticity is 0.15, the income elasticity of labor supply is −0.15, and that medical

  Schwartz and Repetto (2000) correctly noted that if pollution causes households to spend time sick,
improvements in environmental quality will increase labor supply. However, contrary to their conclusion,
this does not necessarily mean that there will be a gain from the benefit-side tax-interaction effect. It is
easy to see the source of their error. In a model in which the total time available for labor and leisure is
fixed–as in Schwartz and Repetto’s study–an increase in labor supply requires a decrease in leisure
consumption. Explicitly modeling this health impact, however, shows that both labor and leisure will
increase in response to reduced pollution, and thus that the sign of the welfare impact is ambiguous.



                                                      8
spending is not an inferior good9 implies that it is negative. Thus, if either type of health

effect is present, the optimal tax will actually be lower than in a model in which environmental

quality is separable in utility.



III. Conclusions

        This paper has shown that when improved environmental quality reduces spending on

medical care, the optimal environmental tax will be lower than indicated by models in which

environmental quality is separable from goods and leisure in the utility function. A similar

result will hold for typical parameter values when environmental quality affects time lost to

illness, though it is possible for the optimal environmental tax to be higher if income effects

on labor supply are quite small. In either case, the optimal environmental tax will be below

the value of marginal damages from pollution.

        These results run counter to those found by Schwartz and Repetto (2000). This

demonstrates the value of explicitly modeling health effects, rather than assuming a

preference relationship, and reinforces the general notion that pre-existing distortionary taxes

tend to raise the costs of environmental taxes.

 These labor elasticities are roughly consistent with those found by Fuchs, Krueger, and Poterba (1998) in
a survey of labor economists. A labor tax rate of 0.4 is a standard assumption in the literature; see, for
example, Browning (1987).

Appendix

Derivation of Equation (17)

        The expression for the (cost-side) tax-interaction effect from equation (16) is:

                        ∂l
(A1)    dW I = −ητ L
                       ∂τ X

Because the change in the price of good X is equal to the change in the tax rate, the Slutsky equation

gives

         ∂l   ∂l C ∂l
(A2)        =     − X
        ∂τ X ∂τ X ∂I

where the superscript “C” denotes a compensated derivative.

Similarly,

         ∂l   ∂l C ∂l
(A3)        =     − L
        ∂τ L ∂τ L ∂I

Taking a derivative of the household utility function (1), holding the levels of utility and of

environmental quality constant and substituting in the consumer first-order conditions (11) yield

        ∂l C        ∂l C      1 + τ X ∂X C        1       ∂Y C       1       ∂M C
(A4)         =−             =                  +                  +
        ∂τ L    ∂ (1 − τ L ) 1− τ L ∂ (1− τ L ) 1− τ L ∂ (1 −τ L ) 1 −τ L ∂ (1− τ L )

The assumption that the cross-elasticity between X and leisure is equal to the average (weighted by

consumption share) over all goods can be written as

           ∂X C 1 − τ L                                        ∂X C 1 −τ L       ∂Y C 1 −τ L       ∂M C 1 −τ L 
                                               (1 +τ X ) X
                                    1
(A5)                    =                                                   +Y                +M                
        ∂ (1 − τ L ) X    (1 + τ X )X + Y + M               ∂ (1 −τ L ) X     ∂ (1− τ L ) Y     ∂ (1 −τ L ) M 

Substituting (A5) and the household budget constraint (6) into (A4) yields

        ∂l C    ∂X C L
(A6)         =
        ∂τ L ∂ (1 − τ L ) X

Finally, the Slutsky symmetry property gives

        ∂lC     ∂X C
(A7)        =
        ∂τ X ∂ (1 −τ L )

Substituting (A2), (A3), (A6), (A7) and the definition of η (15) into (A1) yields equation (17).



Derivation of Equation (18)



                                                      A-1
        The expression for the benefit-side tax-interaction effect from equation (16) is:

                            ∂S        ∂l  dQ
(A8)    dW IB = − (η −1)τ L    + ητ L    
                            ∂Q        ∂Q  dτ X

        The change in spending on X, Y, and l for a change in I will equal

(A9)    (1 −τ ) ∂l + (1 + τ ) ∂X + ∂Y = 1 − ∂M
                   ∂I            ∂I   ∂I          ∂I
               L            X



        For a change in Q that change will be

(A10)   (1 −τ ) ∂l + (1+ τ ) ∂X + ∂Y       = −(1 −τ L )
                                                          ∂S ∂M
                                                            −
                   ∂Q            ∂Q   ∂Q                  ∂Q ∂Q
               L             X



        Weak separability of health in the utility function implies that leisure demand is determined

solely by the relative prices of l, X, and Y (which are not affected by changes in Q) and by the amount

spent on those goods. Together with (A9) and (A10), this implies

            ∂l  ∂M   ∂S                 
                      −1
      ∂l
(A11)    = − 1 −         (1 −τ L ) + ∂M 
      ∂Q    ∂I   ∂I   ∂Q             ∂Q 

        The uncompensated labor supply elasticity is

                   ∂L 1− τ L    ∂l 1− τ L
(A12) ε L =                  =
               ∂ (1− τ L ) L   ∂τ L L

and the income elasticity of labor supply is

               ∂L (1 −τ L ) L     ∂l
(A13) ε LI =                  =−      (1− τ L )
               ∂I     L          ∂τ L

        Substituting expressions (A11) through (A13) and the definition of the MCPF (15) into (A8)

and rearranging yields equation (18)
