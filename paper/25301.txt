                                          ABSTRACT

We explore whether the 2008 economic collapse in Iceland and subsequent economic crisis
affected the probability of ischemic heart disease (IHD) events, independent of regular cyclical
effects attributed to typical economic conditions. We estimate linear probability models using
administrative data on IHD events, earnings and balance-sheet status, as well as unemployment
for all Icelanders aged 16 and older in 2000-2014.

We find that the sharp change in economic conditions in 2008 had a positive long-term effect on
the probability of cardiovascular events in both males and females. In absolute terms these effects
were small but often statistically significant and contrast with the finding that general business-
cycle fluctuations operated in the opposite direction. Several potential mediators were correlated
with the probability of IHD events, but their inclusion had little effect on the estimated economic
crisis coefficients. A statistically significant business-cycle effect is found for both genders
indicating. Thus the general business cycle and the economic collapse in 2008 and subsequent
crisis can be thought of as separate phenomena with differing effects on IHD. This research
contributes to the literature by exploiting a unique circumstance affecting a whole population to
explore its effects on individuals, using exceptional register data.

    The effect of the economic collapse in Iceland on the probability of

                                                 cardiovascular events




1. Introduction

Following booming economic times in the early 2000s, Iceland experienced an economic collapse that was unique in terms of

speed, scope, and severity, and can almost be pinpointed to a single date, October 6th 2008, when Iceland’s Prime Minister

announced the risk of national bankruptcy (The Prime Minister's Office, 2008). The impact of the collapse was widely felt; many

people’s savings vanished with the crash of the Icelandic stock market, monthly unemployment rates tripled and remained high

compared to the pre-crisis long-term rate of around 2.5-3% (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-c), real wages dropped by 13% from the

beginning of 2008 to spring of 2010 (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-h), and the average Icelandic homeowner experienced an

approximately 27% decline in the real equity of their home between 2007 and 2010 (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-i). Even those not

directly experiencing a dramatic change in their own lives felt the shock through media and personal relationships. The crisis

following the collapse was relatively short lived and the Icelandic economy experienced substantial recovery as early as 2011, with

decreasing unemployment (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-h); growing GDP (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-f); stabilizing of prices with relatively low

inflation (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-b); climbing housing prices, and increased equity (Statistics Iceland, n.d.-j). It is thus clear that

dramatic changes, from boom-to-bust and subsequent recovery, took place within a short period of time.


Economic fluctuations are not all the same, and the collapse in Iceland can be characterized as a particularly severe shock.

Whether the health effects of such a shock can be fully attributed to general business-cycle effects is not well understood. In this

study, we examine whether the Icelandic economic collapse affected cardiovascular health, independent of regular cyclical effects

that can be attributed to more typical economic fluctuations. Using register-based individual data on earnings, unemployment,

and cardiovascular diseases for the Icelandic population we exploit this unique occurrence to examine the relationship between

the economic collapse and cardiovascular health, specifically focusing on ischemic heart disease (IHD) (also known as coronary

heart disease), the leading cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2014).
Although dating further back, the literature on business cycles and health received renewed impetus when Ruhm (2000) found

that mortality increases in good economic times. Other studies followed, using different data, methods, and health outcomes –

most with results consistent with those of Ruhm’s (Ariizumi & Schirle, 2012; Gerdtham & Ruhm, 2006; Tapia Granados, 2005; Tapia

Granados & Ionides, 2017; van den Berg et al., 2017), but others with conflicting findings of a counter-cyclical relationship

(Economou et al., 2008; Gerdtham & Johannesson, 2005; Svensson, 2007, 2010). There is furthermore evidence that the pro-

cyclicality of mortality has fallen, at least in the United States, in recent years (Ruhm, 2015). Although limited, some recent

evidence raises the possibility that large economic shocks have effects that differ in relative size or direction from those of smaller

shocks (Ruhm, 2016). The reason for such differences is not clear, but context appears to matter, and a fuller picture is slowly

emerging with each additional study showing results from different types of cycles, outcomes, and institutional or social settings.


In recent years the literature has moved towards more detailed analyses exploring the possible pathways of estimated effects.

Those include changes in personal income, health behaviors, and individual labor-market status (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2016a;

Asgeirsdottir et al., 2014a; Asgeirsdottir et al., 2016b; Asgeirsdottir et al., 2014b; Birgisdottir et al., 2017; Jonsdottir &

Asgeirsdottir, 2014; Miller et al., 2009; Olafsdottir & Asgeirsdottir, 2015; Olafsdottir et al., 2014; Ruhm, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2015).

Miller et al. (2009) found that the added deaths related to a drop in the unemployment rate are concentrated among age groups

that are mostly out of the labor force, indicating that work-related stress or substitution between work and health production are

not primarily to blame. Ruhm (2000) showed that changes in personal income play a negligible part in in the relationship between

business cycles and health, but he has also pointed to risky behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) as potential pathways (Ruhm,

2003, 2004, 2015). Conversely, increased income could have protective effects by raising the consumption of health care and other

health-improving activities, especially in countries where a substantial portion of health services are privately funded (Gerdtham &

Ruhm, 2006).


The Icelandic economic collapse has provided researchers with useful identifying variation of the effects of the collapse given the

sharp contrast in economic performance before versus after October 2008. The health outcomes previously explored include a

number of determinants of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (Asgeirsdottir et al. (2016a); Asgeirsdottir et al. (2014a); Asgeirsdottir et

al. (2016b); Asgeirsdottir et al. (2014b); Birgisdottir et al. (2017); (Eiriksdottir et al., 2015); Hauksdottir et al. (2013); Jonsdottir and

Asgeirsdottir (2014); McClure et al. (2012); Olafsdottir and Asgeirsdottir (2015); Olafsdottir et al. (2014)). Using survey data from

2007 and 2009, Asgeirsdottir et al. (2014b) find a short-term increased risk of male hypertension following the economic collapse

and with an added wave of the same data for 2012, Birgisdottir et al. (2017) also show a longer-run rise in hypertension among
females, and Eiriksdottir et al. (2015) find an increased risk of gestational hypertension after the economic collapse. Furthermore,

data from the emergency departments in Iceland’s capital area indicate a considerable increase in cardiac emergency department

attendance during the first week of the economic collapse, particularly among females, and particularly with IHD diagnoses

(Gudjonsdottir et al., 2012). This negative effect on heart health is not in accordance with results from other business cycles over

the years in Iceland, that have generally shown null-effects (Birgisdóttir & Ásgeirsdóttir, 2017) or negative effects on heart health

during times of increased economic activity (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016). As our analysis includes both general business-cycle

fluctuations as well as the sharp collapse associated with the Great Recession, we aim to separate the two and estimate their

relationship to cardiovascular health. Specifically, we assess whether the effect of the economic collapse of 2008 was in keeping

with the general business-cycle effect or not. This is accomplished by using more comprehensive and detailed data than what has

been carried out in the studies previously mentioned, but those only use aggregate data or small samples. In this study we use

individual-level data from registers on the full adult population in Iceland, in the hope that the scope of the study can tie together

results found in the previous literature.


Stress is known to raise the risk of IHD, as do various environmental factors (American Heart Association, 2015; Arbab-Zadeh et al.,

2012). The medical literature distinguishes between long-term risk factors such as age, hypertension, and cholesterol levels (Muller

et al., 1994) versus acute stressors such as natural disasters that come without warning (Dimsdale, 2008). Recent literature has

also shown that acute stressors, such as earthquakes can have long-term effects on cardiovascular-disease risk factors (Li et al.,

2017). Cardiac events increase in the immediate aftermath of such acute life stressors (Leor et al., 1996), and research shows that

transitory factors affect cardiovascular mortality. For example, peaks have been found in the morning hours (Cohen et al., 1997),

and on Mondays (Arntz et al., 2001). Long-term stressors associated with increased risk of coronary events include chronic work

stress (Matthews & Gump, 2002) and marital stress (Orth-Gomér et al., 2000). Furthermore, changes in the rate of coronary events

might emerge as immediate responses to circumstances (Ruhm, 2007) or as a delayed consequences of accumulated effects

(American Heart Association, 2015; Olafsdottir et al., 2016). Stress, particularly among females, rose as a result of Iceland’s

economic crash (Hauksdottir et al., 2013). Therefore, a study on the effects of a stressful event such as an economic collapse on

coronary diseases is of high relevance.


This study contributes to the related literature by examining the short-term effects of the Icelandic economic collapse on the

probability of IHD events (in the first months following the unofficial date of economic collapse, on October 6th 2008), as well as

the longer-term impacts over the subsequent two years. Our extensive microdata also permits a preliminary exploration of the
pathways through which both the initial shock effect as well as the longer-term effects of the crisis operate. Specifically, we

examine mechanisms related to changes in individual personal income, equity, and own unemployment, and we also consider the

role of general business cycles, as measured by aggregate unemployment, one important external factor related to a deteriorating

economy.




2. Data

The data used originate from five registers that were merged using personal identifiers. These include tax, unemployment and

cause of death registers, as well as registers of all incidences of coronary events at Reykjavík hospitals and of acute coronary

events at the emergency ward at Landspitali University Hospital over the years 2000-2014. Data on the monthly aggregate

unemployment rate was obtained from the Directorate of labor (Directorate of labour, n.d.).


Merging of the data was contingent on permissions from the Data Protection Authority (2015101288ÞS) and the National Bioethics

Committee (13-050) in Iceland and was performed using encrypted personal identifiers. Our sample is characterized both as a

population sample and a flow sample with observations over a fixed time. Specifically, a population sample of all Icelanders living

in Iceland and aged 16 and older in 2000 is used, supplemented by a flow sample of later entrants consisting of persons reaching

the age of 16 during the study period. The result is a follow up of multiple birth cohorts ending at a single time point (the end of

the calendar year 2014), with information provided on each individual for up to 15 years. Sample exits occur only because of death

during the study period or missing data for follow-up, such as due to emigration. A simple comparison of characteristics of those

with and without missing data suggests that the latter group are younger, have fewer children, and lower income, and are less

likely to have experienced an admission to hospital due to IHDs. This is expected, reflecting the greater mobility of younger and

healthier people. The individual characteristics of those with missing data do not change during the crisis years, reducing concern

about systematic attrition in those years. A priori we would not expect results to be affected by attrition in the short-term analysis,

but in the long run this could be of greater concern. The use of the full population of individuals of qualifying age, rather than a

sample, means that we do not worry about selection bias. However, our knowledge is limited to the information contained in the

registers. For instance, we lack data on income, employment, or health prior to 2000, and therefore cannot fully account for those

factors. The final sample includes 188,354 males and 171,964 females, 87,469 and 89,785 of whom were observed during the

whole study period (180 months). The average follow-up time is 130 months for females and 120 months for males, yielding an
unbalanced panel of 45,035,064 person-month observations. A total of 30,997 IHD events are encountered in the sample (20,081

for males and 10,916 for females).


    2.1.Data registers

Information on personal income and equity, as well as demographic information on gender, age, marital status, number of

children, and residency was obtained from the tax register. The data accurately capture income changes, which reflect variation in

employment, hours worked or wages. To reduce traceability in the data, Statistics Iceland top-coded the number of children to 3.

This was done to 33,743 observations. Individuals turning 100 years old during the study period were re-coded by Statistics Iceland

so that their age was 95 in the first year they entered the dataset, with one year added to age annually thereafter. This was done

for 820 observations (332 individuals). Personal income and equity were converted to 2014-year krona.


Unemployment information came from the unemployment register, provided by the Directorate of labor, covering the period

February 2000 to December 2014, during which 91,963 individuals (47,731 males and 44,232 females) are listed in the

unemployment register. The unemployment register does not contain information on those who lost their jobs and did not

register at the Directorate of labor, e.g. because they were immediately rehired or decided to further their education.


From the cause of death register we use data on all incidences of deaths due to diseases of the circulatory system (ICD 10 codes

I00-I99), where IHDs (ICD 10 codes I20-I25) were listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death. In our sample, this

amounts to 6,813 individuals for the whole study period for IHDs (3,980 for males and 2,833 for females).


From the emergency ward admission register, we use data on all admissions to the emergency wards at Reykjavík’s hospitals

where patients have a diagnosis of IHD. Some of these are also found in the hospital admission register, as patients may be

admitted to another ward after discharge from the emergency ward. In such cases we treat both admissions as one event (to avoid

double counting) with the date of admission taken as the date entering the emergency department. Similarly, the original

admission date is used for cases leading to death.


The hospital and emergency ward admission registers contain information on all admissions where patients’ diagnosis contain the

ICD 10 codes I20-I25 (IHDs), but do not contain information on the patients’ medical history. As a result, we cannot control for

prior instances (before the year 2000) of IHD events, nor can we restrict our analysis to first-time events.
    2.2.Descriptive Patterns

We define an IHD event as either death, hospital or emergency ward admission due to IHDs. Figure 1 shows yearly numbers of IHD

events from our data. In Iceland, as in most countries around the world, a downward trend has been evident in the cardiovascular

mortality rate in recent decades. Our data, which includes morbidity and mortality figures, reveals a downward trend in IHD

events, consistent with the global trend in mortality (the figure provides raw numbers rather than mortality or incidence rates).

    2.3.Data limitations

Inpatient cases were all obtained from hospitals in the Reykjavík area. This was considered an adequate proxy for coronary events

for the whole population, as the majority of Icelanders (around two thirds of the population) live in Reykjavík and the surrounding

area. Additionally, many patients living elsewhere are treated in Reykjavík because smaller hospitals have limited resources such as

the availability of heart specialists. Evidence for this was obtained from a preliminary investigation showing that the residence of

those suffering IHDs was distributed throughout the country. Furthermore, no other hospitals outside the Reykjavík area have a

cardiovascular ward or perform cardiovascular surgeries.




3. Methodology

Using a linear probability model, we explore the probability of IHD events as a function of covariates, including calendar time and

age; October 6th 2008 is the reference date for the economic collapse. A linear time trend and seasonality are included to capture
period specific effects on the risk of an IHD, such as variations in treatments and diagnosis, as well as trends in lifestyle factors that

might reasonably be linked with cardiovascular health, like exercise and smoking. Age dummy variables, representing each two-

year age cohort, are included to capture combined cohort effects and those of individual age-related risk factors. Individual fixed

effects are also included to control for time-invariant factors that are spuriously correlated with economic conditions across

individuals.


The identification assumption is that after including controls, the probability of an IHD event would have been the same before

and after October 6th 2008, had the economic collapse not occurred.


The outcome variable is a binary indicator for the IHD event, taking the value one for each period of event occurrence and zero

otherwise. From the hospital admission register we use data on all admissions where patients have a diagnosis of IHD (ICD 10

codes I20-I25). From the cause-of-death register we use data where a listed cause of death is IHD (underlying or contributory).


In model 1, which is a conventional business-cycle model, the covariates include factor variables for marital status (single, married,

cohabitating, or widowed) and residency (i.e. whether an individual resides in the capital region of Iceland, or in seven other

regions) and a continuous variable for number of children. The explanatory variable of primary interest in model 1 is the aggregate

unemployment rate, which provides information on the degree to which the overall economic environment influences an

individual’s heart health and, for the purposes of this study, is used to distinguish between the effects of typical business-cycle

fluctuations versus those of an economic collapse. Following the literature on business cycles and health, we use the monthly

aggregate unemployment rate to proxy the macro economy (see for example Eliason and Storrie (2009); Gerdtham and

Johannesson (2003); Miller et al. (2009); Ruhm (2000, 2003, 2005, 2007)).


In model 2 we explore the immediate effect of the economic collapse of 2008 on the probability of an IHD event by using a binary

indicator for the 3-month period of October, November, and December of 2008, instead of the aggregate economic indicator; the

associated coefficient indicates whether there is a shift in the probability of an IHD event away from the time trend during October

2008 - December 2008. Although October 6th can be designated to be the start of the economic crash, our data does not allow

such detailed timing for the analysis. However, since the 6th of October falls very early in the month, we feel that calendar months

provide sufficient detail for us to draw meaningful conclusions from, despite misclassification of the first 5 days of October into a

treatment group. Since the incidence of IHDs is relatively low, we do not expect these short-term effects to be measured with
great precision but include them because of prior literature indicating effects of transitory changes in a variety of factors on the

risk of an IHD event.


In model 3, we perform a long-term analysis because IHDs are often the result of a gradual process triggered by stressful events.

To do so we replace the time dummy variable capturing the short-term crisis effect (October-December 2008) with two twelve-

month dummy variables for the periods October 2008 - September 2009 and October 2009 - September 2010.


In model 4 we append the binary indicator for October-December of 2008 to the basic business-cycle model (model 1), and in

model 5 we similarly add the binary indicators for October 2008 – September 2009 and October 2009 – September 2010 to the

basic business-cycle model. The purpose of including both the collapse/crisis dummies and the business-cycle indicators in the

same model is to assess if or to what degree, any found effects from the collapse/crisis (models 2 and 3) can be attributed to

traditional business-cycle effects and to what extent they are separate effects. Similarly, comparisons to model 1 can indicate

whether possible business-cycle effects are strengthened by this exceptionally strong single-time fluctuation within the data or

not.


We also estimate models that include additional controls for potential individual mediators including total income, real equity, and

individuals’ own unemployment to all models. For the sake of brevity, full results from the mediation analysis are not shown in the

main results (tables 1 and 2) but can be found in the appendix (tables A1-A14). However, the coefficients on the macroeconomic

variables of key interest, with all mediators collectively included, are shown in tables 1 and 2 and labelled models 4b and 5b.


       3.1.Subgroup analysis

In addition to the full sample estimates, we separately run models for the working-age population, defined here as 21-70 year olds,

on one hand and those above 70 on the other hand. The lower age limit for the working-age population is justified by the fact that

although schooling is mandatory only up to 16 years old, a vast majority of Icelanders finish upper secondary school, which

typically ends at age 20: over 90 percent of the 16-year old Icelandic population was enrolled in school during the study period,

and over 50 percent of the 20-year old population was enrolled in school at either the upper secondary or tertiary level (Statistics

Iceland, n.d.-d, e). The effective retirement age in Iceland for the study period is around 70 years old, (OECD, 2016) and is

therefore used as the upper bound for the working-age population. A separate analysis is performed for those over 70 years old,

since most IHD events occur among that age group, and we might expect different results than for those in the working-age

sample, especially when examining individual-level mechanisms. For example, a person’s own unemployment is an important
mechanism through which effects of the business cycle or collapse run, but such effects are hardly of importance in those above

70, whereas factors such as income and equity could be of importance. Since a wide literature covers the differences in the

incidence of CVDs in males and females, we also stratify all estimates by gender.


We furthermore estimate models where acute myocardial infarction (AMI), otherwise known as heart attack, is the dependent

variable. AMI is a subcategory of IHD (ICD 10 code I21-I22) and can be acutely life threatening. With a stressful event such as an

economic collapse we might expect the probability of AMIs in particular to be affected, especially among the medically vulnerable.

However, as the number of AMI events in the sample is small (a total of 10,875; 7,172 for males and 3,703 for females) we do not

expect to measure the effects of the economic collapse and crisis on the probability of AMI events with great precision. Therefore,

those are not our primary focus and should be interpreted cautiously, although reported in the appendix for completeness (tables

A1-A4 for males and A8-A11 for females).


All regressions were performed with STATA 14.1 statistical software. We report robust standard errors clustered on individuals.




4. Results

Results are reported here separately for males (table 1) and females (table 2). They include estimations with variables describing

economic conditions one at a time, but also include business-cycle and collapse/crisis effects at the same time to estimate the

relationship between those. Tables containing full results with models using individual-level mediators are shown in the appendix.

When examining models with mediators it should be kept in mind that the purpose of their inclusion is not to focus on those

coefficients themselves, as they need not show unbiased estimates of causal effects due to endogeneity. The purpose is rather to

see how the main coefficients of interest are affected by their inclusion. The main variation that we claim is exogenous is the

macroeconomic climate and the collapse of 2008. Tables 1 and 2 show the coefficients of greatest interest in this study from

models 1-5b (numbered in the tables and laid out in the methods section) and are divided into three panels displaying results for

the full, working-age, and over-70-years-old samples.


    4.1.Males

For the full sample (table 1, top panel), a negative and statistically significant relationship is consistently found between aggregate

unemployment (indicating general business cycles) and IHD, indicating that harder economic times are beneficial for heart health.

However, a positive relationship is found between the collapse (short-run effect) and crisis (long-run effect) on one hand and
probability of IHD on the other hand, indicating that the collapse of 2008 and the following recession were compromising for heart

health. The short-run coefficient, although positive in all models, is only barely statistically significant in model 2, and falls just

short of being statistically significant in other models. Comparison across models indicates that the collapse effect (short-run) and

the business-cycle effect are largely independent of each other as indicated by minimal changes in coefficients for both when

estimated separately or simultaneously. However, the business-cycle and the crisis (long-run) coefficients change substantially

between models in which they are estimated separately and simultaneously. In fact, the coefficients more than double in size

when estimated simultaneously, emphasizing the difference between types of economically difficult circumstances. Addition of

our three individual-level mediators (models 4b and 5b) does not substantially change results (compared to models 4 and 5).

Models adding one mediator at a time can be seen in the appendix (table A5), and tell a similar story of minimal mediating effects

from individual-level factors.


When estimating the models for the working-age population and those over 70 years of age separately, some statistical power is

lost, compared to the full sample. Results from the full sample and the working-aged males in model 5 show smaller long-term

crisis coefficients (and general business-cycle effects), whereas the coefficients are generally larger in absolute value than for full

or working-aged sample. Although the stratification leads to statistical significance that is generally lower than in the full sample,

with most coefficients not statistically significant, the size of the point estimates indicates that those over 70 years of age are to a

large extent driving the results found in the full sample. Although point estimates and statistical significance are different in the

subsamples, compared to the full sample results, the general pattern of results between the estimation models is similar.


It should be kept in mind that found effects are small. For example, when exploring the business-cycle model with long-term crisis

coefficients together for the full sample (model 5, top panel), the results reveal that in the first twelve months the probability of

being hospitalized or dying from IHD is 0.0122 percentage points higher than in the average twelve-month period in the sample,

and for the latter twelve months the probability is 0.0098 percentage points higher. The average yearly number of IHD events for

men in the dataset is 1,339 IHD and hence the magnitude of the found effects is rather small, amounting to approximately 13-16

extra cases in each of the two years following the collapse. Results for AMI as an outcome variable (see tables A1-A4 in the

appendix) generally show coefficients that are of the same sign but smaller in magnitude than those for IHD, and with lower

statistical significance.
    4.2.Females

In general, the results for women tell a similar story to those of men, but with coefficients that are smaller in absolute terms and

generally of lower statistical significance as can be expected do to fewer events in women. Business-cycle estimates consistently

show that harsh economic times are beneficial for heart health, although only statistically significant once the suppressing effect of

the crisis (long-run effect) is also included in the model. In the full sample (table 2, top panel), a positive long-term relationship is

found for both the first twelve and twenty-four months (only statistically significant in the latter twelve-month period in model 3),

that increases substantially in absolute value and statistical significance when estimated simultaneously with the business-cycle

effect. The larger coefficients found for the latter twelve-month period than the first twelve months in the long-term analyses are

conceivably explained by a lagged response to accumulating effects (American Heart Association, 2015). No statistically significant

collapse effect (short-term) was found for women although a small negative point estimate that doesn´t change across models is

consistent with what was found for men.


When comparing the full, working-aged, and over-70-year-old samples the results suggest that the effects found for the full

sample are driven mostly by the elderly. The general business cycle seems to affect them to a greater extent than younger

females, and similarly are the coefficients for the long-run crisis larger, although not always precisely measured. Although some of

the mediators studied were independently related to the probability of IHD, the main estimated economic-crisis effect was

insensitive to their inclusion (full results for the mediation analysis for females are shown in the appendix, tables A13 -A14).


Again we emphasize the size of the effects when exploring model 5, with business-cycles and the long-term crisis coefficients

simultaneously estimated. The results reveal that in the first twelve months the probability of an IHD event is 0.0052 percentage

points higher than in the average twelve-month period in the sample, and for the latter twelve months the probability is 0.0080

percentage points higher. The average yearly number of IHD events is 728 IHD for women in the dataset. Therefore, the magnitude

of the found effects is very small, only amounting to circa 3-5 extra cases in each of the two years following the economic collapse.

The results for AMI as an outcome similarly show a long-term crisis effect for women, but the coefficient for the business-cycle

indicator is generally the opposite of what we find when studying IHD (see tables A8-A11 in the appendix). As stated earlier those

results should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of AMI events in the sample.

Notes: Point estimates are computed using linear probability model with individual fixed effects, adjusting for age fixed effects,
time trend, seasonality, marital status, number of children in the household, and residency. Estimation models 1-5b are indicated by
the column numbers (1) - (5b) at the top of the table. Model 1 is a business-cycle model, model 2 a collapse model, and model 3 a
crisis model. Model 4 includes business cycles as well as the collapse, and model 5 includes business cycles as well as the crisis
period. Models 4b and 5b furthermore include three individual-level mediators: individuals’ unemployment, real monthly income,
and real equity. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *p<0.1, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. For the full sample N=22,242,946 and for the
working-aged sample N=17,539,631, for the over 70-year-old sample N=2,661,037. Average number of IHD events per year is 728
for females. Coefficients are interpreted as changes (in percentage points) in the probability of an IHD event.


5. Discussion

In this analysis we exploit a unique circumstance, caused by a sudden economic collapse affecting the Icelandic population. We

find that the sign of the business-cycle coefficient tells the opposite story to those for the economic collapse (short term) and crisis

(long term) dummies. Those results would indicate that more difficult economic times over the business cycle, are generally

beneficial for heart health, while the difficult times following the 2008 sudden economic downturn, were somewhat compromising
for heart health. This implies that economic collapse has different (negative) effects on cardiovascular health than the (positive)

impact of more typical business-cycle downturns, at least in Iceland. This is one of the most important finding of the analyses and

is highlighted further by the fact that the estimated crisis effects hardly budge with the inclusion of aggregate unemployment rates

in the model for short-term collapse analysis (i.e. by comparing models 2 and 4), and in the long-term analysis the coefficients for

both the long-term crisis and the business cycle get larger in absolute terms (see comparison of results from models 1, 3 and 5)

when estimated together. As hard economic times show opposite effects depending on context, the crisis thus has a suppressing

effect on the business-cycle coefficient if not controlled for and vise versa. This indicates that those effects are not simply a part of

a general business-cycle variation, but a distinct effect of this particular economic collapse and crisis in Iceland. Similarly, the

coefficient for the aggregate unemployment rate hardly changes with the inclusion of the short-term collapse indicator, and

increases in magnitude with the inclusion of long-term crisis variables. This is in contrast with results for the USA obtained by

Ruhm (2016), where economic crises and less severe downturns are both associated with reductions in mortality rates. The

different results found here and those of Ruhm’s (2016) highlight the importance of conducting research in various contexts.

Iceland and USA differ in many respects, for example in terms of structure of the welfare system, and hence the different results

are perhaps not surprising, although the explanations are not clear. This is consistent with one of the main takeaways from this

analysis; that the relationship between the aggregate economy and health are likely to be context specific, for example due to the

fact that aggregate economic fluctuations come in various forms.


Icelandic men were more affected by unemployment and real income loss than women as a result of the economic crisis (Statistics

Iceland, n.d.-a, g), and so it may not be surprising that the collapse and crisis often had larger effects for them. The statistically

significant positive crisis effect on IHD events is uncovered for men in the first twelve months (models 3, 5, and 5b) and

subsequent twelve months (models 5 and 5b). For women, similar results are found, but for the full sample and the eldest women,

the coefficient for the latter twelve-month period is larger than the first. For working-aged women however, no crisis effect is

found. Our results also show that the coefficients for the aggregate unemployment rate were larger in absolute terms for men

than women, and statistically significant in most model specifications for all age groups studied, whereas for women it was only

statistically significant in long-term analyses and seemingly driven by the oldest age group studied.


When comparing results from the full and age-restricted samples it seems that the found long-term effects are mostly driven by

people over 70 years old. Although not statistically significant for the eldest males, the long-term crisis coefficients were larger in

absolute value than for the working-aged males and the full sample. This is in accordance with previous research by Miller et al.
(2009), where those mostly affected by a drop in the unemployment rate were those out of the labor force. The reasons for this

are unclear, but indicate that possible pathways of found effects are not through the individuals’ own labor-market experiences.

This is further emphasized by results from the mediation analysis (full results in the appendix), showing that none of the possible

mediators examined had a mediating effect, meaning that estimated effects from ambient economic conditions found here did not

result from changes in individual-level equity, income, or employment.


Even for individuals remaining employed throughout the crisis, ambient conditions of a high unemployment rate could lead to

increased stress which might be a trigger for a cardiovascular event. Findings from Eiriksdottir et al. (2015) would support such

theory, as they attributed an increased risk of gestational hypertension to changes in aggregate unemployment rates during the

economic collapse. However, when studying the probability of IHD in males, we find that a higher unemployment rate is associated

with a lower probability of IHD (table 1). Moreover, although we do not have information on individuals’ health behaviors, which

are an important determinant of cardiovascular health, Asgeirsdottir et al. (2014a) and Asgeirsdottir et al. (2016b) found that the

economic crisis led to both a short- and long-term general decrease in health-compromising behaviors, making our results of a

long-term impact of the crisis all the more interesting.


A limitation of this study is the lack of medical history prior to the year 2000, which prevents us from controlling for an individual’s

previous cardiovascular event, which obviously puts an individual at a higher risk for a subsequent cardiovascular event. Future

research should aim to include such data. Another limitation is that the low number of IHD events in the sample reduces the

statistical power of the analysis. Additional short-term analyses were performed using three one-month dummy variables

(representing October 2008 – December 2008) instead of a single three-month dummy variable. For males, the November 2008

coefficient was positive and statistically significant, whereas those for October and December 2008 were both negative (but not

significant). The sign reversal between the November and December parameter estimates is consistent with the possibility of

“harvesting” whereby some IHD events were accelerated in time from December to November, rather than representing

additional events.


To summarize, our results suggest that the 2008 collapse in Iceland increased IHD events, which contrasts with the beneficial

estimated effects of more general (milder) downturns. However, despite the rather broad definition of a cardiovascular event

employed here (including both fatal and non-fatal events), the estimated effects were fairly small in absolute and relative terms.

This could reflect the strong Icelandic social insurance system, but its role was not examined here. The literature on business cycles
and health is rich in many ways and highlights various forms of nuance, including differential effects depending on the various

types of health outcomes, with a picture emerging that tells separate stories for physical and psychological health. Similarly, rich

microdata has been increasingly used to examine various individual-level pathways and subgroups. Previous research using

Icelandic data on the relationship between business cycles in general (Birgisdóttir & Ásgeirsdóttir, 2017) or specific

macroeconomic events that occurred well prior to the Great Recession (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016) have found null effects or even a

negative effect of increased economic activity on heart health. Based on those results alone, one might have presumed that the

Great Recession was likely to be beneficial to heart health in the Icelandic population. However, recent results on the effects of the

Great Recession have shown the contrary (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2014b; Birgisdottir et al., 2017; Eiriksdottir et al., 2015;

Gudjonsdottir et al., 2012). In the current study we provide an explanation for such differing results, i.e. that not all economic hard

times are the same, and effects of specific macroeconomic events on health can be separated from the effects of general business-

cycle fluctuations. Our results indicate that further focus on the variability in the types of aggregate economic conditions is

warranted in future work.

Appendix

In this appendix, we present results using AMIs as the outcome variable, as well as results from our mediation analysis. Tables A1-

A7 contain results for men and tables A8-A14 for women. Model numbers refer to the models defined and explained in the

Methods chapter of the main text. In the results for the mediation analysis, only models 1, 4, and 5 are included in the tables, as

models 2 and 3 do not include any individual-level mediators. Models 1, 4, and 5 without mediators, as they appear in the main

text, are included in the tables in the first column to better gage the changes in the collapse/crisis coefficients between models

with and without mediators. Models that include mediators are labelled 1b, 4b, and 5b in tables A2-A7 and tables A9-A14.


Males – AMI results

From table A1 we can see that no statistically significant short-term or long-term relationship is found between the collapse/crisis

and the probability of AMIs in males, nor is there a detectable business-cycle effect in general. We include models 4b and 5b in

table A1 for ease of comparison with table 1 in the main text, which includes results for IHD. The results from the mediation

analysis, (tables A2-A4), reveal that although a person’s own unemployment (tables A2 and A3) and real equity (table A2) are

found to be positively and statistically significantly associated with the probability of AMIs, neither of these individual factors have

a mediating effect, as the short-term coefficients for the crisis do not change with their addition to the model. For the oldest age

group, no coefficient for possible mediators was found to be statistically significant.

Notes: Point estimates are computed using linear probability model with individual fixed effects, adjusting for age fixed effects,
time trend, seasonality, marital status, number of children in the household, and residency. Estimation models 1-5b are indicated by
the column numbers (1) - (5b) at the top of the table. Model 1 is a business-cycle model, model 2 a collapse model, and model 3 a
crisis model. Model 4 includes business cycles as well as the collapse, and model 5 includes business cycles as well as the crisis
period. Models 4b and 5b furthermore include three individual-level mediators: individuals’ unemployment, real monthly income,
and real equity. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *p<0.1, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. For the full sample N=22,570,569, for the
working-aged sample N=18,349,379, for the over 70-year-old sample N=2,104,560. Average number of AMI events per year is 478
for males. Coefficients are interpreted as changes (in percentage points) in the probability of an AMI event.

Males – IHD results

Results from the mediation analysis (table A5) show that when studying the whole sample, a person’s own unemployment has a

positive association with the probability of an IHD event. Interestingly, a person’s own unemployment is not found to be

statistically significantly related to the probability of IHDs in working-aged males (table A6).

Females – AMI results

From table A8 we see that for both the full and age-restricted female samples, no short-term effects were found on AMIs, but

long-term effects were found for all groups. For the full sample, effects are found for the first twelve months after the economic

collapse, but for the working age population effects are found for up to twenty-four months. For the first twelve months the

probability of an AMI was increased. In the working-age sample a negative, statistically significant relationship is found in the

second year succeeding the economic collapse. The negative effect found almost offsets the positive effect found in the first

twelve months – suggesting that the positive long-term effects found in the first twelve months may not represent extra cases of

heart attacks in females during this period, but rather cases that were accelerated in time.


Of the possible individual-level mediators studied, the coefficient for real equity was consistently found to be negative and

statistically significant for the full sample and working-aged sample (tables A9-A10). Although real equity seems to have an

independent effect on the probability of AMIs in females, no mediating effects were found.

Notes: Point estimates are computed using linear probability model with individual fixed effects, adjusting for age fixed effects,
time trend, seasonality, marital status, number of children in the household, and residency. Estimation models 1-5b are indicated by
the column numbers (1) - (5b) at the top of the table. Model 1 is a business-cycle model, model 2 a collapse model, and model 3 a
crisis model. Model 4 includes business cycles as well as the collapse, and model 5 includes business cycles as well as the crisis
period. Models 4b and 5b furthermore include three individual-level mediators: individuals’ unemployment, real monthly income,
and real equity. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *p<0.1, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. For the full sample N=22,242,946 and for the
working-aged sample N=17,539,631, for the over 70-year-old sample N=2,661,037. Average number of AMI events per year is 247
for females. Coefficients are interpreted as changes (in percentage points) in the probability of an AMI event.

Females – IHD results

For working-aged females a person’s own unemployment was found to be independently related to the probability of IHD (no

mediating effects), where the coefficient was always negative and statistically significant, indicating that over the study period a

person’s own unemployment might be beneficial to heart health (table A13). For the full sample, real equity similarly was negative

and independently related to the probability of IHD without mediating any effects (table A12).

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *p<0.1, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. Point estimates are computed using linear probability
model with individual fixed effects, adjusting for age fixed effects, time trend, seasonality, marital status, number of children in the
household, and residency. Estimation models 1, 1b, 4, 4b, 5, and 5b are indicated by the panel headings. Model 1 is a business-cycle
model, model 4 includes business cycles as well as the collapse, and model 5 includes business cycles as well as the crisis period.
Models 1b, 4b, and 5b furthermore include the individual-level mediators: individuals’ unemployment, real monthly income, and
real equity, both added one at a time and in the last column all estimated simultaneously. N=2,661,037. Average number of IHD
events per year is 728 for females. Coefficients are interpreted as changes (in percentage points) in the probability of an IHD event.
