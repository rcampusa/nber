     Financing Capital Formation in the l980s: Issues for Public Policy


                                  ABSTRACT

       Three specific aspects of the corporate financing decision — internal

versus external funds, equity versus debt within the external component, arid

 features of the debt including especially maturity — present opportunities

 (and pitfalls) for public policy for affecting U.S. capital formation.

      First, by reducing the government's dissaving and hence its claims on

the economy's financial resources, policy can make credit market funds available

for corporations to finance their investment externally, thereby both stimulat-

ing the overall amount of capital formation and also taking advantage of the

allocative efficiency of the competitive market mechanism to achieve a produc-

tive composition of that capital formation. At the same time, by using the tax

system to augment the rate of return on corporate—sector assets, policy can

also enable corporations better to compete for such funds once they are available.

      Second, by eliminating or even reversing the current tax discrimination

in favor of debt, policy can encourage corporations to rely at least in part

on equities in their external financing, thereby reducing the economy's

aggregate-level financial risk.

      Third, by neutralizing or even reversing the current emphasis on long—

term securities in managing the federal government's own debt, policy can

encourage corporations to issue long— instead of short—term debt instruments,

thereby further reducing aggregate-level financial risk. Along the same lines,

policy can also play a role in pioneering markets for new financial instruments,

like bonds providing protection of the investor's purchasing power, that

private borrowers can then use to finance private capital formation.

     FINANCING CAPITAL FORMATION IN THE 1980s: ISSUES FOR PUBLIC POLICY


                            Benjamin M. Friedman*



        Increased American capital formation has emerged as a nearly undisputed

objective of economic policy for the 1980s. Dissatisfaction with the U.S.

economy's poor productivity performance in the l97Os, as well as with the

erosion of international competitiveness that began much earlier but also

became more evident in the 1970s with the dramatic declines in the internation-

al exchange value of the dollar, has elevated what was once largely a business

interest into a much more widely shared goal. In today's environment groups

representing labor and consumers also recognize the need for capital investment

to create jobs and to raise productivity and hence the population's overall

standard of living. On the whole, public discussion has moved from whether

more capital formation is desirable to what policies can best achieve it.

        An important aspect of capital formation that this discussion has

often overlooked, however, is its explicitly financial side. In an economy

like that of the United States, each decision to create more physical capital

necessarily has a financial counterpart. This financial counterpart may be

a single transaction, but in an economy with highly developed financial

markets it is more likely to be an entire chain of obligations and transfers

leading from an ultimate saver to an ultimate investor. In the end the

financial and nonfinancial systems interact so that the allocation of the

economy's real resources —whether to make consumer goods or producer goods,

for example, or how much and what kind of each — exactly corresponds to its

allocation of financial resources.

        The financial aspect of the capital formation process is especially
                                      —2—




important in a public policy context for two reasons. First, the financial

transactions associated with capital formation are not merely a reflection of

real resource allocations that would necessarily come about in any case.

The setting in which the financing of capital formation takes place can also

be a key determinant of real resource allocations, including not only the

total amount of capital formation but also its composition. The financial

and the nonfinancial elements of the process jointly determine one another,

and public policy may affect the ultimate outcome by influencing either.

Indeed, financial aspects of private capital formation decisions, like a firm's

after-tax borrowing costs, may be much more readily subject to public policy

influence than physical aspects like the production rates of the latest machine

models.

          A second reason why the financial side of capital formation is so

important for public policy is that, when financial markets are as fully

integrated into the economy's life pulse as they are in the United States,

fragility of the financial structure can pose major hazards for the entire

economic system. Moreover, there are sound. reasons for believing that the

considerations determining the actions of individual financial market partici-

pants do not adequately reflect potential threats to the system as a whole

from too brittle a financial structure at the aggregate level.   Financial

structure is therefore a kind of "public good" in the familiar sense that

an individual's (or individual firm's) actions bear "externalities" potentially

affecting everyone else. Because there is no reason for the presence of

such externalities to affect directly the decisions of individual financial

market participants, there is a role for public policy in providing incentives

that will in the end lead to a more satisfactory aggregate financial structure.

          The object of this paper is to consider, from the financial perspective,
                                     —3—




both the setting of and the prospects for Pxnerican capital formation in the

l980s, and to focus in particular on the opportunities (and pitfalls) for

public policy. Section I reviews the evolution of investment and saving in

the United States during the last quarter—century and emphasizes the connection

between the allocation of physical and financial resources. Section II examines

in detail the financing of investment through the economy's nonfinancial corpor-

ate business sector, which historically has accounted for nearly three—quarters

of all U.S. investment in plant and equipment. Section III develops more

fully the concept of externalities associated with private financial actions

and the resulting role for public policy. Section IV focuses on three specific

aspects of corporate financing decisions —   internal   versus external funds,

equity versus debt within the external component, and the maturity of the

debt — and identifies in each case the issues for public policy. Section V

provides a brief summary of the paper's principal conclusions.

I. Physical Capital Formation and Financial Capital Formation

        The principal development that has spurred interest in increased U.S.

capital formation as a goal for the 1980s has been the economy's deteriorating

productivity performance, in conjunction with its declining rate of net invest-

ment in productive plant and equipment. The productivity of labor in the U.S.

nonfarm private business sector increased by 2.6% per annum during 1948—65,

and 2.2% per annum during 1965-73, but only 0.6% per annum during l973_79.1

Although neither 1978 nor 1979 was a recession year, labor productivity declined

absolutely in both, marking the first two-year continuous productivity fall

in U.S. postwar history. With a recession in 1980, productivity has now

declined for still a third successive year.

        In principle, any or all of a number of potential explanations may

help to account for the U.S. productivity slowdown.2 There is evidence that

the rate of technical progress has slowed, probably as a result of the trend

away from research and development activities undertaken by industry.   There

is also evidence that both capital and labor resources have become less

mobile, and hence less able to adapt to changing technologies and consumer

tastes. Demographic factors were rendering the labor force progressively

younger, and hence less experienced and less skilled, until the very end of

the 1970s. Government regulation has added increased burdens to production,

importantly so in many industries. Slower output growth per se also typically

exerts downward pressure on productivity, and the 1970s were a recession—

prone, slow—growth era, at least in comparison with the l960s.3

        The increased attention to the nation's capital formation rate, how-

ever, has brought into a single focus the role of capital — that is, plant

and equipment —   in   the basic production of goods and services. Although

economists investigating the production process have often found the role of
                                          —5—




  capital frustratingly difficult to quantify, both economic theory and empir-

  ical evidence make clear that fixed
                                        capital is essential to production in the
  modern economy.4 Table 1 shows the experience of investment in plant and

  equipment in the United States during the
                                                past quarter-centu, by five—year
  spans (as well as for the single year 1980, to indicate
                                                             the starting point
  for today's policy environment). The table shows not Only gross investment

  in plant and equipment but also the corresponding net investment after subtrac-

  tion of capital consumption allowances adjusted to reflect true economic

  depreciation. The table shows these totals both in absolute dollar amounts

 and as percentages of gross national product in each year.

         The experience reviewed in the bottom panel of Table 1 in particular

 suggests clearly why capital formation has received increased attention as

 the economy's productivity performance has slipped during the l970s.
                                                                             Although
 gross investment in plant and equipment has moved to
                                                          a progressively larger
 share of the nation's total
                               gross national product, the corresponding net
 investment has shown a sharp reversal since
                                                the late l960s. Indeed, by the
 late l970s the share of total output devoted to net investment in plant and

 equipment was almost back to the level of the
                                                  late l950s, and the growth rate
 of the capital stock had fallen back
                                        accordingly. In light of the economy's
declining net capital formation rate, it is
                                                hardly surprising that the
amount of capital available to each employed u.s. worker has actually declined

since 1974 after rising steadily at 3% per annum during the previous
                                                                     twenty-
five years.

        Moreover, even the dramatic decline in the net investment rate shown

in these statistics may understate the true extent of the effective reduction

in the economy's productive capital investment. One reason is that at least

part of net capital outlays in recent years have gone into special investments

that protect the environment, or enhance workers' health and safety, but do

 not otherwise increase capacity to produce the items included in conventional

 measures of output and productivity. In addition, the sharply higher price

 of energy relative to the prices of other inputs to the production process

  (especially labor) has changed the appropriate mix of those inputs to be used,

 so that substantial amounts of labor-saving but
                                                   energy—consuming capital are
 no longer economical.5

         Increasing the economy's investment rate is, at one level, a matter

 of the allocation of real resources. Although additional capital increases

 the economy's productive capacity once it is available for use, in the short

 run resources are fixed, and devoting more to any one use means devoting less

 to something else. Devoting a larger share of output to business fixed invest-

ment than the 1980 level of 11.3% would require devoting a smaller share to

consumer spending (63.7% in 1980), or to purchases of goods and services by

federal or state and local governments (7.6% and 12.8%, respectively), or

to residential investment (4.0%).6

        Increasing the economy's investment rate is also a matter of the alloca-

tion of financial resources, however. An important key to understanding the

functioning of any economy is the truism that, on an ex post basis, the

economy's saving must equal its investment. Since it is unlikely in a decen-

tralized market economy that ex ante plans for saving and investment will

precisely balance one another, the market mechanism must influence the decisions

of businesses and consumers so as to change these inconsistent ex ante plans

into consistent ex post actions. Financial markets play a large role in this

mechanism, generating adjustments in the real yield which the market pays

to savers as suppliers of funds and in the cost and availability factors which

confront those who demand funds to invest in productive plant and equipment,

office buildings, inventories, and residential construction. If plans to

                                                  leads to reduced availability
of plans to demand funds, the market shortage

and higher yields. The result is that, ex post, saving equals investment.

        The function of the financial markets goes even further, however.

           Table 2 shows the balance of
                                          saving and investment in the United
  States during the past twenty—five years, scaled in relation to the
                                                                      gross
  national product as in the lower panel of Table 1. It is clear from the

  table that during this period    there has been no trend at all in the economy's
  total gross saving or total gross investment (which equals total
                                                                     gross saving,
  except for statistical discrepancy) in
                                           comparison to total income and
                                                                            spending.
  The 15-16% range has held
                              remarkably steady throughout.7

          Several important changes have occurred, however. Behind the steadi-

  ness of the total gross saving
                                   rate, the gross private saving rate has shown
 some tendency to increase while government as a whole has moved from a
                                                                        neutral
 position to that of persistent
                                dissaving. Within the private sector, capital

 consumption allowances have risen, even after adjustment to reflect the true

 economic depreciation, so as to
                                   account for essentially all of the increase
 in the gross private saving
                              rate. Personal saving as a share of gross national
 product has varied irregularly, as
                                    movements in the rate of personal
                                                                       saving
 out of disposable personal income have sometimes offset and sometimes
                                                                        compounded
 movements in the share of gross national
                                          product represented by disposable
 income itself. Undistributed
                               corporate profits have increased in relation
to gross national product during the l970s, but here essentially all
                                                                     of the
increase has consisted of artificial
                                       profits due to price inflation for firms
treating inventories on a first—in-first-out
                                                basis. Within the government
sector, continually growing surpluses among state and local governments

(consolidated to include retirement
                                      funds) have offset about half of the
growing deficits at the federal level.8

        Because of the key role played by the federal governmentts dissaving

in affecting the economy's overall
                                     balance of saving and investment, it is
useful to focus on this one development in
                                             somewhat greater detail. Total

  federal government expenditures have risen steadily as a share of
                                                                    gross
  national product over the last quarter_century, from 18.4% during 1956—60

  to 22.0% during 1976-80. This relative growth of federal expenditures has

  itself reflected the net result of
                                       two sharp but opposing trends, as federal
 purchases of goods and services have
                                          represented a steadily declining share
 of gross national product (from 11.2% to 7.3%) and federal transfer
                                                                     payments
 a steadily rising share (6.0% to 12.9%).       Both the goods and services purchases,
 which represent the govermnnt's own use of economic resources, and the trans-

 fers, which represent the government's redirection of claims on these resources

 within the private economy, must be financed.

         The federal government's receipts from taxes and Social Security

 contributions have also increased in relation to the overall economy over

 these years, but only from 18.4% of gross national product during 1956—60

 to 20.0% during 1976—80. The shortfall
                                           from the corresponding growth of
 federal expenditures, shown in Table 2
                                          as a steadily growing negative surplus,
has therefore represented a direct absorption of the private saving available

to finance investment. To the extent that the government itself has undertaken

investment activities, however    including either infrastructure investments
like highways and bridges, or directly productive investments like hospitals

and power facilities — the
                           familiar private investment data shown in Table        2

understate the economy's overall investment total.

        On the gross investment side in Table 2, the one clear trend during this

period has been the increasing share of
                                          output devoted to gross investment in

plant and equipment, as already indicated in Table 1. Apart from the typically

cyclical characteristics of the single year 1980, which depressed homebuilding

and induced an inventory run—off, there has been little trend in the other

two components of private domestic investment.     Finally, net foreign invest—

 II. Focus on the Corporate Sector

           In the U.S. economy many kinds of institutions as well as individuals

 undertake investment in plant and equipment, but the dominant source of this

 investment has traditionally been incorporated firms doing business in nonfinan-

 cial industries including manufacturing, natural resource extraction, trans-

 portation, communication, and public utilities and other nonfinancial services.

 As Table 3 shows, nonfinancial business corporations have consistently accounted

 for nearly three—fourths of all U.S. plant and equipment investment. No other

 single readily identifiable group has even accounted for as much as 10% of the
 total — although
                  the miscellaneous category, presumably a catch-all for individuals

 and unincorporated firms apart from farms, has consistently represented some

 10-15%. While the remaining one—fourth of investment is hardly unimportant,

 any major increase in U.S. fixed investment activity is likely in

large part to involve the nonfinancial corporate business sector.

           Just as the corporate sector bulks large in the nation's total plant

and equipment investment, investing in plant and equipment represents a large

share of the corporate sector's activity. As Table 4 shows, nonfinancial

business corporations typically use far more funds for physical investment

than for financial investment, and plant and equipment is by far the dominant

focus among corporate—sector physical investments)0 The table also shows

that the increase in total U.S. plant and equipment investment as a share

of gross national product indicated in Table 1 has been entirely due to

the corporate sector. The increase from 9.8% of the nation's output devoted

to gross investment in plant and equipment in the late l950s to 11.0% in the

   III. Financial Structure as a Public Good

          Almost any kind of financial
                                          system is capable of transferring resources
  from ultimate savers to ultimate
                                     investors. The special feature of competitive
  financial markets is that, in
                                  so doing, they also perform an important alloca—
  tive function. At the aggregate level the market mechanism determines
                                                                         the
  overall amount of the economy's
                                  income to be saved, and hence the overall
  amount of its output to be devoted to
                                           augmenting the physical capital stock.
  At the underlying level of the micro-unit, the same process enables
                                                                      a multi-
  tude of individuals and institutions
                                         to allocate the total amount saved and
 invested efficiently
                        among countless potentially productive projects.13
         This key role in efficiently
                                         allocating the economy's scarce resources
 constitutes the fundamental rationale
                                          underlying the very existence of competi—
 tive financial markets. In
                              centrally planned economies, for example, the fiat
 approach is also generally capable of
                                          commandeering resources from various
 sources and transferring them to designated
                                                applications. Without competitive
 markets, however, the efficiency of the resulting resource allocation rests

 entirely on the centralized information
                                           gathering and decision making process.'4
By contrast, a competitive market system utilizes each individual market

participant's information (and preferences) in
                                                  arriving at the prices of
and yields on the full range of financial assets and liabilites. These
                                                                        prices
and yields in turn provide the
                               signals and incentives that induce individual
savers to direct their savings toward the
                                             ultimate real investments that the
market as a whole considers most valuable.

        When individuals (or the intermediary agents acting in their behalf)

decide which firm's equities to buy, or to which firm to lend via securities

or other loan arrangements, they do so on the basis of the prospects for return

and the apparent risks associated with
                                         that firm's equities or debt claims.

For firms in nonfinancial businesses, however, the prospective returns and

risks associated with its securities mostly reflect the returns and risks

associated with the firm's underlying real activity, based on its physical
                                                   and other features of its
assets, its human resources, its organization,

business. If a firm's managers believe that it can expand in ways that will
                                   even after allowance for risk, they will
generate unusually high returns,

they will advance financial resources

the economy's overall financial resources are scarce, mirroring the scarcity

sion necessarily limits the expansion of other firms. By ilocating

resources in this way, the competitive market system ultimately determines
                                     the specific directions of the economy's
not just the overall rate but also

real expansion.
                                                                       and
         The efficiency of the financial resource allocation process —

 hence of the economy's chosen growth path
                                               — is not a matter of concern to

                   Moreover, the market tends to

        The fact that most of the

  tive to the economy's total
                               output and spending. Between 1955 and 1980 the
  combination of some movement in
                                   the overall total and this
                                                               large change in
  composition resulted in nonfinancial
                                        private borrowers' outstanding debt
  rising from Only two—thirds of a year's total income to well
                                                                 over a full
 year's income. Although some of this increase
                                                  merely reflects the growth
 of the nation's physical
                           capital stock (including
                                                     residential capital) relative
 to income, to a large extent it also indicates
                                                  more heavily leveraged financing
 of that capital. 19

        Moreover, in addition to this increase
                                                      in the private sector's relative
indebtedness, the financial

intermediated.         The share of total private-sector
                                                            holdings of credit market
debt claims accounted for by
                                  financial intermediaries has risen steadily
during this period, from 69.8% at year-end 1955 to 81.5% at year—end 1980.21

From the perspective of
                        aggregate—level risk, therefore, a growing superstruc-
ture of financial intermediation has
                                     compounded the effect of greater leverage.
        Finally, not all kinds of debt liabilities
                                                         are equally fragile as
assets in the portfolios of lenders who
                                            hold them. Although it is possible
to draw a number of distinctions
                                     among different debt instruments along these
lines, the greater exposure associated with short- in contrast to long—term

  maturities is the most
                            readily apparent. Here the effect of nonfinancial
  business corporations' increased
                                      reliance on short-term debt, as indicated
  in Table 5, has led over time to a steady reduction
                                                          in the average maturity
  of these corporations i
                            Outstanding debt. As Table 7 shows, the   short-term
  share of U.S. nonfinancial
                               business corporations'
                                                        outstanding debt rose from
  Only one-fifth of the total at
                                  year—end 1955 to well over one-fourth at
  year-end 1980, so that during these
                                       years the corporate sector's
                                                                     outstanding
  short—term debt more than doubled
                                     in relation to gross national product.
          As the combination of
                                greater leverage, more intermediation and
  shorter maturities continue to increase the U.S.

 more of a problem. The role for
                                   public policy with respect to the nation's
 financial markets is
                       accordingly greater. In addition to using the financial
system to achieve the amount of
                                 overall capital formation judged appropriate
on macroeconomic grounds, and
                               protecting the system's competitive aspects
so as to promote the efficient
                                allocation of that capital,
                                                             aGgregate—level
risk represents yet a third focus of public Policy with
                                                          respect to the financial

risk is, in effect, a "public
                              good." Moreover, the more capital formation
the nation undertakes — and
                             hence the more financing it does — the
                                                                    more

  portfolio, is hardly independent
                                     of public policy influence. The likely
   avenues of Policy influence in this area lie with the
                                                         tax code's treatment
  of the respective costs
                           and returns associated with
                                                       debt and equity instruments.
  Probably the greatest such
                              single influence in the United States in recent
  years has been the discrimination
                                      between debt and equity forms of pay—out
 at the corporate level under the corporate
                                            profit tax.25 Because the tax
 code allows interest payments (but not dividends)
                                                   as a deduction from corpo-
 rate profit taxes, in

 taxes due from its
                    operations by financing its assets with debt instead of
 equity. Moreover, the interaction of the tax code and
                                                              accelerating price
 inflation has made this
                        discrimination all the more Powerful in recent years,
as nominal interest rates have
                               risen to reflect the inflation

sary to compensate lenders for the

principal.

         It is impossible to know the extent to which the
                                                          tax code's discrim-
ination in favor of debt
                          and against equity has accounted for the observed
pattern of corporate external
                               financing. Even so, it is clear that eliminating

                           explained, in principle the effect of higher returns
