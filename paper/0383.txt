           Inflation and the Benefits from Owner-Occupied Housing



                                   ABSTRACT


       ~fui1e   inflation may be public enemy one for many Americans, most

homeowners have reaped enormous benefits from inflation during the past

decade and a half and will likely continue to do so in the future.        These

benefits take two forms.      First, unanticipated inflation raises the

capitol gain earned at the time of sale above that anticipated at the

ti~e   of purchase.    The realized real after-tax return on the equity

investment in the house exceeds the anticipated real after-tax return to

the extent that (1) the house purchase was financed by a mortgage and/or

(2) unanticipated inflation in housing prices exceeds unanticipated

general inflation.      Second, the eventual increase in anticipated inflation

lowers the user cost of capitol for owner-occupied housing owing to

declines in real after-tax interest rates.      As a result, more housing is

purchased and the consumer surplus earned on housing rises.      Thus

.homeowners first earned an extraordinary real monetary return, and then
                                                                .~



received enormous benefits in kind from occupying larger, higher quality

houses.    The present paper provides estimates of these for homeowners in

different marginal tax brackets for different periods during the last

fifteen years and draws some public policy conclusions from the sentiments.

               While inflation may be pUblic enemy number one for a significant portion of

         Americans, many homeowners have reaped enormous benefits from infiation during

         the past decade and a half and promise to continue to do so in the future.      These

         benefits take two forms.   First, unanticipated infiation raises both the value

         of the implicit rents flowing from an existing house and the capital gain earned

         at the time of sale above those anticipated at the time of purchase.     The

         realized real after-tax return on the equity investment in the house will exceed

         the anticipated real after-tax return to the extent that (1) the house purchase

         was financed by a mortgage and/or (2) unanticipated inflation in housing prices

         and rents exceeds unanticipated general infiation.   Second, the eventual increase

         in anticipated infiation lowers the user cost of capital for owner-occupied
         housing owing to declines in the real after-tax cost of mortgage financing and
         yields on alternative financial asset investments.   As a result, more housing
         is purchased and the consumer surplus earned on housing (the housing stock times
         the excess of the average product over the marginal product) rises.    Thus

         homeowners first earn an extraordinary real monetary retur.n and then receive
         enormous benefits in kind from occupying larger and higher qual!ty houses.      The

         present paper provides estimates of the gains from both unanticipated and

         anticipated inflation for homeowners in different marginal tax brackets for

         different periods during the last fifteen years.

     The first two sections of the paper pertain to the ·calculation of realized

real rates of return on homeowner equity.   A framework for making the calculations

is provided in Section I, and the results are rePOrted and interpreted in

Section II.   Results are given for overlapping six-year intervals between 1962

and 1978 for homeowners in the 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 marginal tax brackets, and

calculations are reported for the contributions tothe extraordinary real returns

earned on a fixed-rate mortgage (relative to both no mortgage and a variable-rate
mortgage) and of differences in relative inflation rates.   The next two sections
deal with the impact of increased anticipated inflation on the demand for housing
and the consumer surpluses reaped on owner-occupied housing.   The impact of

increases in expected inflation on user costs of capital and consumer surpluses
is examined and measured in Section III, again for overlapping six-year periods
for homeowners in different tax brackets.    Measures of the impact of inflation

both anticipated (en realized real returns) and unanticipated (on consumer

surpluses) are combined in Section IV.

                                  I.        The Conceptual Framework
     The after-tax rate of return on equity invested in owner-occupied housing
is that discount rate which equates the present value of the after-tax net
revenues from the house to the initial equity investment.                                  The gross revenues con-
sist of an implicit flow of net rental services over time and a lump sum at the
selling date (asset price net of selling costs and the outstanding mortgage on
that date).     The costs include flows of mortgage and property tax payments, after
allowance for their income tax deductibUity.                                   If inflation generates increases
in net revenues at the quarterly rate p and housing prices at rate q and the
house, and thus the implicit rent, deteriorate at the quarterly rate d, then
the rate of return, e, would be ob1iained by solving

hurdJ.e rate that the marginal. physical. product from additional. housing
investment must exceed in order for the investment to be undertaken.            In equiJ.ibrium,

hoJ.ds.   The equiJ.ibrium marginal. prOduct, then, can be computed from the deprecia-
tion and expected infJ.a.tion rates' (d, p, and q), the terms of the mortgage
(QI, i, and M), the property tax rate and reaJ.tor's fees ("p and       e),   and the
homeowner's expected hoJ.ding period (N), income tax rate ("y) , and required rate
of return (e).     To   compute real.ized rates of return over a given N period span
for homeowners in a given tax bracket, one simpJ.y pJ.ugs in the above-cal.culated

p   for that tax bracket, z:epJ.aces p and q with   ~   post val.ues, and soJ.ves for e.

       The finite hoJ.ding period, in conjunction with B and the muJ.tipJ.e infJ.a.tion
and financing rates, make (J..2) a complicated expression.        A series of assumptions

can transform (J..2) into reJ.a.tionships that better illustrate the primary

determinants of P and that are probabJ.y more famiJ.iar to the reader.          If the

of return, a third series is needed.           The NIA aggregate- private defJ.ator is

empJ.oyed for the general. infJ.a,tion index.         The ex post (denoted by bars over the

symboJ.) inflation rates are listed in Section A of TabJ.e J. for these series by

three year intervaJ.s over the J.96J.-78 period.         The general rise in inflation

since the early 1960s is obvious in all three series.              The renta.l series

a slightly lower rate in 1961-63, slightly more rapid rate in 1967-75, and by

(the observed rate during the period) less the expected innation rate at the

1973-78 period (3.29 percent) is the expected inflation rate at the beginning of 1979
(7.24 percent) less the expected rate at the beginning of 1973 (3·95 percent).
Estimates of unanticipated inflation over overlapping six year periods and for
the entire 1965-78 period are presented in Section    c.   Unanticipated general

        The other data employed in the rate-of-return calculation can be described
briefly.        The annual depreciation and property tax rates are assumed to be 0.02
and 0.018, respectively! and realtor's fees (8) are set at 6 percent of the value
of the house.         The house purchase is assumed to be 75 percent financed With a
25-year, fixed-rate mortgage.            The mortgage yield series utilized is the FHLB's
effective rate series for the 1963-72 period and the FHLB's effective rate on

Rates of return are calculated for households in the 0.15, 0.3 and 0.45 marginal
tax brackets.         As noted above, the required after..tax rates of return on housing

equity are assumed to be 0.85 times the mortgage rate for those in the 0.15 tax

bracket and 0.7 times the mrtgage rate for those in the 0.3 and 0.45 tax brackets.

        HOuseholds are assumed to invest in housing up to the point that the return
on the last dollar invested yields a marginal product such that the expected
return over the homeowner's holding period equals the required return or that
available on alternative investments.            Following the procedure described in
Section I, equation (1.2) is first solved for            f),   Where e is the required after- .
tax rate of return and p and q are expected inflation rates, and then resolved

rates     :P   and   q.   The extraordinary nominal returns, e-e, are then computed.        These
are reported in the top section of Table 2 for the same four overlapping 6-year
. periods and longer 14-year interval featured in Table 1.
        Two facts are obvious.         First, the extraordinary returns earned on owner-

occupied housing have been enormous over the past decade and. a half.             The excess
returns have ranged from about 8 percent per year in the "worst" 1970-75 period, when

unanticipated inflation in house prices was relatively low, to over 10 percent in three

of thefive periods.             In general, housing has earned a 10 percentage point return

above that available on investments in financial assets.              This is, of course, a

direct result of unanticipated inflation and the leveraged investment in the real

housing asset.            Second, the excess returns are largely indePendent of the tax

bracket or income level of the investor.            WhUe higher tax bracket investors

have earned greater returns in most periods, the difference in the excess returns

is small.

        WhUe the data in the top section of Table 2 demonstrate that households

earned substantial excess returns on housing relative to those available on

 financial assets, one might ask whether homeowners were better off in a real

 sense.        This is equivalent to asking whether excess    ~       returns were earned on
 housing, and the question can be answered by subtracting unanticipated general
inflation (the first row in Section C, Table 1) fran the excess nominal returns.

 This subtraction has been performed in the lower section of Table 2.              The ex post
 real return on owner-occupied housing (e-y) has exceeded the expected real return
                                                                                                    2/

   returns, under this assumption, vary between   3 and 9 percent per annum.

     It should be emphasized that these are spendable real gains.                   Young, growing

families have often used the gains to purchase additional housing.                   Older shrinking

families often realize some gains when moving to a smaller unit, and, with the

new reverse mortgages, can borrow automatically against the gains.                   Often
households implicitly realize the gains by borrowing (second-mortgages or

consumer credit) or by reducing their savings out of current income.



             C.        Sources of Differences in ElC Post and EKpected Real Returns

     There are two primary sources of differences between ex post and ex ante

real returns:          differences in relative unanticipated inflation rates and the

existence of mortgage debt.               To see the importance of the former, consider equation

return on housing equity is

                                          Y P
                                                  + q - y.                                   (2.1)
                            k
The ex post equivalent is
                        P   0
             e-y = ~.k - d           - (l-T)T
                                            y   P
                                                    +   q-   y,                              (2.2)

where bars over variables denote ex post values.                   Subtracting (2.1) from (2.2)
and solving

          e-y - (e-y)             = q-q   - (y-y).                                           (2.2)'


Thus, with    ~   = 0,      p = q and 8    = 0,     ex post and ex ante real returns on housing

equity would vary one-for-one with differences in unanticipated inflation rates.

     To illustrate the importance of mortgage debt, consider the one-period

version of (1.2) when B = 0 and p                 = q:
                                                                                                    13

 With no difference in unanticipated inflation rates (q-q :: y-y), the
 ex post real return on equity will devi8lte from the expected real return by a

 mw..tiple ta/(l-a) 1 of unanticipated infl&tion.

         The existence of a mortgage will not necessarily result in extraordinary

 gains when unanticipated inflation rates are positive (and eql&l).                      Assume that

 the mortgage has a variable rate            1.    With q-q     = y-y,    subti'act1on ot (2.3)
  from (2.4), after replacing 1 in (2.4) with              t,    yields



 With    i ... i + <y-y)/(l-1"y)' extraordinary real returns would neceaaar11y be
 zero.     That is, if the index rate of the var1&ble-nte mortgage moved with
 a multiple (1/ (l-Ty) 1 of unanticipated inflation, 8uch that the rea.l1zed real .
 after-tax variable rate equalled the initial rate, then the                     mortsase   would

not provide extraordinary returns during periods of unanticipated inflation.

Of course, no known index rate rises this rapidly because (1) interest rates

move with expected inflation which tends to adjust gradually to unanticipated
inflation and (2) the movement tends to be only one-for-one, rather than a
            §j
multiple.

     The contributions of the mortgage and relative unanticipated inflation rates
to the excess ex post returns earned on housing over selected six-year periods

are listed in Table 3.   The first row simply reproduces row (5) of Table 2, except

that data for the 1962-67 interval have been added in order to include a period

where excess housing gains were relatively minor.    As is indicated in row (2),

most of the excess return is due to the existence of a mortgage during a period

of unanticipated inflation.   The contribution of the IJX)rtgage moves directly with

unanticipated housing inflation, which rose in the late 1960s declined in the

early 1970s, and rose again in the middle 1970s (see Table 1).    Because unantici:

pated housing inflation exceeded unanticipated general inflation in every period

[see row (4) 1, relative unanticipated inflation alwa,ys made a positive contribu-

tion to the excess real ex post return on housing.    However, the contribution

never exceeded It- percentage points.   Comparison of rows (2) and (4) suggest that

a percentage point excess of unanticipated housing inflation over general
inflation raises the ex post real return by about half of a percentage point.
     It is sometimes argued that the existence of variable-rate mortgage (VRMs)
would be "unfair" to existing homeowners during periods of unanticipated



§/Feldstein (1976, p. 816, note 15) argues that the failure of interest rates to
  move with a multiple of expected inflation is due to the taxation of nominal
  capital gains and the use of historic-cost depreciation. Hendershott (1979)
  provides analysis to support this conjecture. For an analysis emphasizing
  non-tax factors that might account for interest rates not rising with a multiple
  of expected inflation, see Levi and Markin (1978).

inflation because mortgage interest payments would rise unexpectedly.           The

existence of VRMs during such periods would obviously reduce ex post returns on

the equity of existing homeowners.    However, if the unexpected added interest

expense is accompanied by greater unexpected real capital gains, then homeowners
would still be better off in the sense that their realized real return on the
housing investment would exceed their expected real return.      To address this issue,

realized real rates of return were calculated on the assumption that VRMs with an
index rate equal to that on newly-issued fixed-rate mortgages existed.          The
difference between ex post returns with fixed-rate mortgages and with VRMs are

listed in row (3).    As can be seen, the reduction in return owing to a VRM is

only a fraction of the total excess ex post return attributable to the mortgage.

In no six-year period Would a VRM have offset as much as one-quarter of the

excess real return earned.    Even with VRMs, homeowners would have earned substantial

excess real returns during these periods of unanticipated inflation.



III.    Expected Inflation. the User Cost of Capital. and the Demand for Owner-

                                 OccyPied Housing

       Housing economists appear to have turned 180 degrees in the past few years

in their views regarding the impact of inflation on housing demand.       In the

early 1970s the impact of inflation on monthly payments (and downpayments to a

lesser degree) was the focus of attention. Owing to the widespread use of the fixed-payment


7.1Arelated argument against VRMs is tha t households cannot manage the higher
  cash flow outlays. For a critique of this argument, see Hendershott and Villani
  (1978, pp. 17-24 and 88-90). To the extent that higher outlays do constrain
  household expenditures during periods in Which inflation and interest rates
  are rising, VRMs ~l.ay a useful macroeconomic stabilization role Lvon Furstenberg
  (1977, pp. 293-95)).
                                                                                   17
mortgage, inflation "tilted" real monthly payments upward during the early years

of the mortgage, resulting in a sharp increase in the ratio of the initial monthly

p~nt        to current income.   As a consequence, housing was "unaffordable" to

those who would have been able to purchase houses or more housing in the absence
            §/
of the tilt. The graduated-payment mortgage was advocated as a means orfreversing

this tilt, and the Emergency Home :Purchase Assistance Act of 1974 was passed in

which mortgage credit was to be made available at below-market interest rates

when inflationary conditions were having a severely disproportionate negative

effect on the housing industry.
         In recent years attention has shifted to the impact of inflation on the
                                               ~
underlying equilibrium demand for housing.         The unaffordability argument pertains
to a perceived disequilibrium where inflation-induced financial constraints hold

effective housing demand below the equilibrium level.        The underlying equilibrium

demand for housing is stimulated by inflation because the real after-tax return from non-
housing investments and the cost of home mortgage credit decline. Recent (1976-78) levels of

single family housing sales and produc tion and increases in housing prices suggest that the

positive impact of inflation on the underlying equilibrium demand for housing has outweighed/

the negative impact created by financial constraints.        This would not be surprising

because the financial constraints probably bind only on potential first-time home

buyers who have not already reaped extraordinary housing capital gains that would

allow large downpayments and thus relatively small monthly payments.        In contrast,

the stimulation to equilibrium demand applies to both existing homeowners and
potential first-time buyers.        In this section the impact of increases in anticipated

inflation on the user cost of capital and thus the equilibrium demand for housing

is analyzed.

     In equilibrium all households will have purchased owner-occupied housing

up to the point that the percentage implicit rental income earned on the last

dollar of housing equals the user cost of capital as defined by the right-hand

side of equation (1.2).       A decline in the user cost of capital would lead households

to demand additional or higher quality bedrooms, bathrooms, and family rooms until the

utility or implicit rent.s from these decline to the lower cost of capital.          The

relation between the implicit rents earned by a representative household in the

15 percent tax bracket and the stock of housing occupied is denoted by the schedule

labelled    I'   in the left panel of Figure 1.   Given the current inflation rate   <10'
the cost of capital is Co and the quantity of housing demanded is K . The            p
                                                                   O
schedule and Co and KO values in the right panel are those relevant tp a

representative homeowner in the 30 percent tax bracket.         The figure is dra.wn so
that the cost of capital is lower for the homeowner in the higher tax bracket.
This is true because the net (after-tax) property tax, mortgage interest rate,

and opportunity cost of funds are all lower for a homeowner in a higher tax
bracket.
           M2I   The importance of the tax bracket to the cost of capital is illustrated

most clearly by the simple cost of capital expression on the right side of

equation (1.4).

     To determine the approximate impact of an increase in expected inflation on

the cost of capital, we take the derivative of (1.4) with respect to q:

          ~ = (1-'1' ) ~i - 1.

Thus the cost of capital will decline if oi/~ < 'J/(l-'I'y)' This inequality has
held in recent years for·two reasons.     First, the interest rate has increased

only about one-for-one with increases in the anticipated general inflation rate.
Second, the anticipated inflation rate of housing prices has increased by more
than has the anticipated general inflation rate (see Table 2).     The impact of

an increase in the expected inflation rate and the resultant decline in the user

cost on the quantity of housing demanded by the two representative households is

           B.   User Costs of Capital and the Efficient Allocation of Resources

     User costs of capital for 24 and    56 quarter holding periods are reported
in Table 4 for homebuyers in the 0.15, 0.3 and 0.45 marginal tax brackets at

three different points in time.     The first, 1964-4, is shortly prior to the

acceleration in inflation; the third, 1978-3, is the most recent quarter with
available data and is the quarter of peak expected inflation (to date); during
the interim quarter, 1972-4, expected inflation equalled about an a.verage or
the 1964-4 and 1978-3 values.     The two noteworthy characteristics of the data
are expected.   First, the user costs or investment hurdle rates are lower the

higher the tax bracket.   Second, the hurdle rates have generally declined over

time as expected inflation has risen, and the decline is especially sharp -- 4~

percentage points -- for investors in the 0.45 tax bracket.    Moreover, this
user cost of capital for these investors is slightly overstated.

    IV.      The Combined Benefits from Anticipated and Unanticipated Infiation
      Estimates of the extraordinary realized real returns earned on investment

 in owner-occupied housing owing to unanticipated inflation were reported in

. Table 2.    Our final task is to compute comparable estimates of the gains in
consumer surplus generated by increases in anticipated inflation.              A rough

measure of the gain in consumer surpluses (the hatched GAIN in Figure 1) can be

obtained by assuming that the implicit-rents curve exhibits unitary elasticity

with respect to K.           That is

                _ aCyl
               P- K '

where a(Y) is the shift factor and is assumed to be increasing with respect to

income.      Using the equilibrium condition P        = c,   the desired level of the housing

stock is

              K =   !ill
                     c
                         .                                                               (4.1)

The gain from the increase in inflation can be obtained by integrating equation

 (4.1) from Co to cl' which yields

              GAIN(Y)   = a(Y) (log Co -   log c )·
                                                l
                                                                                         (4.2)

To make the consumer surplus gain in a given period comparable to the real gain

on equity owing to unanticipated inflation, the gain is divided by the equity in
                                           !lI
 the newly purchased house, (l-a)~:


WRosen (1979) estimates a productivity gain from eliminating the housing tax
  subsidy of $107 per family based upon his 1970 sample. Given that there were
  40 million owner-occupied units in 1970, the total productivity gain would be
  roughly W billion ($107 times 40 million).

!3/The gain in consumer surplus is, of course, independent of the form of the
   financing of the housing purchase (the value of a).
                                                                                                     25




This percentage gain can thus be obtained directly from measures of c at various
points in time.

purchased homes in ~964-4 that provided them with the optimal. quantity of housing.

The    dec~ine    in the user cost of capita.~, which was          partic~~y            drama. tic after

~970,    caused the     househo~ds      to purchase   ~ger     houses in      ~972-4.      These houses

were    he~d unti~ ~978-3       when the further fall in cost of capitu, which was

especially rapid after          ~975,    induced the purchase of even arger houses.                The

extraordinary      rea~   gains from. inflation, both anticipated and unant::lc ipated, from

~964-4    to   ~972-4   are    ~1mited   to the   rea~   gain on equity investment upon the assumed
sa~e    in 1972-4.      Between   ~972-4   and    ~978-3   further gains on equity investment
were    a~o    realized, and these were supplemented by enlarged consumer surpluses

owing to the lower cost of capitu in               ~972-4.    All of these gains accrue to first-

home bUYers in       ~972-4,    as well as   househo~ds ro~ling         into larger houses at that
time.     Unexpected real gains (or losses) after 1978-3 on the equity invested in
the 1978-3 purchase are at this point unknown, but                 substa.nti~ly larger         consumer
surpluses vis-a-vis those which would have been earned on a house purchased at
the cost of capital existing in 1964-4 are known.
        The annual real excess returns owing to inflation are 8 to                    at percent
in the 1965-72 period owing solel;y' to unanticipated inflation (Table 5).
Between    ~973   and   ~978   the excess real returns were        ~O    to   ~5   percent, consisting
of 7 to 7~ percent from W1&nticipated infation a.r.d 3 to 7~ percent from anticipated
in~tion.         The atter excess returns increase with the income of the                    househo~d.


For the post-~978 period, the reu excess returns range from 2t to ~3 percent and

future unanticipated inflation.        Relative to their counterparts ill late 1964,

current homeowners are in an enviable position.        Even if future inflation should

equal anticipated inflation, todays homeowners ill tax brackets of about 25

percent or higher will fare better because of their enormous consumer surpluses

than the homeowners of     1964   did as a result of unanticipated inflation.

     A final consideration is why, when both existing and new homeowners gailled

so enormously from the inflation of the past decade and a half, there is such a

concern over the "rising cost of homeownership"?        A plausible answer is the

above-mentioned increase in fillancial constraints that hold effective housing

demand below the eqUilibrium level.        The movement to lower percentage down-

payments and the use of graduated-payment mortgages has, of course, mitigated

the impact of these constraillts.       Regrettably, however, much of the concern

about the cost of homeownership seems to be based upon a misrepresentation of

the financial costs of housing.        Rather than measuring these costs ill real
                                                             14' For example,
after-tax terms, nominal before-tax costs have been employed.:::!

the mortgage-interest component of the consumer price index, which is calculated

as the product of a before-tax nominal mortgage rate and a house price series,

rose by 39 percent between the end of 1974 and the end of 1978.        In contrast,

a component based upon a real after-tax illterest rate would have about halved,

owing to a decline in the real after-tax ('I'y = 0.25) mortgage rate from 2

percent to about   i   percent.!2I



~Downs (1978),   in an otherwise enlightened analysis, promulgates this error.
   Diamond (1979) shows the true decline in the cost of home ownership.

                              v.   Summry
     Unanticipated inflation results in capital gains that accrue entirely to the
homeowner (unless a variable-rate mortgage exists).    Thus a homeowner with a
l.everaged investment earns real, as well as nominal, gains, and these are
especially l.arge if housing prices rise more rapidly than prices generally.      For

houses hel.d for various six-year intervals between 1964 and 1978 real annuaJ.
rates of return exceeded expected real returns by 5 to ~ percentage points.       The

existence of variabl.e-rate mortgages (VRMs) with an index rate eQ.uaJ. to the

current mortgage rate would have lowered these excess real returns only slightly

to the 5 to 7 percentage point range.   Even with VRMs, unanticipated inflation

benefits homeowners substantially.
     Anticipated inflation lowers the user cost of capital. for owner-occupied
housing, the reduction being greater the higher the tax bracket of the investor,
and raises the demand for housing.   At latel978 expected inflation rates,the
user cost of capital, and thus the equilibrium marginal physical product of
owner-occupied housing, for those in high tax brackets is only 5 percent.      Given
that the equilibrium marginal physical product of corporate investment in
structures is about l5 percent, the favored tax treatment of owner-occupied
housing is the source of significant productivity losses for the economy.
Substitution of a l5 percent tax credit for the mortgage interest and property
tax deductions (and cessation of the double taxation of corporate income) would

lead to a considerably more efficient allocation of the American capital stock.

     The fall in the cost of capital generated by increased anticipated inflation
increases the consumer surpluses of homebuyers.   Again, the increase is greater

the higher is the homeowner's tax bracket.   The gains in consumer surpluses between

1964 and 1978 for homeowners in tax brackets of 25 percent or higher, expressed as a

portion of the equity invested in a 1978 house (assuming a 1oan-to-value ratio of

0.75), were even greater than the extraordinary real returns real.ized on housing
                                                                                29
equity during the 1964-78 period.   Not taking the declines in user cost into
account in the calculation of the mortgage interest component of the consumer

price index has resulted in an overstatement of inflation during the last four
years.

        This appendix provides alternative versions of Tables 1-5, in which expected
inflation rates are based upon observed rates during the previous 3, rather than
6, years.    As a result, this estimate of expected inflation rises more rapidly than
that underlying the Tables in the text.          Because unanticipated inflation in this
calculation is less than thatin the text, the extraordinary realized real gains
on equity investment in housing are less.          On the other hand, the user cost of

capital declines more    rapi~    so the consumer surplus gains are greater.
