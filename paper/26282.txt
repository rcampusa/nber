                                            ABSTRACT

Oversubscribed treatments are often allocated using randomized waiting lists. Applicants are
ranked randomly, and treatment offers are made following that ranking until all seats are filled.
To estimate causal effects, researchers often compare applicants getting and not getting an offer.
We show that those two groups are not statistically comparable. Therefore, the estimator arising
from that comparison is inconsistent when the number of waitlists goes to infinity. We propose a
new estimator, and show that it is consistent, provided the waitlists have at least two seats.
Finally, we revisit an application, and we show that using our estimator can lead to significantly
different results from those obtained using the commonly used estimator.

1 Introduction
Often times, some individuals who apply for a treatment are non-takers. They decline to get

treated when they receive an oer, for instance because they then realize that their benet from

treatment is lower than they thought. When a treatment is oversubscribed but some applicants

are non-takers, an appealing way of allocating the available seats is to use randomized waitlists.

First, applicants are ranked randomly. Then, if       S   seats are available, an initial round of oers

takes place, whereby the rst   S   applicants get an oer. If       r   of them decline it, a subsequent

round of oers takes place whereby the next    r   applicants get an oer. Oers stop when all the

seats have been lled. This allocation method is fair: each taker has the same probability of

being treated; it is also ecient: no seat for treatment remains unused, despite the presence

of non-takers.   Therefore, oversubscribed treatments with non-takers are often allocated by

randomized waitlists.   We conducted a survey, and found 43 articles studying treatments

allocated by randomized waitlists, ranging from charter schools in the USA to agricultural

trainings in Liberia. These treatments often have capacity constraints for various groups of

applicants.   For instance, a charter school may have 20 seats available in 7th grade and 25

seats in 8th grade. Then, a lottery takes place in each group.


As applicants are ranked randomly, it may be possible to form two comparable groups with

dierent likelihoods of getting an oer. One could then compare those two groups to estimate

the eect of the treatment. In practice, researchers have used two types of comparisons. Some

researchers have compared applicants getting and not getting an initial oer, thus giving rise

to the so-called initial-oer (IO) estimators. Other researchers have compared applicants ever

and never getting an oer, thus giving rise to the so-called ever-oer (EO) estimators. When

several lotteries were conducted, as in the charter school example above, researchers have often

included waitlist xed eects in their specications, to ensure they compare applicants within

and not across waitlists.   In our survey, 22 articles used the EO estimator, 20 used the IO

estimator, and a handful used other estimators. Overall, practices are not standardized.


We start by showing that the expected proportion of takers is strictly greater among applicants

ever getting an oer than among applicants never getting one. Intuitively, this is because oers

continue until all seats are lled, so the last applicant getting an oer must by construction

be a taker. Moreover, when waitlist xed eects are included in the estimation, they induce

an endogenous reweighting of waitlists that usually further increases this imbalance between

the two groups, as we explain in more detail in Section 2.


Then, we show that due to this imbalance, the EO estimator is inconsistent when the number

of waitlists goes to innity. In our survey, the median of the number of waitlists divided by the

number of applicants per waitlist is 1.9, and 25% of the articles have more than 100 waitlists

and less than 40 applicants per waitlist. This motivates the asymptotic sequence we consider.

By contrast, if the number of applicants and takers per waitlist goes to innity, the asymptotic




                                                  2
bias of the EO estimator goes to 0.

We show that dropping the last applicant getting an oer in each waitlist is sucient to

restore the comparability between applicants getting and not getting an oer. Based on this

result, we propose a new estimator of the treatment eect. It is built out of comparisons of

applicants that get and do not get an oer in each waitlist, downweighting applicants that

accept their oer by an amount equivalent to dropping one of them.                 Then, our estimator

takes a weighted average of those within-waitlist comparisons, with a weighting scheme that

avoids the endogeneous reweighting induced by the waitlist xed eects.                 We refer to that

estimator as the doubly-reweighted ever-oer estimator (DREO). We show that our estimator

is consistent and asymptotically normal when the number of waitlists goes to innity.

Contrary to subsequent-round oers, initial oers are only a function of applicants' random

ranks in the waitlist.     Therefore, applicants getting and not getting an initial oer are sta-

tistically comparable, and the IO estimator is also consistent.           However, we show that the

asymptotic variance of that estimator is often much larger than that of the DREO estimator,

so using it will often result in large eciency losses.

We use our results to revisit Blattman & Annan (2016), who studied the eects of an agricul-

tural training. The DREO estimator is signicantly dierent from the EO estimator computed

by the authors for some of the outcomes they considered.
                                                                    1

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses a simple example to give the

intuition of our results. Section 3 presents our main results. Section 4 presents our empirical

application. Appendix A presents the proofs. In our Web appendix, we present our survey of

articles that have used randomized waitlists, we show that some of the assumptions adopted

in the paper can be relaxed, we present some simulations, and we revisit another application.




2 Introducing the results through a simple example
We start with a simple example.          We consider a waitlist where ve applicants compete for

three seats. Four applicants are takers (T ) and one is a non-taker (N T ), meaning that she

will refuse to get treated if she gets an oer. Applicants are randomly ranked, and treatment

oers are made following that ranking until all seats are lled. There are           5! possible orderings
of the applicants, that can be divided into 5 groups of        4!   orderings, according to the rank of

the non-taker. Table 1 displays those ve groups of orderings, hereafter referred to, slightly

abusively, as orderings. For each ordering, applicants getting an oer are depicted in italics,

while those not getting an oer are depicted in bold.             In ordering 1 and 2, the rst three

applicants are takers, so oers stop after the third oer. In orderings 3, 4, and 5, one of the

rst three applicants is a non-taker, so a fourth oer is made; then the next applicant is a

taker so oers stop as the available seats have been lled.

                                                     3
The rst issue with the EO estimator is that, on average, applicants getting an oer bear

a higher proportion of takers than applicants not getting an oer. Each ordering has a                  0.20
probability of being selected. Across the ve orderings, the expected share of takers among ap-

plicants getting an oer is 0.2 × (1 + 1 + 3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4) = 17/20. On the other hand, the ex-
pected share of takers among applicants not getting an oer is 0.2 × (1/2 + 1/2 + 1 + 1 + 1) =

4/5. Intuitively, this imbalance arises because oers stop when suciently many takers have
accepted an oer. This endogenous stopping rule creates a positive correlation between get-

ting an oer and being a taker.           When the average potential outcomes of takers and non
            2
takers dier, this imbalance implies that applicants getting and not getting an oer are not

statistically comparable: those two groups have dierent average potential outcomes.

                Ordering 1      Ordering 2      Ordering 3     Ordering 4     Ordering 5

                     T               T                 T           T               NT
                     T               T                 T           NT               T
                     T               T                NT           T                T
                    T               NT                 T           T                T
                    NT              T                 T             T               T


The second issue with the EO estimator arises from the inclusion of xed eects when pooling

waitlists. Assume that one pools waitlists that all have four takers, one non-taker, and three

seats. In some waitlists, the realized ordering of takers and non-takers is Ordering 1 in Table

1, in other waitlists the realized ordering is Ordering 2, etc. With several waitlists, it follows

from, e.g., Equation (3.3.7) in Angrist & Pischke (2008), that the EO estimator with waitlist

xed eects is a weighted average of the EO estimators in each waitlist, that gives more weight

to waitlists where the share of applicants getting an oer is closer to 1/2. In our example, 3/5

of applicants get an oer in waitlists with Ordering 1 or 2, while 4/5 of applicants get an oer

in waitlists with Ordering 3, 4, or 5. Accordingly, waitlists with Ordering 1 or 2 receive more

weight. But those are precisely the waitlists where the proportion of takers among applicants

getting an oer is the highest.       Therefore, the reweighting of waitlists induced by the xed

eects aggravates the over-representation of takers among applicants getting an oer.


The DREO estimator we propose addresses those two issues. Firstly, in our example dropping

the last taker getting an oer is sucient to solve the endogenous stopping rule issue. Table

2 shows that then, the expected share of takers among applicants getting an oer is equal

to   0.2 × (1 + 1 + 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3) = 4/5,      the same as among applicants not getting an oer.

Still, dropping the last taker getting an oer is arbitrary: dropping the rst or the second

     2
   This is often the case. Abadie et al. (2002) and Crépon et al. (2015) are just a few examples of the many
papers that have found large dierences between the average potential outcomes of takers and non-takers.

                                                      4
would have the same eect. Besides, doing so reduces the sample size and statistical precision.

Instead, one can give to the three of them a weight equal to 2/3: this reduces the expected share

of takers among applicants getting an oer by the same amount as dropping one. Secondly,

instead of using xed eects to pool waitlists, we simply take an average of the estimators in

each waitlist, weighting waitlists proportionally to their number of applicants. These weights

are independent of how many oers one has to make to ll the available seats, which solves

the second issue of the EO estimator. Table 2 shows that this second reweighting is necessary.

Even after downweighting takers getting an oer, including waitlist xed eects would still

lead to over-represent takers among applicants getting an oer. Indeed, doing so gives more

weight to waitlists with ordering 1 or 2, where 1/2 of applicants get an oer, while those are

the waitlists where the proportion of takers among applicants getting an oer is the highest.

3 Main results
3.1 Assumptions and parameter of interest
Throughout the paper, we consider the following set-up.


Assumption 1 (Set-up)
a) Applicants for a binary treatment are divided into K mutually exclusive waitlists. For every
   k  {1..K }, Nk denotes the number of applicants in waitlist k . Nk is non stochastic.

b) In each waitlist, Sk seats are available, and are allocated as follows: applicants are ranked,
   and treatment oers are made following that order until Sk applicants have accepted to get
   treated or all applicants have received an oer. Sk is non stochastic.
c) Applicants that do not get an oer cannot get treated.
In Section 4 in the Web appendix, we consider various extensions of this set-up. For instance,

we show that our results remain unchanged if we allow for the possibility that some applicants

manage to get treated even if they do not receive an oer. Similarly, we allow for the possibility



                                                   5
that some applicants may participate in several waiting-lists, or that the treatment may not

be binary. But for now we focus on the basic set-up outlined in Assumption 1.

Then, we assume that ranks are randomly assigned to applicants. Let                                     Rik       denote the rank

assigned to applicant   i in waitlist k , let Lk denote the number of applicants getting an oer in
waitlist k , and let Zik = 1{Rik  Lk } denote whether applicant i gets an oer, the so-called

ever-oer instrument. Let Dik (1) denote her potential treatment if she gets an oer, and let

Dik denote her observed treatment. Under point c) of Assumption 1, Dik = Zik Dik (1). For
                                                                          3
every d  {0, 1}, let Yik (d) denote her potential outcome if Dik = d, and let Yik = Yik (Dik )

denote her observed outcome. Let


                 Pk = ((D1k (1), Y1k (0), Y1k (1)) , ..., (DNk k (1), YNk k (0), YNk k (1)))

be a vector stacking the potential treatments and outcomes of the applicants in waitlist                                     k.
For any integer   j,   let   j   denote the set of permutations of                    {1..j }.   Let    Rk = (R1k , ..., RNk k )
denote the ranks assigned to applicants                1   to   Nk   in waitlist     k.

Assumption 2 (Randomly assigned ranks)
For all k  {1..K } and (r1 , ..., rNk )  Nk , P (Rk = (r1 , ..., rNk )|Pk ) =                           1
                                                                                                       Nk !   .
Assumption 2 requires that the ranks assigned to applicants be independent of their potential

treatments and outcomes, and uniformly distributed on                            Nk .    It implies that each applicant

has the same probability of being in the rst, second, ..., or last rank.

Finally, we consider a last assumption. Let applicants with                      Dik (1) = 1 (resp. Dik (1) = 0) be
referred to as takers (resp. non-takers). For every                       k  {1..K }, let Tk = N   k
                                                                                                 i=1 Dik (1) denote
the number of takers in waitlist            k.

Assumption 3 (Strictly more takers than seats)
For every k  {1..K }, 2  Sk < Tk .
Assumption 3 requires that each waitlist have at least two seats, so waitlists with less than

two seats have to be dropped from the analysis. Assumption 3 also requires that each waitlist

have strictly more takers than seats. When all the seats available in a waitlist get lled, it

must be that    Sk  Tk ,     but it is still possible that               Sk = Tk :   all applicants not getting an oer

might be non-takers. Still, in Section 4.1 of the Web appendix we propose a statistical test of

whether     Sk < Tk   for all   k,   or   Sk = Tk   for some        k.
              K
Let   T =     k=1 Tk denote the total number of takers. Our parameter of interest is

    We implicitly assume that getting an oer does not have a direct eect on the outcome, the so-called
exclusion restriction, see Angrist et al. (1996).

                                                                  2
average number of applicants per waitlist. Let I = {(i, k )  N : i  {1..Nk }, k  {1..K }},

and accept an oer, and to            1   for everyone else. As        Sk   takers receive an oer in each waitlist,

weighting applicants getting an oer by                wik   decreases the share of takers among them by the

same amount as dropping one taker, as illustrated in the numerical example in Section 2.

be a weighting scheme combining             wik   with propensity score reweighting. One can show that                         
                        Dik in a 2SLS regression of Yik on Dik using Zik as the instrument,
is equal to the coecient of
                 DR                                                          Nk
and weighted by wik . Importantly, note that under Assumption 1, Sk =        i=1 Zik Dik , so
observing    (Zik , Dik , Yik )(i,k){1..Nk }×{1..K }    is sucient to compute              .

Our main result relies on the following lemma:

The intuition of point a) of the theorem goes as follows. As the numerical example in Section

2 illustrates, one can show that in each waitlist,                    wik -reweighted      applicants getting an oer

are statistically comparable to applicants not getting an oer. Therefore, the only dierence

between these two groups is that one receives an oer and not the other one. Accordingly,
  1                            1
Lk -1    i:Zik =1 wik Yik - Nk -Lk
                                i:Zik =0 Yik , the dierence between the average outcome of the
                                                 1   Nk
two groups, is an unbiased estimator of E
                                                Nk   i=1 [Yik (Dik (1)) - Yik (0)] , the intention to
treat (ITT) eect of getting an oer on applicants' outcome in waitlist                           k.   The numerator of          
is an average of those unbiased within-waitlist comparisons, that gives to each waitlist a weight

proportional to its number of applicants. Therefore, this numerator is an unbiased estimator
         1
of   E   N    (i,k)I   [Yik (Dik (1)) - Yik (0)]      , the intention to treat eect among all applicants.

The intuition of point b) is similar.

We now derive the asymptotic distribution of                     .   In our survey of articles that have used

randomized waitlists, the median number of waitlists used in the analysis is equal to 64.

Therefore, we consider a sequence where                 K,   the number of waitlists, goes to innity.               An

alternative would be to consider a sequence where the number of applicants per waitlist goes

to innity, but in our survey the median of waitlists divided by applicants per waitlist is

equal to 1.9, so the former asymptotic may be more appropriate in a majority of applications.

Typically, the lotteries determining applicants' ranks are independent across waitlists, so by

design the vectors        (Rk )1kK     are independent, and          (Rk )1kK    is independent of        (Pk )1kK .
Then, point a) of Assumption 4 only requires that the vectors                     (Pk )1kK        be independent.

This is often plausible, for instance when the waitlists correspond to dierent schools.

Point b) requires that whether an applicant is a taker or a non-taker be non-stochastic, a

commonly-made assumption in the randomization-inference literature with imperfect com-

pliance (see, e.g., Imbens & Rosenbaum, 2005).                       Under this assumption, the denominator
                                                                                                 K
                                                                                       1/K             E (RFk )
of   K       is non-stochastic, so it follows from Lemma 3.1 that              K =               k=1
                                                                                                 K               . Then,
                                                                                       1/K             E (F Sk )
                                                                                                 k=1
the asymptotic normality of              K ( - K )       follows from the central limit theorem and from

the linearization of a ratio.           Theorem 3.1 still holds without point b), provided the tar-
                                                ~K = E           K         Tk

                                                                         k=1E (Tk )

Tk   i:Dik (1)=1 [Yik (1) - Yik (0)] is the LATE in waitlist k . Indeed, it follows from Lemma 3.1
                      K
that ~ K = 1/K k       =1 E (RFk )
                                    even if point b) fails. Overall, point b) of Assumption 4 is not
               1/K K  k=1 E (F Sk )
crucially important for Theorem 3.1 to hold, but it simplies the target parameter.
                                                                                                            4

Point c) requires that the number of applicants per waitlist be uniformly bounded by some

constant       N +.   Points d) and e) are technical conditions ensuring we can apply Liapunov's

         Theorem 3.1 also holds (with , the limit of K , as the target parameter) if point b) is replaced by the

Theorem 3.1 implies that         is an asymptotically normal estimator of K                             when the number of

waitlists goes to innity. As is usually the case for estimators constructed using independent

but not identically distributed random variables (see e.g. Liu & Singh, 1995), the asymptotic

variance    2   of      can only be conservatively estimated: we provide a consistent estimator of
2 , an upper bound of
+                             2.    That estimator can then be used to build conservative condence

intervals for   K . 5    When all the      k      have the same expectation, something that for instance

happens when all waitlists have the same number of applicants, the same expectation of the

proportion of takers, and the same expectations of takers' and non takers' potential outcomes,
2 = 2
+           so those condence intervals are exact. Finally, in simulations shown in Section 3.4

of the Web appendix, we nd that the asymptotic distribution in Theorem 3.1 approximates

the distribution of         well if 20 waitlists or more are used in the analysis. This suggests that

articles using more than 20 waitlists may rely on Theorem 3.1 for inference, while articles

using less than 20 waitlists may not.

These two conditions automatically hold if E (RFk ) and E (F Sk ) are the same in every waitlist. But they can
also hold with heterogeneous waitlists. For instance, they hold if the sequences (E (RFk ))kN and E (F Sk )kN
are periodic, which corresponds to an asymptotic where the sample grows by duplicating the original sample.

     Conservative variance estimators also arise in other articles studying treatment eect estimation in ran-
domized experiments (see e.g. Neyman, 1923).

Theorem 3.2 If Assumptions 1-4 and 6 hold,

Under Assumptions 1-4 and 6,
                                              E
                                              F     converges towards the sum of two terms. The rst is a
                                                E
weighted average of the LATEs of takers in each waitlist. If those LATEs vary across waitlists,

this weighted average is not equal to the LATE of all takers, because it overrepresents waitlists

with a ratio of seats to takers closer to 1/2.
                                                           6 The second term,              B , is a bias term.   As explained

in Section 2, this bias arises from the endogenous stopping of oers in each waitlist, and from

the waitlist xed eects.

We start by performing comparative statics on                       |B |,   assuming that waitlists are homogeneous:

there exist real numbers      N0 , T0 , S0 , and Y (0)              such that for all      k , Nk = N0 , Tk = T0 , Sk = S0 ,
            1                                    1
and   E    Tk    i:Dik (1)=1 Yik (0)      -   Nk -Tk      i:Dik (1)=0 Yik (0)          = Y (0) .    Then,


                                                          1 - t0
                                        |B | =                           |      |,                                            (3)
                                                   1 - s0 + N0 (t0 - s0 ) Y (0)
where t0  = T0 /N0 and s0 = S0 /N0 respectively denote the proportion of takers and the ratio of
                                                                                     7
seats to applicants in the waitlist. The right hand side of (3) is decreasing in N0 , decreasing
       8                  9
in t0 , increasing in s0 , and increasing in Y (0) .

Then, we study how waitlists' heterogeneity aects                             |B |.        a , S b )  {2..T - 1}2 , let

                                                                                         Let     0           0
  a , T b )  {3..N }2 ,                                         1                               1
(T0    0          0         and let     Y (0),k = E            Tk     i:Dik (1)=1 Yik (0) - Nk -Tk    i:Dik (1)=0 Yik (0) .
The three following results hold:


   1. If  Nk , Tk , Y (0),k = N0 , T0 , Y (0)                  for all   k , |B |   is larger if   % of the waitlists have
        a seats and (1 - )% have S b seats
       S0                                                   than if all of them have
                                                                                                    a + (1 - )S b seats.
                                                                                                   S0
                                       0                                                                       0

    This remains true if the proportion of takers and the ratio of seats to applicants vary across waitlists.

    This remains true if the number of applicants and the ratio of seats to applicants vary across waitlists.

    This remains true if the number of applicants and the proportion of takers vary across waitlists.

Overall,   |B |   seems to be higher when waitlists have heterogeneous numbers of applicants,

takers, and seats. The impact of waitlists' heterogeneity on                 |B |   can be large. For instance, if

 Nk , Sk , Y (0),k = 40, 20, Y (0) , |B | is 17.1%             larger if   50%   of waitlists have   25   takers and

50% have 35 takers than if all have 30 takers.

3.3.2 Comparison with the Initial Oer estimator
Let  Zik = 1{Rik  Sk } be an indicator for applicants in the initial round of oers, the so-called

                                                                  I
be the propensity score weights attached to initial oers. Let P S be the coecient of Dik in
                                                                                     I
a 2SLS regression of Yik on Dik , using Zik as the instrument, and weighted by wik . We call

P I
    S the IO estimator.
                                                                                      I -
Under Assumptions 1-2 and a technical condition similar to Assumption 4,        K P    S      K
converges towards a normal distribution. Contrary to Zik , Zik is only a function of applicants'

random numbers and of the number of seats in their waitlist. Thus, it satises the random

instrument assumption in Imbens & Angrist (1994). Under Assumption 1, it also satises the

monotonicity condition therein. Then, one can show that
                                                                            I
                                                                            P       is an asymptotically normal
                                                                              S
estimator of the LATE of applicants complying with an initial oer. As those are a random

subset of the takers, this LATE is equal to          K .

However, using
                    I
                    P     instead of     may result in a large loss         of precision, as shown in Theorem

waitlist,   E (Yik (0)|(Dk , Rk )1kK ) be constant.          Point d) requires that the treatment eect be

constant. Point e) requires that all waitlists have the same number of applicants, takers, and

can lead to large eciency losses.           For instance, if      N0 = 40, T0 = 30,               and   S0 = 20,       the

asymptotic variance of the IO estimator is 1.97 times larger than that of the DREO one.




4 Application to Blattman & Annan (2016)
After the second Liberian civil war, some ex-ghters started engaging in illegal activities, and

working abroad as mercenaries. Blattman & Annan (2016)

     Under technical conditions, for instance if one assumes that the potential outcomes have a bounded support,
                                                                                  
it follows from Theorem 2.20 in Van der Vaart (2000) and Theorem 3.1 that K ( - K ) converges in L2 ,

    Blattman & Annan (2016) is one of the few articles in our survey in Section 1 of the Web appendix whose
data is not proprietary.

opportunities, the program hoped to reduce their interest in illegal and mercenary activities,

and to sever their relationships with other ex-combatants.               To allocate the treatment, the

authors divided applicants into 70 waitlists, according to the training site they applied for,

their former military rank, and their community.                 In each waitlist, they randomly ranked

applicants, and oers were made following that ranking until the seats available were lled.


Blattman & Annan (2016) estimate the training's eect on 62 outcomes, that are either

applicants' answers to survey questions, or indexes averaging their answers to several related

questions.    To preserve space, we only consider the main outcomes.                Here are the rules we

used to make our selection: we chose indexes rather than questions averaged into an index;

among questions not averaged into an index, we discarded those asking applicants to give a

subjective opinion; nally, we discarded a few measures the authors did not comment on in

the paper. We end up with four measures of employment, one measure of applicants' interest

in working as mercenaries, and ve measures of their social network.


For each outcome, Table 3 below shows the EO estimator computed by the authors, and

the DREO estimator computed with the same controls as those used by the authors.
                                                                                                       12 An

estimate of   + / K - 1       is shown next to each DREO estimator.                 In Theorem 2.1 in the

Web appendix, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the EO estimator. Accordingly, an
                   
              2 / K - 1,
estimate of   E, +              dened in Section 2.1 of the Web appendix, is shown next to each

EO estimator. The table then shows the p-value of a t-test that the EO and DREO estimators

are equal, also computed following Theorem 2.1 in the Web appendix. Finally, the table shows

the estimated dierence between the mean of              Yik (0)   among non-takers and takers, denoted

Y (0) .   The EO and DREO estimators are close for all employment outcomes, but they

signicantly dier for three of the other outcomes. For applicants' interest in mercenary work,

the DREO estimator is 51.0% larger in absolute value than the EO one, and it is statistically

signicant while the EO estimator is only marginally signicant; for applicants' relations with

their ex-commanders, the DREO estimator is 47.4% larger, and it is statistically signicant

while the EO estimator is not; for applicants' social network quality, the DREO estimator is

three times larger, but none of the two estimators is signicant. For the rst two outcomes,

the estimated dierence between the mean of             Yik (0)   of takers and non-takers is large (30.7%

and 25.1% of the standard deviation of these variables, respectively), which may explain why

the EO and DREO estimators dier.
  12
    The DREO estimator with controls is dened in Section 2.4 of the Web Appendix.
  13
    To account for the controls included in the estimation, Yik and Dik are regressed on the controls, and then
the residuals from those two regressions are used instead of Yik and Dik in the computation of + .

An estimate of E, 2
                    + / K - 1 (see Section 2.1 of the Web appendix) is shown next to each EO estimator,
between parentheses. Column 4 shows the p-value of a t-test that the EO and DREO estimators are equal,
where we follow Theorem 2.1 in the Web appendix to compute the standard error of the dierence between
the two estimators. Column 5 shows the estimated dierence between the mean of Yik (0) among takers and
non-takers.


5 Conclusion
When the seats available for a treatment are allocated using randomized waitlists, we show

that applicants getting and not getting an oer are not statistically comparable. Accordingly,

a commonly used estimator of the treatment eect, the ever-oer estimator, is inconsistent

when the number of waitlists goes to innity.             We propose a new estimator, the doubly-

reweighted ever-oer (DREO) estimator, and we show that it is consistent and asymptotically

normal.      Finally, we show that the DREO estimator is often more ecient than another

consistent estimator, the initial-oer estimator. Overall, we recommend that practitioners use

the DREO estimator when they analyze randomized waitlists.

We start by showing that
                                                                        
                                                                                        Nk
                                   1                                   1

First, we show that (4) holds when               Pk    is such that    Tk < Nk .        Then, we have

      Nk
            i=1


                                                               16
The rst equality follows from the denitions of                       wik , Zik , and Dik . The second equality
holds because       Dik (1)   and   (Pik )    are functions of      Pk , Nk and Sk are non stochastic, and the
conditional expectation is linear. The third follows from the law of iterated expectations, and

the fact that       Lk   is included between       Sk   and    Nk - Tk + Sk      under Assumptions 1 and 3.


Then, under Assumption 1, having         Lk = l is equivalent to having Sk - 1 takers with Rik  l - 1,
                                                           -1     Nk -l
one with     Rik    = l, and Tk - Sk with Rik  l + 1. Slk   -1 Tk -Sk Tk !(Nk - Tk )! possible values
of   Rk   satisfy   these constraints. Under Assumption 2, conditional on Pk each of those values
                           1
has a probability
                          Nk ! of being realized. Hence the fourth equality.

Then,


     E (1{Rik  l}| Lk = l, Pk )          =    Dik (1)E (1{Rik  l}| Lk = l, Dik (1) = 1, Pk \ Dik (1))
                                         +    (1 - Dik (1))E (1{Rik  l}| Lk = l, Dik (1) = 0, Pk \ Dik (1)) . (6)

Conditional on        Lk = l, Sk     takers out of        Tk   satisfy   Rik  l,     and Assumption 2 ensures that

each taker has the same probability of satisfying this condition, so

                                                                                             Sk
                           E (1{Rik  l}| Lk = l, Dik (1) = 1, Pk \ Dik (1)) =                   .                    (7)
                                                                                             Tk
Similarly, conditional on        Lk = l      and   Tk < Nk , l - Sk      non-takers out of   Nk - Tk   satisfy   Rik  l,
and Assumption 2 ensures that each has the same probability of satisfying this condition, so

                                                                                           l - Sk
                         E (1{Rik  l}| Lk = l, Dik (1) = 0, Pk \ Dik (1)) =                       .                  (8)
                                                                                          Nk - Tk
Plugging (7) and (8) into (6) yields the fth equality. The sixth and seventh equalities follow

after some algebra.


Then, we prove the eighth equality. Before that, note that           Tk < Nk and                Assumption 3 ensure

that   1  Sk - 1  Tk - 1  Nk - 1                    and   1  Sk  Tk  Nk - 1, thus               ensuring that all the
                                                                         Nk -1
quantities that follow are well-dened.                  There are
                                                                         Tk -1   ways of distributing  Tk - 1 units
overNk - 1 ranks. The rank of the Sk - 1th unit must be included                                between Sk - 1 and
                                                                                  -1   Nk -1-l
Nk - Tk + Sk - 1, and for every l  {Sk - 1..Nk - Tk + Sk - 1}, there are Slk       -2   Tk -Sk
ways of distributing those Tk - 1 units while having that the Sk - 1th unit is at the lth rank.

Therefore,
                              Nk -Tk +Sk -1
                                                l-1            Nk - 1 - l            Nk - 1
                                                                                 =          .                        (9)
                                               Sk - 2           Tk - Sk              Tk - 1
                                l=Sk -1

Similarly, when distributing Tk units over Nk - 1 ranks, the rank of the Sk th unit must lie
                                                                                    l -1 Nk -1-l
between Sk and Nk - 1 - Tk + Sk . For every l  {Sk ..Nk - 1 - Tk + Sk }, there are
                                                                                   Sk -1 Tk -Sk
ways of distributing those Tk units while having the Sk th unit at the lth rank. Thus,

                              Nk -1-Tk +Sk
                                                l-1            Nk - 1 - l            Nk - 1
                                                                                 =          .                       (10)
                                               Sk - 1           Tk - Sk               Tk
                                  l=Sk


                                                               17
     The eighth equality follows from (9) and (10). This concludes the proof of (5).

     Second, we show that (4) holds when                        Pk     is such that       Tk = Nk .     Then, we have

     The rst equality follows from the denition of                          wik   and from the fact that if          Tk = Nk , Lk = Sk .
     The second equality holds because                       (Pik )     is a function of       Pk , Nk    and   Sk   are non stochastic,

     and the conditional expectation is linear. The third equality follows from the fact that under
                                                                                                                                     Sk

     having       Rik  Sk .       This proves (11). (5) and (11) prove (4).

     We then show that

     First, we show that (12) holds when                       Pk   is such that       Tk < Nk .      Then, we have

     This derivation follows from arguments similar to those used when deriving (5).                                               We only

     prove the last equality.              Note that Assumption 3 ensures that                          1  Sk  Tk - 1  Nk - 1,

                                                                            18

thus ensuring that all the quantities that follow are well-dened. There are                                    ways of
                                                                                                     Tk -1
distributing Tk - 1 units over Nk - 1 ranks. The rank of the Sk th unit must be included
                                                                                l-1   Nk -1-l
between Sk and Nk - Tk + Sk , and for every l  {Sk ..Nk - Tk + Sk }, there are
                                                                               Sk -1 Tk -1-Sk
ways of distributing those Tk - 1 units while having that the Sk th unit is at the lth rank.

Therefore,
                             Nk -Tk +Sk
                                            l-1           Nk - 1 - l           Nk - 1
                                                                           =          .                              (14)
                                           Sk - 1         Tk - 1 - Sk          Tk - 1
                                l=Sk

The last equality in the derivation of (13) follows from (10) and (14).

Second, we show that (12) holds when                 Pk   is such that   Tk = Nk .   Then, we have

                                             Nk                                                     Nk

(15) prove (12). QED.

The rst equality follows from the linearity of the expectation, from the fact                           Nk and N
are not stochastic, from point c) of Assumption 1 and the denitions of                        Yik    and Dik , from

the law of iterated expectations, and from the linearity of the conditional expectation. The

second equality follows from Lemma A.1, with                     (Pik ) = Yik (Dik (1))   for the rst conditional

expectation, and     (Pik ) = Yik (0)        for the second one. The third equality follows after some

algebra. QED.


The proof of Theorem 3.1 below makes use of the following lemma, where                        Op (1)      (resp.   op (1))
stands for a sequence of random variables bounded in probability (resp. converging towards

0 in probability), see, e.g., Van der Vaart (2000).

The right hand side of the inequality in the previous display is an                                 op (1).    With probability

approaching one, the left hand side is bounded by an                            op (1),   so it is itself an   op (1).   QED.

The rst equality follows from point b) of Assumption 4. The second equality follows from

Point a) of Assumption 1 and point a) of Assumption 4 ensures that the                                        RFk s are independent.
Point d) of Assumption 4 ensures that for every                           k,   the expectation             and variance of RFk exist,

and points e.iii) and e.vi) ensures that                  (RFk )kN            satises the Liapunov condition. Then, the

Liapunov central limit theorem (see, e.g., Billingsley, 1986, Theorem 27.3) implies that

hence the third equality. The fourth equality follows from the denition of                                          k .   The conver-

gence in distribution arrow follows from a reasoning similar to that used to prove (19), and

from the Slutsky lemma and the denition of                      F S.

Then, it follows from the fact that a 2SLS coecient with one endogenous variable and one

instrument is equal to the ratio of the reduced form and rst stage coecients, from Equation

(3.3.7) in Angrist & Pischke (2008), and from the denitions of

follows from the law of iterated expectations and the linearity of the conditional expectation.

The third equality follows from (7) and (8). The fourth and fth equality follow from some

algebra. The last equality follows from the law of iterated expectations, the linearity of the

conditional expectation, and (26).

Proof of a)
The organization of the proof is as follows. We use the variance decomposition formula


          KV              = E KV  (Dk , Rk )1kK                  + KV E  (Dk , Rk )1kK             ,   (31)


and then compute the limsup of the rst term on the right hand side, before showing that the

second term is equal to 0.

The rst equality follows from the fact that                                  FS      is a function of              (Dk , Rk )1kK ,           and from

Assumption 3 and point c) of Assumption 4 guarantee that for all                                                   k,

Moreover, by point a) of Assumption 4 these random variables are independent, so it follows

from Gut (1992) that

                         K        2
                    1            Nk            1       1                                   1       1                             p

                        k=1

Using a reasoning similar to that used in the proof of Lemma A.1, one can show that

                1       1                                  Tk            1       1                    T0             1       1
        E           +                                  =                     +                    =                      +                     ,
              Lk - 1 Nk - Lk                               Nk          Sk - 1 Tk - Sk                 N0           S0 - 1 T0 - S0
where the second equality follows from point e) of Assumption 5. Combining the two preceding

displays,
                             K     2
                     1            Nk             1       1                           p    T0        1       1

                         k=1 N
Similarly, one can show that
                                                                   K
                                                           1           Nk Sk - 1 p T0
                                                                                 -    .                                                            (35)

Then, it follows from (34), (35), and the continuous mapping theorem that

                                         k=1

                                                                                                                          1
Finally, Assumption 3 and point c) of Assumption 4 imply that                                             FS            N + -2
                                                                                                                               . Combined with

                                         Y                       2

(33), this implies that                     2              k=1 N 2       Lk -1   +   Nk -Lk       is bounded.            Then, it follows from
                                         FS K
Equation (36) and Theorem 2.20 in Van der Vaart (2000) that

Combined with Equation (32), Equation (37) implies that

d) of Assumption 5. The second equality follows from
                                                     K                                      k=1 N Lk -1   i:Zik =1 wik Dik (1) =
F S.   The third equality follows from point c) of Assumption 5. The last equality follows from

  i:Zik =1 wik     = Lk - 1.

Finally, the result follows from Equations (31), (38) and (39).


Proof of b)
The proof if fairly similar to that of Point a), so we just sketch it.

                                     i:Z =1     Dik (1)       S0 -   i:Z =1 Dik (1)
                   1     K
Let    F SI =      K     k=1
                                        ik
                                           S0             -             ik
                                                                     N0 -S0             .    One can show that under points

a), b), d), and e) of Assumption 5,


                                                                                    2        1           1
                                                                                    Y (0)    S0   +   N0 -S0
                                     I
                              KV     P S    (Dk , Rk )1kK                  =                      2            .                       (40)
                                                                                             F SI

Then, for every        k
                                     
                                                    N0                                                N0
                                                                                                                      S0          S0 T0
         E                   Dik (1) = E                  1{Rik  S0 }Dik (1)                =E              Dik (1)           =         .
                                                                                                                      N0           N0
                  i:Zik =1                          i=1                                               i=1


The second equality follows from the law of iterated expectations, Assumption 2, and from

point e) of Assumption 5. The third follows from point e) of Assumption 5.


It follows from the previous display that for every                            k,

                                                  S0 -                                                   T0
                       i:Zik =1 Dik (1)                        i:Zik =1 Dik (1)             T0   S0 - S0 N0
                                                                                                              T0 - S0
              E                             -                                          =       -            =         .                (41)
                              S0                              N0 - S0                       N0    N0 - S0     N0 - S0




                                                                      27
Combining Equations (40) and (41), one can then show that


                                                                              2       1           1
                                                                       p
                                                                              Y (0)   S0   +   N0 -S0
                                   I

                                                                                      T0 -S0
                                                                                      N0 -S0

                    S0 -(N0 -T0 )
                            N0 -T0
Finally,   F SI >        S0          -
                            N0 -S0 , which is stricly positive under point f ) of Assumption 5.
                                                                           I
Together with Equation (40) and Assumption 3, this implies that KV P S (Dk , Rk )1kK

is bounded, so Equation (42) implies that


                                                                                   2       1            1
                                                                                   Y (0)   S0    +   N0 -S0
                                           I
                     lim E KV              P S    (Dk , Rk )1kK                =                      2         .               (43)
                    K +                                                                    T0 -S0
                                                                                           N0 -S0

Then, one can follow the steps used to prove Equation (39) to show that


                                         I
                                     V E P S (Dk , Rk )1kK                            = 0                                       (44)


Finally, the result follows from the variance decomposition formula and Equations (43) and


(44).

One has     0<   N0 -S0      N0 , so

                                                                                      .

The result follows from the two preceding displays, and using again the fact that
