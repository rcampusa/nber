                                         ABSTRACT

This paper studies the implications of individuals’ knowledge of future job loss for the existence
of an unemployment insurance (UI) market. Learning about job loss leads to consumption
decreases and spousal labor supply increases. This suggests existing willingness to pay estimates
for UI understate its value. But, it yields new estimation methodologies that account for and
exploit responses to learning about future job loss. Although my new willingness to pay estimates
exceed previous estimates, I estimate much larger frictions imposed by private information. This
suggests privately-traded UI policies would be too adversely selected to be profitable, at any
price.

1     Introduction

The risk of job loss is one of the most salient risks faced by working-age individuals. Job loss leads to
drops in consumption and significant welfare losses.1 Millions of people hold life insurance, health
insurance, liability insurance, and many other insurance policies.2 Why isn’t there an analogous
thriving market for insurance against losing one’s job?3

      Two companies have attempted to sell such policies in the past 20 years. PayCheck Guardian attempted
to sell policies from 2008, but stopped selling in 2009 with industry consultants arguing “The potential set
of policyholders are selecting against the insurance company, because they know their situation better than
an insurance company might” (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/your-money/08money.html). More recently,
IncomeAssure has partnered with states to offer top-up insurance up to a 50% replacement rate for work-
ers in some industries and occupations (https://www.incomeassure.com). Back-of-the envelope calculations sug-
gest their markups exceed 500% over actuarially fair prices, and it has been criticized for shrouding the
true price by not saliently noting that the government provides the baseline 30-40% replacement rate (e.g.

                                                         1
    This paper provides empirical evidence that unemployment or job loss insurance would be too
adversely selected to deliver a positive profit, at any price. This market failure provides a potential
rationale for government intervention that requires workers to pay into a government UI system.
    I begin by documenting several pieces of evidence that individuals have knowledge about their
future job loss that could be used to adversely select an insurance contract. First, I use data
from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) that asks individuals about their likelihood of losing
their job. I show these subjective probability elicitations are predictive of subsequent job loss,
even conditional on a wide range of observable characteristics one might expect an insurer to
use to mitigate any asymmetric information. Second, spouses are more likely to enter the labor
market when individuals learn they might lose their job (as indicated through high subjective
probability elicitations). Finally, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I explore the
consumption patterns around job loss and unemployment spells. While unemployment is associated
with significantly lower food expenditure growth of 7-10% (Gruber (1997)), there is also a 2.7%
drop in year t − 1 (relative to t − 2) food expenditure growth prior to the onset of unemployment
in year t. The drop occurs even on a sample who remain employed in these pre-periods and who
experience no change in income. This suggests the consumption drop is indicative of forward-
looking savings behavior anticipating potential job loss. Taken together, these patterns suggest
individuals have knowledge about their future job loss.4 Moreover, the labor supply and ex-ante
consumption responses suggest individuals would prefer to have more financial resources in the
event of job loss. This implies they would naturally have a demand for unemployment insurance
and use their knowledge to (adversely) select insurance contracts.
    Given these patterns, the primary task of the paper is to ask: Can this knowledge of future
job loss explain why there is not a thriving private market for unemployment insurance? Whether
a market can exist depends on whether the markup individuals are willing to pay for insurance
exceeds the cost imposed by worse risks adversely selecting their contract – defined as the “pooled
price ratio” in Hendren (2013).5 Therefore, I analyze the implications of the reduced-form empirical
patterns for both the (a) markup individuals are willing to pay for UI and (b) the pooled price
   4
     As discussed below in the related literature, these patterns are also consistent with findings in previous literature
identifying behavior consistent with knowledge of future job loss. Importantly, I show this knowledge is predictive
even after controlling for observables insurers might use to try to remove any asymmetric information.
   5
     This no trade condition was provided in Hendren (2013). Section 4 provides a simple generalization of that
model to an unemployment context that allows for both moral hazard and also dynamic consumption and labor
supply responses. I show that the no trade condition in Hendren (2013) generalizes to this setting. In particular, the
pooled price ratio depends on the distribution of job loss probabilities but does not depend on the responsiveness of
unemployment to UI benefits. The first dollar of insurance provide first-order welfare gains, whereas the behavioral
response imposes a second order impact on the cost of insurance, a point recognized by Shavell (1979). So although
the moral hazard can affect the optimal level of social insurance, it does not readily provide a singular explanation
for the absence of a private UI market.

ratio.
       A large literature has attempted to estimate the markup individuals are willing to pay for UI.
The most common approach estimates the impact of unemployment on the first difference in con-
sumption and then scales this impact by a coefficient of relative risk aversion (Baily (1976); Gruber
(1997)). However, the empirical results above suggest unemployment affects consumption not only
at the onset of unemployment but also in the year prior. This suggests the first difference estimate
understates the causal effect of unemployment on consumption. To correct for this bias, I develop
a two-sample instrumental variables strategy that scales the first difference impact of unemploy-
ment on consumption by the amount of information revealed over the time period measuring the
difference. This forms a “first stage” of the amount of information revealed over the time frame
comprising the length of the first difference. Using the subjective probability elicitations to form
this first stage, I show one needs to multiply the 7-10% consumption drop by around 1.25 to arrive
at the causal impact of unemployment on consumption of 8-13%. Scaling by a coefficient of relative
risk aversion (e.g. 2) yields the markup individuals are willing to pay for UI (e.g. 16-26%).
       In addition to exploiting the consumption drop upon unemployment, the presence of ex-ante
behavioral responses presents an opportunity for a new method for estimating the willingness to
pay for UI. Under conditions discussed below, the response of current consumption and spousal
labor supply to a change in the likelihood of future unemployment reveals the size of the marginal
willingness to pay for UI.6 I show that the 2.7% consumption drop in year t − 1 versus t − 2 suggests
that individuals are willing to pay a markup for UI of 30% multiplied by the coefficient of relative
risk aversion (i.e. a 60% markup for a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 2.) Analogously, I show
that scaling the ex-ante spousal labor supply responses by the elasticity of labor force participation
with respect to a change in wages reveals the markup individuals would be willing to pay for UI.
For a semi-elasticity of 0.5 , this again suggests individuals are willing to pay of around a 60%
markup for UI.
       Are these willingness to pay estimates sufficient to overcome the hurdles imposed by adverse
selection? To answer this question, I build on the strategies developed in Hendren (2013) to estimate
the pooled price ratio. I use the information contained in the subjective probability elicitations
to provide non-parametric lower bounds and semi-parametric point estimates on the pooled price
ratio. This yields lower bounds that are generally in excess of 70% and point estimates in excess
of 300%. The pooled price ratio remains large across varying assumptions about the observables
insurers would use to price the UI policies and also is quite persistent across subgroups. Since these
estimates generally exceed the estimates for the willingness to pay for UI, the results suggest a
   6
    As shown in Section 5.2, this approach does not require state independence of the utility function in contrast to
the canonical approach in Baily (1976); Gruber (1997) and Chetty (2006).

private UI policies would be too heavily adversely selected to deliver a positive profit, at any price.


Related literature This paper is related to a large literature studying the degree to which
individuals are insured against unemployment and income shocks7 and their behavioral response to
these adverse events.8 The methods of this paper are related to a broad literature using subjective
expectation data to identify properties of individual beliefs (Pistaferri (2001); Manski (2004)). In
particular, this paper is most closely related to the work of Stephens (2004), who illustrates that
subjective probability elicitations in the HRS are predictive about future unemployment status,
and to Stephens (2001) and Stephens Jr (2002) who find evidence of ex-ante consumption drops
and spousal labor supply increases in the U.S. using the PSID.
       Relative to previous literature, the primary contribution of this paper is to study the impli-
cations of these empirical patterns for the workings of a private UI market.9 By using subjective
probability elicitations to identify the ’supply side’ frictions imposed by private information, the
paper utilizes many of the tools developed in Hendren (2013). On the demand side, I develop a new
methodology to measure demand for UI when individuals have knowledge of future job loss. Ex-
ante behavioral responses suggest previous methodologies under-state the value of UI (e.g. Gruber
(1997)). I provide a correction for this method. In addition, these ex-ante behavioral responses
open a potentially fruitful new pathway to valuing insurance by exploiting the ex-ante responses
to measure the value of insurance. In particular, the fact that people drop current food expen-
diture and increase in spousal labor supply when they learn they might lose their job suggests
job loss is significantly under-insured in the U.S., regardless of whether one believes the utility
function is state-dependent or individuals have more time to cook or search for lower prices when
unemployed.10
       Finally, this paper also contributes to the growing literature documenting the impact of private
   7

for one of the only papers documenting adverse selection in a UI context in which mortgage insurance companies

      For example, see Guiso et al. (1992); Dynan (1993); Hubbard et al. (1994); Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998);
Carroll et al. (2003); Lusardi (1997, 1998); Engen and Gruber (2001); Guariglia and Kim (2004); Bloemen and
Stancanelli (2005); Barceló and Villanueva (2010); Campos and Reggio (2015); Brown and Matsa (2015). Most
closely, Basten et al. (2012) and Gallen (2013) find evidence of ex-ante savings increases in response to future
unemployment in Norway and Denmark.
    9
      Along the way, the analysis clarifies the empirical estimands required to answer this question. For example, one
needs to know whether the elicitations are predictive of job loss conditional on public information insurers would use
to price insurance. Further, when studying ex-ante consumption responses, it is important to restrict to a sample that
remains employed in these periods to estimate the demand that would be held by potential insurance customers. To
the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to document that food expenditure growth drops on the sub-sample
of those who remain employed in the pre-period and experience no drop in consumption.

impact of retirement and job loss on consumption.

information on the workings of insurance markets and the micro-foundations for under-insurance.
Previous literature often tests for private information by asking whether existing insurance contracts
are adversely selected (Chiappori and Salanié (2000); Finkelstein and Poterba (2004)). My results
suggest this literature has perhaps suffered from a “lamp-post” problem, as forebode in Einav et al.
(2010): If private information prevents the existence of entire markets, it is difficult to identify its
impact by looking for the adverse selection of existing contracts. Combining with the evidence in
Hendren (2013) that private information prevents the existence of health-related insurance markets
for those with pre-existing conditions, the results suggest a broader pattern: the frictions imposed
by private information form the boundary to the existence of insurance markets.
         The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data used in the analysis.
Section 3 presents a series of motivating statistics establishing the presence of private information
that individuals would use to (adversely) select insurance. Section 4 places these patterns in the
context of a general model of unemployment risk. A private market will not be profitable if the
markup individuals would be willing to pay for UI is less than the pooled price ratio in Hendren
(2013). Section 5 considers the implications of the patterns in Section 3 for measuring individual’s
willingness to pay for UI, and Section 6 considers the implications for measuring the pooled price
ratio. Section 7 discusses robustness and alternative theories of market non-existence. Section 8
concludes.


2         Data

The data draw upon two panel surveys: the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The HRS provides measures of subjective probability elicita-
tions about future unemployment and measures of spousal labor supply. The PSID does not contain
subjective probability elicitations, but includes a panel of information on food expenditures.

2.1        HRS

The HRS sample draws from waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) spanning years
1992-2013. The HRS samples individuals over 50 and their spouses (included regardless of age).11
The baseline sample includes everyone under 65 in the survey who holds a job in the current survey
wave and is not self-employed or in the military.


Subjective Probability Elicitations A main benefit of using the HRS is that it contains a
battery of subjective expectation information about future adverse events. In particular, the survey
    11
    The analysis below will explore how the results vary with age, and the ex-ante consumption responses documented
using the younger sample in the PSID will provide complementary evidence of private information in younger samples.


                                                        5
asks respondents: What is the percent chance (0-100) that you will lose your job in the next 12
months? Figure I presents the histogram of these elicitations. As noted in previous literature (Gan
et al. (2005)), the responses concentrate on focal point values, especially zero. Taken literally, these
responses of zero (or 100%) imply individuals would be willing to bet an infinite amount of money
against the chance of losing (or keeping) ones’ job. As a result, at no point will these elicitations be
used as true measures of individuals beliefs. Instead, I follow the approach of Hendren (2013) by
treating these elicitations as noisy and potentially biased measures of true beliefs about losing one’s
job. To maintain this distinction, I will let Z denote the responses to these survey questions, and
I will let P denote the subjective probability held by the individual that governs their willingness
to pay for lotteries and financial contracts, as in Savage (1954). These “true” beliefs, P , are related
to individual’s willingness to pay for an unemployment insurance contract, but will be assumed to
be unobserved to the econometrician, Z 6= P .


Outcomes Corresponding to the elicitation, the survey allows for the construction of whether
or not an individual will involuntarily lose their job in the subsequent 12 months from the survey,
denoted U . The subsequent wave asks individuals whether they are working at the same job as
the previous wave (roughly 2 years prior). If not, respondents are asked when and why they left
their job (e.g. left involuntarily, voluntarily/quit, or retired). For the baseline analysis, I define
becoming unemployed as involuntarily losing one’s job in the subsequent 12 months following the
previous survey date, and I exclude voluntary quits and retirement in the baseline specifications.12


Public Information Estimating private information requires specifying the set of observable
information insurers could use to price insurance policies. Changing the set of observable char-
acteristics simulates how the potential for adverse selection varies with the underwriting strategy
of the potential insurer. The data contain a very rich set of observable characteristics that well-
approximate variables used by insurance companies in disability, long-term care, and life insurance
(Finkelstein and McGarry (2006); He (2009); Hendren (2013)) and also contain a variety of variables
well-suited for controlling for the observable risk of job loss. The baseline specification includes
  12
     By focusing on the incidence of unemployment in the subsequent 12 months, the empirical work below will
estimate the frictions imposed by private information on a hypothetical insurance market that provides payment in
the event the individual involuntarily loses his/her job in the subsequent 12 months. However, the analysis will also
consider robustness analyses to other definitions of job loss. For example, I construct a measure of job loss in the 6-12
months following the survey. This removes cases where the individuals knew about an immediately impending job
loss that could potentially be circumvented by an insurer imposing a waiting period on the insurance policy. I also
construct measures of job loss in the 6-24 month window, and measures of whether the individual is unemployed in the
subsequent survey round (roughly 24 months after the previous survey). I also construct an outcome that identifies
the set of job losses that lead to a government UI claim by interacting the job loss indicator with an indicator for
receiving positive government unemployment insurance benefits in between survey waves.



                                                           6
a set of these job characteristics including job industry categories, job occupation categories, log
wage, log wage squared, job tenure, and job tenure squared, along with a set of demographic char-
acteristics: census division dummies, gender dummies, age, age squared, and year dummies.13 I
also consider specifications that condition on lagged unemployment incidence, and also to a less
comprehensive set of controls such as just age and gender.14


Spousal Labor Supply The analysis below will also explore spousal labor supply responses
on the sub-sample of married households in the HRS. I define labor market participation as an
indicator of the spouse working for pay in the current wave of the survey. Labor market entry is
defined as an indicator for the spouse working for pay in the current wave but not in the previous
wave of the survey (2 years prior).15

2.2    PSID

I also follow previous literature by exploiting the impact of unemployment on food expenditure
in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) (Gruber (1997); Chetty and Szeidl (2007)).16 I
utilize a sample to heads of household between the ages of 25 and 65 who have non-missing food
expenditure. I define food expenditure as the sum of food expenditure in and out of the home, plus
food stamps.17 Following Gruber (1997), I restrict the baseline sample to those with less than a
threefold change in food expenditure relative to the previous year and whose household head is in
the labor force (i.e. either employed or unemployed and looking for work). For some specifications,
I utilize a measure of household expenditure needs, which the PSID constructs to measure the total
expenditure needs given the age and composition of the household.
    For the unemployment indicator, I use the measure of current unemployment/employment
status at the time of the survey. Because the food expenditure questions ask about how much
spending is typical in the household, this timing of employment measure will more accurately
create a comparison between the employed and unemployed. However, this definition differs from
the job loss definition used in the HRS analysis. Therefore, I replicate the results using a measure
  13
     This set is generally larger than the set of information previously used by insurance companies who have tried
to sell unemployment insurance. Income Assure, the latest attempt to provide private unemployment benefits, prices
policies using a coarse industry classification, geographical location (state of residence), and wages.
  14
     I also assess robustness to additional health status controls that include indicators for a range of doctor-diagnosed
medical conditions (diabetes, a doctor-diagnosed psychological condition, heart attack, stroke, lung disease, cancer,
high blood pressure, and arthritis) and linear controls for bmi.
  15
     The primary analysis will focus on labor market entry by previously non-working spouses, as opposed to total
spousal labor supply because of the presence of correlated shocks to labor earning opportunities within the household
arising from spouses working in the same labor market, industry, or firm.
  16
     Consumption questions are also asked on a 10% sub-sample in the HRS a follow-up survey (that is not asked at
the same time the elicitations are provided).
  17
     In addition to analyzing food expenditure, I also explore the robustness of the results to the post 1997 broader
consumption expenditure measures that are asked every two years. See Footnote 26.


                                                            7
of job loss defined as an indicator for being laid off or fired from the job held in the previous wave of
the survey.18 For the primary sample construction, I select those who are employed in the previous
two years of the survey, analogous to the sample selection in the HRS requiring that individuals
are employed at the time of eliciting their job loss probability.

2.3       Summary Statistics

Table I presents the summary statistics of the main samples. For the baseline HRS sample, there
are 26,640 observations (individuals x years) in the sample, which correspond to 3,467 unique
households. This drops to 2,214 households when using the married subsample. The PSID sample
contains 65,450 observations (individuals x year) from 9,557 individuals who are heads of household.
       Individuals in the samples have relatively similar earnings ($36K in the HRS; $40K in the PSID),
although earnings are slightly higher in the PSID sample which restricts to household heads. The
household heads in the PSID are also more likely to be male (83% versus 40%).19
       The most notable distinction between the HRS and PSID samples is the difference in their age
distributions. The HRS sample is older, with a mean age of 56 as opposed to 41. Despite this, the
frequency of involuntary job loss and subsequent unemployment is fairly similar, with annualized
rates of job loss of 3.1% in the HRS and 2.8% in the PSID sample. The PSID sample is more likely
to be unemployed (2.4% versus 1.9% in the HRS), perhaps because job losses in the HRS sample
are more likely to lead to retirement: the retirement hazard in the HRS sample is 5.3% per year
versus just 1.7% in the PSID sample.20 As discussed below, the analysis will assume an insurer
can separate involuntary job loss from retirement; if this is not possible, the knowledge of future
retirement plans could present an additional source of adverse selection in a private UI market.
       For the married HRS sample, 69.3% of spouses are employed and 3.9% of spouses enter the
labor market (defined as an indicator for being out of the labor force in the previous wave and
in the labor force in the current wave of the survey. For the PSID sample, mean household food
expenditure is $7,314.
       Finally, the second-to-last set of rows in Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the subjective
probability elicitations. While 3.1% of the HRS sample loses their job in the subsequent 12 months
  18
     I only include job losses coded as “fired or laid off”, and do not include cases where the individual quit, the job
was seasonal/temporary, or the company “folded/changed hands/moved out of town/went out of business”. I do not
include this latter case because it includes cases where the individual never loses employment (but had a change in
job title because, for example, of a change in management).

     Although the HRS is a representative sample of individuals over 50 and their spouses, the sample of women
exceeds 50% because women are more likely than men to be married to someone over age 65 (and those over age 65
are not included in the baseline sample).
  20
     I construct the yearly retirement hazard in the HRS by computing the fraction of the sample who is retired in
the subsequent wave (2 years forward) and dividing by 2.

from the survey, the mean subjective probability elicitation is 15.7%.21 Such biasedness is common
with subjective probability elicitations (see, e.g., Hurd (2009)). In particular, for low probability
events there is a natural tendency for measurement error in elicitations to lead to an upward
bias. This provides further rationale for treating these elicitations as noisy and potentially biased
measures of true beliefs, as is maintained throughout the empirical analyses below.22


3         Knowledge of Future Job Loss

This section documents three empirical patterns. First, individuals’ subjective probabilities are
predictive of future job loss conditional on a wide range of observables that insurers could potentially
use to price an insurance policy. Second, when individual’s learn they might lose their job, spouses
are more likely to enter the labor market. Third, consumption growth differs for those who do versus
those who do not lose their job in the 1-2 years prior to job loss. These empirical patterns will
provide a basis for considering the implications for the workings of a private UI market, discussed
in Sections 4-6.

3.1        Private Information about Future Job Loss Using Subjective Probability
           Elicitations

Do people have private information about their likelihood of becoming unemployed? To explore
this, Figure II explores whether those with higher subjective probability elicitations, Z, are more
likely to experience a job loss in the subsequent 12 months, U , conditional on year dummies,
demographic characteristics, and job characteristics, X. The figure presents the coefficients on 5
bins of elicitations from a regression of U on these bin dummies and the observable controls, X.
To be specific, I partition the unit interval into bins, Gj , and regress an indicator for job loss in the
subsequent 12 months from the survey, Uit , on observable controls at time t, Xit , and bin indicators,
                                               n
                                               X
                                  Uit = α +          ψj 1 {Zit ∈ Gj } + ΓXit + it                                  (1)
                                               j=1

Figure II plots the coefficients, ψj , omitting the lowest bin (corresponding to Z = 0 ) and adding
back the mean job loss probability for those in the lowest bin of 1.9%. Standard errors are clustered
by household. The figure reveals an increasing pattern: those with higher subjective probability
elicitations are more likely to lose their job, conditional on demographics and job characteristics.
         Table II presents the results from a linear parameterization of this relationship. I regress the
indicator for job loss in the subsequent 12 months, Uit , on observable controls at time t, Xit , and
    21
    This significant divergence between elicitations and job loss means was noted in Stephens (2004).
    22
    An alternative explanation is that individuals hold overly pessimistic beliefs about losing their job. I return to a
discussion of the implications of biased beliefs in Section 7.


                                                           9
the subjective probability elicitation, Zit :

                                      Uit = α + βZit + ΓXit + it                                   (2)

Table II reports the coefficient β and its standard error, clustering by household. For the baseline
specification with demographics and job characteristics, the estimated slope is 0.0836 (s.e. 0.00675).
For every 1pp increase in the elicitation, Z, individuals are roughly 0.08pp more likely to lose
their job in the subsequent 12 months. This suggests the elicitations contain information about
unemployment beyond what is captured by the observables.
   Columns (2)-(4) illustrate the robustness of the estimated coefficient to alternative control
variables. Dropping job characteristics leads to a slightly higher coefficient of 0.0956 (s.e. 0.00685);
adding additional controls for health characteristics reduces the coefficient to 0.0822 (s.e. 0.00736).
Adding individual fixed effects only reduces the coefficient to 0.0738 (s.e. 0.012). Of course, an
insurer could never condition on an individuals’ fixed effect, as this would require conditioning
on information realized in the future in order to construct the individual-specific sample mean.
But, the specification suggests that much of individuals’ knowledge reflects time-varying knowledge
about future unemployment. This underscores the difficulty that would be faced by an insurance
company attempting to use observable variables to reduce the asymmetric information problem.
   Columns (5)-(10) illustrate the presence of private information across a range of subsamples.
Although the HRS primarily focuses on older workers, columns (5)-(6) split the sample into those
above and below 55 years old. The coefficients are relatively similar, illustrating the stability of
the patterns across the age ranges observed in the data. Columns (7)-(8) split the sample into
those with above- and below-median wage earnings to show the stability of the pattern across the
income distribution. Finally, columns (9)-(10) split the sample into those with more and less than 5
years of job tenure. Here again, the pattern is similar with the estimated coefficient ranges around
0.07-0.09. In short, the presence of private information about unemployment appears consistent
across subsamples of the data.

3.2    Spousal Labor Supply Response to Knowledge of Future Job Loss

Individuals have knowledge about their future job loss. Would they use this information to adversely
select an insurance contract if it were offered to them? More generally, how do individuals react
to learning they might lose their job? If individuals are under-insured against the risk of job loss,
learning today that you might lose your job tomorrow should trigger anticipatory responses to earn
more income today and cut back on consumption. This subsection explores the first of these two




                                                  10
responses by studying the spousal labor supply response.23
       Figure III explores whether those who believe they are more likely to lose their job have spouses
that are more likely to enter the labor market. The figure replaces the subsequent job loss variable,
Uit , in equation (1), with an indicator equal to 1 if the spouse not working for pay last wave and
working for pay in the current wave of the survey. The results suggest that spouses of individuals
who are likely to lose their job are more likely to enter the labor market. In particular, spouses
of individuals with Z > 50 as opposed to Z = 0 are 2 percentage points more likely to enter the
labor force. On the one hand, this is a small effect: it suggests roughly 1 in 50 extra spouses are
induced into the labor market when the elicitation is above 50%. On the other hand, relative to
the base entry rate of these spouses of 3.9%, it is quite large. For values Z < 50, the response is
more muted, perhaps consistent with a model in which labor market entry has high fixed cost.
       Table III linearly parameterizes the relationship in Figure III, estimating an equation

                                            LF Pit = βZit + ΓXit +                                               (3)

               dLF P
where β =       dZ     is the response of spousal labor supply to a 1pp increase in the subjective prob-
ability elicitation, Z. Column (1) of Table III presents this coefficient of 0.0258 (s.e. 0.0087).
Column (2) restricts the sample to those who do not end up losing their job in the 12 months after
the survey, yielding 0.0256 (s.e. 0.009). This suggests households are responding to the risk of
unemployment, even if the realization does not occur. Column (3) uses a specification that defines
spousal work as an indicator for full-time employment, as opposed to any working for pay. This
definition includes shifts from part time to full time work in the definition of labor market entry,
and finds a similar slope of 0.0255 (s.e. 0.0099).
       One threat to interpreting this coefficient as the impact of learning one might lose their job
on spousal labor supply is that it may in part reflect a selection effect. For example, perhaps
individuals who are more likely to lose their jobs may be more likely to have spouses that have less
labor force attachment and are more likely to come and go into the labor market. To this aim,
Column (4) considers a placebo test that uses the lagged value of the elicitation, Zit−2 instead of
Zi,t (where year t−2 corresponds to the previous wave of the survey conducted 2 years prior). Here,
the coefficient is 0.00122 (s.e. 0.008) and is not statistically distinct from zero. Columns (5) and
(6) add household and individual fixed effects to the specification in Column (1), yielding similar
coefficients. In short, the results suggest that in response to learning about future job loss spouses
  23
    This analysis extends a large literature on the added worker effect (e.g. Gruber and Cullen (1996)) and builds on
Stephens Jr (2002) who shows evidence of an ex-ante response by spouses to unemployment shocks in the PSID. Here,
I provide further evidence these responses are related to learning one might lose their job, as captured by subjective
probability elicitations.



                                                         11
are more likely to enter the labor market.24 This suggests not only that individuals and households
have private information about future job loss, but that they would act upon this information if
presented with opportunities to mitigate this risk, such as private UI markets.

3.3       Consumption Response to Knowledge of Future Job Loss

The previous sections establish using HRS data that individuals have private information and
suggests they would take actions to mitigate this risk. This subsection seeks further evidence of this
knowledge of future job loss in a broader sample using a widely analyzed variable: food expenditure
in the PSID. There is a large literature studying the impact of unemployment on measures of
consumption and food expenditure. For example, Gruber (1997) and Chetty and Szeidl (2007)
document a 6-10% average drop in food expenditure upon unemployment. However, if individuals
learn ex-ante about their potential future unemployment, one would expect these cuts to occur
prior to the actual unemployment incidence. Here, I explore this hypothesis by documenting a
drop in household food expenditure in the 1-2 years prior to the job loss or unemployment spell.
       Following Gruber (1997), let gi,t = log (ci,t )−log (ci,t−1 ) denote yearly food expenditure growth,
where ci,t is food expenditure of household i in year t. Let Uit denote an indicator for being
unemployed in year t, Uit . I regress food expenditure growth on leads and lags of unemployment:

                                      gi,t = ak + ∆Fk D Ui,t−k + Γk Xi,t + i,t                                       (4)

I run separate regressions for each lead/lag of unemployment, k. The coefficient ∆Fk D measures the
average difference in consumption growth in period t between those who are and are not unemployed
in period t − k. To control for other life-cycle or aggregate trends in consumption that might affect
gi,t , I include a cubic in the household head’s age and a full set of year dummies in the controls,
Xi,t .
       Figure IV plots the coefficients ∆Fk D for k = −4, −3, ..., 0, ..., 3, 4 for the baseline sample of those
who are employed in years t − 1 and t − 2. Consistent with previous literature, the figure documents
a 7-8% impact on consumption at the onset of unemployment; but, the figure also reveals a 2-3%
  24
     In addition to impacts on entry, one may also expect to see fewer spouses leave the labor force in response to
learning about future unemployment prospects for the other earner. However, a countervailing force could arise from
correlated labor demand shocks (e.g. from spouses working in the same industry). To explore these patterns, Column
(7) defines labor market exit as an indicator for a spouse working for pay last wave and not working for pay in the
current period. The coefficient of 0.0174 (s.e. 0.0119) is positive, although not statistically significant. This suggests
spouses are perhaps slightly more likely to exit, consistent with households facing correlated unemployment shocks.
To this aim, Column (9) shows that the the elicitation is positively related to spousal unemployment in the subsequent
year, with a coefficient of 0.0213 (s.e. 0.0097). Spouses of those who learn they may lose their job may wish to keep
their job, but may not always have that choice. In this case, the estimates for the impact of learning about future job
loss on spousal labor supply under-state the response that would occur if the opportunity set available to the spouse
were held fixed.

impact in the year prior to unemployment.25 Note the dependent variable is log food expenditure
growth. For example, the difference in 2-year consumption growth for those who do versus do not
become unemployment in year t is roughly 10%. Moreover, the impact of unemployment appears
to be a long-run shock to food expenditure that does not recover, as shown in Stephens (2001).
    To explore the robustness of this differential food expenditure growth in year t − 1 relative to
t − 2, Table IV presents the results of a regression of the difference in log food expenditure in year
t − 2 and year t − 1, log (ct−1 ) − log (ct−2 ), on an indicator for unemployment in current period
and controls for an age cubic and year dummies. Column (1) reports the shows that the pattern
in Figure IV corresponds to a -2.71% (s.e. 0.975%) drop in food expenditure26 in the year before
unemployment occurs. Column (2) of Table V adds controls for both the change in household size
in years t − 2 versus t − 1 and the change in expenditure needs, delivering a fairly similar coefficient
of -2.11% (s.e. 1.05%) and suggesting the patterns are not driven by changes in household size or
composition around the time of unemployment.27 Column (3) restricts the sample to those under
age 50 – a group largely not captured by the HRS analysis above. This yields a coefficient of -2.88%
(s.e. 1.06%), which is similar in magnitude but not statistically distinguishable from the baseline
estimate. This suggests knowledge of future job loss is present across the age distribution in the
U.S, not only the older sample surveyed by the HRS.
    The baseline figure studies consumption patterns around unemployment, which may be distinct
from a job loss event; Column (4) illustrates the ex-ante food expenditure response to future job
loss (regardless of whether it leads to future unemployment).28 Individuals who experience a job
loss in the future year are likely to have already dropped their consumption by 2.6% (s.e. 0.824%)
relative to those who will not experience a future job loss in the subsequent year.29 Overall, the
results suggest food expenditure drops in the years prior to the job loss or unemployment spell.
  25
     We do not see a significant drop in consumption in the earlier years (e.g. t − 3 relative to t − 4). This is consistent
with evidence discussed below that a large portion (e.g. 10%) of knowledge of future job loss in period t is revealed
in years t − 2 relative to t − 1, but not as much is revealed in the earlier years. See Section 6 and Online Appendix
Figure I that regresses Ui,t+k on Zit for k = 1, 2, ....
  26
     Online Appendix Figure II replicates the baseline regression in Figure IV using more recent PSID data on total
household expenditure on a sample that is surveyed every two years. The broad patterns are similar, although the
consumption drop upon unemployment is slightly larger (e.g. 12%) when using total consumption expenditure as
opposed to food expenditure. There is also an ex-ante response of 3.6% (p = 0.055) in t − 2 relative to t − 4 in total
consumption expenditure.
  27
     Restricting to the subsample of 53,327 observations for which the needs variable is available drops the coefficient
in column (1) to 2.4%, suggesting roughly half of the drop in the point estimate is driven by differential sample
composition; of course, all of these point estimates are well within 1 standard error of the baseline estimate.
  28
     Online Appendix Figure III presents the lead and lag estimates as in Figure IV using job loss instead of unem-
ployment and finds similar patterns to Figure IV.
  29
     Temporary or seasonal work is coded separately and not included in job loss. Therefore, the ex-ante consumption
responses in the PSID suggest the patterns in the HRS are not driven solely by knowledge about fixed term temporary
contracts.




                                                            13
Forward looking behavior versus correlated shocks There are two competing mechanisms
that could be driving these results. On the one hand, the ex-ante responses are consistent with
forward looking behavior in response to a lower future income. Learning one might lose their job
should have a tendency to lower expenditure today and an increase in savings for the future. On
the other hand, the ex-ante responses could also be consistent with individuals consuming hand-
to-mouth (c = y) if income drops prior to unemployment.
         To distinguish between these mechanisms, Column (5) of Table IV adds controls for a cubic
polynomial of changes in log household income to the baseline specification. This yields a coefficient
of 2.72% (s.e. 0.969%) nearly identical to the baseline specification in Column (1). The results
are similar with higher and lower order polynomial controls, or restricting those with small income
changes between t − 1 and t − 2 . Column (6) adds controls for a cubic polynomial of changes in
log income of the household head, yielding a coefficient of -2.81% (s.e. 0.983%).30 To understand
why the results are not significantly affected by adding controls for income, Online Appendix
Figure IV replicates Figure IV using log household income as the dependent variable as opposed
to log food expenditure. For those employed in both t − 2 and t − 1, unemployment in period t
is not associated with any significant income change in any of the years prior to unemployment.31
Rather, the consumption drop is consistent with an anticipatory response to learning about future
unemployment.


4         Model

Individuals appear to be taking actions – cutting consumption and increasing spousal labor supply
– in response to learning they might lose their job. This suggests the onset of job loss and un-
employment imposes a financial burden that generates a desire for additional financial resources –
something that would be naturally satisfied by an unemployment insurance product. Is this private
information the reason one does not see a thriving private market for unemployment insurance?
         This section develops a simple model in which individuals face a risk of losing their job to
frame and address this question. The framework builds upon a model of Hendren (2013) by
incorporating dynamics and precautionary responses, and allows for the possibility of moral hazard
    30
      The sample sizes are slightly lower for these specifications due to non-response to income questions. The food
expenditure patterns are similar when restricting to a sample with non-missing income reports.
   31
      Note the levels of the coefficients are around -0.4 in the pre-periods, indicating that on average lower income
populations are more likely to experience unemployment. The absence of an ex-ante drop in income differs from the
findings of Davis and von Wachter (2011) for plant closings. To be sure, there are sub-samples in the PSID for which
income does decline; in particular, if one includes those who are unemployed in t − 1 or t − 2, then income does decline
prior to the unemployment measurement (as shown in Stephens (2001)). In this sense, the patterns identified here
are similar to those found in Stephens (2001) who shows roughly a 2% drop in the year prior to a job loss; the main
empirical distinction is that I illustrate that these patterns hold on the sample who remain employed in periods t − 1
and t − 2, so that it is not driven by these correlated income shocks in the pre-periods.


                                                          14
when providing unemployment insurance. The model will clarify how to quantify the degree of
adverse selection that would arise if insurers were to offer insurance and to think about whether
individuals’ willingness to pay for a private UI policy would overcome such barriers. Along the way,
the model also provides a framework for thinking about alternative explanations for the absence of
a private market, including aggregate risk, biased beliefs, and moral hazard.

4.1    Setup

There are a set of individuals, i, who face a risk of losing their job in the next year. They choose
consumption today, cpre , along with a plan for consumption in the event of not losing and losing
her job in the future, ce and cu . In addition, individuals also choose a vector of other choices, a,
which can include spousal labor supply, job search activities, and can be contingent plans for future
behavior conditional on other events that may happen in the future. In this sense, the model is
both stochastic and dynamic. Let p denote an individuals chance of losing her job in the next 12
months. This chance is allowed to be privately known to the individual (so that it can generate
adverse selection). It is also allowed to be affected by the choices of the individual – for example,
unemployment insurance may increase the odds of job loss (moral hazard).
   Individual i chooses {cpre , cu , cu , a, p} ∈ Ωi to maximize a utility function that satisfies

                              v (cpre ) + pu (cu ) + (1 − p) v (ce ) + ψi (p, a)                       (5)

where v (cpre ) is the utility over consumption today, u (cu ) and v (ce ) are the utility over consumption
if the individual does and does not lose her job next year, and ψi (p, a) is the (dis)utility from all
the other choices p and a. The model generalizes the structure in Hendren (2013) in several
ways to capture the features operating in the present environment. First, the utility function over
consumption is allowed to differ for those who remain employed, v, versus those who lose their job,
u. This allows for state-dependent utility. Second, the probability of job loss is allowed to be a
choice, so that the problem incorporates moral hazard: more insurance can increase the cost to the
insurer of providing that insurance. Third, the model in principle allows for multiple dimensional
heterogeneity (e.g. different individuals, i, may have different utility functions, ψi , and face different
constraints, Ωi . In the exposition in the main text, I assume heterogeneity can be fully summarized
by the choice of p (i.e. it is uni-dimensional); but the modeling in Appendix A illustrates how the
analysis readily extends to the case of multi-dimensional heterogeneity.
   Finally, the model allows for sources of formal and informal insurance: items such as transfers
from friends and family, and the current level of government benefits are embodied in the con-
straints, Ωi . In particular, the model allows for dynamic responses to under-insurance and thus the
ability to match the empirical patterns in Section 3.

                                                     15
Consumption Responses                  To see how the general modeling setup captures the patterns of con-
sumption in Figure IV, one can make the assumption that the constraints, Ωi , allow the individual
to save today to increase consumption in both states of the world tomorrow.32 Optimization then
yields the familiar Euler equation:

                                    v 0 (cpre (p)) = pu0 (cu (p)) + (1 − p) v 0 (ce (p))                                (6)

The marginal utility of income today equals the expected marginal utility of income in the future.
If the marginal utility of income is higher when unemployed, u0 > v 0 (i.e. individuals are under-
insured), then learning one might lose their job should cause individuals to cut back on current
consumption and save for future consumption. In this sense, the ex-ante responses in Figure IV
are consistent with individuals being under-insured against the risk of job loss.


Spousal Labor Supply Responses The model also captures the spousal labor supply responses
seen in Section 3.3. To see this, write a = (lspouse , a0 ) and ψi (p, a) = κi (p, a0 ) − η (lspouse (p)) ,
where a0 is the vector of all other actions and η captures the disutility of spousal labor supply. Let
wspouse lspouse denote the earnings of the spouse with labor supply lspouse . Then, the intratemporal
choice of labor supply implies the marginal disutility of labor is equated to the marginal value of
consumption multiplied by the wage, η 0 (lspouse (p)) = wspouse v 0 (cpre (p)). So, the Euler equation
(6) can be re-written as
                                1
                                       η 0 (lspouse (p)) = pu0 (cu (p)) + (1 − p) v 0 (ce (p))                          (7)
                            wspouse
The marginal disutility of labor divided by the spouse’s wage equals the expected marginal utility
of income in the future. All else equal, an increase in p should lead to an increase in spousal labor
supply. Equation (7) illustrates this logic along the intensive margin; Appendix C.4 illustrates
this logic using extensive margin responses. If individuals are under-insured against unemployment
risk, u0 (cu (p)) > v 0 (ce (p)), which generates a desire to increase income if job loss becomes more
likely. In this sense, the model formalizes the idea that the ex-ante responses signal under-insurance
against unemployment, and suggest they would have a desire to purchase a private unemployment
insurance contract if it were offered.

4.2     Existence of Private Markets

When can a third-party insurance company enter this environment and profitably sell an insurance
contract? To be precise, I ask when can a private market arise for additional insurance on top of
  32
     To be specific, I assume that if {cpre , cu , cu , a, p} ∈ Ωi then {cpre − s, cu + s, cu + s, a, p} ∈ Ωi for all s. For
simplicity, I assume that the interest rate on savings equals 1 to be consistent with the lack of discounting in equation
(5). More generally, this Euler equation is obtained as long as the discount rate on utility equals the interest rate on
risk free savings.

what is currently provided by existing formal and informal insurance arrangements.33
       To begin, imagine an insurer enters and attempts to sell a policy that pays $1 in the event the
                                                                               p u0 (cu (p))
individual loses her job. A type p is willing to pay                          1−p v 0 (ce (p))    from the future state of not losing
her job to buy this policy, where           u0 (c   u (p))    and    v 0 (c   e (p))   are the marginal utilities of consumption
in the event of losing and not losing her job.
                                                                                                  p
       The actuarially fair cost of providing this $1 to a type p is                             1−p .   If the insurer could sell at this
price there would be a profitable insurance market as long as the individual had a higher marginal
                                                    u0 (cu (p))
utility of income when unemployed,                  v 0 (ce (p)) .   But, since p is unobserved to the insurer, the cost
to the insurance company depends on who else prefers such an insurance contract. The natural
tendency is that those more likely to obtain the insurance payout (i.e. those with probabilities
greater than p) will prefer this insurance contract. Let P denote the random variable corresponding
to the distribution of probabilities chosen by the population. The cost of providing insurance
                    E[P |P ≥p]
depends on         1−E[P |P ≥p] ,   where P is a random variable representing the distribution of risks of job
loss. Appendix A shows that a private market cannot exist if and only if
                                                    u0 (cu (p))

where     v 0 (ce (p))   − 1 is the markup over actuarially fair rates that a type p is willingness to pay for

a small amount of insurance and T (p) =                       1−E[P |P ≥p] p           is the pooled price ratio. Equation (8)
is similar to the equation in Hendren (2013), but generalized to the case when the elements of
the equation are choices of the individual, instead of exogenously given. As a result, the present
formulation incorporate dynamic responses (e.g. consumption responds to learning about future
unemployment) and moral hazard (the likelihood of an insurance payout, p, depends on behavior).
The main result provided in Appendix A is that the objects in equation (8) are sufficient for
characterizing when a private market can profitably sell insurance in this rich environment.
       Equation (8) is similar to the unraveling condition in Akerlof (1970) and Einav et al. (2010). In
those models, the market will fully unravel whenever the average cost curve (average cost of those
purchasing the insurance at a given price) lies everywhere below the demand curve (willingness to
pay for the marginal purchaser). Online Appendix Figure V presents a graphical illustration that
translates the current analysis into their framework. Loosely, equation (8) characterizes when the
                                                                                                                                   0

market unravels for a small amount of insurance, where the “demand curve” is given by . 1−p v 0 (ce (p))
                                                         E[P |P ≥p]
and the “average cost curve” is given by                1−E[P |P ≥p] .        The key distinction of the model in this paper
is that it does not exogenously restrict the set of insurance contracts traded. Appendix A.2 shows
that the no trade condition also rules out menus of contracts and other (e.g. larger) insurance
  33
    A related question, discussed in Section (7), is whether a private market would arise if the government were to
stop providing UI.


                                                                      17
contracts. In this sense, when Equation (8) holds, it suggests the market for any insurance contract
about the job loss will fully unravel in the sense of Akerlof (1970) and Einav et al. (2010).34
         While the present model is less restrictive than Einav et al. (2010) in terms of allowing for
endogenous contracts, the model is more restrictive in only allowing a single dimension of hetero-
geneity, p. In Appendix A.1, I extend the baseline model in Section 4 to allow two people with
                                                           u0
the same p to have a different willingness to pay,         v0 .   When people with the same p have different
                        u0
willingness to pay,     v0   , the left side of Equation (8) is drawn from the interior of the distribution of
u0
v0 .     In this sense, the results are robust to the introduction of multi-dimensional heterogeneity.35
         Equation (8) provides a theory of how private information can prevent the existence of a UI
market. The next two sections focus on translating the empirical evidence in Section 2 and 3 into
                                                                                    u0 (cu (p))
estimating each side of this equation: the willingness to pay for UI,               v 0 (ce (p)) ,   and the pooled price
ratio, T (p).


5         Implications for Willingness to Pay

Because unemployment insurance policies are not traded in a market, it is not straightforward to
                                                                            u0 (cu (p))
ascertain the markup individuals would be willing to pay for UI,            v 0 (ce (p)) .   This section develops two
strategies for estimating properties of this willingness to pay. The first follows previous literature by
assuming state-independent utility over consumption and inferring the willingness to pay from the
size of the consumption drop caused by job loss. While this is a common strategy employed in the
previous literature, I show that this approach underestimates willingness to pay when individuals
have ex-ante knowledge about future job loss. In particular, estimates must be scaled upwards to
account for the fact that some information about job loss has been revealed at the time lagged
consumption is measured in the first difference estimate.
         The second strategy exploits the ex-ante behavioral response to learning one might lose their
job. Instead of comparing employed to the unemployed, I compare the consumption of individuals
who learn today that they might lose their job to those who learn today they will likely not lose their
job. Throughout, I compare and contrast the assumptions required for each of these approaches to
deliver accurate inferences about individuals’ willingness to pay.
    34
     The model in Akerlof and EFC do allow for richer heterogeneity than the single-dimension allowed in the baseline
model. However, Appendix A.1 shows an analogy of equation (8) readily extends to the case of multi-dimensional
heterogeneity.
  35
     As shown in Appendix A.1, the relevant willingness to pay is not a simple average of the population, but is a
more complicated interior quantile of the type space that depends on the joint distribution of the type distribution
and willingness to pay.

5.1        Approach #1: Consumption when unemployed versus employed
5.1.1        Setup

There is an extensive literature focused on estimating the markup individuals are willing to pay for
additional UI benefits by measuring the causal effect of job loss or unemployment on consumption
growth. If utility over consumption is state independent (v (c) = u (c)), one can follow Chetty (2006)
by using a third-order Taylor expansion for u0 around ce (p)36 , to write the markup individuals are
willingness to pay for UI as:
                                            u0 (cu (p))
                                                                                 

the coefficient of relative prudence.37 For simplicity, I assume constant coefficient of relative risk
                                    c1−σ
aversion (e.g. u (c) =              1−σ )   so that the coefficient of relative prudence equals the coefficient of
relative risk aversion plus 1, γ = σ + 1. Following Gruber (1997), it is common to approximate this
percentage change using log consumption,
                                               ∆c
                                                  (p) ≈ log (ce (p)) − log (cu (p))                                                   (10)
                                                c
When utility over consumption is state independent (u (c) = v (c)), the willingness to pay for a
type p depends on the causal impact of job loss on their consumption.

5.1.2        Implementation using Unemployment versus Job Loss

While equation (10) is the causal effect of job loss, the traditional focus of previous literature is
to estimate the causal effect of unemployment on consumption. Indeed, because the consumption

  37
       To see this derivation, note that u (c) = v (c) so that

   u0 (cu (p))           u0 (ce (p)) + u00 (ce (p)) (cu (p) − ce (p)) + 12 u000 (ce (p)) (cu (p) − ce (p))2

data in the PSID is not high-frequency, it is difficult to measure food expenditure at the time of job
loss. The subsequent survey provides information about whether the individual lost her job. But
it does not provide the consumption levels at the time of losing that job, which is formally what is
desired to estimate the willingness to pay for an insurance policy that pays $1 in the event of job
loss.
       Therefore, my baseline analysis to estimate willingness to pay will focus on the causal impact
of unemployment on consumption, following the traditional approach in the literature (e.g. Gruber
(1997)). This potentially provides an over-estimate of the impact of unemployment on consumption
if shocks that lead to unemployment at the time of the next survey are worse than the average
job loss shock. I therefore present results below from a complementary approach that estimates
the impact of having lost one’s job in the past 12 months on current consumption. This will likely
under-state the causal impact of job loss on consumption: if those who lose their job are liquidity
constrained (Chetty (2008)), consumption will have fallen more at the time of the job loss than
what is observed at the time of the subsequent survey. In practice, it will turn out that the impacts
of job loss and unemployment on consumption are fairly similar, so that much of this distinction is
not important in practice.38

5.1.3      Attenuation Bias in First Difference Estimator

To estimate the causal impact of unemployment on food expenditure in equation (10), one must
account for the fact that those who are unemployed may differ on many other dimensions (e.g.
have lower earnings history or less savings) that generate differences in consumption levels. To
remove this selection bias, previous literature often focuses on the impact of unemployment on
yearly consumption first differences, as in ∆F0 D in Equation 4 (Gruber (1997); Chetty and Szeidl
(2007)).
       The first row of Table V presents the estimates for ∆F0 D in Equation 4 using the baseline
sample from the PSID. Consistent with Gruber (1997) and Chetty and Szeidl (2007), the event
of unemployment leads to a roughly 7-8% lower food expenditure relative to the previous year.
Column (1) presents the results for the baseline sample in the PSID, yielding a coefficient of 7.23%
(s.e. 0.997%). The remaining columns report robustness to alternative specifications that I return
to below.
       The common assumption in previous literature is that this yearly first difference impact on
expenditure reflects the causal effect of unemployment. However, the results in Section 3.3 illustrate
that lagged consumption may differ between subsequently employed and unemployed, even for those
  38
    See Appendix Figure III, which replicates the baseline pattern in Figure IV using job loss instead of unemployment
as the outcome.


                                                         20
who were ex-ante identical. In this case, one can write the first difference estimate as:

       ∆F0 D = E [log (ce (p)) − log (cu (p))] − (E [log (cpre (p)) |U = 0] − E [log (cpre (p)) |U = 1])(11)
               |             {z              } |                            {z                         }
                  Average Causal Effect                       Bias from ex-ante response

where the bias term equals the difference in consumption in the year prior to the unemployment
spell, cpre , between those who subsequently become unemployed and those who do not. If individ-
uals in the previous year have knowledge about future unemployment then one would expect the
distribution of cpre (p) to differ between those who experience versus do not experience unemploy-
ment (e.g., those who lose their job on average could have lowered their consumption in previous
periods). Therefore, the bias term in equation (11) would be nonzero.

5.1.4      IV Correction

This section provides a two-sample IV strategy to recover the causal effect from the first difference
estimator by scaling it by the amount of information revealed over the time elapsed in the first
difference (e.g. 1 year prior to unemployment).39 The idea is to use the Euler equation (Equation
6) to infer a link between ex-ante consumption driving the bias in equation (11) and ex-post
consumption, ce (p) and cu (p). The main intuition is that the impact of learning that unemployment
is 1% more likely (i.e. p increases by 1pp) should have an impact on consumption today that equals
1% of the causal effect of unemployment on consumption. When this is true, one can scale the first
difference estimate by the amount of information revealed in the time length of the first difference.

Proposition 1. Suppose that (i) the utility function is state-independent (u (c) = v (c)), (ii) the
Euler equation 6 holds, and (iii) the causal effect of unemployment on consumption is not varying
           d[log(ce (p))−log(cu (p))]
with p,                dp               = 0. Let “≈” denote an equality up to log-linear consumption approx-
imations and third-order Taylor approximations for u and v. Then, the average causal effect of
unemployment on log consumption is given by

than) E [log (ce (p)) − log (cu (p))] if higher values of p correspond to larger (smaller) consumption

    An alternative strategy would be to use longer lags instead of 1-year lagged consumption. However, Online
Appendix Figure V shows that individuals have (albeit small) predictive information about future unemployment 10
years in advance. This suggests the lags would need to be longer than 10 years to remove the bias in Equation (11).


                                                                          21

Proof. See Appendix C.1.

       The average causal effect of unemployment is given by the first difference estimate in equation
(4), ∆F0 D , scaled by the amount of information that is revealed over the year prior to the unem-
ployment measurement, 1 − (E [P |U = 1] − E [P |U = 0]). If individuals have no knowledge about
future unemployment, then E [P |U = 1] = E [P |U = 0], so that the denominator equals 1, and the
first difference estimate remains valid. But, to the extent to which individuals learn about future
unemployment and adjust their behavior accordingly, one needs to inflate the impact of unemploy-
ment on the first difference in consumption by the amount of information that is revealed over this
time period.
       Appendix C.1 shows that the κ correction factor in the denominator of ∆IV accounts for the
fact that the ex-ante consumption response is valued using the ex-ante marginal utility, whereas
the insurance markup is defined relative to the marginal utility in the ex-post state of employment.
Because pis small on average (E [p] = 4%), this correction is small in practice; if individuals are
willing to pay a 25% markup and E [p] = 4%, then this correction factor is roughly 1.01. Going
forward I assume κ ≈ 1.

5.1.5       2-Sample Implementation

Because the PSID does not contain belief elicitation information that could be used to formulate
the denominator in equation (12), I rely on a two-sample IV strategy. Using the HRS, I regress the
subjective probability elicitations on an indicator for subsequent unemployment. This provides an
estimate of E [P |U = 1]−E [P |U = 0], as long as the measurement error in Z is classical (i.e. Z −P
is uncorrelated with U ). Because P and U are bounded variables, the classical measurement error
assumption is unlikely to be literally true; yet it provides a natural benchmark case for the analysis.
The estimates suggest E [P |U = 1] − E [P |U = 0] ≈ 0.197 (s.e. 0.012), which implies roughly 80%
of the uncertainty in unemployment is not known 1 year in advance. Appendix Table I illustrates
that the 80% statistic is quite stable across subgroups of the data.

where σ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.


                                                                  22
on consumption. For the baseline sample employed in t − 1, unemployment causes a 9% average
drop in food expenditure. The remaining rows translate the causal effect into a willingness to pay
by following equation (9) for common values of risk aversion (e.g. σ ranging from 1 to 3). under
an assumption of σ = 2 suggests individuals are willing to pay a 20.4% markup for unemployment
insurance. Higher risk aversion (e.g. σ = 3) raises the willingness to pay to 31.9%; if individuals
are less risk averse (e.g. σ = 1), they would be willing to pay a 9.8% markup for unemployment
insurance.


Robustness The baseline analysis in column (1) makes a couple of specification decisions whose
robustness are explored in Columns (2)-(6). Column (2) controls for changes in household size
and food needs, yielding a similar willingness to pay estimate. Column (3) explores the pattern
for those age 50 and under (analogous to Column (3) in Table IV for ∆F−1D ) and again finds a
similar coefficient to the baseline specification. Column (4) re-introduces observations with more
than a threefold change in food expenditure, which were dropped to align with the specification
of Gruber (1997). Re-introducing these observations increases the first difference estimate to -
8.89% (s.e. 1.23%). Third, food expenditure sums monthly food spending in the house, out of the
house, and – in addition – any spending that occurred through food stamps. While this follows
Zeldes (1989); Gruber (1997), there are two concerns with adding food stamp expenditure into the
analysis. First, individuals may have already included this spending in their report for in- and
out-of-house expenditure (although technically this would not be a correct response). Second, the
wording of the food stamp question elicits concurrent expenditure for the previous week, whereas
the food expenditure measures elicit a “typical” week. Since unemployment is co-incident with
rises in food stamp use, this differential recall window could lead to an under-stating of the impact
of unemployment on food consumption. To understand the potential impact of this, Column
(5) expands the specification in Column (4) to exclude food stamp expenditure from the food
expenditure measure altogether. This yields a larger expenditure drop of 18.2% (s.e. 1.71%), and
provides arguably an upper bound on the size of the causal effect of 22.7%. This would suggest
individuals are willing to pay a 60.9% markup for UI with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of
2.
     The analysis in Columns (1)-(6) measure how food expenditure varies with whether or not the
individual is employed at the time of measurement. As discussed in Section 5.1.2, one would ideally
like to estimate the impact of job loss regardless of whether it leads to unemployment. Column
(6) shows that food expenditure growth is 4.87% (s.e. 0.860%) lower relative to the previous year
if a job loss has occurred relative to the previous year. This is slightly lower than the baseline



                                                 23
estimate of 7.23% in Column (1). This is consistent with the idea that the consumption effects are
attenuated when looking at job loss because the timing of the consumption measurement does not
align with the timing of the event.
       Finally, a remaining concern is that equation (8) requires comparing the willingness to pay for
all p to the pooled price ratio. Therefore, it is also useful to understand the heterogeneity in the
potential willingness to pay across the population. How much might some people be willing to
pay for insurance? Estimating a maximum as opposed to an average is always more difficult than
estimating a mean. This is compounded by the problem that consumption expenditure is generally
measured with error (Zeldes (1989); Meghir and Pistaferri (2011)). Appendix C.2 develops a
measurement error model that uses symmetry assumptions to provide an upper bound on the
causal effect of unemployment on food expenditure, minp {log (cu (p)) − ce (p)}, which can be used
to construct a maximum willingness to pay for UI. For brevity, the details of this approach are
provided in the Appendix.
       Columns (7)-(8) present the results. For the baseline sample in Column (7), the results suggest
a maximum causal impact on food expenditure is 13.7%, or roughly twice as large as the mean
consumption drop. This rises to 14.6% on the broader sample that does not drop outliers with
greater than a threefold change in measured food expenditure. The lower rows in Table V scale
these estimates by various values of risk aversion. With a conservative estimate of 3, it suggests the
maximum markup individuals would be willing to pay is less than 52.6% on the baseline sample
and 56.6% in the broader sample including outliers.

5.2      Approach #2: Exploiting Ex-Ante Responses as Evidence of WTP

The previous section follows previous literature by inferring the willingness to pay for UI from the
causal impact of unemployment on consumption (as measured by food expenditure). While this is
a standard approach, it suffers a couple of drawbacks that have been noted in the literature. Most
notably, it relies heavily on an assumption of state-independence of the utility function over food
expenditure.41
       Recent literature has highlighted how these assumptions may be problematic. In particular,
individuals who are unemployed may have more time to spend searching for lower prices or using
time to make food instead of eating at restaurants. In this case, true “consumption” may not fall
by as much, suggesting a lower drop in the marginal utility of income. More generally, one might
worry about state-dependence of the utility function: even if consumption levels were the same
  41
     This is often stated as two distinct assumptions: (1) state independence over consumption (u (c) = v (c) for all
c), and (2) food expenditure as a valid proxy for consumption. But, it should be clear that all that matters is how
well food expenditure and risk aversion are able to provide a proxy for the marginal utility of consumption.



                                                         24
when employed and unemployed, the marginal value of additional income when unemployed may
differ from the marginal value of additional income when employed, u0 6= v 0 .
       This section presents a new strategy for identifying the willingness to pay for UI that avoids
these issues. The idea is to exploit the ex-ante behavioral response to learning one might lose their
job within the state of currently being employed. The extent to which individuals take actions in
response to learning they might lose their job in the future to generate or save financial resources
helps reveal their willingness to pay for UI.

5.2.1       Exploiting Ex-Ante Consumption Responses

To see how this approach can work using ex-ante consumption responses, recall the Euler equation
(6):
                                         v 0 (cpre (p)) = pu0 (cu (p)) + (1 − p) v 0 (ce (p))

Individuals who learn today that they will lose their job in the next year will equate their marginal
utility of consumption today to the marginal utility of consumption when losing their job, v 0 (cpre (1)) =
u0 (cu (1)). Conversely, those that learn today that they won’t lose their job in the next year will
have a current marginal utility of consumption equal to the marginal utility of consumption when
employed next year, v 0 (cpre (0)) = v 0 (ce (0)). Under the assumption that ce and cu do not vary with
p, Proposition 2 illustrates how the ex-ante behavioral response can reveal the markup individuals
are willing to pay for UI.

Proposition 2. Suppose (a) the Euler equation holds, (b) ce and cu do not vary systematically
            dce               dcu
with p,     dp    = 0 and     dp = 0, and (c) the coefficient         of relative risk aversion in the ex-ante employed
                                 −v 00 (c (p))
state is constant, σ          = v0 (cpre pre )
                                               cpre (p). Then,
                                              u0 (cu ) − v 0 (ce )
                                                                                             
                                                                    σ     −dlog (cpre (p))
                                                                   = E                                                 (13)
                                                      v 0 (ce )     κ              dp
                    "                                 #
                                                                    h                 i
                                       1                              −dlog(cpre (p))
where κ = E                   u0 (cu (p))−u0 (ce (p))     ≈ 1 and E        dp           is the average relationship between
                        1+p        u0 (ce )
consumption today, cpre , and beliefs about future employment, p.

Proof. See Appendix C.3.

       Proposition 2 shows that one can identify the markup individuals are willing to pay for UI by
scaling the impact of a change in beliefs about future unemployment on consumption today by the
coefficient of relative risk aversion over current consumption. In contrast to equation (9), equation
13 no longer compares consumption between the employed and unemployed, but rather studies how
consumption today varies with changes in beliefs about the future states of the world.42
  42
       To see how this can differ it is helpful to consider a couple of examples to illustrate how marginal utilities of


                                                                 25
2-Sample Implementation To estimate how cpre (p) varies with p in equation 13, I follow a
methodology similar to that of the two sample IV approach in Section 5.1. While that approach
compares the time path of consumption and time path of beliefs, p, between t − 1 and t, this
approach exploits the differential path of consumption between t − 2 and t − 1 for those who do
versus those who do not become unemployed at time t. Mathematically,

          dlog (cpre )   E [log (ct−1 ) − log (ct−2 ) |Ut = 1] − E [log (ct−1 ) − log (ct−2 ) |Ut = 0]
                       ≈                                                                                            (14)
              dp                 E [Pt,t−1 − Pt,t−2 |Ut = 1] − E [Pt,t−1 − Pt,t−2 |Ut = 0]

where Pj,t is the beliefs in period t about job loss in period j. The numerator captures the impact
of unemployment in year t on food expenditure growth in t − 1 relative to t − 2. The denominator
equals the amount of information that individuals learn about Ut between year t − 2 and t − 1. The
ratio of these two changes provides an estimate of the impact of changes in beliefs, p, on current
food expenditure, cpre (p).
    Table IV already reported the numerator in equation (14). Food expenditure growth is 2.71%
lower in the year prior to the unemployment measurement. To estimate the denominator, I follow a
similar approach to the estimation of the first stage in Section 5.1. Recall that the average difference
in beliefs one year prior to the job loss measure between those who do and do not lose their job is
E [Pt,t−1 |Ut = 1] − E [Pt,t−1 |Ut = 0] = 19.7% (Appendix Table I, Column (1)). In this sense, 80% of
the information about unemployment is realized between t − 1 and t. Now, one wishes to know how
much is revealed between t − 2 and t − 1, and thus one needs an estimate of how much individuals
know 2 years ante, E [Pt,t−2 |Ut = 1] − E [Pt,t−2 |Ut = 0].
    To obtain this, I regress the elicitation, Z, on an indicator for losing one’s job in the subsequent
12-24 months after the elicitation. The second row of Appendix Table I reports this value as
additional food expenditure, u0 and v 0 , are conceptually distinct from the level of food expenditure when employed
and unemployed. First, it is possible to observe a large expenditure drop, but that individuals do not actually have
a willingness to pay for insurance. If unemployed individuals have more time to spend searching for lower priced
consumption goods or have more time to cook at home instead of needing to eat at restaurants (as shown in Aguiar
and Hurst (2005)), then their marginal utility of additional food expenditure when employed, v 0 (ce ), may be equal
to the marginal utility of additional food expenditure when unemployed, u0 (cu ), even if ce > cu .
  Conversely, it is also possible to have a case where job loss has no causal effect on consumption, ce (p) = cu (p) = c̄,
but individuals have significant willingness to pay for insurance, u0 (c̄) > v 0 (c̄). For example, perhaps the additional
time available when not employed enables a greater value from higher expenditure (e.g. eating at nice restaurants).
Hence, there may be a higher utility value of additional spending when unemployed but because of financial liquidity
constraints, consumption does not rise as much as a fully insured individual would prefer. In this case, consumption
may not be affected by unemployment but individuals can have a willingness to pay for UI.
  While the present approach avoids issues of state dependence, Proposition 2 imposes an additional assumption
that is not required of the standard approach: ex-post consumption does not vary systematically with p, dc        dp
                                                                                                                    e
                                                                                                                      =0
     dcu
and dp = 0. Intuitively, if higher p today decreases (increases) consumption in both states of the world, then
the marginal utility of income today will rise more than (less than) would be suggested by just the average gap in
marginal utilities between employment and unemployment. In this sense, using the response of cpre to p to estimate
the willingness to pay for UI will lead to an overestimate (underestimate) of the true willingness to pay. I return to
a discussion of this in Section 5.3.




                                                           26
E [Pt−2,t |Ut = 1] − E [Pt−2,t |Ut = 0] = 9.37%.43 The difference is then 10.31%, which forms an
estimate of the amount of information about unemployment in year t is revealed in the second year
prior to the unemployment measurement.


Results Table VI takes the estimates for each specification in Table IV (repeated in the first rows

                             dcpre
yield estimates for           dp     of around 20-30%. Scaling these by a coefficient of relative risk aversion of
σ = 2 suggests individuals are willing to pay around a 50-60% markup for unemployment insurance.
For higher values of risk aversion (σ = 3) this increases to 70-90%; for lower values (σ = 1) this
decreases to 20-30%.

5.2.2      Exploiting Spousal Labor Supply Responses

In addition to exploiting the response of consumption to learning one might lose her job, one can
also exploit the ex-ante spousal labor supply responses. One can also use the labor supply version of
the Euler equation (equation (7)) to identify the willingness to pay for UI. In addition to illustrating
the various methods one can use to estimate willingness to pay, it also provides a willingness to pay
estimate for the HRS sample that more closely will correspond to the sample used to measure the
pooled price ratio, T (p), in Section 6.
                                                                                            h                 i

beliefs, p, and     semi     =   dlog(w)   is the response of the female labor participation rate to a 1% increase
in wages (a.k.a. the semi-elasticity of spousal labor supply). Intuitively, one can compare the
magnitude of the labor supply response to beliefs to the size of a response to a wage increase to
infer individuals’ implicit valuation of UI. I use a baseline value of semi = 0.5, following Kleven
et al. (2009). I also consider a range of estimates between 0.33 and 1, loosely consistent with the
range of estimates found in Blundell et al. (2016).


From Elicitations, Z, to Beliefs, P                         Figure III and Table III reported a clear relationship

E [Zt−j,t |Ut = 1] − E [Zt−j,t |Ut = 0] ranging from 0.1 to 0.05 at j = 8, which suggests most of the information in Z
is about unemployment in the subsequent year. This is consistent with a relatively flat consumption growth profile
for years prior to t − 2 as shown in Figure IV.

   In particular, to the extent to which the noise in the elicitations is classical the attenuation will

                                                                                           var(Z|X)

   I correct for this attenuation bias using two benchmark assumptions: (i) the noise in the elic-
itations is classical (i.e. Z − P is uncorrelated with P ), and (ii) that true beliefs are unbiased
(Pr {U |P } = P ). The classical measurement error assumption implies that the attenuation will be
                                                               var(Z|X)
equal to the ratio of total variance to signal variance,       var(P |X) .   Therefore, I proceed by scaling the

the estimate of β in equation (3) by the ratio of total to signal variance           var(P |X) .   The unbiasedness
of true beliefs implies that cov (Z, U |X) = cov (P, U |X) = var (P |X). In words, the only reason Z
and U will co-vary will be because of their correlation with the underlying beliefs, P . Hence, one

The variance of Z given X is estimated as the mean square error of a regression of Z on X. The
covariance between Z and U is estimated as the covariance between residuals of regressions of Z
on X and U on X, and adjusting for the degrees of freedom used to estimate the coefficients on
X in those regressions. All standard errors are be bootstrapped by household to account for the

Results       The first row of Table VII reports the coefficients from Table III of the relationship

the results for   var(P |X)   for each of the specifications. The estimated scaling factor is around 11 for
the non-placebo specifications in Columns (1)-(3) and (5)-(6).
   The third set of rows scales the estimates in the first row by this scaling factor to recover an

estimate of     dp .   The coefficients range around 0.3, which suggest that a 10pp increase in true
beliefs will increase LFP by 3pp. The next rows scale this response by the semi-elasticity of labor
supply, semi , for values ranging from 0.33 to 1. For a semi-elasticity of 0.5, the results suggest
individuals would be willing to pay ~60% markup for unemployment insurance. If labor supply is
more elastic (e.g. semi = 1), it suggests a willingness to pay of around 30%; if labor supply is less
elastic (e.g. semi = 0.33), it suggests a willingness to pay of 90-95%.

5.3    Discussion

The estimates range from around 10-50% for the ex-post methods of valuation in Section 5.1 to
30-90% for the ex-ante methods in Section 5.2. There are two interpretations for why the valuations
exploiting ex-ante responses are higher than the ex-post methods. On the one hand, there could be
a violation of state independence of the utility function (u 6= v) so that individuals have a higher
desire to have income in the state of unemployment than would be gathered from their drop in
consumption. In this case, the ex-ante methods provide a more accurate measure of the value of
UI. On the other hand, the ex-ante valuation could suffer from a selection bias: types of shocks
that generate higher p could be generating lower consumption in both the cu and ce states of the
world. For example, perhaps individuals that are more likely to learn they might lose their job
they also learn that their own future earnings prospects decline even if they do not end up being
                                                                          dce
the ones that lose their job. In this case, one would expect              dp    < 0 so that the ex-ante responses
over-state the willingness to pay for UI.44 Going forward, I explore the implications of the broad
range of estimates – largely between 10-90% – for the workings of a private UI market.


6     Implications for the Pooled Price Ratio

Individuals appear to be willing to pay a significant markup in order to obtain unemployment
insurance. Is this sufficient to overcome the cost of higher risks adversely selecting their insurance
contract, T (p)? This section builds on Hendren (2013) by providing two approaches to measuring
properties of the pooled price ratio. I first provide a lower bound on the average pooled price ratio
under relatively weak assumptions. Second, I provide a semi-parametric point estimate for the
minimum pooled price ratio, inf T (p) that will require some additional parametric assumptions.

6.1    Non-parametric Lower Bounds for the Average Pooled Price Ratio, E [T (P )]

To begin, let PZ denote the predicted values from a regression the unemployment event, U , on the
elicitations, Z, controlling for observables that insurers might use to price insurance, X,

                                                PZ = Pr {U |X, Z}
  44
     To see how this would lead to an over-statement of the true demand for UI, note that the Euler equation now
implies
                         dcpre 00                                                               dce
                              v (cpre (p)) = u0 (cu (p)) − v 0 (ce (p)) + (1 − p) v 00 (ce (p))
                          dp                                                                    dp
                                 dc
so that the consumption drop, dppre
                                    , is larger for two reasons: the value of insurance, u0 (cu (p)) − v 0 (ce (p)), and
the higher value of consumption in the future even if employed, (1 − p) v 00 (ce (p)) dc
                                                                                      dp
                                                                                        e
                                                                                          . In this sense, the ex-ante
consumption response would over-state the value individuals would have for a privately traded UI policy.




                                                          29
Under a couple of natural assumptions, the distribution of predicted values, PZ , forms a distribu-
tional lower bound on the distribution of true beliefs, P . In particular, Hendren (2013) shows that
if (a) elicitations contain no more information about U than does P : Pr {U |X, Z, P } = Pr {U |X, P }
and (b) true beliefs are unbiased Pr {U |X, P } = P ,45 then true beliefs are a mean-preserving spread
of the distribution of predicted values:

                                                 E [P |X, Z] = PZ

Because they contain more information, the true beliefs, P , are more dispersed than the distribution
of predicted values, PZ .
       Figure V illustrates the dispersion in the distribution of predicted values, PZ . To do so, I run
a logistic regression of U on X and a 3rd order polynomial in Z along with indicators for Z = 1,
Z = 0.5, and Z = 0. I then construct the predicted values, PZ . I aggregate across observable
variables by subtracting out the predicted unemployment event if only X (not Z) is included in
the regression, PZ − Pr {U |X}.46
       The results indicate a significant degree of dispersion generated by the information in the
elicitations. An individual with a mean predicted risk of unemployment, Pr {U |X, Z} = Pr {U |X}
has roughly 25% of the population with a higher predicted risk of losing their job based on their
elicitations, Z. The logic of equation(8) can be seen in this graph: would individuals with lower odds
of becoming unemployed be willing to pay the pooled cost of those with higher odds of becoming
unemployed?
       To understand the markup individuals would have to be willing to pay to cover the cost of higher
risks, consider a measure analogous to a pooled price ratio using the distribution of predicted
values PZ , instead of the unobserved distribution of risks, P . For each p, calculate the average
extent to which the predicted values lie above p, m (p) = E [PZ − p|PZ ≥ p]. Then, construct the
average m (p) by drawing p from the distribution of PZ , E [m (PZ )]. Finally, normalize this by the
  45
     Assumption (a) is a natural assumption to place on the elicitations, as it is difficult to imagine how someone
could report more information than their true beliefs. Assumption (b) is potentially more restrictive, as individuals
may have biased beliefs. However, many forms of biased beliefs can be incorporated naturally into the theoretical
analysis in Section 4. For example, consider the classic model of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) whereby individuals
with true likelihood of unemployment, p, behave as if that likelihood is actually q (p). In this case, one can think of
the divergence between q (p) and p as a ratio that multiplies the willingness to pay for insurance, as noted in equation
(16). The pooled price ratio, T (p), is analogous to the cost of the insurance product to the insurer, which depends
on the actual probabilities that satisfy Pr {U |X, P } = P .
  46
     To construct this figure, I use a probit specification in X and Z that includes a second order polynomial in Z
to capture the potential nonlinearities, such as the moderately convex relationship illustrated in Figure II, and also
indicators for Z = 0, Z = 0.5, and Z = 1 to capture focal point responses illustrated in Figure I. This produces the
predicted values, PZ . To construct Pr {U |X}, I run the same specification but exclude the Z variables. Results are
similar using a linear specification (as shown in Appendix Table III), but since the mean probability of becoming
unemployed is very close to zero (3.1%) the logit specification has a better fit since the specification is not fully
saturated in X and Z.


                                                          30
probability of job loss in the population, Pr {U }, and add 1:

                                                            E [m (PZ )]
                                               TZ = 1 +                                                            (15)
                                                             Pr {U }

Loosely speaking, TZ is a pooled price ratio obtained using the distribution of predicted values in
place of the unobserved true distribution of risks. Appendix B.1 provides formal conditions under
which TZ ≤ E [T (P )], so that TZ provides a lower bound on the average pooled price ratio.47 So,
without making strong assumptions about the presence or nature of the measurement errors in
individuals’ subjective elicitations, one can form a lower bound on the average pooled price ratio,
E [T (P )].
       The average pooled price ratio, E [T (P )], contains less information than is required to estimate
the no trade condition (which requires the pooled price ratio for all p, or in particular its minimum,
inf T (p)). This shortcoming will motivate a complementary approach in Section 6.2 that will impose
a semi-parametric structure to facilitate estimation of the minimum pooled price ratio. However,
one can motivate the average pooled price ratio as a reasonable measure of the frictions imposed by
private information on the workings of an insurance market. In particular, Appendix B.1 shows the
average pooled price ratio characterizes the markup individuals would have to be willing to pay to
make it profitable for insurers to be able to sell insurance if they chose their prices randomly along
the demand curve, instead of strategically finding the individual who has the lowest pooled price
ratio to try to sell insurance. If insurers cannot find the type, p, who faces the lowest T (p) when
trying to open up an insurance market, then E [T (P )] will characterize the markup individuals
would need to be willing to pay in order for insurers to profitably be able to sell insurance.


Results The first set of rows in Table VIII present the estimates of E [TZ (PZ )] − 1.48 For the
baseline specification with demographic and job characteristic controls, the average markup imposed
by the presence of worse risks is at least 77% (s.e. 5.2%), suggesting E [T (P )] ≥ 1.77. Columns
  47
      This lower bound builds upon but is distinct from the results in Hendren (2013). Hendren (2013) shows that
E [m (PZ )] ≤ E [m (P )]. Appendix B.1 provides conditions under which this also implies TZ ≤ E [T (P )]. The bound
for E [T (P )] is tighter for low probability events, like unemployment and job loss.
   48
      As in Hendren (2013), the construction of E [TZ (PZ )] and E [mZ (PZ )] is all performed by conditioning on X.
To partial out the predictive content in the observable characteristics, I first construct the distribution of residuals,
PZ −Pr {U |X}. I then construct mZ (p) = E [PZ − p|PZ ≥ p] for each value of X as the average value of PZ −Pr {U |X}
above p + Pr {U |X} for those with observable characteristics X. In principle, one could estimate this separately for
each X; but this would require observing a rich set of observations with different values of Z for that given X. In
practice, I follow Hendren (2013) and specify a partition of the space of observables, ζj , for which I assume the
distribution of PZ − Pr {U |X} is the same for all X ∈ ζj . This allows the mean of PZ to vary richly with X, but
allows a more precise estimate of the shape by aggregating across values of X ∈ ζj . In principle, one could choose
the finest partition, ζj = {Xj } for all possible values of X = Xj . However, there is insufficient statistical power to
identify the entire distribution of PZ at each specific value of X. For the baseline specification, I use an aggregation
partition of 5 year age bins by gender. Appendix Table III (Columns (3)-(5)) documents the robustness of the results
to alternative aggregation partitions.



                                                           31
(2) and (3) shows that adding health controls or dropping the job characteristic controls do not
meaningfully change the results (72% and 80%, respectively). Figure VI, Panel A, graphically
illustrates these estimates of E [TZ (PZ )] − 1 plotted against the psuedo-R squared of the model
for Pr {U |X, Z}. Additional job characteristics controls help better predict unemployment entry
rates across industry and occupation groups, but they do not reduce the average pooled price ratio.
Intuitively, the magnitude of E[PZ − p|PZ ≥ p] depends on the thickness of the upper tail of the
distribution of predicted values, which does not appear to be significantly altered with these changes
in controls, X.49 This is consistent with the upper tail being driven by person-specific idiosyncratic
knowledge that an individual may have that he or she has a particular chance at losing his or her
job. Even if an insurer could use individual fixed effects to price insurance, individuals would still
on average have to be willing to pay at least a 40% markup to cover the pooled cost of worse risks.
    The remaining columns of Table VIII and panels of Figure VI explore how the estimated
markups vary across subsamples. This provides consistent estimates of E [TZ (PZ )] − 1 in excess of
50% across occupations (Figure VI, Panel B), age (Panel C), and year (Panel D).
    Could insurers mitigate adverse selection by imposing waiting periods or making other mod-
ifications to when the insurance policy pays its benefits, U ?50 Figure VI (Panel E) shows that
requiring a 6-month waiting period (so that the insurance policy pays only if the individual loses
his or her job in the subsequent 6-12 months) leads to a lower bound on E [T (P )] − 1 of 57.9%
(p < 0.001). The markups remain high for other potential timelines, such as 0-24 and 6-24 month
payout windows, and if an insurer required an individual to also file for government UI. One could
also imagine that the insurer pays out an insurance payment proportional to the amount of time the
individual spends unemployed. Although duration is not perfectly observed in the HRS, a potential
proxy for unemployment duration and severity is whether individuals are unemployed and looking
for work in the next survey wave (24 months later). Figure VI (Panel E) shows that this continues
to have a significant amount of private information, with the lower bound on the average pooled
price ratio above 40%. In short, changing the definition of U through waiting periods and attach-
ment to government UI programs does not appear to remove or significantly reduce the barriers
  49
     Appendix Table III explores robustness to various specifications, including linear versus probit error structures,
alternative aggregation windows for constructing E [mZ (PZ )], and alternative polynomials for Z. All estimates are
quite similar to the baseline and yield lower bounds of E [TZ (PZ )] − 1 of around 70%.
  50
     Fortunately, the lower bound result does not require that Z be an elicitation that perfectly corresponds to an
event, U . Hence, to explore whether such modifications would be profitable one can simply alter the construction of
U and use the same elicitation to construct lower bounds on E [T (P )] for this alternative event.
   I abstract from the ability of an individual to change the timing of their unemployment. Such claim timing could
impose additional adverse selection costs. In principle, if such timing responses are costly to the worker, they would
be a behavioral response that would not affect the insurer’s costs for the first dollar of insurance when b = τ = 0.
But, this could be an additional cost factor with non-marginal contracts, as has been noted in other market contexts
such as dental insurance (Cabral (2013)).



                                                          32
imposed by private information.
    Perhaps insurers could sell insurance only to observably low risks, such as those with longer job
tenure?51 Figure VI (Panel F) presents the lower bound estimates on subsamples with high job
tenure and steady work histories. In contrast to the idea that restricting to low risks would help
open up an insurance market, if anything the opposite is true: lower risk populations have higher
markups. Indeed, for those with greater than 5 years of job tenure, the data suggest a lower bound
of 110% despite having a less than 2% chance of losing their job in the subsequent 12 months.
Loosely, the data is consistent with there always being at least one bad apple in every bunch that
knows s/he has a decent chance of losing his/her job. This presents an especially high burden on
a sample that on average have a low risk of job loss.

6.2    Semi-parametric Point Estimates of inf T (p)

To move from lower bounds on E [T (P )] to a point estimate of the minimum pooled price ratio,
inf T (p), one requires an estimate of the distribution of beliefs, P . To obtain this, I follow Hen-
dren (2013) by making additional assumptions about the distribution of measurement error in the
elicitations. Note that the observed density (p.d.f./p.m.f.) of Z and U can be written as
                                        Z    1
                   fZ,U (Z, U |X) =              pU (1 − p)1−U fZ|P,X (Z|P = p, X) fP (p|X) dp
                                         0

where fZ|P,X is the distribution of elicitations given true beliefs (i.e. elicitation error) and fP is the
distribution of true beliefs in the population (which can be used to construct T (p) at each p).52 As
shown in Hendren (2013), the key additional assumption required to move from lower bounds to
point estimates is to place some structure on the distribution of elicitations given beliefs, fZ|P,X ,
to reduce its dimensionality. I assume elicitations are equal to beliefs plus a noise term, Z = P + ,
where  is drawn from a mixture of an ordered probit structure to capture the excess mass at focal
point values. Appendix B.2 provides the precise details of the specification and the estimation of
the minimum pooled price ratio.


Results The second set of rows in Table VIII report the results. I estimate a value of inf T (p) − 1
of 3.36 in the baseline specification with demographic and job characteristic controls. This suggests
that unless people are willing to pay a 336% (s.e. 20%) markup in order to obtain unemployment
   51
      For example, health-related insurance markets generally exclude those with pre-existing conditions. Hendren
(2013) shows this is consistent with those risks having private information but healthy individuals not. Loosely, those
results suggest that there’s one way to be healthy, but many unobservable ways to be sick. This pattern prevents the
existence of insurance markets for those with pre-existing conditions, but the ability of insurers to limit such risks
from risk pools allows for insurance markets for the healthy that are less afflicted by problems of private information.
   52
      This is obtained by first taking the conditional expectation with respect to p and then using the assumption that
Pr {U |Z, X, P } = P .


                                                            33
insurance, the results are consistent with the absence of a private market. Including health controls
reduces this markup slightly to 323% (s.e. 26.8%), and using only demographic controls increases
the markup to 530% (s.e. 65.5%).53
    The results are also quite robust across subsamples, as illustrated in Columns (4)-(9) of Table
VIII. Consistent with the findings in the lower bound analysis, I find larger barriers to trade imposed
by private information for those with longer tenure backgrounds (and hence lower unemployment
probabilities on average), with values of inf T (p) − 1 of 474%. The results are similar across age
groups (333% for ages at or below 55 and 344% for ages above 55); and they are slightly higher for
below-median wage earners (436%) than above-median wage earners (316%). The estimates are
all well above the estimated markups individuals are willing to pay for UI. In this sense, private
information provides a theory of the absence of a private market.


7     Discussion

Although Section 5 suggests larger demand for UI than found in previous literature, estimates of
the pooled price ratio generally lie above these willingness to pay estimates. This suggests private
information provides a rationale for the absence of the private market: if an insurer were to try to
sell a policy, the results suggest it would not deliver a positive profit at any price. Here, I provide
a brief discussion of alternative theories of market non-existence.


Government UI            To begin, one might wonder whether government UI is crowding out the
provision of a private market. Here, my estimates suggest individuals continue to have an un-
satisfied willingness to pay for UI in the status quo world with the current level of government
and other formal/informal sources of insurance. They are willing to pay a premium for additional
UI, but it is insufficient to overcome adverse selection. Another interesting question is whether
a private market would arise if the government were to decrease its benefit levels. Extrapolating
evidence from Gruber (1997) suggests the willingness to pay could increase by a factor of 3 (Table
I, p196), but this would still be smaller than the estimated 300% markups individuals would need
to be willing to pay to overcome adverse selection. This suggests a private market would not arise
even in the absence of government provision of UI.


Moral Hazard Moral hazard is another common explanation for market non-existence. However,
the model in Section 4 allowed for moral hazard and showed it does not affect market non-existence.
  53
     Appendix Table IV presents the raw point estimates for αi and ξi . It suggests there is a small (e.g. 10%)
sub-sample of the population that has a very high chance of losing their job. The presence of this upper tail drives
these high estimated markups.



                                                        34
Although behavior may change when individuals obtain insurance, the behavioral response to a
small amount of insurance will be small; and the impact of the small response on the cost of a
small insurance policy is second-order – analogous to the logic that the deadweight loss of a tax
varies with the square of the tax rate. This insight, initially noted by Shavell (1979), suggests
moral hazard does not affect whether insurers’ first dollar of insurance is profitable.54 In this sense,
moral hazard can limit the size of the gains to trade, but does not provide a singular theoretical
explanation for the absence of a market. In contrast, the first dollar of insurance can be adversely
selected by strictly worse risks, so that private information can explain the absence of a market.


Government Regulation Another theory of market non-existence is overly burdensome gov-
ernment regulation. For example, Cochrane (1995) suggests off-hand this is a reason one does not
see markets for “reclassification risk” in health insurance markets.55 Translating this idea to UI,
perhaps individuals are willing to pay for UI, but the reason such demand is not satisfied is because
the government prevents it from being so. Here, the empirical results in Section 5 and 6.2 reject
this theory as a singular explanation of market non-existence. Because of adverse selection, firms
have no ability to profitably enter the market even without any regulatory constraints.


Aggregate Risk           The baseline model in Section 4 assumes that the insurer would have access
to risk-neutral insurance markets. If there is aggregate risk, the cost to the insurer of transferring
dollars from employed to unemployed states for a type p may be higher than the ex-ante risk-neutral
            p
cost of    1−p   because the marginal cost of capital is higher in states where people are unemployed.
In the limit where unemployment is perfectly correlated across individuals and all individuals have
the same willingness to pay for UI, there may be no scope for a profitable insurance market.
       However, unemployment is not purely an aggregate shock. The world does not oscillate between
full unemployment and full employment. To be sure, unemployment rates vary across years; but
the R-squared of a regression of unemployment on year dummies yields an R-squared of 0.0019. As
long as the risk of unemployment has an idiosyncratic component, there will be first order gains
to risk pooling and an insurance company should be able to profitably sell UI. If insurers did not
want to absorb any aggregate risk, they could in principle condition their insurance contract on the
aggregate unemployment rate and fully insure themselves against the portion that reflects aggregate
  54
     If insurers are unable to sell small insurance contracts, perhaps because of fixed costs, then the moral hazard
response could limit the gains to trade and prevent them from covering their fixed costs. In this sense, moral hazard
plus fixed costs could prevent market existence. In contrast, private information provides a singular explanation for
market non-existence that does not require an existence of fixed costs.
  55
     This theory is made suggestively, and the paper does not provide direct evidence of an impact of government
regulation.

risk. However, my results suggest that the market for insuring the idiosyncratic risk would be too
heavily adversely selected.56


Biased beliefs          The baseline model above assumes individuals have accurate beliefs. This is at
odds with existing literature suggesting individuals may have biased beliefs about their unemploy-
ment and job prospects (e.g. Stephens (2004); Spinnewijn (2015)).
         To extend the model in Section 4 to include biased beliefs, suppose p is the objective belief for a
given individual but their decisions over financial assets utilize a re-weighted probability function,
q (p) as in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). It is straightforward to show that the no trade condition
becomes:
                                                  u0 (cu (p))
                                          β (p)                ≤ T (p)   ∀p                                  (16)
                                                  v 0 (ce (p))
                     p 1−q
where β (p) =        q 1−p   is the distortion in individuals’ marginal rate of substitution arising from
                                                                                  u0
biases in beliefs (as opposed to differential marginal utilities of income,       v 0 ).   Biased beliefs generate
a second reason individuals would be willing to pay for UI: they may over (or under) state of the
likelihood of job loss, β (p).
         One can use the estimates above to ask how biased must beliefs be to overcome the frictions
imposed by private information. With a pooled price ratio of 330% and markup individuals are
willing to pay less than 75%, a market would not be profitable unless individuals believe that job
loss is 4.4-times more likely to occur than in reality (330/75=4.4). So, one requires incredibly large
biases to sufficiently inflate demand to overcome the hurdles that would be imposed by adverse
selection.


8         Conclusion

This paper argues that private information prevents the existence of a robust private market for
unemployment or job-loss insurance. I show that traditional approaches using first differences
under-estimate individuals’ valuations of UI when individuals possess knowledge of future job loss.
I provide corrections for this bias that accounts for the information that has been realized at the time
one measures the lagged value in the first difference estimate. I also provide conditions under which
one can exploit the impact of learning unemployment is 1pp more likely on consumption today to
infer a willingness to pay for UI. Despite these generally higher willingness to pay estimates, they
still fall well below the frictions imposed by private information. If insurers were to attempt to sell
such policies, they would be too heavily adversely selected to delivers positive profit.
    56
    The fact that the vast majority of unemployment risk is idiosyncratic perhaps also explains why there is not a
large private market for households to insure against fluctuations in the aggregate unemployment rate.



                                                          36
       While this paper has focused on the positive question of why do markets exist, the paper has not
explored the normative implications. In particular, the presence of ex-ante knowledge of future job
loss suggests individuals may have demand not only for insurance against losing their job tomorrow;
but also demand for insurance against learning today that they might lose their job tomorrow.
Additionally, one might also expect that much of the information that prevents third-parties from
selling UI policies is jointly known to the firm and worker. If this is the case, then one might ask why
firms don’t provide additional UI or severance57 and, in particular whether additional government
UI introduces externalities on the firm’s contracting decisions. The implications of such patterns
for optimal UI design are an interesting direction for future work.
       Figure VII places these estimates in the context of other insurance markets studied in Hendren
(2013), which uses a similar empirical strategy to study private information in long-term care
insurance, life insurance, and disability insurance. Those results suggest no statistically significant
amounts of private information for those with observable characteristics that allow them to purchase
insurance. However, for individuals with pre-existing conditions that would cause them to be
rejected by an insurance company, the estimated markups are 42% for life, 66% for disability, and
83% for long-term care. The patterns are consistent with the idea that the frictions imposed by
private information are forming the boundary to the existence of insurance markets. In settings
with sufficiently high pooled price ratios, private markets cannot exist.
       Figure VII also places the degree of private information about job loss in context. The frictions
to creating a private market are quite large – this perhaps explains why one does not even observe
subsegments of the population in which this market exists. In every subgroup, there’s a “bad apple”
with a decent chance of job loss, making it difficult to profitably sell insurance.

Notes: This table presents regression coefficients from a linear regression of an indicator for job loss in the next 12 months on the subjective probability elicitation, Z, controlling for observable
characteristics, X. Column (1) presents the baseline specification with controls for year dummies, demographics, and job characteristics. Columns (2) uses only demographic controls and year
dummies; Column (3) uses demographic, job characteristics, and health characteristics. Column (4) adds individual fixed effects to the baseline specification. Columns (5)-(10) report results for
the baseline specification on various subsamples including below and above age 55 (Columns 5 and 6), above and below-median wage earners (Columns 7 and 8) and above and below 5 years
of job tenure (Columns 9 and 10). Standard errors are clustered by household.

Notes: This table presents the coefficients from a regression of spousal labor entry on the subjective elicitation. I restrict the sample to respondents who are married in both the current and
previous wave. I define spousal entry as an indicator for the event that both (a) the spouse was not working for pay in the previous wave (2 years prior) and (b) the spouse is currently working
for pay. I include observations for which the spouse was working for pay in the previous wave (these observations are coded as zero). Column (1) presents a linear regression of an indicator for
spousal labor entry on the elicitation, Z, and controls for year, demographics, and job characteristics. Column (2) restricts to the subsample that does not lose their job in the subsequent 12
months. Column (3) defines spousal labor force entry using only full time employment. I define an indicator for the event that both (a) the spouse was not employed full time in the previous
wave and (b) is currently working full time. Column (4) uses the lagged value of Z from the previous wave (2 years prior) as a "placebo" test. Column (5) adds household fixed effects to the
specification in Column (1). Column (6) adds individual fixed effects to the specification in Column (1). Column (7) replaces the dependent variable with an indicator for exit of the spouse
from the labor market. I define exit as an indicator for being in the labor force last wave (2 years prior) and out of the labor force this wave. Column (8) replaces the dependent variable with an
indicator for spouse unemployment in the subsequent 12 months and restricts the sample to spouses currently in the labor market. All standard errors are clustered by household.

Notes: This Table presents estimates of the impact of unemployment in year t on consumption growth in year t-1 relative to t-2, log(ct-1)-log(ct-2). Column (1) controls
for a cubic in age and year dummies and restricts to the baseline sample of those who are employed in both year t-2 and t-1. Column (2) adds controls for the change in
log expenditure needs ("need_std_p") between t-2 and t-1 and the change in total household size between t-2 and t-1 (this is not available in all years of the survey).
Column (3) restricts the sample to those 50 and under to the baseline specification. Column (4) replaces the unemployment indicator with an indicator for job loss. Job
loss is defined as an indicator for being laid off or fired. Column (5) adds controls to the specification in Column (1) for a third degree polynomial in the household's
change in log income between years t-2 and t-1. Column (6) adds controls to the specification in Column (1) for a third degree polynomial in the household head's
change in log income between years t-2 and t-1. All standard errors are clustered at the household level.

Notes: This Table presents 2-sample IV estimates of the causal impact of unemployment on consumption, and the implied willingness to pay for UI. The first set of rows present the coefficients from a regression
of the change in log food expenditure between years t-1 and t on an indicator of unemployment in year t. The sample includes all household heads in the PSID who are employed in years t-1 and t-2. The baseline
specification in Column (1) controls for a cubic in age and year dummies. Column (2) adds controls for the change in log expenditure needs between t-1 and t and the change in total household size between t-1
and t. Column (3) restricts the sample to those 50 and under for the specification in Column (1). Column (4) adds in the outliers in changes in food expenditure that are more than threefold. Column (5) replaces
the dependent variable in the specification in Column (4) with the change in log food expenditure excluding expenditure paid with food stamps. Column (6) replaces the unemployment indicator with an indicator
for job loss. Job loss is defined as an indicator for being laid off or fired.
    The IV estimate for log(cu)-log(ce) divides the first difference estimate by the estimated amount of information revealed between year t-1 and year t. Appendix Table I presents this estimate of the first stage.
Using the HRS sample, this estimates are constructed using a regression of the subjective probability elicitations, Z, on an indicator for subsquent unemployment in the next 12 months, U. The implied willingness
to pay estimates for [u'(cu)-v'(ce)]/v'(ce) are presented for various values of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, σ, and under the assumption that the coefficient of relative prudence is σ+1.
   Columns (7)-(8) present estimates for the upper bound on the maximum willingness to pay for UI, Δ*. Appendix Table II presents the estimates of the components comprising these estimates. Column (7)
presents estimates for the baseline sample that drops observations with more than a threefold change in expenditure; Column (8) retains these outliers.
   All standard errors are clustered by household. Columns (1)-(6) present analytical standard errors; Columns (7)-(8) present bootstrapped estimates (N=500).

Notes: This Table presents the implications of the estimates from Table 4 for individuals' valuation of UI. The first row replications the first row in Table 4. The second
set of rows divide the ex-ante first difference estimate by the amount of information revealed between year t-2 and t-1 for those that do versus do not experience job
loss in period t. This is computed as the difference in the coefficient from a regression of the elicitation, Z, on subsequent unemployment in the next year, U, and the
coefficient from a regression of Z on an indicator for unemployment in the 12-24 months after the survey. Appendix Table IV provides the baseline regression results
for this first stage calculation. The third set of rows scales these responses by the coefficient of relative risk aversion to arrive at an estimate of the willingness to pay
for UI.

Notes: This table scalse the regression coefficients in Table 3 to arrive at an estimate of the willingness to pay for UI. The second set of rows presents the the
total variance of Z relative to the signal variance (var(P)). I estimate the variance of Z given X by regressing Z on the control variables and squaring the RMSE.
I estimate the variance of P given X as follows. I regress the future unemployment indicator, U, on the controls and take the residuals. I regress Z on the controls
and take those residuals. I then construct the covariance between these two residuals and rescale by (n-1)/(n-df), where df is the number of degrees of freedom
in the regression of U on the controls. This provides an estimate of Cov(Z,L|X), which is an approximation to var(P|X) that is exact under classical measurement
error. Standard errors are constructed using 500 bootstrap repetitions, resampling at the household level. The implied impact of p on LFP is constructed by
taking the regression coefficient and multiplying by the total variance / signal variance. The next set of rows divides by various assumptions for the semi-
elasticity of spousal labor force participation with respect to wages, which yields a willingness to pay for UI.

Notes: Table presents estimates of the nonparametric lower bounds on E[T(P)] and semi-parametric point estimates for the minimum pooled price ratio, inf[T(p)]. Each column
replicates the specifications in Table 2. All standard errors for inf[TZ(PZ)] and E[mZ(PZ)] are constructed using 1000 bootstrap resamples at the household level for the minimum
pooled price ratio and 500 resamples for the lower bound estimate of E[T(P)].
1
 inf T(p) specification not available for the FE specification because nonlinear fixed effects cannot be partialled out of the likelihood function. The lower bounds on E[T(P)] are
constructed using a linear probability model. This model generates some predicted values outside of [0,1], which would induce a nonsensical likelihood in the parametric model used
to estimate the point estimate for the distribution of P.

Notes: This figure reports mean unemployment rate in each elicitation category controlling for demographics, job characteris-
tics, and year controls. To construct this figure, I run the regression in Equation (1). The figure plots the coefficients on bins of
the elicitations. I omit the lowest bin (corresponding to Z = 0) and add back the mean job loss of 1.9% to all coefficients. The
5 / 95% confidence intervals are constructed using the standard errors of the regression coefficients, clustering by household.

Notes: These figures present coefficients from separate regressions of leads and lags of the log change in food expenditure
on an indicator of unemployment, along with controls for year indicators and a cubic in age. Data is from the PSID with
one observation per household per year. Unemployment is defined as an indicator for the household head being unemployed.
Following Gruber (1997) and Chetty et al. (2005), food expenditure is the sum of food in the home, food outside the home,
and food stamps. The horizontal axis presents the years of the lead/lag for the consumption expenditure growth measurement
(i.e. 0 corresponds to consumption growth in the year of the unemployment measurement relative to the year prior to the
unemployment measurement). The sample is restricted to household heads who are employed in t − 1 or t − 2 .

Notes: This figure presents the cumulative distribution of Pr {U |X, Z} − Pr {U |X}. To construct Pr {U |X, Z}, I use the
baseline sample in the HRS and regress job loss in the next 12 months, U , on both the observable characteristics (year
dummies, demographics, and job characteristics) and the elicitations (a cubic in Z combined with indicators for Z = 0, Z = 0.5,
Z = 1 to capture focal point responses). I use a logit specification and construct the predicted values to form an estimate
of Pr {U |X, Z} for each observation in the baseline sample. For Pr {U |X}, I repeat this process but exclude the elicitation
variables. These predicted values provide an estimate of Pr {U |X}. I then construct the difference, Pr {U |X, Z} − Pr {U |X}
for each observation, and plot its cumulative distribution.

Notes: These figures present estimates of the lower bounds on the average pooled price ratio, E [TZ (PZ )], using a range of sub-
samples and controls. Panel A reports estimates of E [TZ (PZ )] for a range of control variables, including a specification with
individual fixed effects. All specifications use a probit link specification for Pr {U |X, Z} except for the fixed effects specification
in Panel A, which uses a linear specification because of the presence of fixed effects. The horizontal axis presents the Psuedo-R2
of the specification for Pr {U |X, Z}. Panel B constructs separate estimates by occupation. Panel C constructs estimates by
age group. Panel D constructs separate estimates for each wave of the survey. Panel E reports specifications for alternative
definitions of U . These include whether the individual loses her job in the subsequent 6-12 months, 6-24 months, or 0-24
months (instead of 0-12 months). Panel F restricts the sample to varying sub-samples, analyzing the relationship between
E [TZ (PZ )] and restrictions to lower-risk subsamples. The horizontal axis in Panels B-F report the mean unemployment
probability, Pr {U }, for each sub-sample.

Notes: Hendren (2013) argues private information prevents people with pre-existing conditions from purchasing insurance in
LTC, Life, and Disability insurance markets. This figure compares the estimates of inf T (p) − 1 for the baseline specification
in the unemployment context to the estimates in Hendren (2013) for the sample of individuals who are unable to purchase
insurance due to a pre-existing condition (blue circles) and those whose observables would allow them to purchase insurance in
each market (red hollow circles). Figure reports the confidence interval and the 5 / 95% confidence interval for each estimate
in each sample. For the sub-samples in LTC, Life, and Disability for which the market exists, one cannot reject the null
hypothesis of no private information, inf T (p) = 0. In contrast, sub-samples whose observables would prevent them from
purchasing insurance tend to involve larger estimates of the minimum pooled price ratio, which suggests the frictions imposed
by private information form the boundary of the existence of insurance markets.

A      No Trade Condition
This section provides a more formal exposition of the no trade condition in Section 4. To provide a general treatment,
I begin by relaxing the condition of uni-dimensional heterogeneity in the population. Individuals are indexed by a
heterogeneity parameter, θ, and make choices {cpre (θ) , cu (θ) , ce (θ) , a (θ) , p (θ)} ∈ Ωθ , where the constraint set
varies arbitrarily across types.
    Consider a policy that provides a small payment, db, in the event of being unemployed and is financed with a
small payment in the event of being employed, dτ , offered to those with observable characteristics X. By the envelope
theorem, the utility impact to type θ of buying such a policy will be given by

                                    dU = − (1 − p (θ)) v 0 (ce (θ)) dτ + p (θ) u0 (cu (θ)) db

which will be positive if and only if
                                                    p (θ) u0 (cu (θ))       dτ
                                                                          ≥                                                (17)
                                                 (1 − p (θ)) v 0 (ce (θ))   db
The LHS of equation (17) is a type θ’s willingness to pay (i.e. marginal rate of substitution) to move resources from
the event of being employed to the event of being unemployed.58 The RHS of equation (17), dτ       db
                                                                                                      , is the cost per dollar
of benefits of the  insurance policy.
    Let Θ̄ dτ     denote the set of all individuals, θ, who prefer to purchase the additional insurance at price dτ
                
             db                                                                                                        db
                                                                                                                          (i.e.
those satisfying equation (17)). An insurer’s profit from a type θ is given by (1 − p (θ)) τ − p (θ) b. Hence, the insurer’s
marginal profit from trying to sell a policy with price dτdb

                     Premiums Collected                 Benefits Paid                   Moral Hazard
The first term is the amount of premiums collected, the second term is the benefits paid out, and the third term
is the impact of additional insurance on its cost. If more insurance increases the probability of unemployment,
dE [p (θ)] > 0, then it reduces premiums collected, τ , and increases benefits paid, b.59
     However, for the first dollar of insurance when τ = b = 0, the moral hazard cost to the insurer is zero. This insight,
initially noted by Shavell (1979), suggests moral hazard does not affect whether insurers’ first dollar of insurance is
profitable – a result akin to the logic that deadweight loss varies with the square of the tax rate.
     The first dollar of insurance will be profitable if and only if

                                                       E p (θ) |θ ∈ Θ̄ dτ
                                                                         

If inequality (18) does not hold for any possible price, dτ
                                                          db
                                                             , then providing private insurance will not be profitable at
any price. The market will unravel a la Akerlof (1970). Under the natural assumption60 that profits are concave in b
and τ , the inability to profitably sell a small amount of insurance also rules out the inability to sell larger insurance
contracts.
     To this point, the model allows for an arbitrary dimensionality of unobserved heterogeneity, θ. To provide a
clearer expression of how demand relates to underlying fundamentals, such as marginal rates of substitution and
beliefs, it is helpful to impose a dimensionality reduction on the unobserved heterogeneity.
Assumption A1. (Uni-dimensional Heterogeneity) Assume the mapping θ → p (θ) is 1-1 and continuously
                                                                                                               p u0 (cu (p))
differentiable in b and τ in an open ball around b = τ = 0. Moreover, the marginal rate of substitution, 1−p      v 0 (ce (p))
                                                                                                                               ,
is increasing in p.
  58
     Note that, because of the envelope theorem, the individual’s valuation of this small insurance policy is independent
of any behavioral response. While these behavioral responses may impose externalities on the insurer or government,
they do not affect the individuals’ willingness to pay.
  59
     To incorporate observable characteristics, one should think of the expectations as drawing from the distribution
of θ conditional on a particular observable characteristic, X.
  60
     See Appendix A.3 for a micro-foundation of this assumption.




                                                              56
    Assumption A1 states that the underlying heterogeneity can be summarized by ones’ belief, p (θ). In this case,
the adverse selection will take a particular threshold form: the set of people who would be attracted to a contract
for which type p (θ) is indifferent will be the set of higher risks whose probabilities exceed p (θ). Let P denote the
random variable corresponding to the distribution of probabilities chosen in the population in the status quo world
without a private unemployment insurance market, b = τ = 0.61 And, let cu (p) and ce (p) denote the consumption
of types p (θ) in the unemployed and employed states of the world. Under Assumption A1, equation (18) can be
re-written as:
                                                 u0 (cu (p))
                                                              ≤ T (p) ∀p                                          (19)
                                                 v 0 (ce (p))
where T (p) is given by
                                                          E [P |P ≥ p] 1 − p
                                              T (p) =
                                                        E [1 − P |P ≥ p] p
which is the pooled cost of worse risks, termed the “pooled price ratio” in Hendren (2013). The market can exist
only if there exists someone who is willing to pay the markup imposed by the presence of higher risk types adversely
                                  0
selecting her contract. Here, uv0 (c  u (p))
                                    (ce (p))
                                             − 1 is the markup individual p would be willing to pay and T (p) − 1 is the
markup that would be imposed by the presence of risks P ≥ p adversely selecting the contract. This suggests the
pooled price ratio, T (p), is the fundamental empirical magnitude desired for understanding the frictions imposed by
private information.
     The remainder of this Appendix further discusses the generality of the no trade condition. A.1 discusses multi-
dimensional heterogeneity. Appendix A.3 illustrates that while in principle the no trade condition does not rule out
non-marginal insurance contracts (i.e. b and τ > 0), in general a monopolist firm’s profits will be concave in the size
of the contract; hence the no trade condition also rules out larger contracts. Appendix A.2 also discusses the ability
of the firm to potentially offer menus of insurance contracts instead of a single contract to screen workers.


A.1      Multi-Dimensional Heterogeneity and Robustness to Outlier Willingness
         to Pay
In reality, there are many reasons beyond one’s chance of job loss that drive differences in willingness to pay. As a
result, a potential concern with the robustness of the no trade condition is that one may expect that at least one
person in the population is likely willing to pay the pooled cost of the risks worse than them, even if the majority
of those with similar likelihood of job loss, p, have lower demand for UI. To understand the potential validity of
this concern, this section solves for the no-trade condition in the case where there is an (unbounded) distribution of
u0 (cu (θ))
 v 0 (ce (θ))
              among the set of those with the same risk type, p (θ). In this case, there is heterogeneous willingness to pay
for additional UI for different types θ with the same p (θ).
        I show that there exists a mapping, f (p) : A → Θ , that maps A ⊂ [0, 1] into the interior of the type space, Θ,
such that the no trade condition reduces to testing
                                                u0 (cu (f (p)))
                                                                ≤ T (p)   ∀p                                             (20)
                                                u0 (ce (f (p)))
In this sense, even though some types are willing to pay an unboundedly high amount for UI, their extreme willingness
to pay does not directly affect the no trade condition. Rather, one needs to search through an interior subset of the
type space. Hence, if there are sufficiently many people of risk type p with very high willingness to pay, then one
would expect the type f (p) to be willing to pay the pooled cost of worse risks, so that equation (20) will not hold.
But, the results illustrate that a simple addition of individuals with outlier willingness to pay for UI will not open
up a market unless there are sufficiently many other types with the similar risk type that are also willing to pay the
pooled cost of worse risks.
    I prove this result as follows. First, I assume for simplicity that the distribution of p (θ) has full support on [0, 1]
                           0
and the distribution of uv0 (c u (θ))
                             (ce (θ))
                                      has full support on [0, ∞) (this is not essential, but significantly shortens the proof
– note this allows for some individuals with unboundedly high willingness to pay). Now, fix a particular policy, dτ       db
                                                                                                                             ,
and consider the set of θ that are willing to pay for this policy:
                                                                    
                                                                      dτ
                                                    E p (θ) |θ ∈ Θ̄
                                                                      db
   61
      In other words, the random variable P is simply the random variable generated by the choices of probabilities,
p (θ), in the population.

∞. For each p, define f (p) to be a value(s) of θ such that the willingness to pay equals p̃−1 (p):
                                                 p u0 (ce (f (p)))

testing this equation for all pin the range of A:
                                          E [p (θ) |p (θ) ≥ p]
                                                                 ≥ p̃−1 (p)     ∀p ∈ A
                                        1 − E [p (θ) |p (θ) ≥ p]
which is equivalent to
                                       E [p (θ) |p (θ) ≥ p]       p u0 (ce (f (p)))

which proves the desired result.
     Intuitively, it is sufficient to check the no trade condition for the set of equivalent classes of types with the same
willingness to pay for dτ dp
                             . Within this class, there exists a type that one can use to check the simple uni-dimensional
no trade condition.


A.2      Robustness to Menus
Here, I illustrate how to nest the model into the setting of Hendren (2013), then apply the no trade condition in
Hendren (2013) to rule out menus in this more complex setting with moral hazard. I assume here that there are
no additional choices, a, other than the choice p, although the presence of such additional choices should not alter
the proof as long as they are not observable to the insurer. With this simplification, the only distinction relative to
Hendren (2013) is the introduction of the moral hazard problem in choosing p. This section shows that allowing p to
be a choice doesn’t make trade any easier than in a world where p (θ) is exogenous and not affected by the insurer’s
contracts; hence the no trade condition results from Hendren (2013) can be applied to rule out menus.
     I consider the maximization program of a monopolist insurer offering a menu of insurance contracts. Whether
there exists any implementable allocations other than the endowment corresponds to whether there exists any alloca-
tions other than the endowment which maximize the profit, π, subject to the incentive and participation constraints.
     Without loss of generality, the insurer can offer a menu of contracts to screen types, {ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)}θ∈Γ where ν (θ)
specifies a total utility provided to type θ, v (θ) = p (θ) u (cu (θ)) + (1 − p (θ)) v (ce (θ)) − Ψ (p; θ), and ∆ (θ) denotes
the difference in utilities if the agent becomes unemployed, ∆ (θ) = u (cu (θ)) − v (ce (θ)). Note that ν (θ) implicitly
contains the disutility of effort.
     Given the menu of contracts offered by the insurer, individuals choose their likelihood of unemployment. Let
q̂ (∆, θ) denote the choice of probability of employment for a type θ given the utility difference between employment
  62
    If p̃ is not strictly increasing (e.g. because of “advantageous selection”), it will be strictly more profitable to an
insurance company to sell the insurance at a higher price. Hence, one need not test the no trade condition for such
intermediate values of dτ db
                             where p̃ is decreasing in p.


                                                             58
and unemployment, ∆, so that the agent’s effort cost is Ψ (q̂ (∆; θ) θ). Note that a type θ that accepts a contract
containing ∆ will choose a probability of employment q̂ (∆; θ) that maximizes their utility. I assume that q̂ is weakly
increasing in ∆ for all θ.
    Let Cu (x) = u−1 (x) and Ce (x) = v −1 (x) denote the consumption levels required in the employed and unem-
ployed state to provide utility level x. Let π (∆, ν; θ) denote the profits obtained from providing type θ with contract
terms ν and ∆, given by
              π (∆, ν; θ) = q̂ (∆; θ) (cee − Ce (v − Ψ (∆; θ))) + (1 − q̂ (∆; θ)) (ceu − Cu (ν − ∆ − Ψ (∆; θ)))
Note that the profit function takes into account how the agents’ choice of p varies with ∆.
    Throughout, I maintain the assumption that profits of the monopolist are concave in (ν, ∆). Such concavity can
be established in the general case when u is concave and individuals do not choose p (see Hendren (2013)). But,
allowing individuals to make choices, p, introduces potential non-convexities into the analysis. However, it is natural
to assume that if a large insurance contract would be profitable, then so would a small insurance contract. In Section
A.3 below, I show that global concavity of the firm’s profit function follows from reasonable assumptions on the
individuals’ utility function. Intuitively, what ensures global concavity is to rule out a case where small amounts of
insurance generate large increases in marginal utilities (and hence increase the demand for insurance).
    I prove the sufficiency of the no trade condition for ruling out trade by mapping it into the setting of Hendren
(2013). To do so, define π̃ (ν, ∆; θ) to be the profits incurred by the firm in the alternative world in which individuals
choose p as if they faced their endowment (i.e. face no moral hazard problem). Now, in this alternative world,
individuals still obtain total utility ν by construction, but must be compensated for their lost utility from effort
because they can’t re-optimize. But, note this compensation is second-order by the envelope theorem. Therefore, the
marginal profitability for sufficiently small insurance contracts is given by
                                                   π (ν, ∆; θ) ≤ π̃ (ν, ∆; θ)
    Now, define the aggregate profits to an insurer that offers menu {ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)}θ by
                                                       Z
                                    Π (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)) = π (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ) ; θ) dµ (θ)

and in the world in which p is not affected by Π,
                                                              Z
                                       Π̃ (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)) =       π (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ) ; θ) dµ (θ)

So, for small variations in ν and ∆, we have that
                                             Π (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)) ≤ Π̃ (ν (θ) , ∆ (θ))
because insurance causes an increase in p. Now, Hendren (2013) shows that the no trade condition implies that
Π̃ ≤ 0 for all menus, {ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)}. Therefore, the no trade condition also implies Π ≤ 0 for local variations in the
menu {ν (θ) , ∆ (θ)} around the endowment. Combining with the concavity assumption, this also rules out larger
deviations.
     Conversely, if the no trade condition does not hold, note that the behavioral response is continuous in ∆, so that
sufficiently small values of insurance allow for a profitable insurance contract to be traded.


A.3     Concavity Assumption and Sufficient Conditions for Concavity
The presence of moral hazard in this multi-dimensional screening problem induces the potential for non-convexities in
the constraint set. Such non convexities could potentially limit the ability of local variational analysis to characterize
the set of implementable allocations. To be specific, let π (∆, µ; θ) denote the profit obtained from type θ if she is
provided with total utility µ and difference in utilities ∆,
      π (∆, µ; θ) = (1 − p̂ (∆; θ)) (cee − Cv (µ − Ψ (1 − p̂ (∆; θ)))) + p̂ (∆; θ) (ceu − Cu (µ − ∆ − Ψ (1 − p̂ (∆; θ))))
To guarantee the validity of our variational analysis for characterizing when the endowment is the only implementable
allocation, it will be sufficient to require that π (∆, µ; θ) is concave in (∆, µ).

Assumption. π (∆, µ; θ) is concave in (∆, µ) for each θ
     This assumption requires the marginal profitability of insurance to decline in the amount of insurance provided.
If the agents choice of p is given exogenously (i.e. does not vary with ∆), then concavity of the utility functions, u
and v, imply concavity of π (∆, µ; θ). Assumption A.3 ensures that this extends to the case when p is a choice and
can respond to θ.


                                                                  59

                                                  e)

    For simplicity, we consider a fixed θ and drop reference to it. Profits are given by

                   π (∆, µ) = q̂ (∆) (cee − Ce (µ − Ψ (q̂ (∆)))) + (1 − q̂ (∆)) (ceu − Cu (µ − ∆ − Ψ (q̂ (∆))))

    The goal is to show the Hessian of π is negative semi-definite. I proceed in three steps. First, I derive conditions
                  ∂2π                                                 ∂2π
which guarantee ∂∆  2 < 0. Second, I show that, in general, we have ∂µ2 < 0. Finally, I show the conditions provided
                   2
             ∂ π
to guarantee ∂∆ 2 < 0 also imply the determinant of the Hessian is positive, so that both eigenvalues of the Hessian
must be negative and thus the matrix is negative semi-definite.

                                          ∂2π
A.3.1         Conditions that imply       ∂∆2
                                                <0

Taking the first derivative with respect to ∆, we have
                         ∂π          ∂ q̂ e
                                =        (ce − ceu + Cu (µ − ∆ − Ψ (q̂ (∆))))

Taking another derivative with respect to ∆, applying the identity ∆ = Ψ0 (p̂ (∆)), and collecting terms yields

∂2π             h                                                                  2                    i

                                                                                                                                    

                 ∂∆2
We consider these three terms in turn. The first term is always negative because C 00 > 0. The second term,
            ∂ q̂
multiplying ∂∆   , can be shown to be positive if

                                    (1 + q̂ (∆)) C 0 (µ − ∆ − Ψ (q̂ (∆))) ≥ q̂ (∆) C 0 (µ − ∆)

which is necessarily true whenever
                                                                  u0 (ceu )
                                                                             ≤2
                                                                  v 0 (cee )
This inequality holds as long as people are willing to pay less than a 100% markup for a small amount of insurance,
evaluated at their endowment.
        Finally, the third term is positive as long as Ψ000 > 0. To see this, one can easily verify that the term multiplying
 ∂ 2 q̂                                            ∂ 2 q̂   −Ψ000                                    000
∂∆2
        is necessarily positive. Also, note that ∂∆     2 = (Ψ00 )2 . Therefore, if we assume that Ψ     > 0, the entire last term
                                                                         u0 (ce )                                     ∂2π
will necessarily be negative. In sum, it is sufficient to assume v0 cue ≤ 2 and Ψ000 > 0 to guarantee that ∂∆            2 < 0.
                                                                            ( e)

Fortunately, profits are easily seen to be concave in µ. We have
                            ∂π
                               = − (1 − q̂ (∆)) C 0 (µ − ∆ − Ψ (q̂ (∆))) − q̂ (∆) C 0 (µ − Ψ (q̂ (∆)))
                            ∂µ
so that

                           ∂µ2
which is negative because C 00 > 0.

Finally, we need to ensure that the determinant of the Hessian is positive. To do so, first note that

Therefore, the unsubstantiated assumption for the model is that the convexity of the effort function increases in

p, Ψ000 > 0. An alternative statement of this assumption is that ∂∆      2 < 0, so that the marginal impact of ∆ on
the employment probability is declining in the size of ∆. Put differently, it is an assumption that providing utility
incentives to work has diminishing returns.
    Future work can derive the necessary conditions when individuals can make additional actions, a (θ), in response
to unemployment. I suspect the proofs can be extended to such cases, but identifying the necessary conditions for
global concavity would be an interesting direction for future work.


B       Details of Empirical Approach
B.1     Details on Lower Bounds on Average Pooled Price Ratio

This section provides details on the estimation of the lower bounds on the average pooled price ratio. I begin by
providing theoretical motivation for the average pooled price ratio by showing it characterizes when an insurer can
earn positive profits if it enters with a particular random pricing strategy. Then, I provide conditions under which
the average pooled price defined by the predicted values provides a lower bound on the average pooled price ratio,
TZ ≤ E [T (P )].


B.1.1     Motivating the Average Pooled Price Ratio when Insurers don’t know P

To see the theoretical relevance of E [T (P )], suppose an insurer seeks to start an insurance market by randomly
drawing an individual from the population and, perhaps through some market research, learns exactly how much this
individual is willing to pay. The insurer offers a contract that collects $1 in the event of being employed and pays an
amount in the unemployed state that makes the individual perfectly indifferent to the policy. If p is the probability




                                                                         61
this individual will become unemployed, then all risks P ≥ p will choose to purchase the policy as well. The profit
per dollar of revenue will be
                                                          u0 (cu (p))
                                               r (p) = 0              − T (p)
                                                          v (ce (p))
So, if the original individual was selected at random from the population, the expected profit per dollar would be
positive if and only if                           0            
                                                   u (cu (p))
                                              E                   ≥ E [T (P )]
                                                   v 0 (ce (p))
If the insurer is randomly choosing contracts to try to sell, the average pooled price ratio, E [T (P )], provides
information on whether or not a UI market would be profitable.


B.1.2      Conditions under which TZ ≤ E [T (P )]

Here, I provide conditions under which TZ , defined in equation (15), provides a lower bound on the average pooled
price ratio, E [T (P )]. To begin, assume that (a) the elicitations, Z, have no more information about U than do
true beliefs, P . Stated formally: Pr {U |X, Z, P } = Pr {U |X, P }. Second, assume that beliefs are unbiased, so that
Pr {U |X, P } = P . Hendren (2013) shows that these two assumptions imply that E [m (PZ )] ≤ E [m (P )]. This
suggests that TZ ≤ 1 + E[m(PPr{U }
                                  )]
                                     . So, what remains to show is that 1 + E[m(P
                                                                               Pr{U }
                                                                                     )]
                                                                                        ≤ E [T (P )]. For this, we make
                                                  
                                          m(P )
one additional assumption that cov         P
                                                , P ≤ 0. This is a natural assumption because m (p) is, on average, a
decreasing function in p (because m (1) = 0), so dividing by P renders it an even more    strongly decreasing function
in P . Indeed, I have been unable to find a random variable P for which cov m(P  P
                                                                                    )

    Given these assumptions note that

                                                               

B.2       Specification for Point Estimation
I follow Hendren (2013) by assuming that Z = P + , where  has the following structure. With probability λ,
individuals report a noisy measure of their true belief P that is drawn from a [0, 1]-censored normal distribution with
mean P + α (X) and variance σ 2 . With this specification, α (X) reflects potential bias in elicitations and σ represents
the noise. While this allows for general measurement error in the elicitations, it does not produce the strong focal
point concentrations shown in Figure 1 and documented in existing work (Gan et al. (2005); Manski and Molinari
(2010)). To capture these, I assume that with probability 1 − λ individuals take their noisy report with the same bias
α (X) and variance σ 2 , but censor it into a focal point at 0, 50, or 100. If their elicitation would have been below κ,
they report zero. If it would have been between κ and 1 − κ, they report 50; and if it would have been above 1 − κ,




                                                                            62
they report 1. Hence, I estimate four elicitation error parameters: (σ, λ, κ, α (X)) that capture the patterns of noise
and bias in the relationship between true beliefs, P , and the elicitations reported on the surveys, Z.63
     Ideally, one would flexibly estimate the distribution of P given X at each possible value of X. This would enable
separate estimates of the minimum pooled price ratio for each value of X. However, the dimensionality of X prevents
this in practice. Instead,
                       R p I again follow Hendren (2013) and adopt an index assumption on the cumulative distribution
of beliefs, F (p|X) = 0 fP (p̃|X) dp̃,
                                               F (p|X) = F̃ (p| Pr {U |X})                                         (22)
where I assume F̃ (p|q) is continuous in q (where q ∈ {0, 1} corresponds to the level of Pr {U |X}). This assumes
that the distribution of private information is the same for two observable values, X and X 0 , that have the same
observable unemployment probability, Pr {U |X} = Pr {U |X 0 }. Although one could perform different dimension
reduction techniques, controlling for Pr {U |X} is particularly appealing because it nests the null hypothesis of no
private information (F (p|X) = 1 {p ≤ Pr {U |X}}).64
     A key difficulty with using functions to approximate the distribution of P is that much of the mass of the
distribution is near zero. Continuous probability distribution functions, such as the Beta distributions used in
Hendren (2013), require very high degrees for the shape parameters to acquire a good fit. Therefore, I approximate
P as a sum of discrete point-mass distributions.65 Formally, I assume

                                     F̃ (p|q) = w1 {p ≤ q − a} + (1 − w) Σi ξi 1 {p ≤ αi }

where αi are a set of point masses in [0, 1] and ξi is the mass on each point mass. I estimate these point mass
parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. For the baseline results, I use 3 mass points, which generally
provides a decent fit for the data. I then compute the pooled price ratio at each mass point and report the minimum
across all values aside from the largest mass point. Mechanically, this has a value of T (p) = 1. As noted in Hendren
(2013), estimation of the minimum T (p) across the full support of the type distribution is not feasible because of
an extremal quantile estimation problem. To keep the estimates “in-sample”, I report values for the mean value of
q = Pr {U } = 0.031; but estimates at other values of q are similarly large.

where φ denotes the standard normal p.d.f. and Φ the standard normal c.d.f. I estimate four elicitation error param-
eters: (σ, λ, κ, α (X)). σ captures the dispersion in the elicitation error, λ is the fraction of focal point respondents,
κ is the focal point window. I allow the elicitation bias term, α (X), to vary with the observable variables, X. This
allows elicitations to be biased, but maintains the assumption that true beliefs are unbiased.
   This approach builds upon Manski and Molinari (2010) by thinking of the focal point responses as “interval data”
(i.e. 50/50 corresponds to some region around 50%, but not exactly 50%). However, the present approach differs from
Manski and Molinari (2010) by allowing the response to be a noisy and potentially biased measure of this response
(as 50/50 corresponds to a region around 50% for the noisy Z measure, not the true P measure).

  64
    Moreover, it allows the statistical model to easily impose unbiased beliefs, so that Pr {U |X} = E [P |X] for all X.
  65
    This has the advantage that it does not require integrating over high degree of curvature in the likelihood function.
In practice, it will potentially under-state the true variance in P in finite sample estimation. As a result, it will tend to
produce lower values for T (p) than would be implied by continuous probability distributions for P since the discrete
approximation allows all individuals at a particular point mass to be able to perfectly pool together when attempting
to cover the pooled cost of worse risks.

   Now, consider the impact of unemployment on the first difference of consumption. Define ∆F D as the estimated
impact on the first difference in consumption:
                                    ∆F D = E [log (c) − log (c−1 ) |U = 1] − E [log (c) − log (c−1 ) |U = 0]
Adding and subtracting E [log (ce ) |U = 1] yields
∆F D = E [log (c) |U = 1]−E [log (ce ) |U = 1]+E [log (ce ) |U = 1]−E [log (c) |U = 0]−(E [log (c−1 ) |U = 1] − E [log (c−1 ) |U = 0])
Note that c = cu for those with Ut = 1 and c = ce for those with U = 0. The following three equations help expand
∆F D :
                                                                          dlog (cpre ) var (P )
                          E [log (c−1 ) |U = 1] − E [log (c−1 ) |U = 0] =
                                                                              dp       var (U )

                                                                                 64
and

    E [log (c) |U = 1] − E [log (ce ) |U = 0]                     =     E [log (cu ) |U = 1] − E [log (ce ) |U = 1]
                                                                                                    d [log (cu ) − log (ce )]
                                                                  =     E [log (cu ) − log (ce )] +                           (E [P |U = 1] − E [P ])
                                                                                                               dp
and

                       E [log (ce ) |U = 1] − E [log (c) |U = 0]                      =       E [log (ce ) |U = 1] − E [log (ce ) |U = 0]
                                                                                              dlog (ce ) var (P )
                                                                                      =

So, substituting these into ∆F D yields:

                                                                                              u0 (cu ) d [log (ce ) − log (cu )]

More generally, if the size of the consumption drop is increasing with p, then E [log (cu ) − log (ce )] > ∆IV .


C.2        Maximum Willingness to Pay
While the analysis to this point estimates the average causal effect of unemployment, Equation (8) requires comparing
the willingness to pay for all p to the pooled price ratio. Therefore, it is also useful to understand the heterogeneity in
the potential willingness to pay across the population. How much might some people be willing to pay for insurance?
    Estimating minima and maxima is always more difficult than estimating means; but this section attempts to
make a bit of progress to help shed light on this important question. Let ∆min denote the largest causal effect of
unemployment in the population,

                                                             ∆min = min [log (cu (p)) − log (ce (p))]                                                                     (23)
                                                                           p

Following equation (9), note that the willingness to pay satisfies
                                 u0 (cu ) − u0 (ce )     
                                                             min
                                                                      γ    min
                                                                                  
                                                     ≥ σ  −∆        1 +    −∆                                                                                             (24)
                                      u0 (ce )                          2

Therefore, ∆min generates a upper bound on the willingness to pay (note that ∆min < 0).
    This motivates the question: How big can the causal impact of unemployment be? To address this, note that
one can write the causal effect as the sum of two first differences:

                      log (cu (p)) − log (ce (p)) = log (cu (p)) − log (ct−1 (p)) − (log (ce (p)) − log (ct−1 (p)))

where the first term captures consumption change if unemployed and the second term is the consumption change
if employed. Let ∆maxe    = maxp {log (ce (p)) − log (ct−1 (p))} denote the maximum consumption change experienced
by those who did not lose their job. And, let ∆min     u     = minp {log (cu (p)) − log (ct−1 (p))} denote the minimum
consumption change experienced by those who lose their job. Note that we expect ∆max        e    > 0 and ∆min
                                                                                                           u   < 0. The
Euler equation ((6)) combined with the assumption of CRRA preferences implies that ct−1 lies between cu (p) and
ce (p), ct−1 (p) ∈ [cu (p) , ce (p)] for all p. Under this natural assumption, the causal impact of unemployment is
bounded below by the difference between these drops:

                                                                        ∆min ≥ ∆min
                                                                                u   − ∆max
                                                                                       e

Therefore, one can bound the causal effect of unemployment on consumption by the largest consumption drop
minus the smallest consumption increase. The question now becomes: how large can the consumption drop upon


                                                                                      65
unemployment be, ∆min    u    ? And, how large can the consumption increase upon learning that you didn’t lose your job
be, ∆max
       e   ?
     If one observed consumption directly, one could estimate the full distribution of first differences in consumption
for those who become unemployed, log (cu (p)) − log (ct−1 (p)), and remain employed, log (ce (p)) − log (ct−1 (p)).
Then, one could in principle find ∆min    u   and ∆max
                                                     e    directly from the data.
     However, consumption data in the PSID and other datasets is quite noisy in practice (see for example Zeldes
(1989); Meghir and Pistaferri (2011)).66 Therefore, I proceed as follows. Note that the Euler equation implies that
ct−1 (p) ∈ [cu (p) , ce (p)] for all p. In particular, this implies that the log consumption change should always drop for
those who lose their job, ct−1 (p) ≥ cu (p). Therefore, I use the extent to which one observes consumption increases
for those who become unemployed to provide information about how the consumption change distribution and its
minimum, ∆min u   , is affected by measurement error.
     I begin by removing systematic variation in consumption changes due to life cycle and year effects. In particular,
I regress the consumption change on the observables, X, in Equation (4) (an age cubic and year dummies) and let
∆∗it denote the residuals.67 Online Appendix Figure VI plots the distributions of ∆∗it for those with Uit = 1 and
Uit = 0. As one can see, the wide dispersion is suggestive of considerable measurement error, as noted in previous
literature.
     Let Q (α, U ) denote the α−quantile of the distribution of ∆∗it as a function of unemployment status, Ut . Appendix
Table II reports that 41.7% of the sample who become unemployed have ∆∗it > 0 (i.e. Q (58.3, 1) = 0), even after
controlling for age and year effects. Because the Euler equation suggests consumption changes should not be positive,
it suggests the excess dispersion is the result of measurement error. The key assumption I impose is that the impact
of measurement error is symmetric across the distribution of consumption changes. In particular, I assume that the
probability that the observed consumption change lies above the maximum plausible consumption change of 0 is less
than or equal to the probability that the observed        consumption change is below the minimum actual consumption
change, Pr ∆∗it ≤ ∆min   u   |Uit = 1 ≥ Pr {∆∗it ≥ 0|Uit = 1}, where Pr {∆∗it ≥ 0|Uit = 1} = 41.7%. Appendix Figure V
shows that the observed distribution of consumption changes is fairly symmetric, which would be consistent with the
underlying assumptions needed for Equation (25) to hold.68 With this assumption,

                                          ∆min
                                           u   ≥ Q (Pr {∆∗it ≥ 0|Uit = 1} , 1)                                       (25)

Because Pr {∆∗it ≥ 0|Uit = 1} = 41.7%, one can bound the consumption drop by the 41.7th quantile of the observed
consumption drop distribution. This equals −13.7%, as shown in Appendix Table II.
    Similarly, one can impose an analogous assumption on the distribution of consumption changes for the employed
that the observed fraction of the population that experiences a consumption decline when remaining employed is less
than or equal to the fraction who experience a consumption increase that is above ∆max e   , Pr {∆∗it ≤ 0|Uit = 0} =
Pr {∆∗it ≥ ∆max
            e    |U it = 0}. Under this assumption,

                                          ∆max
                                           e   ≤ Q (Pr {∆∗it ≤ |Uit = 0} , 0)                                        (26)

Appendix Table II shows this maximal consumption increase equals 0.5%. Combining equations (25) and (26) yields
the lower bound on the causal impact of unemployment on consumption:

                           ∆min ≥ Q (Pr {∆∗it ≥ 0|Uit = 1} , 1) − Q (Pr {∆∗it ≤ |Uit = 0} , 0)

where the right hand side equals −13.7% − 0.5% = 14.2% (s.e. 1.1%), as reported in Table V, Column (7). Therefore,
the maximum causal impact on food expenditure is 14.2%, or roughly twice as large as the mean consumption drop.
The lower rows in Table V scale this estimate by various values of risk aversion. With a conservative estimate of 3,
it suggests the maximum markup individuals would be willing to pay is 54.7%.
   66
      This “left-hand-side” measurement error was necessarily not a problem for estimating the mean consumption
impact of unemployment (assuming the error is classical). But, for estimating properties of the distribution of
consumption changes such as minima and maxima, this measurement error becomes a significant limitation.
   67
      This residualization can be formalized by assuming there are known time and year preference shocks affecting
the marginal utility of consumption that are common across individuals. Note the residuals now satisfy the ex-ante
Euler equation, E [∆∗it ] = 0. But, the means of the residuals will differ for those who do and do not experience
unemployment, E [∆∗it |Uit = 1] ≤ 0 and E [∆∗it |Uit = 0] ≥ 0.
   68
      While the symmetry assumption is not directly testable, it can be micro-founded from many common assump-
tions on measurement error distributions. For example, if the true distribution of consumption changes is symmet-
ric and the distribution of measurement error is symmetric and unbiased, then it is straightforward to show that
Pr ∆∗it ≤ ∆min u  |Uit = 1 ≥ Pr {∆∗it ≥ x|Uit = 1}, where x ≤ 0 is the maximum consumption change for those who
become unemployed. Symmetric and median-unbiasedness is a common assumption measurement error models (see,
e.g., Bollinger (1998); Hu and Schennach (2008)).

C.4      Ex-ante labor supply derivation
This section illustrates how to use the spousal labor supply response, combined with known estimates of the spousal
labor response to labor earnings, to estimate the ex-ante willingness to pay for UI.
     To begin, one needs a model of extensive margin labor supply response. I assume spousal labor force participation
generates income, y, but has an additively separable effort cost, η (θ). I assume a spouse labor supply decision,
l ∈ {0, 1}, is a binary decision and is contained in the set of other actions, a. Formally, let utility be given by

                             v (cpre ) + pu (cu ) + (1 − p) v (ce ) + 1 {l = 1} η (θ) + Ψ̃i (1 − p, ã, θ)

where η (θ) is the disutility of labor for type θ, distributed Fη in the population.
    Let k (y, l, p) denote the utility value to a type p of choosing l to obtain income y when they face an unemployment
probability of p. The labor supply decision is

                                                       k (y, 1, p) − k (0, 0, p) ≥ η (θ)

so that types will choose to work if and only if it increases their utility. This defines a threshold rule whereby
individuals choose to work if and only if η (θ) ≤ η̄ (y, p) and the labor force participation rate is given by Φ (y, p) =
F (η̄ (y, p)).
     Now, note that                                                                         
                                     dΦ          ∂ η̄            ∂k (y, 1, p)   ∂k (0, 0, p)

and making an approximation that the impact of the income y does not discretely change the instantaneous marginal
utilities (i.e. because it will be smoothed out over the lifetime or because the income is small), we have

                                                               dΦ         ∂2k
                                                                  ≈ f (η̄) 2 y

Finally, note that   ∂k
                     ∂y
                          = v 0 (cpre (p)) is the marginal utility of income. So,

                                                       dΦ          d  0          

                                                                        67
and integrating across all the types p yields

so that the ratio of the labor supply response to p divided by the semi-elasticity of labor supply with respect to wages
reveals the average elasticity of the marginal utility function. Assuming this elasticity is roughly constant and noting

Now, how does one estimate dΦdp
                                ? Regressing labor force participation, l, on Z will generate an attenuated coefficient
because of measurement error in Z. If the measurement error is classical, one can inflate this by the ratio of the
variance of Z to the variance of P , or

Note: This table presents estimates from regressions of the elicitation, Z, on unemployment measured in both (a) the subsequent 12 months and (b) the subsequent 12-24 months. The first row corresponds to the
first stage for the ex-post welfare measure; the final row ("Difference") corresponds to the first stage for the ex-ante welfare measure. Column (1) uses the baseline HRS sample. Columns (2)-(7) explore the
heterogeneity in the estimates by subgroup. Columns (2)-(3) restrict the sample to males and females.Columns (4)-(5) restrict the sample to those above and below age 55. Columns (6)-(7) restrict the sample to
before and after 1997. Standard errors are computed using 500 bootstrap repetitions resampling at the household level.

values, Pr{U|X,Z}, using a linear model instead of a probit specification. Columns (3)-(5) consider alternative aggregation windows for translating the distribution of predicted values into estimates of E[mZ(PZ)].
While Column (1) constructs mZ(PZ) using the predicted values within age-by-gender groups, Column (3) aggregates the predicted values across the entire sample. Column (4) uses a finer partition, aggregating
within age-by-gender-by-industry groups. Column (5) aggregates within age-by-gender-by-occupation groups. Columns (6)-(7) consider alternative specifications for the subjective probability elicitations. Column
(6) uses only a linear specification in Z combined with focal point indicators at Z=0, Z=50, and Z=100, as opposed to the baseline specification that also includes a polynomial in Z. Column (7) adds a third and
fourth order polynomial in Z to the baseline specification. Columns (8)-(10) consider alternative outcome definitions for U. Column (8) defines unemployment, U, as an indicator for involuntary job loss at any
point in between survey waves (24 months). Column (9) defines unemployment as an indicator for job loss in between survey waves excluding the first six months after the survey (i.e. 6-24 months). Finally,
Column (10) defines unemployment as an indicator for job loss in the 6-12 months after the survey wave.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the distribution of private information about unemployment risk, P. Column (1) reports the baseline specification. Columns (2) uses
only demographic controls; Column (3) uses demographic, job characteristics, and health characteristics. Columns (4)-(9) report results for the baseline specification on
various subsamples including below and above age 55 (Columns 4 and 5), above and below-median wage earners (Columns 6 and 7) and above and below 5 years of job
tenure. The F(p) estimates report the location and mass given to each point mass, evaluated at the mean q=Pr{U=1}=0.031. For example, in the baseline specification, the
results estimate a point mass at 0.001, 0.031, and 0.641 with weights 0.446, 0.471 and 0.082. The values of T(p) represent the markup that individuals at this location in the
distribution would have to be willing to pay to cover the pooled cost of worse risks. All parameter estimates are constructed using maximum likelihood. Because of the non-
convexity of the optimization program, I assess the robustness to 1000 initial starting values. All standard errors are constructed using bootstrap re-sampling using 1000 re-
samples at the household level.

Notes: This figure presents the estimated coefficients of a regression of the elicitations (elicited in year t) on unemployment
indicators in year t + j for j = 1, .., 8. To construct the unemployment indicators for each year t + j, I construct an indicator
for involuntary job loss in any survey wave (occurring every 2 years). I then use the data on when the job loss occurred to
assign the job loss to either the first or second year in between the survey waves. Because of the survey design, this definition
potentially misses some instances of involuntary separation that occur in back-to-back years in between survey waves. To the
extent to which such transitions occur, the even-numbered years in the Figure are measured with greater measurement error.
The figure presents estimated 5/95% confidence intervals using standard errors clustered at the household level.

Notes: This figure presents the estimated coefficients of a regression of leads and lags of log household consumption expenditure
on an indicator for unemployment. The figure replicates the sample and specification in Figure IV (Panel B) by replacing
the dependent variable with log total consumption expenditure on a sample beginning in 1999, surveyed every two years. I
restrict the sample to household heads who are employed in t − 2 or t − 4. Following the baseline specification, the sample is
restricted to observations with less than a threefold change in consumption expenditures. Note that after 1999, the PSID asks
a broader set of consumption questions but is conducted only every two years, which prevents analyzing total 1-year interval
responses to unemployment.

Notes: This figure re-constructs the analysis in Figure IV using job loss instead of unemployment. I define job loss as an
indicator for being laid off or fired from the job held in the previous wave of the survey. The figure present coefficients from
separate regressions of leads and lags of the log change in food expenditure on an indicator of job loss, along with controls for
year indicators and a cubic in age. Sample is restricted to household heads who are employed in years t − 1 and t − 2.

Notes: This figure illustrates the no trade condition using the marginal and average cost curves as in Einav, Finkelstein and
Cullen (2010). Panel A presents an illustrative example for the demand for a contract that pays $1 in the event of becoming

                                                                                                                                       .
Under a standard single crossing condition, all types P ≥ p would also purchase the insurance policy (see text for discussion
of multi-dimensional heterogeneity). Therefore, the cost to the insurer of the contract is given by the average likelihood that
the payment is made, E [P |P ≥ p] relative to the likelihood the payment is received, 1 − E [P |P ≥ p], 1−E[P

                      to illustrate the empirical approach that compares the pooled price ratio, T (p) =               p 1−E[P |P ≥p]

lies below the pooled price ratio, as depicted in Panels A and B.

Notes: This figure plots histograms of ∆∗it for those who are employed, Uit = 0, and unemployed, Uit = 1. ∆∗it is defined as
the residual from a regression of log (cit ) − log (cit−1 ) on an age cubic and year dummies, X. I restrict the sample to household
heads who are employed in t − 1 and t − 2. Following the baseline specification, the sample is restricted to observations with
less than a threefold change in consumption expenditures.
