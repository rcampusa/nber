                                             ABSTRACT




This paper attempts to disentangle the direct effects of experience from those of culture in
determining fertility. We use the GSS to examine the fertility of women born in the US but from
different ethnic backgrounds. We take lagged values of the total fertility rate in the woman's country
of ancestry as the cultural proxy and use the woman's number of siblings to capture her direct family
experience. We find that both variables are significant determinants of fertility, even after controlling
for several individual and family-level characteristics.

1. Introduction

A woman’s fertility is influenced by a large number of factors: her education, her wealth and
income, where she lives, who she marries, etc., and, of course, her preferences over family size.
The latter, as shown in Fernández and Fogli (2005), have a systematic component that depends
upon the woman’s heritage (i.e., her parents’ country of origin). In that paper, we argued that
a woman’s heritage influences her work and fertility outcomes because diﬀerent countries possess
diﬀerent norms and beliefs—i.e., diﬀerent cultures—about the appropriate role for women in society,
including how much (or whether) they should work when married and what is an ideal family size.
These preferences and beliefs are transmitted by the family and hence where a woman’s parents
were born matters even if women share the same markets and institutions. We showed that, even
after controlling for various characteristics of a woman, there is a quantitatively important eﬀect
of culture on a woman’s work and fertility outcomes.                  Using past values of female labor force
participation and total fertility rate (TFR) in the parents’ country of origin to proxy for culture
in the case of work and fertility, respectively, we showed that these variables enter positively and
statistically significantly in explaining a woman’s work and fertility outcomes in the US.1
        An important question is whether our cultural variables are truly capturing the beliefs or
norms in the country of heritage or whether they are instead proxying for direct personal experi-
ence. It could be argued, for example, that how much a woman’s mother worked or the number
of siblings a woman grew up with are what determines a woman’s preferences in these areas, i.e.,
that culture is really simply personal experience that is intergenerationally transmitted (rather
than also including, say, a component that is more akin to beliefs).                    Personal experience may
diﬀer from cultural beliefs (as transmitted by parents and perhaps neighborhood) for a variety of
reasons. There may be various shocks that aﬀect an individual’s work experience or fertility, but
that do not reflect that person’s beliefs about woman’s role nor about ideal family size. In this
paper we wish to explore whether, once a woman’s own family experience has been taken into
account, culture still plays a role in determining fertility outcomes.2

that point to country of origin mattering to fertility of immigrants.
   2
     Fernández, Fogli, and Olivetti (2004) show that whether a man’s mother works is a quantitative and statistically
significant factor that helps explain whether his own wife works, even after controlling for many of his characteristics
and those of his wife.    That paper establishes, therefore, that "personal experience" matters.        We argue that
increased numbers of this new type of man (a man with a working mother) made it more attractive for women to
invest in market skills and to work when married either because this type of man constituted a better partner for


                                                           1
     We use the General Social Survey (GSS) to study the fertility outcomes of US-born women
as a function of their age, education, and various characteristics of their husbands. We use the
number of siblings a woman has to reflect her own family experience and take lagged values of
TFR in her country of ancestry to proxy for her culture. We find that both personal experience
and culture matter to a woman’s fertility. In particular, culture remains a statistically significant
determinant of a woman’s fertility even after controlling for her number of siblings. The eﬀect
of culture is quantitatively important.           We find that a standard deviation increase in TFR is
associated with an increase of 0.14 children, which is 50% of the variation in the number of
children observed across ancestries in the US.


2. Data Sets, Variables, and Sample Selection

Our strategy here is similar to that in Fernández and Fogli (2005).                   In order to keep constant
markets and institutions, we study the fertility outcomes of women who were born in and reside
in the US, but who have diﬀerent heritages (and hence presumably diﬀerent cultures). As noted
previously, we use the number of siblings a woman has to reflect her own family experience and
TFR in her country of ancestry to proxy for her culture.3
     To obtain our sample, we used the General Social Survey (GSS) which, in addition to pro-
viding data on the fertility behavior and ethnic origins of a respondent, also has information on
a number of background characteristics including the number of siblings.4 Although the census
would allow a larger sample size, it only provides information on the number of the individual’s
own siblings living in the household with the respondent. This is far too restrictive a definition
as most individuals do not live with their siblings. We should note, however, that the definition
of sibling in the GSS is not ideal as it includes stepbrothers and stepsisters.5
a married working woman, or because this type of man was more interested in marrying a woman who, like his
mother, worked outside the household.
  3
    The TFR is the average number of children a hypothetical cohort of women, from the ages of 15 to 49, would
have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a
given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as number of children per woman.
   4
     The GSS is a series of cross sections that have been collected annually since 1972 (except for a few years) by
the National Opinion Research Center. Each cross section contains about 1,500 observations, and respondents are
asked about their demographic background, political and social attitudes, and labor market outcomes.           Davis,
Smith and Marsden (1999) describe the content and the sampling frame of the GSS.
  5
    SIBS is the answer to the following question: "How many brothers and sisters did you have? Please count those
born alive, but no longer living, as well as those alive now. Also include stepbrothers and stepsisters, and children



                                                          2
     Although the GSS does not provide direct information on the country of birth of a respon-
dent’s parents, it asks “From what countries or part of the world did your ancestors come?” We
use the answer to this question to determine a woman’s ancestry, though unfortunately we cannot
distinguish second-generation Americans from those who have been in the US for longer.                       To
obtain a sizeable sample, we use observations from the years 1977, 1978, 1980, and from 1982 to
1987.6
     We construct our sample by including all married women of foreign ancestry born in the US
and between 29 and 50 years of age.7 Note that these women’s parents must have been in the US
by 1927-1958, depending on the age of the woman and the survey year. Thus, on the one hand, it
could be argued that TFR around 1930-1940 or even a decade or two earlier would best reflect the
culture of the country of ancestry (though a large proportion of women must come from families
who were in the US for several generations). On the other hand, one could argue that the values
that parents and society transmit are best reflected in the behavior of the counterparts of these
women in the country of ancestry in the early 80s. Data limitations, in any case, do not permit
us to use years prior to 1950. Consequently, we choose TFR in 1950 in the country of ancestry
as our benchmark cultural proxies but also explore 1960 and 1970 values as well.8
     We conclude our selection by eliminating from our sample all women whose fathers were
born in countries that became centrally planned economies around World War II.9 The rationale
for doing this is that the parents of most women in our sample must have been in the US by
1940. Hence, these parents did not live through the profound transformations in the economies,
institutions, and cultures that these countries experienced, and using data from the 1950s and
later would thus not capture the correct culture for these individuals.               We keep Russia in the
sample, however, since the revolution was in 1917 and the parents may have been there for a
substantial length of time thereafter. We are left with 1177 observations. Lastly, solely in order
to be able to make meaningful comparisons across averages of women by country of ancestry, we
adopted by your parents".
   6
     1977 is the first year in which people were asked where they were born.
   7
      It should be noted that most individuals claim foreign ancestry: only approximately 8% of the sample (those
in the categories of "American Indians" and "Americans") were eliminated by restricting the sample to women with
foreign ancestry. We also exclude those individuals who gave answers that did not allow a country of ancestry to
be assigned (e.g., "Africa").
   8
     Cross-country data for 1950 TFR from the United Nations Demographic Yearbook.
   9
     We eliminated Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and Lithuania.




                                                       3
also eliminated countries with fewer than 10 observations.10                 Our final sample consists of 1145
women from 14 countries of ancestry: Canada, Denmark, UK, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain and Sweden.
        The summary statistics for the sample are presented in Table 1. The women in our sample
are on average 38.3 years old, have 2.3 children, and 3.6 siblings. They and their husbands have
on average 13 years of school and their parents around 10-11 years.
        In Table 2 we report the summary statistics at the country level. The TFR in 1950 shows
large variation across countries: from 6.9 children in Mexico to 2.2 in Germany.                     The average
across countries is 3.0 with a standard deviation of 1.2. There is also a large dispersion in the
number of siblings women have: from 7.3 in Mexico to 2.5 in Sweden with an average across
countries of 3.8 and a standard deviation of 1.2. The correlation between the number of siblings
and the 1950 TFR is high (0.83). The number of children women have across ancestries in our
sample does not vary as much: Mexican women again have the highest number of children (2.95)
and French and Italian women the lowest (2.15).                 The average across countries is 2.46 with a
standard deviation of 0.28.


3. Analysis and Results

We estimate the following model:
                                              0
                              Zisjt = β 0 + β 1 Xi + β 2 Yei + β 2 Z
                                                                   ej + fs + γ t + εisjt ,                    (3.1)

where Zisjt is the number of children born to woman i, who resides in region s, is of ancestry j,
and is interviewed in year t.11 In Xi we include a set of individual characteristics which varies
with the specification considered, fs is a full set of dummies for the region of residence and γ t
is the year of survey fixed eﬀect. Our variables of interest are Yei , the number of siblings woman
                  ej , which is the cultural proxy (TFR 1950), assigned by ancestry. Since this
i has (SIBS), and Z
key variable on the right-hand side only varies by country of ancestry, all the standard errors we
report are corrected for clustering at the country-of-ancestry level.
        Tables 3a and 3b present our main results. The regressions all include a full set of dummies
for the woman’s region of residence and year-of-interview fixed eﬀects. The first column reports
  10
       Austria, Greece, Japan, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Portugal, and Belgium. Since our regressions are all run at
the individual level, including these small numbers of observations does not aﬀect our results.
  11
     The regional variable includes the following 9 categories: New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central,
West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and Pacific.

the results from regressing the number of children born to individual i on the cultural proxy for
fertility–TFR in 1950 assigned by country of ancestry. The coeﬃcient on the cultural variable
is positive and significant, indicating that women whose parents were born in countries where
women had more children, tend to have more children themselves.                    In the second column, the
number of siblings is substituted for the cultural proxy. The coeﬃcient on this variable is also
positive and significant, indicating that women from larger families tend to have more children.
Introducing both variables in the regression in column (iii), we find both positive and statistically
significant. Their magnitudes are somewhat smaller, indicating that there is a positive correlation
between the two explanatory variables.12
       There may be many reasons for the positive partial correlations above that have little to
do with culture and family experience.             In particular, our cultural proxy may be picking up
characteristics of the women’s parents that vary systematically across country of origin and aﬀect a
woman’s human capital accumulation decision and, through that, her fertility behavior. Similarly,
the number of siblings a woman has may not just be picking up the eﬀect of one’s own family
experience in the process of preference formation about the ideal family size, but is likely to be
correlated with a number of background factors which systematically diﬀer across families and
influence a woman’s education acquisition.
       Since we do not have enough background information about these women to directly rule out
the possibility that our results are driven by systematic diﬀerences across families, we choose to
control directly for a woman’s level of education (an endogenous variable). By doing so, we are
left with only the direct eﬀect of culture and family experience on fertility.
       The regression results from including a set of individual characteristics, in particular the
woman’s age, her age squared, and a set of dummy variables to capture her level of education
(below high school [omitted], high school degree [High School], some college [Some College], and at
least a college degree [College +]), are reported in columns (iv) through (vi). As expected, more
educated women tend to have fewer children. The direct eﬀects of culture and family experience
remain positive and statistically significant, albeit both somewhat smaller in magnitude (especially
the coeﬃcient on SIBS), indicating that a woman’s education tends to be negatively correlated
with the TFR in her country of ancestry and her total number of siblings.
       As a woman’s fertility is likely to be influenced not only by her education but also by other
family characteristics (e.g. wealth) and unobserved human capital, the last three columns of Table
 12
      The correlation between SIBS and 1950 TFR at the individual level is 0.25.



                                                         5
3a report the results of including her mother’s and father’s levels of education to proxy for these.
Interestingly, both variables are significant but of opposite signs: the father’s education is positive
whereas the mother’s has a negative eﬀect. One possible explanation for this is that the father’s
education is picking up family wealth whereas the mother’s education is likely to be correlated
with whether she worked or not (greater education is associated with a higher probability of work)
which may then also influence the probability that her daughter works and her fertility choices.
In all cases, both culture and family experience remain positive and significant.
        To assess the quantitative impact of culture and family experience, note that a one standard
deviation increase in 1950 TFR is associated with a 0.14 increase in the number of children,
whereas a one standard deviation increase in the number of siblings is associated with a 0.05
increase in children.       As the standard deviation in the number of children across ethnicities is
0.28, the diﬀerences across culture and family experience is accounting for a significant proportion
of the variation across ethnicities.
        Table 3b explores how the inclusion of the characteristics of a woman’s husband aﬀects
our analysis. The first three columns present the results for a specification which includes the
woman’s characteristics and those of her husband’s, namely, his age (and its square), education
(in years), and total income (in units of $10,000). In the case of the last variable, as the GSS
does not report the income of the spouse but only that of the respondent and the family, we con-
struct the husband’s income by subtracting the woman’s income from the family’s total income.13
This variable unfortunately does not appear to be measured very well as it is insignificant in all
specifications, whereas we know from our prior analysis using the 1970 US Census that husband’s
income enters positively and significantly in fertility analysis.14            Husband’s education, on the
other hand, enters negative and significant.
        As can be seen in the table, culture and family experience both appear to play a quantita-
tively important role even after controlling for the husband’s characteristics (though once parental
education is entered, siblings are no longer significant): an increase of one standard deviation in
  13
       Family income is total family income, from all sources in the previous year and before taxes. Respondent’s
income is labor earnings in the previous year before taxes and other deductions. Family and respondent’s incomes
on 1972-1993 surveys are in constant dollars (base = 1986). These variables are based on categorical midpoints and
imputations. For details see GSS Methodological Report No. 64. Since most of the women that declare themselves
housewives, students or unemployed have missing income, and omitting them would bias our results, we recode
these missing values with zero.
  14
     See Fernández and Fogli (2005).



                                                         6
1950 TFR is associated with an increase of 0.13 children, which is about 46% of the variation in
number of children observed across ancestries.                 Similarly, an increase in SIBS of one standard
deviation is associated with an increase of 0.06 children, which is about 21% of the same variation.
        Overall, our results suggest that a woman’s cultural heritage, as well as her own personal
family experience, are distinct and quantitatively important factors in determining a woman’s
fertility decisions.


4. Robustness

The results we just described are robust to various changes in sample criteria and to the use of
alternative cultural proxies. In particular, they are not driven by certain countries having large
numbers of observations: we find similar results when exclude Germany or UK. We also find
similar results when we use the 1960 level of TFR as our cultural proxy, which is not surprising
since the correlation across countries between TFR in the 50s and 60s is around 0.96.                 Lastly,
we also changed the sample by using a diﬀerent decade.                  We repeated our analysis for women
between the age of 29 and 50 in the years 1988-98 and obtained similar results.


5. Conclusion

Although economists have long stressed the importance of incentives for human behavior, it is only
recently that there has been rigorous work showing that incentives operate within a framework
given not only by markets, but also by institutions and, as a small but growing literature aims to
show, by culture (or norms and beliefs).15 In this paper we aim to contribute to this literature
by demonstrating that it is not only personal experience (as reflected in the number of siblings
a woman has) that matters to a woman’s fertility, but also that her culture (as embodied in the
TFR in her country of ancestry) plays a role. Using several years of the GSS, we find that even
after controlling for various characteristics and family background of a woman, both her own
personal experience and her culture play a role in influencing her fertility.
