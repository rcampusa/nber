                   Taxation and On—the—Job Training Decisions



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper is an econometric analysis of the on—the—job training (OJT)

decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The data are

obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which asked a very careful

series of questions concerning the individual's OJT status. Each individual's

internal rate of return is estimated and used as an explanatory variable

to predict the probability of taking OJT. The individual's marginal tax

rate is also entered in the equation. The results suggest that income

taxation has tended to increase the probability of being involved in OJT.

I conjecture that this is because income taxation makes investment in physical

capital a less desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future,

and hence increases the attractiveness of human capital.

I.    Introduction

      The rich econometric literature on the impact of taxes upon hours of

work has provided important results for students of tax policy. There is,

however, a tendency to neglect the possibility that taxation may also affect

other dimensions of labor supply. The purpose of this paper is to estimate

the effect of income taxation on the decision to engage in one significant

kind of human capital investment, on-the-job training (OJT). I study the

OJT decisions of a group of white American males during 1975. The results

suggest that income taxes have tended to increase the number engaging in OJT.

      Section II discusses some conceptual problems that arise in an attempt

to study econometrically taxes and OJT decisions. A simple theoretical and

econometric framework for analysis is presented in Section III. The data are

described in Section IV, and the results and their implications are laid out

in Section V. A concluding section contains some caveats and suggestions for

future research.


II. Background

      Mincer [1974], Heckman [1976] and Blinder and Weiss [19761, among others,

have provided careful theoretical discussions of the determinants of OJT

decisions. The models differ to varying degrees, but they hold in common a

view of OJT as an investment, the amount of which is sensitive to its rate

of return. The econometric literature on the determinants of OJT i quite

thin. Although OJT sometimes appears as an explanatory variable in wage

q(nerat1ny cquations (Duncan   and   Hoffman [19791) ,   not   much has- been done to


 explain   OJT itself.1

 1.   An exception   is the study of Duncan and Hoffman [1978], which is dis-
 cussed below.

     P'   lii; t he major reason for   lie   dea rLIi   of a Ltempts Lo   ly 01

econometrically is measurement problems. Unlike education, one cannot ask

a simple question to discover how mi'eh of it a. person has accumulated.2 I

attempt to deal with this problem by taking advantage of a special set of

questions asked in the ninth wave of A Panel Study of Income Dynamics (Survey

Research Center, 1976) corresponding to the year 1975:

     1. "On a job like yours, how long [in months] would it take the

            average 'iew person to become fully qualified?"

     2.    "How long [in months] have you held your present position?"

If the answer to the second question is less than or equal to that of the

first, then the individual is classified as being in OJT, and otherwise,

not. On this basis, about 30% of the sample were engaged in OJT.

     Do these questions lead to an adequate depiction of the individual's

current OJT status? Duncan and Hoffman [1978,] discuss this issue at length,

but a few remarks seem appropriate here. One can certainly imagine situa-

tions in which the Panel Study responses will produce misleading inferences.

For example, while those observed not to be in OJT at a point in time might

be past the time of any further investment, they might also be on the verge

of taking new jobs which will involve more OJT. Unfortunately, given the

absence of similar questions on OJT for subsequent years, it is impossible




2.   Of course, even for education the measurement issue is not straightforward,
because one knows neither the consum})tion componon L oft ime sponL al ;c1ioo1,
                                                                                nor
its "quality."

3.   Individuals who claim that they are        never    fully trained for their jobs are
classified as being in OJT.
to determine the likelihood of such classification errors.4

       Another problem with the questions is that they tell us nothing about

the intensity with which individual.; undertake OJT. It is quite possible,

for example, that even those who claim to be doing no OJT are actually de-

voting some fraction of their potential earnings to human capital forma-

tion, albeit a very small one. It may be useful, then, to think of the

dichotomous       variable derived from the Panel Study questions as telling us
                                                                                                                  5
whether or not the individual devotes a "substantial" amount of time to OJT.

       Finally, one should note that for purposes of this paper, it is un—

necessary to interpret the answer to question 1 as an exact value of the

length of the OJT period. All that is required is information on whether

the training period is longer than the individual's tenure, so that the OJT

classificatiOn can           be   made.

       It is clear, then, that the survey questions do not provide a perfect

indicator of an individual's OJT status. I think, however, that it is a

significant improvement over other measures available for a representative

samrle of individuals, and is worth exploiting.

were similar to those who were classified as being in OJT. There was no indica-
tion that the job changers had the same characteristics as those who were
classified as taking OJT.
5.   It is often the case that the value of a dichotomous variable indicates
that the individual is pursuing more than some threshhold amount of an activity,as
opposed to a zero amount. For example, many individuals report that they give
"no" charitable contributions, when, in fact they give small positive amounts.
See Boskin and Feldstein [1975].
assumptions on the nature of the prcess that generated the profile.6 In

this paper, I adopt one of Mincer's Ll974] formulations, the advantages and

disadvantages of which are discussed in the next section.

      The complications brought about by introducing taxes into this situation

can be illustrated by a simple two-period model of lifetime utility maximiza-

tion. Eaton and Rosen (1980] have shown that even in such a simple model, the

direction of the impact of an income tax upon human capital accumu].ation is

ambiguous. Intuitively, because the tax influences the utilization rate of

OJT, i.e., hours of work, it changes the rate of return to OIJT. Due to the

familiar conflict of income and substitution effects, however, the effect of

an income tax upon hours of work is itself ambiguous, and therefore so is the

impact upon human capital accumulation. The unearned income component of the

income tax introduces an additional effect. By making physical capital a less

desirable vehicle for carrying consumption into the future, it increases the

attractiveness of human capital investment, ceturis paribus.7

      Even in a very simple model, then, the impact of taxes upon the OJT

decision cannot be known a priori. The framework of this paper allows the

data to determine the effect.


III. Framework

beginning of his working life, an individual decides whether or not to put

Although the OJT decision is made i a lifetime context, the Panel Study
questions give us only a snapshot ol each   individual   in   the   year 1975.

If the answer to the Panel Study qustion indicates that the individual

is involved' in OJT during 1975, it is assumed that he is in the midst

of a spell of OJT, and that his wage can be explained by the human capi-

tal wage generating model described below. The wages of individuals who

are not in OJT are assumed to be governed by the same type of process, but

it is expected that their age-wage profiles are much flatter. Such individuals

may be past the time in which they invested substantially in OJT, or they may

have chosen career paths which never included it at all.8

     All models of optimal human capital accumulation imply that a key variable

driving an individual's OJT decision is its internal rate of return. This

suggests the following two—step procedure for investigating OJT decisions:       (1)


Estimate for each individual in the sample the internal rate of return to OJT.

(2) Estimate the responsiveness of the probability of taking OJT to the rate of

return and the individual's tax situation. These issues are now discussed in turn.


A.   The Internal Rate of Return to OJT

     As stressed above, the internal rate of return cannot be directly observed.

It can be inferred from age-wage profiles, and such inference requires that an

explicit wage generating model be specified. Mincer's [1974] formulation is

tractable, yields interesting results, and has been employed in a wide variety

of contexts. Under certain conditions, the     th individual's wage rate (w.)

is related to his years of education (ED.) and job experience (EXP.) by the

relation



8.   As noted above, we are unable to account for the possibility that some of
those not in OJT happen to be caught in the period after the completion of some
training and before the beginning of additional training.
(3.1)     nw. = 2nw0 + rED, + pk0EXP, — pk0EXP + 2,nU—k+ k0 EXP.)


where    w   is the potential wage in lie absence of human capital invest-

ments, r5 is the rate of return to education, k        is the initial pro-

portion of potential wages devoted to OJT, T is the number of years

over which OJT takes place, and p is the increment to potential earn-

ings each period that follows from a $1 increase in expenditure (in terms

of foregone earnings) on OJT.

        The wage function (3.1) is derived on the basis of a number of quite

restrictive assumptions. For example, the proportion of potential earnings

devoted to OJT is assumed to decline linearly with time, rather than determined

by choice theoretic considerations)0 Unfortunately, attempts to add more

"realistic" assumptions to the human capital generating story have lead to non-

linear specifications that are barely tractable from an estimation point of

view.     (See, e.g., Haley [1976].) In light of its simplicity and widespread use
                                    11
in other contexts, I adopt (3.1).

        The wage generating equation applies both to those who are engaged in OJT

and those who are not, but one expects that the parameter values will differ between

the two groups. Therefore, (3.1) is estimated separately for each)2 Specifically,


9.   The assumptions behind this formulation are discussed carefully by Mincer
[1974]. He uses earnings as the dependent variable, but as Blinder [1976] has pointed
out, in the presence of variable hours of work, the wage is more appropriate.

10.  It also assumes constant returns to human cnpit.,i J.nvestmcnt, unlike the
diminishing marginal returns postulated    many other models. For a detailed
evaluation of the assumptions, see Blinder [1976].
1].. In c)rdcr to avoid the theoretical and statistical comjlicati.ons of determining
simultaneously education and OJT, I assume in this paper that the former• is pre-
determined. It is hoped that in future research the decisions will be modelled
jointly.
12. Since the decision to take OJT is endogenous, there is a possibility that the
estimated parameters may be inconsistent due to selectivity bias. However, applica-
tion of the test suggested by Heckman [1979] indicates that such bias is not a
problem in this sample. (In the wage generating equation for each group, the ratio
of the coefficient on the inverse Mill's ratio to its standard error is less than
0.5 in absolute yalue.)
     I append a normal error to each euuation, and estimate the parameters by
 maximum likelihood.

         Although our main point of interest in (3.1) is the parameter p

 one should note that it is not quite the variable that drives the OJT de-

 cision. As Blinder [1976, p. 12] has pointed out, standard theoretical

 considerations suggest that the         relevant     magnitude is the internal rate

 of return, r ,       defined   as the solution to



 (3.2)                          1 =               =
                                      J:pe_rTdT
                                                       (l_eR)
 where     R    is the numler of years remaining in the earnings span. Given

 a
    F estimated fron (3.1), information on the individual's age, and an
 assumption on the age of retirement (R=65), r is straightforward to
 compute.
      With estimates of r for all members of the sample in hand, the only

remaining step is to estimate how it affects the probability of taking

OJT.      I assume that


(3.3)                Prob[Choose OJT] =    [Prob(co+a li
                                                       r.)   >   i 1J
where           has a standard normal distribution and the ci's
          -'l                                                             are param-

eters. This is the well-known probit model, which can be estimated by

maximum likelihood.

        According to Equation (3.3) the internal rate of return captures all

the information that is needed to make the OJT decision. One could argue

that "tastes" for OJT might differ amonq          individuals,     so that a vector of



13. Note that if the individUal is sufficiently close to retirement, the
internal rate of return may actually be negative.
                                           —        —




personal       characteristics should be ,*rlcluded. The notion that personal character-

istics are "proxies" for the individual's access to capital markets would lead

to the same conclusion. In order t avoid colinearity problems and to keep the

specification as simple as possible, I conducted only a limited amount of in-

vestigaon along these lines.14              In some experiments, (3.3) was augmented with

a non—labor income variable. This was intended to be a rough measure of non-

human wealth, which might be related to the extent of the individual's access to

capital markets, his tastes for human capital investment, and/or his attitudes

toward risk.


B.      Taxes

        As shown in Section II, economic theory puts no constraints on how taxation

affects the rate of return to human capital investments. Ideally, one would want

to estimate how each of the various tax effects discussed there influences the OJT

decision., To do so would require the construction of structural equations for

hours of work, savings, the rate f return to OJT, and the OJT decision itself.

Such a program is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, I merely hypothesize

that the probability of taking OJT is some function of both the pre-tax internal

rate of return and the tax rate. At the outset it is assumed that the relation-

ship    can be written


(3.4)           Prob (choose OJT.1   =   Prob   [   (a+   r.+u2t.) >


where t. is the marginal tax rate, and 1.12 has a                standard normal distribution.
                                                                                                 Ir'


The coefficient a2 ,       then,   sumrnirizes all the (possibly) conflicting effects
of Lhe income tax upon the ojrr dcciion.
14. Willis and Rosen [1979, p. S.l9J also exclude essentially all "taste"
variables from their probit equit'i.ns J:or tlic.collogo—joing decision.
15.     Note   that although the probit index is linear in r
probability of doing OJTis non-linear in these variables.
                                                                        and   t , the expected

       A complication is introdaced by the progressivity of the tax system.

An individual's decision to take OJT may influence his marginal, tax rate.

Thc variables       used     here   are age, number of children, education, non—lat)or
income, and dichotomous variables for the region and type of town in which
the individual was raised.



IV. Data

       The data are observations for the ninth wave of the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics, correspondinq to the year 1975 Ilnstitute for Socialsearch.,.l976j.

 The sample consists of wiuite males under the age of bS, who were salied or paid

 y the hour and not employed in agriculture. A few observations were omitted be-

 cause of missing data on one or more of the variables, leaving a total of 1554.

        The variables that appear in (3.1) are the wage, experience and educa-

tion. The pre-tax wage is found by adjusting the Survey Research Center's

hourly wage rate by a deflator to account for regional differences in

price levels. Experience (EXP) is measured as years the individual has

spent in the labor force since age 18. Education (ED) is also measured

in years. The following are the other exogenous variablessed to form

the fitted value of the marginal tax rate: AGE = age in years CHILDREN

= number of children living at home; NE = 1 if individual was raised in
                    18
the northeast            ;   CITY = 1 if individual was raised in a city TOWN = 1



  16. A similar procedure is suggested by Johnson and Pencavel [1978] in
 their study of the determinants of hnu:-s of work.
       Duncan and iIofman [1978] use a similar set of exogenous variables
 in their reduced form equations to cxi lain the OJT decision.

  18.     The following convention is used to define dichotomous variables:
       = 1 if    "means Z takes the                  valu of one if
                                                          is true for the
  individual, and zero otherwise.

        est, dividends, plus the imputed rntal on owner-occupied houses and automobiles.

        The value used for t is the margi nal federal income tax rate as estimated by the

        Survey Research Center. (No attempt is made to correct f or state and local income

        taxes.)

             The mean values of the variables conditional upon the OJT decision

        and for the entire sample are reported in Table IV.l. One observation from the

        table is particularly noteworthy Although the individuals classified as OJT

        takers,, are younger than those who are not, the mean difference is only about 4.5

     years. The survey responses thus appear to be indicativeof something other

     than just age differences.


     V. Results

             Before   reporting results, it   might    be    useful to restate briefly the

    procedure:        (1)    Estimate the wage function (3.1) separately for              those
    who are engaged         in OJT and those who are       not.   (2) For each individual,
-   substitute the estimate of p           from his group's wage equation into equation

     (3.2)    iii order to estimate his inLcrril rate of return, r .                (3)     Estimate

    a   probit equation for the O,JT      decision,        using as explanatory variables the

     internal rate of return, marginal tax rate and (in some cases) non—labor income.


     A. The Wage Function

           In order to estimate (3.1), I          append a normally distributed error
    term, and use      maximum likelihood estimation. The numerical optimi2ation
    are performed using the Davidon-Fletcher-Poweil and GRADX quadratic hill-
    climbing      algorithms (Goldfeld and Quandt l972J )         .   The   asymptotic standard


    19. It is assumed that the rate of return on these durables is 6%, and
    the individual's equity in them is 50%.

   errors of the estimates are computed by taking the square roots of the di-

   agonal elements of the negative inverse Hessian matrix of the log likelihood

   function. Elements of the Hessian ire in turn calculated as numerical dif-

   ferences of various log likelihood values. Unfortunately, the likelihood

   function turns out to be rather flat around the maximum value20, and

  the second partials are therefore quite sensitive to the size of the inter-

  vals over which these differences were taken. One cannot, then, attach great

  confidence to the accuracy of the standard errors, although they are present-

  ed along with the parameter estimates below.

          I report in the first column of Table V.1 the results when the wage equa-

  tion is estimated using the subsample of all individuals in OJT.                The esti-

  mates seem fairly reasonable. The approximately 5% rate of return to schooling

  is somewhat below values that have been reported in other studies               Mincer

  [l97].) The value for p implies that when an indiyidual deyotes 1 addi-

  tional dollar of foregone income to OJT, his earnings increase by 12 cents er

   year for the rest of his life. A similar value is found by Mincer when he

   estimates a linear version of (3.1) and assumes T=20 (Mincer [1974], p. 94).

   The estimate of k           suggests that about a third of an individual's potential

   initial earnings are devoted to OJT, which is slightly below Mincer's figure

   of 0.42. The value of T indicates that QJT continues over a period of about
                 21
   26   years.

"...how long.., would it take the average new person to become fully
qualified?" By the end of the 26 years, the fraction of potential earn-

expects that only the           number o.f years in which a significant amount of OJT

  those who had attended college and those who did not. These results are reported

  in the second and third columns of Table V.1. A likelihood ratio test rejects

 the hypothesis that they are identical.         (The test statistic is 329.2) I

 therefore use the p's in columns (2) and (3) as the bases for constructing

 internal rates of return. That is, conditional on being in OJT, if the individual

 went to college, a value of 0.1260 for p is inserted into equation (3.2);

 otherwise, a value of 0.1896.

       Column 4 of Table V.1 exhibits the results when the wage equation
                                                                        22

 pared to those who do take OJT, human capital investment tends to add very

 little to future earnings ——     the value of p in the fourth column is
 only about 12% the corresponding value in the first. Moreover, compared

 to their counterparts in column 1, the earnings paths of the individuals

 in column 4 are characterized by smaller fractions of initial potential

 earnings devoted to human capital accumulation (k = .1194)             which fall

 off at a greater rate (T=3.6) .       These results suggest that the Panel Study

 question is picking up a meaiiingful distinction between individuals.


B.    Probit Equations

      The probit estimates for the
                                      probability of being in OJT are present-
edin Table V.2.23 The first column
                                         shows the probit estimates when the
probability of OJT is a function of the internal
                                                         rate of return, r    ,   and
22.   Attempts to break up this sample on the basis of education did not
 lead to significantly different results.

23. In all the probit equations
                                  exhibited, the internal rate of return and the
marginal tax rate are entered linearly.
                                          Some equations were estimated with an
interaction term. This term did not
                                      contribute significantly to the explanatory
power of the equation, and its inclusion rendered all the coefficients
 (The t—statjstjc on the interaction                                    unstable.
                                     term was 1.27.) In this sample, at least,

the fitted value of the marginal tax rate,, t •                          As expected, the probability

that an individual will engage in on-the-job training increases with the internal

rate   of return.        Consider now the CO(' I Ii       ci ent    on   the marq i nnl tax rtt.e ,   the sign
of which      is theoretically indeterminate. The tositive                      value suggests that
individuals arc induced by the income tax to engage in OJT. Ap})arenty, the
effect Lhat:      dom.inates    .is the one which        gives     the individual an     incentive     to
substitute human for physical capital as a means for carrying consumption into
the    future. (In the next section I discuss the quantitative significance of the

coefficient.)

       In column 2, the individual's non-labor income is added to the probit equation.

The estimated coefficient suggests that increases in physical wealth are associated

with a lower probability of taking OJT. Although the inclusion of wealth leaves

the qualitative picture unchanged, it has a dramatic effect on the magnitude of

the tax effect. This is a consequence of the colinearity introduced by the

fact that NLINC is one of the instruments used to form t .                             The question of the

suitability of NLINC as an instrument thus arises. In a life-cycle model, asset

accumulation is the subject of choice. Indeed, in such models doubts can be

cast upon the exogeneity of practically any variable. If the variables used to

form t are endogenous, it is not clear that using the fitted value is any

better than using t itself. I therefore re-estimated the probit equation using

the actual marginal tax rate rather than the fitted value.                             (See columns 3 and 4.)

The main qualitative conclusion is the same —- an increase in the marginal tax

rate    increases the probability            of taking     OJT. But the quantitative results are much
more in line with those of column 1.

enormously.      I somewhat arbitraril'; choose the coefficients of column (1)

as the basis for exploring the quantitative implications of the results.

Perhaps the most sensible way to d this is to use the coefficients

for      some        simple simulations. The problem is to determine how the

number of men doing OJT would vary under tax systems with rate schedules

different from those now in effect. For each individual in the sample, I

use the probit equation from column 1 of Table V.2 to predict the probability

of taking OJT, and multiply it by the individual's sample weight. I then

recalaulate the probability of taking OJT, with marginal tax rates 20% and

33% below those currently faced, and again multiply by sample weights.

        The simulation results are reported in Table V.3. They suggest that

if marginal tax rates were reduced by a third, the number of white men

taking OJT would decrease by about        2.4%.    The proportional decrease is

greater for those over than under the age of 40 --              about 6.7% to 0.8%.

For those who attended college, the tax induced decrease in the incidence

of OJT is about the same as that for the population as a whole. The smaller

tax cut of 20% brings about a smaller decrease in the proportion of white

men taking OJT, about 1.7%.

       Given the absence of other empirical studies of the tax impact upon

human capital decisions, it is hard to determine whether or not these

magnitudes are "reasonable." They seem to inc to be well within the bounds

as OJT takers or non-OJT takers. flincer's [1974] simple but elegant theory
of human capital was employed to e:timate internal rates of return to

OJT. This internal ra1e of return, along with a tax variable, were used

to explain the OJT decision in a probit equation. I found that the in-

come tax tends to increase the probability that an individual engages

in OJT. A decrease in marginal tax rates of one—third would decrease the

incidence of OJT among white males by 2.4%.

     The normative implications of this findino are not entirely clear.

There have recently been claims that increases in federal income tax rates

have generated serious decreases in the accumulation of physical capital

 (Boskin [1978]). Such analyses have ignored human capital accumulation.

The results of this paper suggest that reductions in physical capital may

have been accompanied by tax induced increases in human capital. Obviously,

 the two effects do not cancel out --   taxation   distorts both decisions away

 from their first best values. Estimates of the welfare cost of income taxation

 should be extended to take into account human capital effects.24




 24. An attempt along these lines using simulation techniques is reported in
 Driffill and Rosen [19811.
