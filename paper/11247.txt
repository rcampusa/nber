Portfolio Choice over the Life-Cycle in the Presence of ‘Trickle Down’ Labor Income

ABSTRACT

Empirical evidence shows that changes in aggregate labor income and stock market returns exhibit

only weak correlation at short horizons. As we document below, however, this correlation increases

substantially at longer horizons, which provides at least suggestive evidence that stock returns and

labor income are cointegrated. In this paper, we investigate the implications of such a cointegrated

relation for life-cycle optimal portfolio and consumption decisions of an agent whose non-tradable

labor income faces permanent and temporary idiosyncratic shocks. We find that, under economically

plausible calibrations, the optimal portfolio choice for the young investor is to take a substantial {\em

short} position in the risky portfolio, in spite of the large risk premium associated with it. Intuitively,

this occurs because the cointegration effect makes the present value of future labor income flows

`stock-like' for the young agent. However, for older agents who have shorter times-to-retirement, the

cointegration effect does not have sufficient time to act, and the remaining human capital becomes

more `bond-like.' Together, these effects create a hump-shaped optimal portfolio decision for the

agent over the life cycle, consistent with empirical observation.

1     Introduction
The optimal portfolio choice problem over the life cycle has received considerable attention from
political, ﬁnancial, and academic circles. In spite of the vast work on this topic, there is still much
discord between empirical observation, ‘conventional wisdom,’ and the predictions of most of the
academic literature.
    Although the level of stock market participation has increased signiﬁcantly over the decades,
some empirical features have remained robust. In particular, several studies report that risky asset
holdings are typically low at young ages, and then are either increasing or hump-shaped as the
agent ages (see, e.g., Ameriks and Zeldes (2001), Faig and Shum (2002), Heaton and Lucas (2000),
and Poterba and Samwick (2001)). In contrast, conventional wisdom maintains that, for reasonable
levels of risk aversion, young agents should place a large proportion of their wealth into the market
portfolio, and that this proportion should drop as the agent nears retirement. Indeed, one often-
quoted strategy suggested by ﬁnancial advisors is that investors should place (100 - age)% of their
wealth in a well-diversiﬁed equity portfolio (see, e.g., Malkiel (1996, p. 418)).
    Both empirical observation and conventional wisdom are at odds with early academic studies
such as Merton (1969) and Samuelson (1969), who conclude that a long-lived agent should hold a
constant fraction of her wealth in the risky asset throughout her life. Moreover, when calibrated
using historical values for the equity premium and the stock market return volatility, as well as
a ‘reasonable’ risk-aversion coeﬃcient, these models predict that the appropriate proportion of
wealth placed in the risky asset is a counterfactually large number, as high as 100%. These results,
however, are derived under many restrictive assumptions, including power utility, independent and
identically distributed returns on the risky and riskfree investments, the absence of market frictions
and, perhaps most importantly, the absence of labor income.
    In an attempt to reconcile theory and observation, many of the restrictive assumptions underly-
ing the Merton (1969) and Samuelson (1969) results have been progressively relaxed.1 For instance,
several studies have examined the eﬀect of labor income on portfolio choice over the life-cycle. For
many agents, the ‘wealth’ (i.e., the certainty-equivalent present value) tied up in terms of future
wages dwarfs their ﬁnancial wealth. As such, one might suspect that optimal portfolio choice ac-
   1
     Some papers in this direction examine the implications of time-variation in the riskless interest rate, in the equity
premium, and/or diﬀerent utility functions for the portfolio choice problem. See, e.g., Balduzzi and Lynch (1999),
Barberis (2000), Brandt (1999), Brandt et al. (2004), Brennan, Schwartz, and Lagnado (1997), Brennan and Xia
(2000), Campbell, Chacko, Rodriguez, and Viceira (2004), Campbell and Viceira (1999, 2001), Dammon, Spatt, and
Zhang (2003), Kim and Omberg (1996), Liu (2001), Michaelides (2003), Samuelson (1991), Schroder and Skiadas
(1999), Wachter (2002), and Xia (2001).

counting for labor income may generate signiﬁcantly diﬀerent predictions. Interestingly, however,
most existing studies ﬁnd that incorporating labor income into the optimal portfolio decision only
serves to strengthen the puzzle. Indeed, most models attribute ‘bond-like’ qualities to the future
ﬂow of labor income. That is, these models predict that, through their labor income, agents im-
plicitly hold a large position in the risk-free asset, implying that they should take an even more
aggressive position in the risky asset with their cash-on-hand, compared to those models that ignore
labor income. Early papers in this direction include Bodie, Merton, and Samuleson (1992), who
consider portfolio choice in the context of an endogenous leisure/labor trade-oﬀ. More recently,
researchers have used micro data to calibrate the individual labor income process. (See, e.g., Camp-
bell et al. (2001, CCGM), Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2002, CGM), Davis and Willen (2000),
Haliassos and Michaelides (2003), Jagannathan and Kocherlakota (1996), and Viceira (2001)).2
With the particular distributional assumptions made in those papers (essentially, labor income and
stock returns follow autonomous Markov i.i.d. or AR(1) processes), they ﬁnd that only counter-
factually high correlations between shocks to labor income and stock returns, or the possibility of
disastrous labor income shocks (see, e.g., CGM), can explain the low holdings of the risky asset
observed for young investors.
       We note, however, that the labor income speciﬁcations of these models may be unnecessarily
restrictive. In particular, if the contemporaneous correlation ρR                ,L
                                                                                      between market returns and
                                                                             M
changes to aggregate labor income ﬂow is speciﬁed to be low, consistent with the data, then these
models also force longer-term correlations to be low as well. Closely related, such speciﬁcations
also force the correlation ρR       ,R
                                             between the returns to the market portfolio and returns to human

capital (which equals the sum of the current labor income, i.e., ‘the dividend’, and the unobservable
‘capital gain’) to be low. In contrast, below we provide evidence suggesting that the correlation
between market returns and labor income is an increasing function of the time interval. Note that
such a result is consistent with capital ﬂows and ﬂows to labor income being cointegrated, which
in turn generates high correlation between the returns to human capital and to the stock market.
       The notion that human capital and market returns should be highly correlated is not new. For
example, Baxter and Jerman (1997, BJ) test for the existence of cointegration by using data on
   2
    Several other contributions investigate the implications of human capital for asset pricing and portfolio choice.
For instance, Bodie, Detemple, Otruba, and Walter (2004), Chan and Viceira (2000), and Dybvig and Liu (2004)
examine the portfolio choice problem in economies with ﬂexible labor supply or voluntary retirement. Telmer (1993)
investigates the variability of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution in an incomplete market economy
with uninsurable labor income shocks. Heaton and Lucas (1996) and Lucas (1994) study the equity premium in
economies with aggregate and idiosyncratic labor income shocks, transaction costs, as well as borrowing and short-
sales constraints.




                                                            2
aggregate employee compensation and GDP growth (in contrast to using market returns, as is done
in this paper). Although the evidence in support of cointegration is statistically weak, as is often
the case in tests of cointegration, they proceed under the economically plausible assumption that
such a relation indeed exists, and investigate the implications for international portfolio choice.
Assuming a constant discount rate, they ﬁnd that the present values of capital income and labor
income exhibit high correlation, in excess of 90%. Campbell (1996) also estimates a similar high
correlation between human capital and market returns, but using a very diﬀerent argument. In
particular, he assumes that labor income follows an AR(1) process with low contemporaneous
correlation with the stock dividends. However, he assumes that the same (highly time varying)
discount factor should be used to discount both labor income and dividends. In his model, the
high correlation between human capital and market returns is eﬀectively due to the common highly
varying discount factor.3
       In this paper, we investigate the implication of cointegration between labor income and market
returns for life-cycle portfolio choice. Such a speciﬁcation is consistent with the notion of ‘trickle-
down’ labor income. That is, future labor income ﬂows are aﬀected by past proﬁtability of the
economy, so that returns to labor and physical capital are highly correlated, even though the
contemporaneous correlations between market returns and changes in labor income might be low.4
       Although related to the work of BJ, our analysis diﬀers signiﬁcantly from theirs in many aspects.
First, they consider an inﬁnitely-lived representative agent who has a claim to aggregate labor
income. Thus, their analysis does not generate implications for the life-cycle behavior of ﬁnitely-
lived individual agents. Furthermore, their analysis ignores the fact that individual agents face
signiﬁcant idiosyncratic labor income shocks (see, e.g., Carroll and Samwick (1997, CS), CGM, and
Gourinchas and Parker (2002, GP)) that are not captured by looking at aggregate averages alone.
Second, they do not solve for the optimal portfolio choice. Rather, they focus on the one-period
return of an investor desiring a world value weighted (i.e., diversiﬁed) portfolio. Finally, they
estimate human capital by exogenously setting the discount rate used to discount labor income to
a constant.
   3
      The assumption that market returns and returns to labor should be highly correlated is also common to many
macroeconomic models. While the early paper of Fama and Schwert (1977) had dismissed the empirical relevance
of labor income for asset prices (Mayers (1974)), a new strand of literature has recently revisited this point (Black
(1995), Jagannathan and Wang (1996), Santos and Veronesi (2004), Campbell (1996), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001)).
These recent papers ﬁnd that labor income can be an important conditioning variable, which improves the predictive
power of asset pricing models substantially.
    4
      Other papers use the assumption that labor income and dividend ﬂows are cointegrated. For example, Santos
and Veronesi (2004) and Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004) investigate economies where the proportion of output
paid out as labor income is stationary.




                                                         3
       In contrast, we solve the optimal life-cycle portfolio choice problem of an agent with constant
relative risk-aversion who earns non-tradable labor income. The latter is cointegrated with stock
returns and exhibits both temporary and permanent idiosyncratic labor income shocks, which we
model as in CCGM and CGM. Using a dynamic programming approach we solve for the consump-
tion and portfolio allocation rules, and also obtain endogenously the ‘shadow’ present value of
labor income for the optimizing agent (eﬀectively discounting future labor income at her marginal
utility).
       Contrary to much of the previous literature, and to ‘conventional wisdom,’ our model predicts
that a young agent should take a short position in the risky asset. However, as the agent ages,
the optimal proportion of wealth in risky stocks increases. Intuitively, the inverse of the mean
reversion coeﬃcient controlling the cointegration provides a time-scale for the agent: if the number
of years of remaining employment is larger than this time scale (i.e., if the agent is young), then the
return on their human capital is highly exposed to market returns. Furthermore, most of the young
agent’s ‘wealth’ is tied up in future labor income. As such, they will ﬁnd themselves overexposed
to market risk, and it will be optimal to short the market portfolio, analogous with the inﬁnitely
lived representative agent in BJ who faces no idiosyncratic labor shocks. However, if the number of
years of remaining employment is smaller than this time scale (i.e., if they are middle aged), then
the return on their human capital is not highly exposed to market returns—that is, their future
labor income is more bond-like than stock-like. As such, they ﬁnd it optimal to invest more in
the risky asset than a retired individual. Combined, these results generate a hump-shaped optimal
portfolio decision over the life cycle, consistent both qualitatively and quantitatively with empirical
evidence.
       We emphasize that our results are obtained without specifying any type of ﬁxed entry costs to
participate in the equity market. This contrasts considerably with other papers in the literature
that can only explain this non-participation by assuming a rather large entry cost (see, e.g., Abel
(2001), CGM, and GM). Further, as we demonstrate below, the qualitative conclusions of our
ﬁndings are very robust across a wide range of parameter inputs. The most important parameter
is κ, the mean-reversion coeﬃcient controlling the cointegration between labor income and market
returns. Our point estimate for κ ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 depending upon the data set used, and
is consistent with the estimates of BJ. Our benchmark case of κ = 0.15 provides a time-scale of
 1
0.15   = 6.67 years for the cointegration to take eﬀect. For times-to-retirement signiﬁcantly larger
than this, the cointegration eﬀect makes the present value of future labor income ﬂows highly
correlated with market returns, in turn making it optimal for the young agent to short the risky

asset. Interestingly, even when we consider the case κ = 0.05 (and hence, a time scale on the order
       1
of   0.05   = 20 years), the same qualitative solution is found for a risk premium of 4% (a number that
is often used in the literature).
         We acknowledge that we cannot provide irrefutable empirical evidence in support of cointegra-
tion (i.e., κ > 0) over the null hypothesis of a unit root (i.e., κ = 0). That is, the Dickey-Fuller
τ -statistics for unit root tests do not possess the level of signiﬁcance usually expected in the liter-
ature.5 We note, however, that, as is well known, it is econometrically very diﬃcult to distinguish
between these two hypotheses—unit root tests are notorious for lacking power. Still, we consider
investigating the implication of such a cointegrated relation for life-cycle portfolio choice a worth-
while endeavor for several reasons. First, we ﬁnd such a relation economically plausible. As BJ
point out, if the labor and capital income were allowed to have independent trends, then the ratio of
labor income to capital income would either grow without bound or approach zero asymptotically,
and the labor share would approach either zero or one. This seems unlikely (and counterfactual).
Second, we provide some additional empirical support for cointegration by demonstrating that cor-
relation between stock returns and labor income are an increasing function of the horizon. Third,
we note that our model speciﬁcation reduces to traditional models (i.e., no cointegration) in the
limit κ → 0. Econometrically, it is diﬃcult to distinguish between κ = 0 and, say, κ = 0.05 given
only a few decades of data. Indeed, for κ = 0.05, we only expect to see the eﬀects of cointegration
                          1                                                                                   60
over a time frame of     0.05   ≈ 20 years, implying that with 60 years of data, we only have about           20   ≈3
independent data points. Yet, as we show below, the models with κ = 0 or κ = 0.05 generate signif-
icantly diﬀerent predictions for the optimal portfolio decision of a young agent.6 Since both models
are diﬃcult to distinguish econometrically, it seems important to investigate the implications of
both.
         Our conclusions hold for reasonable levels of the agent’s risk aversion coeﬃcient. Following
CCGM, CGM, and Gomes and Michaelides (2004, GM), we choose γ = 5 for our baseline case.
Qualitatively similar results are obtained if γ = 4. However, a less risk-averse agent (e.g., γ = 3)
ﬁnds it optimal to invest heavily in stocks in spite of the long-run cointegration eﬀect. Hence,
we ﬁnd that even small diﬀerences in relative risk aversion can generate substantially diﬀerent
predictions. This result is consistent with empirical observation that asset holdings and stock
market participation exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. In contrast, most models that do not
     5
     We note that both our estimates of κ and its statistical signiﬁcance are very much in line with those obtained by
BJ, even though we use stock returns and they use capital ﬂows.
   6
     In some respects, this is analogous to the approach of Bansal and Yaron (2004) who show that consumption
dynamics with small but persistent drifts are econometrically diﬃcult to distinguish from i.i.d. consumption dynamics,
but generate signiﬁcantly diﬀerent risk premia.



                                                          5
account for this long-run cointegration conclude that young agents over a wide range of risk-aversion
levels should hold a large proportion of their ﬁnancial wealth in risky securities.
        The recent literature has oﬀered many alternative explanations for the limited stock market
participation puzzle.7 The explanation we oﬀer here, while diﬀerent, can be viewed as complemen-
tary to these. Indeed, our paper emphasizes that if, in fact, labor income and market returns are
cointegrated over the long run, then such a relation has a ﬁrst-order eﬀect on the optimal portfolio
decisions of an agent over the life cycle.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the life-cycle portfolio
choice model. We explain the details of the model calibration in Section 3. In Section 4 we
determine optimal portfolio and consumption choice by numerically solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-
Bellman equation. Sensitivity analysis is performed suggesting that the main qualitative result is
robust to a wide range of parameter calibrations. We conclude in Section 5.


2        A Model with Cointegrated Aggregate Labor Income
We specify the date-t price of the risky asset as S(t). More accurately, S should be interpreted
as the gain process, that is, the value of a portfolio that continually reinvests any dividends paid
out by the risky asset. As such, we specify the dynamics of S as if the risky asset does not make
dividend payments:
                                          dS(t)
                                                = µ dt + σ dz3 (t) .                                        (1)
                                          S(t)
Here z3 is a standard Brownian motion. It is convenient to deﬁne the log-stock price as s ≡ log S.
From Ito’s lemma it follows that its dynamics are
                                                 
                                              1 2
                                ds(t) = µ − σ       dt + σ dz3 (t).                                         (2)
                                              2

        Next, we specify the dynamics for the labor income process. Deﬁne the current labor income
ﬂow for an individual as L(t). It is convenient to introduce log-labor as (t) = log L(t). Since
CCGM, CGM, CS, and GP ﬁnd idiosyncratic labor shocks to be proportional to the level of labor
income, it follows that an individual’s income is a product of two numbers: L1 (t), the ‘aggregate
income’ associated with this agent’s career choice, and L2 (t), her idiosyncratic shocks. As such,
her log-labor ﬂow is a sum of these two factors:

                                             (t) = 1 (t) + 2 (t),                                        (3)
    7
    See, for example, Abel (2001), Davis, Kubler and Willen (2003), Faig and Shum (2002), GM, Guo (2004), Heaton
and Lucas (1997, 2000), Hsu (2003), Hong, Kubik and Stein (2004), and Storesletten et al. (2001).



                                                       6
where 1 (t) = log L1 (t) and 2 (t) = log L2 (t).
      We now need to specify the dynamics for 1 (t) and 2 (t). We choose the process for the aggregate
state variable 1 (t) to capture two empirical observations: First, contemporaneous correlations
between market returns and aggregate shocks to labor income are low. Second, as we report below,
this correlation increases substantially with the time horizon.8
      Thus, we assume that the diﬀerence between labor income and the ‘gain’ process is trend-
stationary.9 (We provide below some empirical evidence that this is indeed consistent with the
data.)
      Deﬁne the diﬀerence between the logs of these two variables as y(t):

                                                y(t) ≡ 1 (t) − s(t).                                               (4)

To capture the notion of cointegration (i.e. long-run dependence) between labor income and stock
returns, we assume that y(t) is a mean-reverting process with a mean reversion κ and long-run
central tendency of θ t

                                 dy(t) = κ (θ t − y(t)) dt + ν1 dz1 (t) − ν3 dz3 (t) ,                              (5)

where z1 is a standard Brownian motion independent from z3 .10
      Note that the time-dependence in the central tendency implies that 1 (t) and s(t) are not
cointegrated in the strict sense of the word for non-zero θ. However, we emphasize that one should
expect such a time trend in the ratio of gain process to income ﬂow (i.e., to ﬁnd θ = 0). To illustrate
this point, consider a simple exchange economy where aggregate output is equal to $1 per year, and
the present value of the output is constant and equal to $20. The price-dividend ratio is stationary
(in fact constant) and equal to 1/20=0.05. It follows that the gain process (value of the stock plus
reinvested dividends) at date t is simply 20 ∗ (1.05)t . The gain process-to-dividend ratio at date-t
     20∗(1.05)t
is       1      ,   which is clearly non-stationary. In particular, note that the log gain-dividend ratio
    8
      The latter is also consistent with the results of Campbell (1996) and BJ, that the returns to human and physical
capital are more highly correlated.
    9
      We note that an alternative modeling approach would be to assume that the ﬂow of aggregate labor income and
the ﬂow of aggregate dividends are cointegrated, as in, for example, Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004). However,
since we are in a partial equilibrium framework, this would force us to specify both the aggregate dividend process
and the pricing kernel of the economy in order to determine aggregate stock returns. To avoid this extra layer of
structure, rather than specifying a cointegration relation between labor income and dividends,we assume that the
diﬀerence between labor income and the ‘gain’ process is ‘trend-stationary,’ which is also consistent with our empirical
results reported below.
   10
      It might seem more general to deﬁne the y-dynamics as dy = κ (θ0 + θ t − y) dt + ν1 dz1 − ν3 dz3 . However, one
can then replace the state variable y with y ∗ ≡ (y − θ0 ), whose dynamics from Ito’s lemma follow equation (5) above.
Such a transformation of state variables would not aﬀect the deﬁnition of y (up to an ‘irrelevant constant’).

= log 20 + t log 1.05 is a linear function of time, consistent with the speciﬁcation of the central
tendency in equation (5).
       The crucial coeﬃcient in equation (5) is κ, which measures the speed of mean-reversion of the
deviations between labor income and stock prices towards a deterministic time trend θt. Roughly
                               1
speaking, we can think of      κ   as a time-scale for which stock returns and labor income are coupled.
More formally, τ ≡ log(2)/κ is the half-life for which deviations from the steady-state value decays.
Since a young middle class agent might have, say, 45 years of labor income in front of her before
retirement, even a small positive κ implies that the present value of her labor income is strongly
aﬀected by market movements, as we demonstrate below.
       The AR(1) speciﬁcation implies that y(T ) is normally distributed, with expected value

This equation shows that the steady state value of y(t) is not θt but rather θt − κθ . Hence, below
we choose for our benchmark case y(0) = − κθ .

used to emphasize that this shock is idiosyncratic, in contrast to the aggregate shocks z1 and z3 .
That is, we follow CCGM, CGM, CS, GP, and many others and we assume that the idiosyncratic
labor income component is subject to permanent shocks. Further, we introduce a time-dependence
in the drift in (7) to capture the ﬁndings in the literature that the drift of an individual’s labor
income is a function of her age. Speciﬁcally, we choose

                                           α(t) = α0 + α1 t − α ,                                               (8)

where α0 and α1 are calibrated to capture the hump-shape of earnings over the life cycle (see, e.g.,
CGM and CS). However, we note that the combination of 1 (t) and 2 (t) eﬀectively ‘double counts’
the expected increase in labor income over time. As such, the term α is subtracted so that the
total labor income process (t) conforms well to the empirical ﬁndings of, e.g., CGM.11

Thus, in the special case (σ − ν3 ) = 0, labor income is contemporaneously uncorrelated with market

are unnecessary for generating labor income dynamics that are ‘stock-like’. Instead, what is crucial
is the long-term cointegration.

2.1    Comparison with Standard Labor Income Process Specification

Standard approaches typically choose to specify the labor process using levels rather than changes.
Furthermore, it is common to consider only discrete time intervals, rather than use a continuous-
time speciﬁcation as above. In order to clarify how our approach relates to the extant literature,
here we compare our speciﬁcations (9) and (2) for the labor income and stock price with more
standard models in the literature. In particular, we demonstrate that in the limit κ → 0, our
speciﬁcation is nearly equivalent to the standard model.
   For example, CCGM assume that investor’s i age t labor income, Yi,t , is exogenously given by

                                    log(Yi,t ) = f (t, Zi,t ) + νi,t + εi,t ,                          (13)

where f (t, Zi,t ) is a deterministic function of age and other individual characteristics Zi,t , εi,t is an
idiosyncratic temporary shock uncorrelated across households and distributed as N (0, σε2 ), and νi,t
is given by
                                            νi,t = νi,t−1 + ui,t .                                     (14)




                                                       9
Here, ui,t is distributed as N (0, σu2 ) and is uncorrelated with εi,t . Moreover, ui,t is decomposed into
an aggregate component ξt and an idiosyncratic component ωi,t , uncorrelated across households:

                                             ui,t = ξt + ωi,t .                                         (15)

Further, CCGM assume that the excess return on the risky asset is given by

                                         Rt+1 − Rf = µ + ηt+1 ,                                         (16)

where the innovations ηt are assumed to be i.i.d. over time and distributed as N (0, ση2 ). They allow
for correlation between the aggregate component of labor income shocks, ξt , and innovations to
stock returns, ηt ; they denote the correlation coeﬃcient ρη,ξ .
   Using equation (13) at date-t and date-(t + ∆t), and then using (14), we can write the change
in labor income as

      log(Yi,t+∆t ) − log(Yi,t ) =   f (t, Zi,t+∆t ) − f (t, Zi,t ) + νi,t+∆t − νi,t + εi,t+∆t − εi,t
                                =    f (t, Zi,t+∆t ) − f (t, Zi,t ) + ui,t+∆t + εi,t+∆t − εi,t
                                =    f (t, Zi,t+∆t ) − f (t, Zi,t ) + ωi,t+∆t + ξt+∆t + εi,t+∆t − εi,t . (17)

   This labor income speciﬁcation closely matches our speciﬁcation in equation (9) after some re-
labeling and some minor changes. Let us ignore for now the temporary shock term εi,t+∆t − εi,t .
This is done for two reasons. First, we cannot capture this temporary shock in continuous time
in the way that CCGM do without introducing another state variable, which would increase sig-
niﬁcantly the diﬃculty of obtaining convergence numerically. Instead, we capture the notion of
temporary shocks by placing them into the wealth dynamics rather than the labor income dynam-
ics, as will be seen below in equation (22). Second, and more importantly, we emphasize that
both CCGM and us ﬁnd this term to have negligible eﬀect on optimal portfolio decisions. We
then relabel ∆(t) ≡ log(Yi,t+∆t ) − log(Yi,t ), ωi,t+∆t ≡ ν2 ∆z2,i (t) and f (t, Zi,t+∆t ) − f (t, Zi,t ) ≡

      σ2     (κ=0)       ν22
  µ− 2 +α          (t) − 2 . Finally, since CCGM allow aggregate labor income shocks ξ to be cor-
related with innovations in market returns η, we decompose ξ into two terms ξ⊥ ≡ ν1 ∆z1 and
ξ ≡ (σ − ν3 ) ∆z3 , which are ‘orthogonal’ and ‘parallel’ to stock market shocks ηt , respectively.
Thus, we write ξt ≡ ξ⊥ + ξ = ν1 ∆z1 + (σ − ν3 ) ∆z3 . With this relabeling and the dropping
of the temporary component term, the CCGM and our labor income dynamics can be written,
respectively, as

Here, the superscript ακ (t) emphasizes that we calibrate α(t) for a given κ to match the labor income
proﬁle of CGM. Clearly, the two models diﬀer only in the conditional drift, and are identical in the
limit where the mean reversion parameter κ → 0. Below, we demonstrate that even though these
two models are extremely diﬃcult to distinguish econometrically for ‘small’ values of κ, they have
enormously diﬀerent predictions for the optimal portfolio choice of young agents. Indeed, even for
                                                                       1
an estimate of κ as low as 0.05, which implies a time-scale of        0.05   = 20 years, and a risk premium of
four percent (the same risk premium assumed by, e.g., CCGM, CGM, and GM), we ﬁnd it optimal
for the young agent to short the market portfolio.

2.2      Empirical Motivation for the Model

BJ use the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) approach to test whether the ratio of labor income to
capital income is a stationary random variable. As it is often the case when testing for unit roots,
they are unable to ﬁnd decisive evidence to rule out nonstationarity. As discussed in BJ, these
ﬁndings can be explained by the fact that unit root tests lack power, i.e., they tend not to reject
the unit root null hypothesis when it is false.
       We perform similar ADF tests to check whether the variable y = 1 − s is trend stationary.
When measuring y, we use return realizations on the U.S. value-weighted market index as a proxy
for s, instead of relying on GDP growth data as in BJ. We use average U.S. employee compensation
data to construct a proxy for 1 . We obtain the total annual ‘Compensation of employees’ and the
number of ‘Full-time and part-time employees’ from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) Tables. Each year, we divide the number of ‘Full-time and part-time employees’ by one
minus the average yearly unemployment rate to obtain a proxy for the number of individuals
who are either holding or seeking a full- or part-time employee position. Our proxy for 1 is the
logarithm of the ratio of ‘Compensation of employees’ and the number of individuals either seeking
or holding a full- or part-time employee position.12 Further, in our model the y variable has a time
trend. Thus, we follow Oularis et al. (1989) and we include a second-order time trend in the ADF
regression model
                               ∆y = ξ1 + ξ2 t + ξ3 t2 + ξ4 y + Φ(L) ∆y−1 +  ,                               (20)

which we estimate by ordinary least squares (OLS). Comparing equation (5) and equation (20),

we see that if we ignore the eﬀects of the terms ξ3 t2 and Φ(L) ∆y−1 , then ξ4 would provide

    The value-weighted market index returns are from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data-
base. We convert stock market prices and aggregate labor income from nominal to real terms by use of the
consumer price index (CPI). The NIPA Tables are available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis web site at
http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn1.htm, while the CPI index, the unemployment rate, and the civilian participation
rate data are available from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank web site at http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/.

time.
   Not surprisingly, our analysis suﬀers from the same problems as those reported in BJ. The ADF

critical value for the ADF test based on (20) is -3.55 (see, e.g., Davidson and MacKinnon (1993), p.
708). Consistent with BJ (our results are very similar to those that BJ report in their unpublished
Appendix), we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the y series has a unit root.
   These results are robust to the proxy we use for the aggregate labor income component. For
instance, we have also measured 1 as the logarithm of ratio of ‘Compensation of employees’ and
the number of ‘Full-time and part-time employees,’ without adjusting the denominator using the
unemployment rate. Further, we have projected changes in 1 against the lagged average yearly job
market participation rate of the civilian U.S. population, and we have performed the ADF tests on
1 minus its predictable component. In each case, we have obtained similar ξ4 and τ estimates.
   Finally, these ﬁndings are robust to the sample period. Since unemployment and participation
rates are available only from 1948, during the sample period from 1929 to 2001 we can only mea-
sure 1 as the ratio of ‘Compensation of employees’ and the number of ‘Full-time and part-time
employees,’ without adjusting the denominator using the unemployment rate. This approach yields
a ξ4 = −0.1858 estimate with a τ = −2.73 ADF statistic.
   To provide additional motivation for the model, we further investigate the properties of the
long-run correlations between stock returns and labor income. In Table 2.2, Panel A, we report the
correlations between the jth-order diﬀerences in log-labor income and log-stock prices, j = 1, . . . , 5,
computed using overlapping intervals from 1948 to 2001. First, we note that these correlations are
particularly diﬃcult to pin down. For instance, the 1-year correlations range from 16% to 37%
depending on the proxy we use for 1 . Further, these estimates vary depending on the choice of
the sample period (not reported). This evidence is consistent with the rest of the literature. For

instance, CCGM and CGM ﬁnd that the 1-year correlation is small and insigniﬁcant, while they
report that the same correlation estimated with returns lagged one year is as large as 52%. Similarly,
Davis and Willen ﬁnd no evidence for a relation between income innovations and contemporaneous
aggregate equity returns. Further, Campbell (1996) estimates a VAR model for stock and T-Bill
returns, labor income, dividend yields, and term premia. He ﬁnds a 17% correlation between the
contemporaneous innovations to labor income and stock returns. Clearly, longer-term correlations
may be even more imprecisely estimated, as the number of ‘independent observations’ drops linearly
with the time interval for which the correlation is measured.13 Still, we ﬁnd two results which seem
robust. First, the estimate of the κ coeﬃcient is relatively insensitive to the choice of the proxy
for labor income, and is approximately equal to 0.15. Second, and related, we systematically ﬁnd
that correlations are increasing in the time interval. This pattern is at odds with previous labor
income models, but is consistent with the notion of cointegration between labor income and stock
market performance. To illustrate this point, in Panel B we report the correlations implied by
our model (5) and (2) for a realistic calibration of its coeﬃcients (we explain the details of the
calibration in Section 3 below). Diﬀerent rows report long-run correlations for diﬀerent values of κ
and corr(d, ds), the coeﬃcient of contemporaneous correlation between changes in  and changes
in s. For κ ≈ 0.15, the value we use in our baseline calibration, the model produces long-run
correlations that are consistent with the empirical evidence. Instead, for κ → 0, the model reduces
to the standard labor income speciﬁcations previously considered in the literature, and produces
constant long-run correlations that are at odds with the empirical evidence.
       In sum, as in BJ, we cannot provide conclusive evidence to reject the unit root hypothesis in the
y series. However, we note that the cointegration eﬀect can act at very low frequencies. For small
values of κ, it might take many decades for an agent’s wages to catch up with the performance of the
economy. Thus, given the relatively short sample period it is not surprising that such eﬀect might
go undetected by the ADF test, which is notorious for its lack of power. Further, we emphasize that
the stylized evidence on the patterns of the long-run correlations between labor income and stock
returns are at odds with the labor income models previously considered in the literature, while
they closely match the correlation pattern implied by our model. Finally, we note that economic
intuition provides strong support to the notion that labor and capital income are cointegrated. For
all these reasons, we proceed under the assumption that the y variable is trend-stationary.

    Indeed, this is why we do not report correlations over longer time intervals. For example, with (2001 - 1948 =
53) annual observations, even a 5-year time interval already leaves us with only 53
                                                                                  5

correlations for diﬀerent values of the κ coeﬃcient and the contemporaneous correlation between
changes in  and changes in s, corr(d, ds). We obtain diﬀerent values of corr(d, ds) by changing
the value of the ν3 coeﬃcient. The other model coeﬃcients are calibrated to realistic values, as we
explain in Section 3 below.

2.3   The agent

The current ﬁnancial wealth of the agent is stored in two securities. In particular, the agent owns
θ0 (t) shares of the riskless asset, whose date-t price is B(t), and θ(t) shares of the risky asset, whose
date-t price is S(t). Hence, her wealth and wealth dynamics follow

               W (t) = θ0 (t)B(t) + θ(t)S(t)                                                              (21)
              dW (t) = −C(t)dt + θ0 (t)dB(t) + θ(t) dS(t) + L(t) dt + βW (t)dz4,i (t).                    (22)

The last term captures the notion of transient shocks to the agent’s wealth. In contrast to most
discrete-time models, it is simpler in our continuous-time model to capture these transient shocks
in the wealth process rather than in the labor income process. Consistent with intuition, and the
numerical results of CGM, we report below that this term has a negligible eﬀect on the agent’s
consumption and portfolio choices for a wide range of reasonable parameter estimates for β.
   It is convenient to deﬁne:
                                                            C

That is, c is optimal consumption as a percentage of wealth, X represents the ratio of labor income
as a percentage of wealth, and π is the optimal proportion of wealth placed in the risky asset. The
wealth dynamics can then be written as

   We assume that the agent has standard constant relative risk aversion utility function. As such,
her objective function is:

Note that equation (31) provides a simple mapping between consumption and JW . Below, we take
advantage of this relation by performing our numerical analysis on partial derivatives on C rather
than on J. This is done mostly to improve the stability of our numerical procedure. The added
stability can be understood by noting that equation (32) implies that the proportion of wealth
placed into the risky asset must be estimated from numerical estimates of the second derivative of
the value function. Rather, by using equation (31), we can rewrite equation (32) as:
                                                                               1

Note that this relation allows us to determine π by using only ﬁrst derivatives of C.
   As is well known, the CRRA utility function possesses a scaling feature which allows us to
eliminate one of the state variables. In particular, for any value of λ, we can write

                                       C(λW, λL, y, t) = λ C(W, L, y, t).                                       (34)

Intuitively, this states that if an agent were twice as rich and had twice the labor income, then she
                                                                                       1
would optimally choose to consume twice as much. If we choose λ =                      W,   then we can write

                                              L           1
                                       C(1,     , y, t) =   C(W, L, y, t).                                      (35)

Recall that we have previously deﬁned X ≡              L
                                                       W   and c(X =      L
                                                                          W , y, t)   ≡ C(1, W

interpret c as the consumption scaled by wealth:

The ﬁrst term is the well known result from Merton (1969). The other terms capture the eﬀects
of stochastic labor income and cointegration. Note in particular that for the case where there is
no cointegration (i.e., where κ = 0), it is straightforward to see that the y-state variable is not
‘needed,’ i.e., cy = 0 and the last term drops out.14
       Further, we note that it might be diﬃcult for an agent to short-sell securities. Thus, we follow
GM, Storesletten et al. (2001), and many others, and we impose the constraint that π lies within
the πmin = 0 and πmax = 1 bounds. In Section 4, we relax this constraint and allow the agent to
take short positions up to 100% of her ﬁnancial wealth, i.e., πmin = −1 and πmax = 2.
       Just as we have used equation (31) to rewrite the ﬁrst order condition on π, we can also use
this equation to rewrite the Bellman equation. Straightforward but tedious algebra produces the
dynamics

    Further, note that for the special case where µ − r = γσ 2 and ν3 = 0 we ﬁnd π(t) = 1. In that case, the agent
invests 100% of her wealth in risky assets irrespective of the correlation between labor income and stock returns,
which is driven by ν1 , ν2 ! This is a very speciﬁc case, where absent any labor income investors would want to invest
everything in the stock market (the Merton portfolio is (µ − r)/(γσ 2 ) = 1). With ν3 = 0 we can think of labor
income as giving the agent a random number (determined by ν1 , ν2 ) of shares of stock—the agent has no incentive
to deviate from his position. Alternatively, we can think in terms of the two eﬀects on the agent’s risky asset holding
decision that play a role when increasing exposure to labor income risk: background risk vs. diversiﬁcation motive.
They oﬀset each other exactly in this special case.

The ‘ﬁnal condition’ is
                                            c(X, y, T ) = −1             ∀(X, y).                         (39)

2.4      Present Value of Labor Income

The ﬁrst order condition with respect to consumption for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
yields
                                                JW = UC = e−δt C −γ .                                      (40)

Thus, the time-t present value of the agent’s labor income is
                                                    T                           −γ
                                                                          C(s)
                                     Vt = E t           ds e−δ(s−t)                    Ls .                (41)

Below, we estimate the present value to labor income in equation (41) by using the Monte Carlo
method.
       Given that Vt is a function of only three state variables, namely y, L, and W , we can write the
stochastic component of dV as

                dVstochastic     = Vy dystochastic + VL dLstochastic + VW dWstochastic                     (42)

                                 = ν1 Vy + ν1 LVL dz1 + ν2 LVL dz2,i
                                                                          
                                   + −ν3 Vy + (σ − ν3 )LVL + πσW VW dz3 + βW VW dz4,i .

Although there are no traded securities that correlate with the z1 , z2,i , and z4,i sources of risk, we
can, as a thought experiment, introduce three ‘pseudo-securities’ Xj , j = 1, 2, and 4 such that

                               dXj (t)               Q
                                         = r dt + σdzj,i (t)                                               (43)
                               Xj (t)
                                                       
                                         = r + λj (t)σ dt + σdzj,i (t) ,               j = 1, 2, 4.

The coeﬃcients λj (t), j = 1, 2, and 4, are the risk premia on these pseudo-securities.15 We note that
if all these claims were traded, then these risk-premia would be pinned down by the observable price
processes. In that case markets would be complete and the portfolio problem would have a simple
solution (e.g., Duﬃe (2001)). It is well-known that when markets are incomplete, the incomplete
markets portfolio problem can be characterized by a complete markets problem in a ﬁctitiously
completed market where the risk premia of the added securities are such that, at the optimum,
the agent does not want to hold them (He and Pearson (1991), Karatzas, Lehoczky, Shreve and
  15
    For simplicity, we assume these securities pay no dividends and we normalize their diﬀusion coeﬃcients to be
constant (equal to σ). This insures that the securities span all sources of risk.


                                                              18
Xu (1991)). The corresponding risk premia, given the optimal value function, are determined by
             dX (t)     dJW (t)
λj (t)dt = − X j(t) ·   JW (t) .   Using equation (40), we obtain
               j


                                                     1                     
                                                                 −δt     −γ
                                 λj (t)dt = −               d   e    C(t)     · dZj (t) .        (44)
                                                e−δt C(t)−γ
We then consider a replicating portfolio consisting of an investment θS in the stock S, θB in the
riskfree asset B, and θX in Xj , j = 1, 2, and 4:
                             j


                                 V Rep = θS S + θB B + θX X1 + θX X2 + θX X4 .                   (45)
                                                             1            2        4


The stochastic component of dV Rep is

                      Rep
                   dVstochastic = θS Sσdz3 + θX X1 σdz1 + θX X2 σdz2,i + θX X4 σdz4,i .          (46)
                                                      1               2                4


Thus, by matching coeﬃcients in (42) and (46) we conclude that the proportion of the agent’s
human capital implicitly tied up in the stock market is

                                    θS S   −ν3 Vy + (σ − ν3 )LVL + πσW VW
                                         =                                .                      (47)
                                     V                   σV
Finally, we determine the correlation coeﬃcient between returns to human capital and stock returns,
which we denote by ρ. By combining (2) with (42), we obtain

                                          −ν3 Vy + (σ − ν3 )LVL + πσW VW
                                     ρ=                                  ,                       (48)
                                                         σV

where σV2 = (ν1 Vy + ν1 LVL )2 + (ν2 LVL )2 + (−ν3 Vy + (σ − ν3 )LVL + πσW VW )2 + (βW VW )2 .
    In Section 4, we evaluate (41), (47), and (48) for reasonable model coeﬃcients, and illustrate
the eﬀect of ‘trickle down’ labor income risk on the agent’s human capital.


3     Model Calibration
To illustrate the implications of our model, we consider a realistic calibration of its coeﬃcients.

    1. Risky Asset and Riskfree Bond:

      Consistent with Mehra and Prescott (1985), we ﬁx the real riskfree interest rate at 1% and
      we assume a 6% risk premium for the risky asset investment, i.e., r = 1% and µ = 7% in real
      terms. As we will show later, lower estimates of the risk premium make our results stronger
      in that optimal stock holdings are even lower. Finally, we set σ = 16%.



                                                            19
2. Aggregate Labor Income Dynamics:

  By discretizing (2) and (5), we obtain:

                                   ∆s = a0 + ξ1                                               (49)
                                   ∆y = a1 + a2 t + a3 y + ξ2 ,                               (50)

  where ξ1 and ξ2 are normal error terms and, as deﬁned earlier, s = log(S) and y = 1 − s.

  As we explained in more detail in Section 2.2, we consider two sample periods: 1929-2001 and
  1948-2001. When measuring y, we use return realizations on the CRSP U.S. value-weighted
  market index as a proxy for s. For the 1929-2001 sample period, our proxy for 1 is the
  logarithm of the ratio of ‘Compensation of employees’ and the number of ‘Full-time and part-
  time employees,’ both from the NIPA Tables. For the 1948-2001 sample period, it is the
  logarithm of the ratio of ‘Compensation of employees’ and the number of individuals either
  seeking or holding a full- or part-time employee position. We convert stock market prices and
  labor income from nominal to real terms using the CPI index.

  We proceed under the assumption that the y variable is trend-stationary. Thus, we ﬁrst de-
  trend y by estimating the OLS regression y = γ1 + γ2 t + εy . Then, we evaluate the residuals
  ε̂y and use OLS to ﬁt the linear model

                                         ∆ε̂y = a3 ε̂y + ξ2 .                                 (51)

  With this approach, we immediately obtain an estimate for the a3 coeﬃcient in (50), while a1
  and a2 are determined by a1 = γ2 −a3 γ1 and a2 = −a3 γ2 . Furthermore, we use the time-series
  of the residuals ξ̂1 and ξ̂2 to estimate the variance terms var(ξ1 ) and var(ξ2 ), as well as the
  covariance cov(ξ1 ,ξ2 ).

  Finally, we map the coeﬃcients of the discretized model (49)-(50) into those of the continuous-
  time diﬀusions (2) and (5). Speciﬁcally, the κ coeﬃcient in (5) is given by κ = − log(a3 + 1) =
  0.2 (κ = 0.13 when we estimate the model using 1948-2001 data). As for the other model
  coeﬃcients, after making the appropriate conversions we obtain θ = −0.0518, ν1 = 0.0598,
  and ν3 = 0.1721 when using 1929-2001 data (θ = −0.0522, ν1 = 0.0362, and ν3 = 0.1447
  when using 1948-2001 data).

  We use κ = 0.15 for our baseline case. Interestingly, we document below that even when κ is
  as small as 0.05 and the market risk premium is ﬁxed at 4% (a value commonly used in the
  literature), the same qualitative solution is found. Further, we ﬁx θ = −0.0518, ν1 = 0.05,


                                              20
  and ν3 = σ = 0.16. From equations (2) and (9), we see that imposing ν3 = σ yields a zero
  contemporaneous correlation between labor income growth and stock market returns. A low
  correlation is consistent with the empirical evidence reported in, e.g., CGM, Davis and Willen
  (2000), and Fama and Schwert (1977).

3. Permanent Idiosyncratic Labor Income Shocks:

  The variance of the 2 term is determined by the ν2 coeﬃcient, which we calibrate to match
  the magnitude of the typical permanent income component variance, as measured in previous
  contributions that have modeled the labor income process of individual households by using
  micro data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). For instance, CGM report
  values for the standard deviations of the permanent idiosyncratic shocks that range from 0.1
  to 0.13, depending on the household’s education level. CS’s and GP’s estimates range from
  0.11 to 0.21, depending on the household’s occupation and education level. Storesletten et al.
  (2002) document that the conditional standard deviation of the permanent shocks increases
  from 0.12 to 0.21 as the economy moves from peak to trough. In our baseline case, we set
  ν2 = 0.15. In the next section, we document the sensitivity of our results to diﬀerent values
  of ν2 .

  To gather a better sense for the relative magnitude of the ν2 coeﬃcient in our calibration,
  it is worth noting that from equation (9) the total variance of the labor income process is
  ν12 + (σ − ν3 )2 + ν22 , which equals 0.025 in our baseline case. The total variance can be
  decomposed into an aggregate and an idiosyncratic component. The aggregate component
  is ν12 + (σ − ν3 )2 = 0.0025, while the idiosyncratic component is ν22 = 0.0225. Thus, in our
  baseline case the ratio of aggregate to permanent idiosyncratic variance shocks is very small,
  consistent with the evidence in CCGM. In the next section, we document that a larger value
  of ν2 , which implies an even smaller ratio of aggregate to permanent idiosyncratic variance
  shocks, also yields qualitatively similar risky asset holdings.

4. Deterministic Life-Cycle Labor Income Profile:

  We calibrate the coeﬃcients in the drift term α(t) in (7) to reproduce the typical income
  pattern due to the predictable growth component described in CS. We consider a twenty year
  old college-educated agent, t = 0, who will work till her retirement date at age 65, T = 45.
  We assume that her t = 0 annual labor income is $15,000 in 1992 USD and we set α0 = 0.0722
  and α1 = −0.0024, which imply the deterministic labor income proﬁle depicted in Figure 1.
  Further, we subtract the term α = 0.0142 in (8) to compensate for the expected increase in


                                              21
   the aggregate labor income component 1 , so that the total labor process  = 1 + 2 conforms
   well to the typical deterministic labor income pattern estimated by, e.g., CGM using PSID
   households data.

5. Transitory Income Shocks:

   The transitory income component documented in CGM, CS, GP, and others is built into our
   model through the term proportional to dz4,i in the wealth dynamics (22). For our baseline
   case, we ﬁx β = 0.02, which implies that most transient ﬂuctuations are within ±2 β, i.e.,
   ±4%, of the current value of wealth. Thus, for an average wealth of, say, $300,000, most
   transient shocks will be within ±$12, 000 per year, with a typical yearly shock of ±$6, 000,
   consistent with the results of, e.g., CGM.

6. Preferences:

   The critical parameter in the CRRA utility function is the risk aversion coeﬃcient γ. Mehra
   and Prescott (1985) argue that reasonable values of γ are smaller than 10. As in CCGM,
   CGM, and GM, we use γ = 5 for our baseline case. In the next section, we document the
   sensitivity of our results to diﬀerent γ values.

   The magnitude of the remaining coeﬃcients in the value function (27) is less controversial.
   We follow CCGM, CGM, and GM and we ﬁx δ = 0.04. Cagetti (2003), Dyann, Skinner,
   and Zeldes (2004), and Hurd (1989) examine the implications of a bequest motive on lifetime
   saving and consumption decisions. In our application, we follow an approach similar to that of
   GP and do not explicitly model the agent’s behavior during her retirement years. In this case,
    determines the number of years of retirement consumption that the investor wants to save
   for. Accordingly, we calibrate  to generate a wealth accumulation proﬁle over the life cycle
   that is consistent with the evidence documented in, e.g., Cagetti (2003) for college-educated
   households. This approach results in  = 8.

7. Initial Conditions:

   We consider a twenty year old agent endowed with $5,000 of cash-on-hand in 1992 USD, i.e.,
   W (0) = 5. As mentioned previously, the agent’s t = 0 annual labor income is $15,000 in
   1992 USD, i.e., L(0) = 15. Finally, we ﬁx y(0) at its ‘steady state’ most likely value, i.e.,
   y(0) = −θ/κ, and without loss of generality we initialize the logarithm of the stock market
   gain process at zero, i.e., s(0) = 0.

4         Simulation Results
With the exception of a few special cases,16 analytic solutions for the life-cycle portfolio choice
problem are typically not available. We solve our problem numerically, by using standard ﬁnite-
diﬀerence methods; see, e.g., Ames (1977) and Candler (1999).
         Here, we only sketch the numerical solution approach, postponing more details to Appendix
A. We solve the consumption problem (38) backwards, starting from the time T = 45 terminal
condition (39) and going all the way back to the initial date t=0. At each 1/10 of a year, we
save the values of c and π on an X- and y-grid. To obtain representative wealth, consumption,
investment, and X proﬁles, we simulate 200,000 W , L, y, and X-paths from their dynamics at the
frequency of 1/10 of a year. In the simulations, we ﬁx the controls π and c at the values obtained
by interpolating our π and c solutions on the points of the X- and y-grid. Then, we average the
realizations of the W , C, π, and X-paths. Finally, we derive analytic solutions for Et [ys ] and Et [Ls ],
t ≤ s ≤ T , and use them to determine the representative y and L life-cycle patterns.

4.1        Baseline Case

In Figure 2, Panel A, we report the representative life-cycle wealth, consumption, and labor income
proﬁles that result from our baseline calibration of the model. As expected, accumulated wealth
increases over the life of the agent, and her consumption grows proportionally. Finally, the repre-
sentative individual labor income proﬁle exhibits the typical pattern identiﬁed by, e.g., CGM for a
college-educated household.
         Most interestingly, Panel B of Figure 2 depicts the representative stock holdings, π, over the
life-cycle. Contrary to the ﬁndings of much of the previous literature, we ﬁnd that a young agent
should not invest in the risky asset. However, as the agent ages, the optimal proportion of wealth
in risky stocks increases. Intuitively, the inverse of the mean reversion coeﬃcient controlling the
cointegration provides a time-scale for the agent: if the number of years of remaining employment
is larger than this time scale (i.e., if the agent is young), then the return on their human capital
is highly exposed to market returns. Furthermore, most of the young agent’s ‘wealth’ is tied up
in future labor income. As such, she will ﬁnd herself overexposed to market risk, and it will be
optimal to short the market portfolio, analogous with the inﬁnitely lived representative agent in BJ
who faces no idiosyncratic labor shocks. Since we impose short-sale constraints, the agent chooses
to invest her entire liquid wealth in the riskfree bond. However, if the number of years of remaining
    16
    Among recent studies, see, e.g., Duﬃe et al. (1997), Liu and Loewenstein (2002), Liu et al. (2003), Schroder and
Skiadas (2003, 2004).



                                                        23
employment is smaller than this time scale (i.e., if she is middle aged), then the return on her
human capital is not highly exposed to market returns—that is, her future labor income is more
bond-like than stock-like. As such, she ﬁnds it optimal to invest more in the risky asset than a
retired individual. Combined, these results generate a hump-shaped optimal portfolio decision over
the life cycle, consistent both qualitatively and quantitatively with empirical evidence.
    Finally, in Figure 2, Panels A and B, we depict the representative paths for the state variables
X and y. It is worth noting the downward sloping X-proﬁle. At a young age, an agent has very
limited cash-on-hand relative to her annual labor income (in our calibration, X = 3 at t = 0). As
the agent grows older, her accumulated wealth exceeds her annual labor income and X decreases.

4.2    Human Capital

We use equation (41) to compute the value of a 20-year old agent’s human capital. Following
the same method discussed previously, we simulate 500,000 wealth and consumption paths and we
average across these simulated paths to evaluate (41). For a twenty-year old agent, in the baseline
case this approach results in a present value of labor income, V , of approximately $175,000. Further,
we numerically diﬀerentiate V with respect to y, L, and W , and use our estimates of Vy , VL , and
VW to compute the fraction of the agent’s human capital tied up in the stock market, as illustrated
in (47). We ﬁnd this fraction to be as large as 54.5%. At ﬁrst blush, this fraction might not seem
high enough to generate our ﬁndings, since the optimal retired agent holds about that much in
stock, so it would seem that the agent’s implicit holdings match her desired holdings, and therefore
with her remaining cash-on-hand she should also invest about half of it in the risky asset. However,
this estimate does not account for her implicit holdings in the three pseudo-securities X1 , X2 , and
X4 that we introduced in Section 2.4. Figure 4 below shows the decomposition of the replicating
portfolio for human capital into its various holdings of stock, pseudo-securities and risk-free money
market. We ﬁnd that the position in X1 , X2 , and X4 implicit in the agent’s human capital are
14.4%, 94.2%, and 0.4%, respectively. Clearly, human capital is mostly equivalent to a long position
in the stock market S and in permanent idiosyncratic risk which is hedged with X2 . The transient
idiosyncratic shocks driven by z4 and hedged with X4 represents only a very small fraction of
the replicating portfolio. Hence, they do not aﬀect much the shadow value of labor income. We
emphasize that the pseudo-securities have risk-premia determined endogenously, so that agents,
given their labor income, do not want to trade in these securities.17 Interestingly, through her
  17
     An alternative interpretation is the following: suppose the agent had no labor income, but instead could invest
in these pseudo-securities (with risk-premia as determined above), then she would want to invest precisely in the
portfolio represented in Figure 4.



                                                        24
human capital the agent’s implicit holding in the risk-free asset is approximately -63%. That is,
the agent’s present value of labor income is a very leveraged security. On the other hand, for an
agent approaching retirement human capital becomes small. Thus, her position in these pseudo
securities approaches zero, which explains her long position in the stock market.
   Related, we measure the correlation of stock returns and the returns to human capital. Using
equation (48), for a twenty-year old agent we ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient ρ ∼
                                                                            = 50%. That is, due
to the idiosyncratic labor income shocks, the correlation is much lower than what is found by BJ
and Campbell (1996) at the aggregate level. Still, it is suﬃciently high to have a ﬁrst-order eﬀect
on the agent’s portfolio choice decisions.
   Finally, in Figure 5, Panel A, we illustrate how the agent’s human capital evolves over the life
cycle. For values of time t from 0 to 45, we use (41) to compute the present value of the future
stream of labor income, Vt . We note that the fraction of the agent’s labor income tied up in the
risky asset is roughly constant at 50% throughout the ﬁrst half of her life, and it rapidly goes
to zero as she approaches retirement. Further, we note that the present value of human capital
has a hump-shaped proﬁle. That is, although young agents face a larger stream of future labor
income, they discount such cash ﬂows higher than older agents do. This occurs for two reasons.
First, as the agent ages, she faces lower idiosyncratic labor income risk. To validate this intuition,
we use equation (44) to compute the risk premium on the permanent idiosyncratic labor income
shocks over the agent’s life cycle. Figure 5, Panel B, shows that λ2 has a downward sloping proﬁle
and conﬁrms that the risk premium on idiosyncratic shocks approaches zero when the agent retires.
This eﬀect is common to other models with idiosyncratic labor income risk, e.g., CCGM, CGM, CS,
GM, and more. Second, in our model human capital has pronounced ‘stock-like’ features, and thus
it commands a higher discount rate, for young agent, while it acquires ‘bond-like’ properties, and
thus it is discounted at a lower rate, for older agents. Due to this second eﬀect, which is determined
by the long-run cointegration of labor income and stock market performance, the value of human
capital peaks at a later point of the agent’s life, compared to standard models considered in previous
studies. This intuition is conﬁrmed by the evidence in Figure 5, Panel C, which shows that the
correlation of stock returns and the returns to human capital remains high and basically constant
over the ﬁrst half of the agent’s life, and it rapidly drops as the agent approaches retirement.

4.3   Speed of Mean Reversion and Equity Premium

In Figure 6, we explore the robustness of our results to the magnitude of the κ coeﬃcient. Consistent
with the intuition discussed in Section 4.1, we see that larger values of κ increase the agent’s



                                                 25
exposure to stock market risk and thus reduce her stock holdings. However, even a small value of
κ has ﬁrst-order eﬀects on the life-cycle π proﬁle.
   CCGM, CGM, and GM set the equity premium equal to 4%, a value that can be motivated
based on the observation that stock prices have tended to increase over recent years relative to
corporate earnings. Thus, in Figure 7 we illustrate the life-cycle π proﬁle when r = 2% and µ = 6%.
Interestingly, a lower value of the equity premium makes our results even stronger. Speciﬁcally, it
is worth noting that with this model calibration a young agent chooses not to invest in the stock
market even if the κ coeﬃcient is as low as 0.05, as compared to the κ = 0.15 of the baseline case.

4.4   Contemporaneous Correlation of Stock Returns and Aggregate Labor In-
      come Shocks

We noted previously that our baseline calibration implies a zero contemporaneous correlation of
stock returns and growth rates in labor income. In Figure 8, we illustrate the eﬀect of non-zero
contemporaneous correlations. We consider two cases, ν3 = 0.18 and 0.14, which imply correlations
of approximately ±13%, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, we note that even such high
values of correlations have limited impact on the agent’s stock holdings, compared to the long-run
cointegration eﬀect.

4.5   Persistent Idiosyncratic Labor Income Shocks

We note that an increase in the idiosyncratic labor income variance (through an increase in ν2 )
has two possibly opposite eﬀects on the investor’s desired portfolio holdings. First, it increases
‘background risk,’ which all else equal leads to a decrease in desired risky asset holdings. Second,
it provides a ‘diversiﬁcation motive,’ which might induce the agent to increase her demand of
the risky asset. The latter eﬀect could potentially counter-balance the eﬀect due to the long-run
cointegration-like behavior of the aggregate labor income with the market portfolio. In Figure 9,
we show that a value of ν2 as high as 0.20 (the upper end of the empirical range documented in
the literature) attenuates but does not eliminate our main result. Interestingly, the picture shows
that investors with an investment horizon of approximately 12 years are in fact indiﬀerent to a
change in ν2 . This ‘duration’ like feature may be due to a near perfect oﬀsetting of the two eﬀects
(diversiﬁcation motive vs. background risk) noted above.

4.6   Transitory Idiosyncratic Labor Income Shocks

It is generally agreed that transient idiosyncratic labor income shocks have negligible implications
for the optimal portfolio choice problem solution. In Figure 10, we conﬁrm this result by considering


                                                 26
values of β as small as zero, and as large as 0.04 (twice the value used in our baseline case).

4.7   Relative Risk Aversion

In Figure 11, we document the sensitivity of our results to changes in the relative risk aversion
coeﬃcient. We note that even for a young agent with relative risk aversion γ = 4 human capital
has stock-like features. In this case, the stock holdings retain the same hump-shaped proﬁle over
the life-cycle. However, a less risk averse agent (e.g., γ = 3) perceives her human capital to be more
bond-like, in spite of the long-run cointegration eﬀect. Even at a young age she invests heavily in
the risky asset. As she gets older, the present value of her human capital declines relative to the
value of her liquid wealth. Thus, we see her π proﬁle decline as she approaches retirement. We
emphasize that even small diﬀerences in relative risk aversion can generate opposite decision as to
whether to participate in the stock market. This result is qualitatively consistent with empirical
evidence, which shows that asset holdings exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity.

4.8   Short-Sale Constraints

The recent development of derivatives markets as well as the proliferation of Exchange Traded
Funds (ETFs) makes it easier for an agent to take short positions in the market portfolio. Thus,
in Figure 12 we illustrate the typical life-cycle investment proﬁle when the short-sale constraint
is relaxed. Consistent with the intuition developed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we ﬁnd that a young
agent chooses to short the market portfolio, to hedge the long position in the stock market implicit
in her human capital.


5     Conclusions

Conventional wisdom maintains that young investors should invest heavily in the stock market.
Most theoretical investigations concur. Furthermore, most models suggest that labor income is
more ‘bond-like’ than ‘stock-like,’ implying even higher optimal proportions of wealth should be
placed into the risky asset if labor income is accounted for. In this paper, however, we claim
that by incorporating two features previously documented in the literature, namely, that aggregate
labor income is cointegrated with aggregate output, and that individual labor income is subject
to signiﬁcant permanent idiosyncratic shocks, we ﬁnd the optimal portfolio choice for the young
investor is to take a substantial short position in the risky portfolio. This occurs because our model
implies that the value of the claim to labor income is eﬀectively a highly leveraged security with
large implicit exposure to the market portfolio.


                                                   27
    One obvious extension of our paper is to include housing.18 We note that Quan and Titman
(1997) ﬁnd that the real estate market is cointegrated with the stock market. This evidence suggests
that if one were to incorporate housing into the portfolio choice and model this cointegration, the
optimal investment in stocks would become even more negative.
    Although this paper focuses on the individual’s optimal portfolio and consumption choices
given the risk premium of the market as given, our ﬁndings might have important implications
for general equilibrium models that attempt to explain the ‘equity premium puzzle’.19 Indeed, as
pointed out by Basak and Cuoco (1998), by taking as given that a large proportion of investors do
not participate in the stock market, one need only attribute very reasonable levels of risk aversion
to those agents that do invest in stocks in order to explain the historical equity premium. Our
results indicate that it is optimal for a large proportion of agents in the economy to short, or
at least not participate in the equity market. Thus, the exogenous speciﬁcation of Basak and
Cuoco (1998) might be justiﬁable in a general equilibrium setting that considers two agent classes
that endogenously choose to participate in the stock market depending on their risk aversion and
long-run exposures to aggregate risk.20
    Further, since we ﬁnd that, in the presence of cointegration, the investment horizon has a
dramatic impact on portfolio holdings, this suggests it would be interesting to understand, within
an equilibrium model, the interaction of various cohorts or overlapping generations of households
whose labor income is cointegrated with long-term market performance.21 Within this setting, it
would be interesting to examine the eﬀect of possible changes to the Social Security system, e.g.,
the possibility of moving to a privatized retirement system in which retirement contributions earn
market-based rates of return (see, e.g., Abel (2001) and CCGM).
    Finally, our model suggests that labor income artiﬁcially generates a negative net supply of
risk-free securities. This prediction contrasts with the typical approach of assuming that the risk
free security is in zero net supply. We save these interesting questions for future research.


   18
      Several recent studies investigate the implications of real estate holding for asset pricing. See, e.g., Cocco (2000),
Flavin and Yamashita (2002), Hu (2002), Davidoﬀ (2003), and Yao and Zhang (2003).

(2004) and Vissing-Jørgensen and Attanasio (2003). Although not directly related, Bansal and Yaron (2004) inves-
tigate how long run AR(1) processes for earnings ﬂow can explain historical equity premiums.
   20
      More speciﬁcally, the fraction of human capital implicitly tied up in the stock market might vary by occupation.
This eﬀect, which is captured by diﬀerent values of the κ coeﬃcient in our model, has a signiﬁcant impact on portfolio
holdings. Further, we have demonstrated above that small diﬀerences in risk aversion can also yield heterogeneity in
stock market participation in our model.

Appendix A: Numerical Solution Approach
We solve the optimal portfolio and consumption problem (37), (38), and (39) by using the alternate
direction implicit (ADI) ﬁnite-diﬀerence method; see, e.g., Ames (1977). We follow Candler (1999)
and treat the non-linear terms in (38) ‘explicitly,’ thus reducing the problem to a sequence of tri-
diagonal systems of linear equations that can be solved easily using standard numerical methods.22
       As noted previously, via some transformations we are able to reduce the state space from four
state variables to two, namely, X and y. We evaluate the solution on a discrete state-space grid.
For y, we set the lower bound of the domain at ymin = y0 + θ T − 3 σ(y), and the upper bound at
                                 
ymax = y0 + 3 σ(y), where σ(y) = (ν12 + ν32 )/2 κ. We then construct the y-grid with a ∆y = 0.05
mesh. For X, we use Xmin = 0 and Xmax = 10, and construct the corresponding X-grid using a
∆X = 0.05 mesh.
       We solve the problem backwards, starting from the time T = 45 terminal condition (39) and
going all the way back to the initial date t = 0. We use a time step ∆t = 0.0005, which is further
broken down into time-increments of length ∆t/2 in each of the two steps of the ADI algorithm.
       We note that our numerical approach is robust to the choice of the time- and space-grid para-
meters. For instance, we have veriﬁed that using a ﬁner ∆X = ∆y = 0.01 mesh, in combination
with diﬀerent values of Xmax , ymin , and ymax , results in the same numerical solution for c and π.
       The boundary conditions are treated as follows. First, we note that at Xmin = 0 labor income is
zero. Thus, the Merton (1969) closed-form solution for optimal consumption holds and provides an
exact boundary condition, which we impose in our ﬁnite diﬀerence approach. Further, we note that
the second derivative of consumption with respect to the X state variable vanishes as X increases.
Thus, we impose the condition
                                               ∂ 2 c(Xmax , y)
                                                               = 0.                                           (52)
                                                     ∂X 2
       Economic intuition does not oﬀer exact boundary conditions at ymin and ymax . After some
experimentation, we have found that the third derivative of consumption with respect to the y
variable vanishes as y approaches the boundaries of its domain. Thus, we impose the conditions

                                   ∂ 3 c(X, y)
                                               = 0 , y = ymin and y = ymax .                                  (53)
                                        ∂y 3
We check the robustness of the solution to this approach by extending the range of the y-domain,
ﬁnding identical results. Further, we note that using a discretization of (38) that relies only on
  22
    We test our numerical approach in the special case of the Merton’s (1969) model, for which a closed-form
solution is known. In that case, the approximation error generated by the numerical solution method for the agent’s
consumption/investment policies is nearly zero.



                                                        29
internal points at ymin and ymax yields results identical to those obtained by imposing the boundary
condition (53).
