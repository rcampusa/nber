                                         ABSTRACT

In economies with a large informal sector firms can increase profits by reducing workers’ outside
options in that informal sector. We formalize this idea in a simple model of an agricultural
economy with plantation owners who lobby the government to enact coercive policies—e.g. the
eviction and incarceration of squatting small-hold farmers—that reduce the value to working
outside the formal sector. Using unique data for 14 British West Indies ‘sugar islands’ from the
year of slave emancipation in 1838 until 1913, we examine the impact of plantation owners’
power on wages and coercion-related incarceration. To gain identification, we utilize exogenous
variation in the ease with which smallholders could evade the plantation system in the different
islands over time. Where evading the plantation system became exogenously easier, planter
power declined, incarceration rates dropped, and agricultural wages rose, accompanied by a
decline in formal agricultural employment. Most of the wage increase can be statistically
explained by the reduced coercion of smallholders.

1 Introduction

Changes in the terms of trade that reduce labour demand should, in theory, reduce wages e.g.,

Stolper and Samuelson (1941) and Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson (1977). Yet the 19th century

collapse of world sugar prices did not reduce wages in the British West Indies sugar colonies.

Despite the fact that sugar in 1913 was worth just one quarter of what it had been in 1838, sugar

prices and wages were uncorrelated during 1838–1913.

   This paper explains this historical episode by appeal to the institutional changes that were

induced by international trade. A fall in the price of sugar reduces the rents from trade that

accrue to elites, which both reduces the resources available for investing in coercive institutions

and reduces the returns to those investments. As a result, institutions become less coercive and

wages rise. We take this insight to our historical setting of 14 British West Indies sugar colonies

from 1838 (the abolition of slavery) to 1913. At the start of the period, sugar prices were high and

the white planter elite used its political power over the legislature, the judiciary, and the police

to limit ex-slaves’ opportunities for earning a living off the plantation. This depressed wages. As

sugar prices and the rents from sugar exports declined, the planter elite reduced its investments

in coercive institutions, thus freeing up non-plantation opportunities for peasants. This raised

wages.

   A comparison of Barbados with the Virgin Islands illustrates. The left panel of figure 1 tracks

the share of sugar in total exports in Barbados and the Virgin Islands for 30 years after abolition,

during which sugar prices fell by a third. Barbados was so geographically suitable for sugar that

despite the price decline, sugar continued to account for 85% of all its exports. In contrast, Virgin

Island plantations were destroyed by a series of devastating hurricanes and rebuilding was made

unprofitable by the low price of sugar. As a result, sugar ceased being exported.

   In this setting, and bearing in mind that sugar is labour-intensive, the standard economic chan-

nel predicts that wages in the Virgin Islands should have declined relative to wages in Barbados. In

fact, the opposite was the case, as shown by the upward-sloping curve in the right panel of figure 1.

It tracks the difference between the log wages of the Virgin Islands and Barbados (ln wV I − ln wB ).

Relative wages rose by a full log point (270%) in just 20 years.

   Trade-induced institutional change explains why. In Barbados, the planter elite continued to

grow sugar on all available land (Engerman, 1982, 197), making it easy for the planter elite to

prevent former slaves from engaging in off-plantation activities. In contrast, many Virgin Island

planters abandoned their lands, making it hard for the remaining planters to exercise coercion:

They could not prevent ex-slaves from developing higher-paying, off-plantation work such as

raising livestock on small freehold plots (Dookhan, 1975, 136, 138).

                      The evidence from incarceration rates per capita is suggestive of coercion. The downward-

sloping curve in the right panel of figure 1 is the difference between incarceration rates in the

Virgin Islands and Barbados. Incarceration rates rose in Barbados and fell in the Virgin Islands,

leading to a 1.5 percentage-point relative fall, which is huge in comparison to the base incarcera-

tion rates of about 2 percentage points.

                      Generalizing this example, the main thesis of our paper is illustrated in figure 2. Let i index

colonies and t index years. The falling price of sugar (pt ) had two offsetting effects on wages (wit ).

The first operates through market forces in that lower sugar prices reduced the demand for labor,

thereby reducing wages. The second operates through institutional change in that lower sugar

prices made plantation sugar less profitable, thereby limiting the economic and political strength

of the planter elite (Nit ). This reduced the equilibrium level of coercion (Cit ), which made it easier

and more remunerative for peasants to work off the plantation. Consequently, wages rose. Figure

2 provides a coherent explanation for why we see no correlation between output prices and wages,

as well as for the divergent paths of Barbados and the Virgin Islands.

   Our example of Barbados and the Virgin Islands strongly suggests that one cannot understand

the impact of terms-of-trade movements on wages solely in term of the conventional market-

forces channel. One must also understand the role of the institutional-change channel. We are the

first to examine the institutional-change channel and the first to simultaneously estimate the wage

impacts of both channels.

   For estimation, we have developed a rich new panel dataset on the evolution of 14 British

West Indies sugar colonies from 1838 to 1913. Data are from the Colonial Blue Books and include

wages, incarceration rates per capita and exports by crop. We augment these data with new data

on the share of land that is suitable for sugar cane and on hurricane landfalls in order to provide

instruments for why sugar declined more rapidly in some colonies (e.g., the Virgin Islands) than

in others (e.g., Barbados).

   Our conclusion is that the puzzling zero correlation between sugar prices and wages is the

result of two offsetting terms-of-trade impacts, namely a negative market-forces impact and a

positive institutional-change impact. But this result, which averages across 14 colonies, disguises

important cross-colony differences. For colonies where sugar remained king the market-forces

channel dominated and wages fell by 24%. In contrast, for colonies where sugar collapsed en-

tirely the institutional-change channel dominated with the result that wages rose by 20% and

incarceration rates per capita fell by 53%.



                                                             3
    There is a compelling reason for why we chose the example of the sugar price collapse that

rocked the 19th century British West Indies. This historical episode allows us to uniquely track the

long-run economic and institutional evolution of 14 entities (colonies) that were initially similar.

Economically, all were slave societies until Abolition in 1838 and all were completely specialized in

sugar cane production. Institutionally, all had effective political and legal systems inherited from

Britain (including some of the Western Hemisphere’s first representative assemblies) and were

dominated by a small group of white planters. After 1838, the colonies evolved independently of

one another as a result of a hub-and-spoke trade system with Britain and the legislative, judicial,

and policing autonomy enjoyed by each colony.

    Here is precisely what we do: In section 2.1 we review the history of legal coercion in the British

West Indies. In sections 2.2—2.3 we show historically that the decline in world sugar prices pt was

exogenous to the British West Indies, that the share of sugar in total exports is an excellent measure

of the strength of the planter elite Nit , and that cross-colony differences in the rate at which Nit

declined can be explained by exogenous agro-climactic factors, especially suitability for sugar

cane cultivation and hurricanes. In section 3 we develop a model that motivates our empirical

specification. In section 4 we describe the Colonial Blue Book data, including data on wages (wit ),

incarceration rates (Cit ) and sugar export shares (Nit ).

    In section 5 we present our core results, which involve two regressions: ln wit = βNit + γ ln pt

and Cit = β ′ Nit + γ ′ ln pt where for brevity we ignore error terms, fixed effects and all other re-

gressors. We estimate βb < 0 and βb′ > 0 i.e., the weakening of the planter elite raised wages and

reduced incarceration rates per capita. This is the institutional-change channel. We also estimate

γ         b′ = 0 i.e., the adverse terms-of-trade shock lowered wages and had no effect on incar-
b > 0 and γ

ceration rates per capita. This is the market-forces channel. In section 6 we instrument Nit with

sugar suitability and hurricanes and find that the OLS and IV estimates are precisely estimated to

be equal so that we can reject the endogeneity of Nit .1 Section 8 concludes.

    Turning to a literature review, there is a small literature that examines the impact of global-

ization on institutional dynamics, which in turn has implications for long-run wage dynamics.

Seminal contributions are Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson’s (2005) study of how the Atlantic
   1
     In section 7 we move to the sub-colony (parish) level and find a positive relationship between mortality rates and
the share of land under sugar cane cultivation even after controlling for colony-year fixed effects. This implies that our
findings of coercive institutions cannot be explained away by unobservables at the colony-year level.

trade affected European property rights institutions and Greif’s (2005; 2006a) study of how me-

dieval long-distance trade gave birth to markets characterized by impersonal exchange. Both

institutional changes led to improved living standards and, in particular, to rising wages. See also

Engerman and Sokoloff (1997), Sokoloff and Engerman (2000), Greif (2006b), La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes and Shleifer (2008), Levchenko (2007, 2013), Nunn (2008), Nunn and Wantchekon (2011),

Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), and Puga and Trefler (2014). Each of these papers postulates an

institutional-change channel in which terms-of-trade movements affect the domestic distribution

of wealth and power, which in turn leads to institutional changes that potentially affect wages.2

       The particular institution we examine is ‘legal coercion,’ by which we mean the use of leg-

islative, judicial, and policing powers to exclude some or most members of society from the full

benefits of participating in the market economy. Legal coercion is analyzed in Greif (2005) and

frames Acemoglu and Robinson’s (2012, ch. 9) study of Apartheid.

       Legal coercion is also central to the two papers most closely related to our own, namely, Naidu

and Yuchtman (2013) and Bobonis and Morrow (2014). The latter examine coffee in Puerto Rico

between 1849 and 1874, a period in which unskilled workers were forced to work for landowners.

They show that positive coffee price shocks led to increased coercion by Puerto Rican landowners

and to distorted investments in human capital.

       Naidu and Yuchtman (2013) is not about international trade, but the analysis is of obvious

relevance and elegance. They examine how the British Master and Servant law affected labour

demand shocks associated with movements in the prices of industrial goods. Before the law was

abolished (1858–1875), positive price shocks did not translate into higher wages. Instead, workers

who sought higher-paying jobs were prosecuted for breach of their Master and Servant labour

contracts. After abolition (1876–1890), wages rose in counties where prosecutions had been most

common and wages became more responsive to demand shocks. We depart from Naidu and

Yuchtman (2013) in several meaningful ways. First, their institutional change (abolition of Master

and Servant law) is exogenous to their mechanism whereas institutional change is endogenous

to ours. Second and related, their time frame is relatively short and their focus is on higher-

    Most of these papers deal with per capita incomes rather than wages, but the link is clear. See also the contributions
by González de Lara (2008), Naritomi, Soares and Assuncao (2012), and Bruhn and Gallego (2012) as well as the survey
by Nunn and Trefler (2014). Additionally, there are related papers on the impact of international trade on financial
development, including Rajan and Zingales (2003) and Do and Levchenko (2007).

frequency shocks whereas we are concerned with a longer 76-year time frame. Third, they deal

with a specific labour contract (see also Naidu 2010) whereas we deal with a pervasive system of

legal coercion.

       Any historical paper on the terms of trade and wages must pay homage to the remarkable

scholarship of Jeffrey Williamson and his coauthors (O’Rourke and Williamson, 2001; Clemens

and Williamson, 2004; Williamson, 2006; Blattman, Hwang and Williamson, 2007). This body of

work shows conclusively that the market-forces channel is central for understanding the terms-of-

trade impacts on wages. Our work shows that where interest focuses on long-term wage move-

ments in labour markets that are coercive — there are few of these in Williamson’s samples — one

must additionally consider the institutional-change channel.

       Finally, there are several regional literatures on international trade and coercive labour mar-

kets. Most famously, the Brenner Debate is about the export-led second serfdom and the cor-

responding rise of coercion in Eastern Europe (Domar, 1970; Brenner, 1976; Aston and Philpin,

1985). There is also a literature on how Latin American planter interests have dominated govern-

ments in order to secure cheap labour through coercion e.g., McCreery (1986) and Paige (1998).

Robinson and Baland (2008) document that in the Chilean inquilinos system, large landowners

controlled the votes of smallholders living on their land and were thereby able to turn control of

labor into political capital. Dell (2010) shows how the mita system of forced mining in Peru and

Bolivia (1573–1812) continues to have negative impacts today. Unlike Dell, our paper is not about

the persistent effects of institutions. Finally, Dippel and Carvalho (2014) examine transitions from

democracy to autocracy in the British West Indies during the 19th century. Such transitions play

no role in our analysis.3



2 History

26 years separated the abolition of the slave trade (1807) from the passing of An Act for the Aboli-

tion of Slavery (1833). In the intervening generation, the powerful West Indies Sugar Interest came
   3
    Dippel and Carvalho (2014) begin by observing that in the British West Indies franchise eligibility was often based
on land ownership. As the sugar economy was gradually replaced by smallhold agriculture, voting patterns turned
against the planter elite. In response, the elite in several colonies demanded that parliament abolish itself and reconsti-
tute the colonies as Crown colonies. This took legislative authority out of the hands of voters and put it in the hands of
executive councils appointed in London. Our current paper has nothing to do with such transitions from democracy to
autocracy, though they complement our study.

to accept the inevitability of emancipation. A few colonies even welcomed emancipation with its

promise of a generous compensation package. In Barbados and Antigua the planter elite owned

and cultivated almost all of the land, leaving former slaves with no other option than to work on

the plantation. Emancipation was therefore not expected to affect labour costs, profitability or the

political and social status quo (Merivale 1861, 339–340; Engerman 1984, 134). However, in most

colonies, emancipation was anticipated with a sense of impending doom. Where sugar was in the

ascendancy, as in Guyana and Trinidad, wages were expected to rise dramatically because labour

was scarce and would become scarcer once former slaves started carving out farms from the hin-

terland. Where sugar was in decline, as in Jamaica, the prognosis was equally gloomy (Merivale

1861, 340–341; Engerman 1984, 134 and table 2) because wages were expected to rise as freed

slaves squatted on abandoned estates or purchased small ‘freehold’ plots in the mountains. Thus,

the view held in most colonies was that after emancipation, former slaves would abandon plan-

tation work in favour of subsistence farming on freehold land. Labour shortages would ensue,

wages would rise sharply, and planters would be bankrupted.4

       When emancipation finally came on August 1, 1838, former slaves immediately fled the plan-

tations. In many colonies upwards of one-half were gone by early Fall (e.g., Hall 1978, 58; Riviere

1972, 13) and although many were back by Spring for want of work, wages spiked. This situation

did not last long. Across the 14 colonies, Colonial Blue Book data indicate that wages remained

high only until 1845, and by 1848 wages had fallen back to pre-emancipation levels as planters

mastered the use of legal coercion.


2.1 Legal Coerction

In our context, ‘legal coercion’ means the use of colonial laws, courts, and police to prevent former

slaves from farming legally on freeholds or farming illegally on abandoned plantations and Crown

land. Legal coercion was the hallmark planter response to emancipation. To understand the forms

it took in the British West Indies, one must understand the points of conflict between planters and
   4
    The view was held by all Tories (e.g., Sir Robert Peel, 1853, 706) and by many Whigs (e.g., Colonel Leith Hay in
Great Britain Parliament 1834, 172). The view was even held by some Abolitionists e.g., Sir Henry Taylor wrote in his
autobiography: “I did not believe that, when freed [the negro] would continue to work on the plantations for any wages
which the planter could afford to pay.” (Taylor, 1885, 125). Finally, it was held by Oxford professor Herman Merivale,
the greatest contemporary authority on colonial economics, who argued in his 1839–41 lectures that in Guyana and
Trinidad, negroes are “indisposed to labour, to which they can only be tempted by the most exorbitant offers of wages”
(Merivale, 1861, 317).


                                                          7
former slaves. The planters wanted low wages as well as a supply of labour that was both steady

throughout the year and flexible enough to accommodate the peak demands of harvest during

which employees were expected to work about 90 hours a week (Higman, 1984, 182–183). In

contrast, the former slaves wanted, among other things, less restrictive labour laws, more freedom

of movement, and either title to land with secure property rights or greater access to their pre-

emancipation cottages and provision grounds where they grew food and cash crops (Marshall,

1996b).5

    There were four common types of legal coercion. First, arrangements between planters and

peasants came to be interpreted as an implicit contract obliging peasants to work for the entire

year and to work long hours at harvest time. As a result, disputes over wages and hours were

common (Wilmot, 1996, 50). This implicit contract shared similarities with the Master and Servant

law that is the focus of Naidu and Yuchtman (2013), except that the terms were harsher. For one,

the hours were extremely long. For another, peak labour demand came during the sugar and

provisions harvests and, since these two harvests coincided, the implicit contract forced peasants

to neglect their own harvest (Eisner, 1961, 210). Most important historically, the contract often

included annual use of a cottage and provision lands. In the view of ex-slaves, these cottages and

provision lands were supposed to become theirs after emancipation (Marshall 1996b, 18; Satchell

1990, 68). However, the planter-dominated legal system quickly disabused ex-slaves of any such

notions. Instead, cottages and provision grounds were treated by planters as a bond for breach

of contract: If a peasant left mid-season or failed to work long hours during the harvest then

the planter evicted the peasant from his cottage and destroyed his crops. Smith (2011, 228–229)

provides a vivid account of such an eviction. Such punishments were quickly legalized by a body

of coercive law called ‘tenancy-at-will’ e.g., Bolland (1981, 595), Dookhan (1975, 130), and Brizan

(1984, 128).

    Second, former slaves wanted access to cheap land with full legal title. Planters responded

with a host of restrictions. Large tracks of Crown land were either kept off the market, made

available only at artificially high prices, or sold only in large lot sizes e.g., Craton (1997, 390–

393). For example, 83% of Trinidad’s landmass was owned by the Crown, yet it was kept off
    5
      A common misconception is that planters were monopsonists in labour markets. Monopsony power was an excep-
tion to the rule: Planters often bargained individually with their workers and workers often organized plantation-level
strikes. See Wilmot (1996).



                                                          8
the market until the large-scale arrival of East Indian indentured labourers (Sewell, 1861, 103,

106, 133). Also, to prevent peasants from pooling their resources to buy and either subdivide or

collectively administer plantations, these practices were prohibited and planters were pressured

socially not to sell e.g., Eisner (1961, 211) and Craton (1997, 390). Not only was land held back, it

was actively repossessed by the government. Satchell (1990, ch. 4 and table 4.3) documents that

18,000 acres of Jamaican smallholds were repossessed after 1869 for failure to pay taxes (quitrents).

In addition, the tax system was designed to penalize smallholders. Total taxes on a small plot were

often substantially higher than on a large estate and export taxes were sometimes higher on the

products of provision grounds than on sugar e.g., Underhill (1895, xvii). Holt (1992, 202–213)

provides a detailed discussion of Jamaica’s regressive taxes.

       Third, squatting was so rampant that it seriously undermined the ability of planters to keep

peasants on plantations. In Jamaica there were 10,000 squatters by 1844 and this number probably

climbed to 40,000 by the mid-1860s (Eisner, 1961, 215–216). Given the size of the problem, the full

force of the law was brought to bear on peasants who attempted to squat on abandoned estates

or Crown land. The Colonial Blue Books list the titles of all colonial statutes and a quick perusal

shows that every colony repeatedly enacted and strengthened trespass and vagrancy laws in or-

der to prevent squatting. Further, local magistrates, who were often former plantation overseers

(McLewin, 1987, 85–87), strengthened enforcement of these statutes by converting trespasses into

larcenies so that a peasant who so much as set foot on an abandoned estate could be thrown in

jail. This abusive practice was so common that even Jamaica’s Governor Eyre complained of it

(Morrell, 1969, 407). Of the many types of legal coercion, anti-squatting laws were the ones most

likely to cause imprisonment.6

       Fourth, immigration and emigration policy was used to depress wages by expanding the sup-

ply of labour. Authorities in Trinidad, Guyana, and Jamaica funded the immigration of East Indian

indentured labour to work on plantations e.g., Laurence (1971). Further, former slaves in many

colonies faced restrictions on outmigration (e.g., Bolland 1981, 594), a fact that is reflected in the

low number of emigrants recorded in the Colonial Blue Books7
   6
     This will be relevant for the empirics in two ways: It means that legal coercion can be measured by incarceration
rates and it means that incarceration rates are an imperfect measure of coercion in that they capture only one of our
four dimensions of coercion.
   7
     There were some exceptions, such as Montserrat and Nevis (Hall, 1971, tables 1 and 5).




                                                          9
   The widespread use of these four types of legal coercion was described and disparaged by

many contemporaries, both in the colonies and in Britain. After carefully documenting many of

the above practices, William Hancock (1852, 14) wrote:

      [W]e have had a mass of colonial legislation, all dictated by the most short-sighted but

      intense and disgraceful selfishness, endeavouring to restrict free labour by interfering

      with wages, by unjust taxation, by unjust restrictions, by oppressive and unequal laws

      respecting contracts, by the denial of security of [land] tenure, and by impeding the

      sale of land.”

Legal coercion was a fact of life for peasants of the British West Indies.


2.2 Terms-of-Trade Shocks and Institutional Change

This portrait of legal coercion represents the state of affairs across the British West Indies at mid-

century. Our main thesis is that the secular decline in sugar prices during 1838–1913 weakened the

institutions that supported legal coercion and thus raised wages. In this subsection we describe

this process.

   During the course of the eighteenth century, West Indies sugar faced increased competition

from new sugar cane producers and from European beet sugar. See the left-hand panel of figure

3. This had two major impacts. First, the share of world sugar output produced by our 14 West

Indies colonies declined from 17% in 1838 to an inconsequential 1% in 1913. See the right-hand

panel of figure 3. Second, the price of sugar collapsed. Figure 4 plots the time series of the London

price of sugar, which was where almost all British West Indies sugar was sold. In 1913, the price of

sugar was just one quarter of what it had been in 1838 (e5.74−4.47 ≈ 1/4). The secular decline in the

price of sugar was entirely beyond the control of West Indies planters. Econometrically speaking,

it was exogenous. It was also the main cause of the decline of British West Indies sugar e.g., Curtin

(1954).

   The impact of declining world sugar prices on plantations and legal coercion is graphically

illustrated in figure 5 for the case of Jamaica. The black and grey areas are sugar plantations that

were active in 1790. The black areas are sugar plantations that were active in 1890. Thus, the

grey areas show the very substantial decline of sugar plantations. The grey areas also provide an

Notes: This figure plots the log of the London price of sugar. Two events stand out. As part of the repeal of the Corn
Laws and the move to Free Trade, Britain’s preferential tariff on West Indies sugar was phased out over the period
1846–54 (Curtin, 1954). Second, France and Germany subsidized domestic production of beet sugar during 1884–1903,
which further drove down sugar prices.

important insight into one of two obstacles to legal coercion that planters faced: It was increasingly

costly to keep peasants off of the rapidly growing stock of high-quality, unused land. The result

was that Jamaican peasants left the plantations in droves and either bought small freeholds or

squatted. The number of freeholds was 2,114 in 1838, 19,397 in 1845, 50,000 in 1860 and 111,957 in

1890. This growth created the second obstacle to legal coercion: Peasants were a growing economic

and political force.

       Trade statistics mirror these two obstacles. Between 1850 and 1890 the share of Jamaican ex-

ports originating from freeholds and squatters rose spectacluarly from 10.4% to 39.0%. “Increasing

prosperity of the peasantry is thus seen to be mainly due to their growing share in export crops”

(Eisner, 1961, 235). The flip side of this was the decline of sugar exports: Between 1850 and 1890

the share of sugar in total exports fell from 77% to 25%.8

       For our other 13 colonies, there is much less data available on (i) the declining acreage of

sugar plantations, (ii) the rising number of freeholders and squatters, and (iii) the growing peasant

participation in exports. For colonies where such data are available, all three trends are clearly

    Data on freeholds and peasant exports are from Eisner (1961, 220, 221, and 234). Sugar export data are from the
Colonial Blue Books.

manifest (Riviere, 1972, 15-17). Further, Marshall (1968, 253–254) concludes from his survey of the

British West Indies that the period from roughly 1850 to 1900 was one of “continuing expansion

of the number of peasants and, more important, a marked shift by the peasants to export crop

production.” Thus, as in the Jamaican case, the three trends are correlated with the fall in sugar’s

share of total exports.

   We have thus laboriously compiled Colonial Blue Book data on sugar exports (including mo-

lasses and rum). Figure 6 displays sugar exports as a share of total exports by colony. It is crucial

for our paper. The figure is a bit of an eye chart so it is best to focus on the two dominant features.

First, in 1838 every colony was highly specialized in sugar. Second, by 1913 there were substantial

cross-colony differences in sugar export shares. Colonies roughly divided into three groups.

   • Group 1: Five colonies remained heavily involved in sugar for the entire period (Antigua,

      Barbados, Guyana, St. Kitts, and Nevis).

   • Group 2: Three colonies saw sugar decline to less than half of total exports (St. Lucia,

      Trinidad and Tobago).

   • Group 3: Five colonies exited sugar entirely by the end of period (Virgin Islands, Grenada,

      Dominca, St. Vincent, and Montserrat).
Jamaica had characteristics that are between groups 2 and 3.

   The declining power of planters relative to peasant freeholders and squatters was most pro-

nounced in the third group, less pronounced in the second group, and largely absent in the first

group. This historical fact will not be obvious except to students of Caribbean history because one

might conjecture that planters simply moved into other plantation crops. This was not the case.

   Figure 7 displays the major export crops for colonies in groups 2 and 3. The thin dashed line

is the export share of sugar and the thick line is the export share of the most important non-sugar

crop. A thick dashed line is added where there is a second important non-sugar crop. The title

of the panel names the colony and crop. For example, the top left panel shows that in the Virgin

Islands sugar was displaced by livestock. Livestock was exclusively a peasant activity in the Virgin

Islands (Harrigan and Varlack 1975, 64–65; Dookhan 1975, 138).

   The first conclusion to emerge from figure 7 is that sugar was not replaced by the other highly

lucrative plantation crops of the Western Hemisphere, namely, cotton and coffee. Cotton was only

important in Montserrat, and only at the very end of our period. Coffee was grown in Jamaica, but

                                                  13

Notes: This figure reports the share of sugar in total exports. Nevis is not reported because it stayed between 0.95 and
1.00 throughout. Also, Nevis merged with larger St. Kitts in 1883 and Tobago merged with larger Trinidad in 1899.
Each series is lowess smoothed. (The smoothed data faithfully reproduce trends in the raw data as can be seen by

freeholders and squatters accounted for two-thirds of total production (Eisner 1961, 217; Amer-

ican and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society 1849, 97; Lewis 1986, 72). Figure 7 shows that sugar was

replaced by whatever crop was best suited to the local microclimate. These crops were cocoa,

limes, livestock, arrowroot and bananas. None of these crops generated the spectacular returns

associated with sugar during its heyday. That is, the collapse of sugar prices and the transition

out of sugar significantly diminished the economic clout of planters from what it had been on the

eve of emancipation.

                                  The second conclusion to emerge from figure 7 relates to the export share of new crops (cocoa,

limes, livestock, arrowroot, coffee and bananas). The larger was this share, the greater was peasant

involvement in exports. In group-3 colonies, freeholders and squatters were active producers

of cocoa in Grenada, arrowroot in St. Vincent, and livestock in the Virgin Islands. In group-

2 colonies, planters dominated livestock in Tobago and controlled most but by no means all of

cocoa in Trinidad and St. Lucia. In group-1 colonies, sugar was the only major export and it was

dominated by planters. These facts are carefully documented in Appendix A. Thus, there was a

negative correlation between the export share of sugar and peasant participation in export crops.

       Putting these two conclusions together, the sharper was the decline in a colony’s export share

of sugar, the greater was the decline in planter power and the greater was the rise in peasant

participation in the market economy.9


2.3 The Differential Decline of Sugar and Identification of the Institutional Channel

We have argued that on the eve of emancipation our 14 colonies had identical economies (com-

plete specialization in sugar) and identical institutional arrangements (powerful elites using legal

coercion). Why then did the sugar economy collapse in some colonies but not in others? Restated,

should we think of the evolution of sugar exports as exogenous or endogenous to the main processes

we wish to describe, namely, the evolution of wages and legal coercion? There are good reasons

to think that it may have been endogenous. For example, in some colonies planters mechanized

early on and in other colonies planters imported indentured East Indian labour, both of which are

endogenous choices that slowed the decline of sugar. However, we now argue that these were

secondary factors.

       The historical record strongly suggests that the main factors behind the differential collapse

of sugar were agro-climactic and hence exogenous. To establish this fact we hired a specialist to

develop an index of each colony’s suitability for sugarcane cultivation and each colony’s incidence

of hurricanes. Details are described below in section 6.1. Figure 8 plots each colony’s 1913 share

of sugar in total exports against its share of land that is suitable for sugar. There is a very tight

relationship between the two, which highlights the fact that much of the differential decline in

sugar shares can be explained by differences in exogenous sugar suitability. Only Grenada and the

Virgin Islands have 1913 sugar shares that cannot be explained by sugar suitability. Grenada’s

exceptionalism is simple: Grenada is good for sugar, but perfect for cocoa (Richardson, 1997, 193)

so its sugar decline is explained by exogenous cocoa suitability. The Virgin Islands’ early exit

from sugar is due to hurricanes in 1848, 1852, 1867 and 1871 which destroyed the colony’s sugar
   9
    Peasant participation translated into at least some political power. The earnings of urban professionals such as
merchants, lawyers and surveyors came from servicing the growing peasant economy. As a result, the fortunes of rural
peasants and urban professionals were tied together. Small freeholders voted for these professionals, thus giving peas-
ants at least some political representation. Holt (1992, 217–227) documents this relationship for the case of Jamaica: By
mid-century, the Planter Party had lost its parliamentary majority to the Town Party and as many as 38% of legislators

infrastructure and left planters too indebted to rebuild given the low price of sugar. That is, the

Virgin Islands’ early exit from sugar was due to exogenous hurricanes. Thus, sugar’s differential

decline is largely explained by exogenous agro-climactic factors. This will inform our use of sugar

suitability and hurricanes as instruments for the decline of sugar. It will also explain why our

first-stage statistics are good and why our IV and OLS estimates are so similar that we can reject

endogeneity of the decline of sugar.



3 A Simple Model of Coercive Labor Market Institutions

Before turning to the econometric work, we will need a model to structure our thinking about a

host of specification issues, including choice of covariates and the direction of possible endogene-

ity bias.

    We consider a small open economy that produces two goods, sugar with exogenous price

p > 0 and food (the numeraire good). There is an exogenous measure L of workers (former



                                                                                            17

slaves), an endogenous measure N of planters (members of the planter elite), and a continuum of

heterogeneous land indexed by i. Land can be planted in either plantation sugar or freehold food.

In plantation sugar, one planter and one worker on ‘plot’ i produce ϕx(i) units of sugar where i

is ordered so that x′ < 0 and ϕ is a productivity shifter. In freehold food one worker on plot i

produces Φ − i units of food.

   The mass N of planters occupy the most productive plots (i ∈ [0, N ]) and grow sugar. This

is the legacy of the slave economy. Since each planter employs one worker, there remains a mass

L − N of workers producing freehold food. In principle, these workers could occupy plots (N, L].

However, coercion of level C prevents them from using plots (N, N + C] and forces them onto

the inferior plots (N + C, L + C]. See figure 9. Thus, coercion C worsens the outside options of

workers employed by planters. This relationship between outside options and coercion figures

prominently in Acemoglu and Wolitzky (2011).

   The determination of wages in the colonies was complex so we focus on the two most impor-

tant features. First, the fall in sugar prices lowered labour demand and hence depressed wages.

Second, the availability of outside options, particularly freehold farming, increased wages. We

provide the simplest possible model of wage determination that delivers these two features and

note that many other models also do so.

   On each planter’s estate there lives an ex-slave who claims customary rights to a cottage lo-

cated on the estate. If the planter and worker agree on a wage w then together they generate sugar

income pϕx(i). If they fail to agree on a wage then the worker relocates to the most marginal plot

i = L+C where he earns Φ−L−C. For simplicity alone we assume that the planter receives 0. We

use generalized Nash bargaining over the surplus pϕx(i) − (Φ − L − C). The planter’s bargaining

weight is θ(N ) where 0 < θ(0) ≤ θ(·) < 1. We assume θN ≥ 0 to allow for the possibility that


                                               18
the stronger is the planter elite (N large) the more each planter receives; however, this is a minor

feature of the model. The Nash solution provides the worker with:


                      w(i, C, N ) = (1 − θ(N )) pϕx(i) + θ(N ) (Φ − L − C) .                                      (1)


Thus, wages w are increasing in the price of sugar p and the outside option Φ − L − C, which are

the two features of wage determination we had set out to model.


3.1 The Politics of Coercion

Coercion uses state resources such as passing vagrancy laws and enforcing them to prevent squat-

ting on the fallow lands (N, N +C]. We assume that these costs are given by C γ where γ > 1. These

costs are funded by a head tax on planters of C γ /N . Therefore, profits are pϕx(i) − w(i, C, N ) −

C γ /N or:

                     π(i, C, N ) = θ(N ) pϕx(i) − θ(N ) (Φ − L − C) − C γ /N .                                    (2)

   We use Grossman and Helpman’s (1994) ‘Protection for Sale’ framework to determine the level

of coercion C. We begin by assuming that all sugar is exported and agents only consume food so

that we can equate utility with profits and income. C is chosen to maximize a weighted sum of

the profits of planters, the wages of plantation workers, and the income of freeholders:

                               Z       N                     Z       N                     Z   L+C
               W (C) = α(N )               π(i, C, N )di +               w(i, C, N )di +              (Φ − i)di   (3)
                                   0                             0                             N +C


subject to C ≥ 0. α(N ) is the weight given to planters’ profits. We assume ∂α(N )/∂N > 0 so that

the larger is the plantation economy, the more influence planters have over the level of coercion.

This is our key assumption. We also assume α(0) = 1 so that as the measure of planters becomes

small they are treated on par with plantation workers and freeholders.

   An increase in coercion C affects W via three channels. First, it forces freeholders onto less

productive land, which lowers W . Second, it uses real resources (C γ ), which also lowers W .

These two channels push the optimal level of coercion towards 0. Third, an increase in coercion

transfers income from plantation workers to planters. When α = 1 this pure transfer has no effect

on W , but when α > 1 the pure transfer raises W . It follows that when planters are weak (N ≈ 0


                                                         19
and α(N ) ≈ 1), the optimal level of coercion is C = 0. Conversely, when planters are strong, the

third channel dominates and the optimal level of coercion is C > 0. As shown in Appendix B.1

where W (C) is written out in full, there is a critical planter strength N C with 0 < N C < L such

that C(N ) = 0 for N < N C and

                                                                          1
                                        θ(N ) α(N ) − 1 L − N              γ−1
                       C(N ) =        N                −                         for N ≥ N C .                        (4)
                                          γ     α(N )    γα(N )

Further, CN > 0 for N > N C . The insight is simple: the stronger is the planter elite, the greater is

its political influence (as measured by α) and hence the higher is the level of coercion.


3.2 The Marginal Planter N ∗

A measure M of potential English planters are randomly assigned plots i ∈ [0, M ]. (The determi-

nation of M is described in the next subsection.) Having received a plot, a planter can either plant

sugar or return to England and earn W . The marginal planter i = N ∗ therefore earns


                                        e(N ∗ ) ≡ π(N ∗ , C(N ∗ ), N ∗ ) = W
                                        π                                                                             (5)


where the notation builds on equation (2). Appendix B.2 provides restrictions on x(i) and W

which ensure that there exists a unique solution N ∗ ∈ (0, L) to equation (5).10


3.3 Free Entry of Planters and General Equilibrium

In this subsection we deal with theoretical issues surrounding general equilibrium, issues that play

no role in the empirics to come. All but the most interested readers will want to skim through the

following discussion. Closing the model, we must endogenize the mass M of entrants. There is
  10
    This footnote gathers together a number of disparate comments about assumptions that may trouble the more
theoretical reader. (1) Uniqueness plays no role for our comparative statics: It is assumed in order to avoid mathematical
details that do not inform our empirics. This is proven in Appendix B.2 where uniqueness is abandoned. (2) We can
allow the planter to also plant food. In that case we must assume that Φ < W so that an Englishman who plants food
receives Φ − i < Φ < W and hence prefers returning to England over planting food. (3) The planter’s outside option
need not be 0. More generally, we can assume that in the event of disagreement the planter produces a fraction δ of
ϕx(i) and so receives the outside option δpϕx(i). This generalization requires only one very minor modification of our
model, namely, that the Nash bargaining weight θ be replaced by δ + (1 − δ)θ. (4) All our results hold with C γ /N
replaced by the more general cost function χ(C, N ) where χC > 0, χCC > 0 and χCN < 0. (5) We need to assume that
the surplus in any planter-worker pair is positive. That is, pϕx(i) > Φ − L − C for all i. Noting that pϕx(i) > pϕx(L)
and Φ > Φ − L − C, a sufficient condition for a positive surplus is pϕx(L) > Φ.

an infinite pool of potential planters, each of whom chooses between two alternatives. (1) Stay in

England and earn W . (2) Pay a fixed cost f and be randomly assigned a plot i ∈ [0, M ] where M

is the mass of potential planters who pay the fixed cost. (M corresponds to Me in Melitz (2003).)

Fixed costs use English resources, not Caribbean resources.

   In equilibrium, each entrant must be indifferent between alternatives (1) and (2) so that:

                                   Z       N∗                              

                                                  π(i, C(N ), N )di + 1 − ∗       W −f =W .        (6)

That is, an entrant pays f and randomly draws a plot i. With probability N ∗ /M ∗ the entrant draws
                                                           R N∗
a plot i < N ∗ , plants sugar and earns on average (N ∗ )−1 0 π(i, C(N ∗ ), N ∗ )di. With probability

1 − N ∗ /M ∗ the entrant draws a plot i > N ∗ , returns to England and earns W .

   An equilibrium is a mass of entrants M ∗ , a mass of planters N ∗ , and a level of coercion C(N ∗ )

such that plantation-worker earnings satisfy equation (1), a worker on freeholder plot i earns Φ−i,

planter profits satisfy equation (2), the maximizer of W (C) in equation (3) is C(N ∗ ) of equation

(4), the planter on the marginal estate i = N ∗ is indifferent between staying and leaving (equation

5), and entrants M ∗ are indifferent between entering and not entering (equation 6). Appendix

B.3 proves that an equilibrium exists, is unique, is interior in the sense that 0 < N ∗ < L and is

characterized by figure 9.


3.4 Comparative Statics

We now consider how the comparative statics of the model can inform the empirical specification.

Totally differentiating equation (1) yields:


   dw = (1 − θ)ϕx dp − [θCN + (pϕx − Φ + L + C)θN ]dN + (1 − θ)px dϕ + |{z}
                                                                        θ d(Φ − L) .
        | {z }          |{z} |         {z       }       | {z }
               +                     +                       +                    +           +
                                                                                                   (7)

That is, wages are increasing in the price of sugar p, in sugar productivity ϕ and the exogenous

component of the outside option (Φ − L). In contrast, wages are decreasing in the size of the

plantation elite N because N influences both the level of coercion (CN > 0) and the share of the

surplus that goes to the planter (θN > 0). Totally differentiating equation (4) yields:

Equations (7)–(8) are illustrated in figure 10. A fall in the price of sugar sets off market forces that

lower the value of the marginal product of labour and hence depress wages. The fall in the price of

sugar also sets off institutional forces by weakening the planter elite (N ∗↓). This reduces coercion

(C(N ∗ ) ↓) and hence raises wages. If in addition θN > 0 then there is a secondary mechanism

whereby the fall in N reduces θ, which directly reduces wages.

       Equations (7)–(8) and figure 10 motivate our core regressions:

where i indexes colonies, t indexes years, Nit is our measure of the strength of the plantation

4 Data Sources

4.1     Colonial Blue Books

Starting in the mid-1830s, the colonial administration began collecting statistics on local conditions

in its colonies. Each colony filled out an annual Blue Book and sent it to London where it is now

stored in the British National Archives. We photographed the relevant pages of the archived Blue

Books, manually entered the relevant data into spreadsheets, and built a detailed panel data set on

wages, legal coercion, and exports. The panel runs from 1838 to 1913 and includes our 14 colonies.

      The Blue Books report daily wages for ‘predial’ workers i.e., for agricultural workers who might

move from plantation to plantation without a contract and without transfers in kind such as rental

of a cottage or use of provision lands. In a handful of cases, wages were reported as weekly or

monthly, in which case we divided them by 5 or 20. In a few other cases, wages were reported

as a range, in which case we used the midpoint. Where possible we have compared our wage

data to wages cited in contemporary sources such as Sewell (1861). Wages are very sticky and as

a result we also considered smoothing them using moving averages of 1 to 3 years. Smoothing

strengthens our results, but we do not report these. Since wages are nominal, we attempted to

construct a cost-of-living index, but key components of such an index (food and clothing) were

imported from Britain and so had the same price in every colony. As a result, the cost of living

moved in tandem across colonies and is absorbed by year fixed effects. (Import data by origin of

imports are from the Blue Books.)

      The Blue Books report extensive data on the value of exports by crop. For 1838–1854 and 1913,

our export data come directly from the Blue Books. For 1854–1912, export data are from the annual

Statistical Tables Relating to the Colonial and Other Possessions of the United Kingdom. These Statistical

Tables – available on line at the House of Commons Parliamentary Papers Online Database – report

on a subset of the Blue Books data, allowing us to economize on trips to the National Archive. We

verified that data in the Statistical Tables and Blue Books are identical.

      Sugar prices, and indeed all export prices that we use, are from Blattman et al. (2007). Because

of sugar’s importance to our study, we verified that the prices in Blattman et al. (2007) are practi-


                                                   23
cally identical to Deere (1950), the seminal work on the subject. The Blue Books sometimes report

sugar exports in quantities, which allowed us to compute short series on sugar prices. These short

series all moved in exactly the same way as the sugar-price series in Blattman et al. (2007) and

Deere (1950). Finally, the main cross-sectional characteristics of our 14 colonies in 1838 appear in

online appendix table 1.


4.2 Legal Coercion

Ideally, we want four measures of legal coercion, one for each of the four types of legal coercion

documented above. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to find long time series on (1) statutes

governing tenancy-at-will or related legal cases, (2) land-use restrictions or land-price data, (3)

statutes on trespass or related convictions, or (4) restrictions on emigration or related emigration

statistics. We do have data on immigration of indentured East Indian workers from Roberts and

Byrne (1966).

       The one series that we consistently have across colonies and time is the Blue Book data on

incarceration rates per capita. This is the flow of new incarcerations per year divided by the

population. While the data are consistently available, they have two shortcomings. First, they

reflect only one of our four types of legal coercion. Second, we do not know the reason for the

incarceration i.e., they include incarcerations for reasons other than trespass and vagrancy.12

       Nevertheless, Brizan (1984, 134) reports that in Grenada, two-thirds of court cases from 1850

to as late as 1890 involved legal coercion. Grenada was likely typical in this respect. Further, the

history of West Indies riots indicates that legal coercion was often behind increases in incarcera-

tion rates. By far the most important rebellion in the British West Indies during 1838–1913 was

Jamaica’s Morant Bay Rebellion (1865). At the time, a number of villages had illegally been estab-

lished on Crown lands in the hills above Morant Bay. Tensions ran high as the government sought

to limit any further expansion of these villages. Things came to a head during a trespass case

involving a villager who had been pasturing on an abandoned estate (Underhill, 1895, page 59).

A crowd gathered at the courthouse, violence broke out and quickly spread throughout Jamaica.

600 people died and many more peasants were imprisoned (Underhill, 1895; Craton, 1988).

       Another example is the 1853 riots in the Virgin Islands. As a result of hurricanes, the colony
  12
       In contrast, Naidu and Yuchtman (2013) use incarceration rates that are specific to Master and Servant cases.


                                                             24
was carrying a large public debt. The government responded by shifting the tax burden onto

peasants, which is our second form of legal coercion. Specifically, in 1853 the government doubled

the head tax on livestock, the most important peasant activity. This led to escalating tensions, a

major riot and many incarcerations (Dookhan, 1975, ch. 7 and especially 156).

   Other examples of how increased legal coercion translated into increased incarcerations can

be found in each and every one of our colonies. Thus, our incarceration-rate data are informative

about legal coercion.



5 OLS Evidence

Table 1, a stripped-down OLS specification, is our single most important table. It reports our base-

line specifications for the wage and incarceration-rate equations (equations 9–10). There are a very

large number of specification choices built into the table and we will consider many alternative

specifications in subsequent sections, but it will turn out that the results in table 1 are representa-

tive. We therefore ask for the reader’s indulgence in temporarily suspending any disbelief about

robustness so as to put forward our key results as quickly as possible.

   Consider panel A. The sample is 14 colonies in 1838–1913. The dependent variable is log wages

ln wit . 944 observations have non-missing wage data, which is 93% of all possible observations. In

column 1, we regress ln wit on the log of the London price of sugar. The coefficient is zero, which is

the puzzle discussed in the introduction. In column 2, we add the figure 6 lowess-smoothed share

of sugar in total exports, which is our measure of relative planter power Nit . The coefficient on

the price of sugar is now positive and the coefficient on sugar shares is negative. This is precisely

as predicted in figure 10.

   The novel aspect of the paper is the institutional-change channel (Nit ). We therefore want to

ensure that the coefficient on Nit is not an artifact of some unmodelled omitted trend. In col-

umn 3 we thus add year fixed effects. Since ln pt only varies across years it disappears from the

regression. Reassuringly, the coefficient on Nit does not change at all.

   Panel B has the same structure as panel A except that the dependent variable is incarceration

rates per capita Cit . There are 856 observations with non-missing data on incarceration rates,

which is 84% of all possible observations. As predicted in figure 10, the column 2 coefficient on

Notes: Panel A presents estimates of the wage equation (9). Panel B presents estimates of the coercion equation (10)
where coercion is measured as incarceration rates per capita. Nit is the lowess-smoothed share of sugar in total exports
as displayed in figure 6. (a) There are two differences between the ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ columns. The latter includes
the lagged dependent variable. It also reports the long-run coefficients on Nit and ln pt . (b) All specifications include
colony fixed effects. Year fixed effects are added in columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 and, as a result, ln pt is suppressed. (c) Sample
sizes vary across columns. There are 944 observations with wage data, 856 observations with incarceration-rate data,
and 803 observations with both wage and incarceration-rate data. Columns 5–8 use the same samples as columns 1–4,
respectively, except for observations lost through missing lags. (d) Standard errors are clustered by colony. ***, **, and
* indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. t-statistics are in parentheses.

−1.27. Column 2 is β w ∆Nit where β w = −0.44 (from table 1, panel A, column 2 1) and ∆Nit is indicated in the row
name. Column 3 is columns 1 plus 2. Column 4 is β w ∆Nit where β w = 0.59 (from table 1, panel B, column 3) and
∆Nit . The column is expressed as a percentage of the sample’s average incarceration rate per capita.




ln pt is zero and the coefficient on Nit is positive. Further, the latter coefficient is slightly larger with

year fixed effects. Nothing in standard trade models would lead one to consider such a regression

or expect the observed sign pattern.

    We turn next to the magnitudes of the wage equation coefficients in column 2 and the incar-

ceration rate coefficient in column 3. During 1838–1913 the log price of sugar fell by 1.27 points.

Further, Nit fell on average by 0.54 so that, roughly speaking, ∆Nit = −0.54 for group-2 colonies

(colonies that had an average decline in sugar), ∆Nit = 0 for group-1 colonies (colonies that

stayed completely in sugar), and ∆Nit = −1.00 for group-3 colonies (colonies that completely

exited sugar). Table 2 translates our coefficients into more meaningful magnitudes. The market-

forces impact of declining sugar prices was a 0.24 log point fall in wages. The institutional-change

impact of declining relative planter power was a 0.24 log point increase in wages for the average

colony (∆Nit = −0.54) and a much larger 0.44 log point increase for the group-3 colonies where

sugar completely collapsed. The net impact of these two channels varies by group, but the inter-

esting thing is that where sugar collapsed entirely, the institutional-change channel dominated the

market-forces channel (−0.24 + 0.44 = 0.20). This illustrates the central thesis of the paper.


5.1 Robustness of the OLS Estimates

1. A Dynamic Model: While our colony-level clustering controls for serial correlation in the

residuals, given the persistent time-series properties of wages, incarceration rates, and institutions


                                                        27
it is wise to model this persistence in a more structured way. To this end we include a lagged

dependent variable.13 Columns 5–8 of table 1 report the results with one-year lagged dependent

variables e.g.,

                           ln wit = γ w ln pt + β w Nit + ρw ln wi,t−1 + λw    w    w
                                                                          i + λt + εit .


For comparability, we report the long-run coefficients γ w /(1 − ρw ) and β w /(1 − ρw ). In table 1,

comparison of columns 1–4 with columns 5–8 shows that the static and dynamic models generate

similar estimates.

       2. The Common Sample: In columns 4 and 8 of table 1, we restrict the sample to observations

where there are data for both log wages and incarceration rates. Comparing columns 3 with 4 or

7 with 8, it is clear that the different samples yield similar conclusions.

       3. Alternative Prices: It reasonable to argue that we should be using the price of the export

basket rather than just the price of sugar. For one, what matters is how exports impact labour

demand in total, not just labour demand in sugar. For another, once a colony stops producing

sugar, the sugar price is no longer relevant. Blattman et al. (2007) report world prices for a large

number of commodities. Combining these with export data from the Blue Books, we computed
                              P
the export price index P Eit ≡ j θijt ln pjt where j indexes crops, pjt is the world price of crop j,

and θijt is the share of crop j in the total exports of colony i. Table 3 reports results using P Eit .

Consider the wage equation (panel A). In column 1, P Eit is by itself and is insignificant, which

is another example of the zero-correlation puzzle. In column 2, Nit is added and both regressors

are significant, just as we saw in table 1. In column 3, both P Eit and the log price of sugar ln pt

are included, but only ln pt is significant. Further, the coefficient on Nit (−0.43) is the same as in

column 3 of table 1 (−0.44). Similar results obtain for the dynamic specification in columns 5–7.14

The results for incarceration rates (panel B of the table) are similar to what we saw earlier. The

theory states that prices should not matter and this is what we find. Further, adding P Eit barely

affects the coefficient on Nit .

       4. Interactions: One way of reformulating our argument is to say that the stronger is the
  13
      Lagged dependent variables with fixed effects can be a problem, but as Nickell (1981) shows, the bias is of order
O(1/T ) where T ≈ 76 is the number of years. Hence the bias is only 1/76 or 1.3%, which is to say tiny.
   14
      We do not report results with year fixed effects because then P Eit is statistically insignificant. Despite the fact that
P Eit varies by colony, most of its variance is driven by time series variation and this is swept out by the year fixed
effects.

planter elite, the smaller is the impact of ln pt on wages. Mathematically, the larger is Nit , the

less positive should be the coefficient on ln pt in the wage equation. This suggests that we should

include the interaction Nit × ln pt as a regressor and expect it to have a negative coefficient in

the wage equation. Arguing symmetrically, Nit × ln pt should have a positive coefficient in the

coercion equation. The results appear in columns 4 and 8 of panel A and columns 2 and 4 of panel

B. The coefficients have the expected signs and are statistically significant. It turns out that there

is nothing empirically new in using Nit × ln pt in place of Nit . This is because, after controlling for

colony and year fixed effects, Nit and Nit × ln pt are almost perfectly correlated. Restated, Nit and

Nit × ln pt explain exactly the same sample variation so that it does not matter which we include.15

Further, conclusions about magnitudes are also the same for the Nit and Nit × ln pt models.16

       5. Labour Supply Shocks: The model sketched one specific market-forces channel, but there

are others of interest and here we consider one of them. During 1838–1913 the most significant

international movement of people was the arrival of indentured immigrants, mostly from India.

According to Roberts and Byrne (1966), between 1838 and 1913, cumulative net immigration was

230,000 for Guyana, 124,000 for Trinidad, 37,000 for Jamaica and smaller amounts for Grenada,

St. Lucia, Antigua and Dominica. Restated after crudely controlling for colony size, the ratio

of cumulative net immigration to 1913 population exceeded 0.15 for only two colonies, Trinidad

where it was 0.37 and Guyana where it was 0.77. This illustrates that immigration was important

in only two colonies and so cannot be expected to influence our conclusions.

       The other labour supply shock was much smaller. British West Indies workers left for Guyana

during the post-1880 gold rush and for Panama during the building of the canal by the French

(1881-1889) and Americans (1908–1913).

       We consider these labour-supply variables in table 4. Column 1 is the same specification as

in column 2 of table 1, except that we have added five labour-supply variables. ‘Indentured im-

migrants’ is either the log of cumulative net immigration from 1838 to year t or, where there was

no immigration, 0. Not only is it statistically significant, but it is also economically large. It de-

pressed wages by 0.23 log points in Guyana (−0.019 × ln(230, 000)) and by about 0.15 log points

in colonies that received smaller numbers of immigrants. The remaining regressors in column 1
  15
     Specifically, the regression Nit × ln pt = βNit + λi + λt + εit has an R2 of 0.98.
  16
     In table 3, panel A, column 4, the derivative of log wages with respect to Nit is (−0.10) × ln pt . The mean of ln pt is
5.1 so the derivative is −0.10 × 5.1 = −0.51. This is very similar to the table 1, column 3 coefficient on Nit of −0.44.

with a dummy that is 1 when the canal was being built (1881–1889 and 1908–1913) and 0 in all

other years. ‘Guyana gold rush’ is the interaction of the log of one plus a colony’s distance from

Guyana with a dummy that is 1 after gold was discovered (1880) and 0 in all other years. (We add

one before taking the log of distance so that Guyana is at 0 distance.) These four regressors are not

statistically significant either individually or jointly (F4 = 1.45, p = 0.27). We therefore drop them

in the remaining specifications. Columns 2–5 repeat the main specifications of our baseline table 1

except for the inclusion of indentured immigrants. The key conclusion is that all of the estimated

coefficients on Nit and ln pt are unchanged.17

       6. Destructive Regression Diagnostics: In the online appendix we examine whether our re-

sults are sensitive to outliers or other features of the data. In online appendix table 3 we drop one

decade at a time, re-estimate our main specifications and report the results. None of our results are

changed. In online appendix table 4 we revisit the year fixed effects out of concern that we may

be overfitting the data, which might lead to unanticipated results. We replace year fixed effects

with decade fixed effects. We also replace year fixed effects with polynomials in time of the form
Pn                    k                                                        18
  k=1 αk (year − 1837) for n = 2, 4, 6. Again, none of our results are changed.

       7. A Placebo Test: One can ask whether similar results would obtain no matter what crop

we used. While our historical analysis surrounding figure 7 suggests not, we can examine this

directly. We re-run our regressions by replacing the sugar export share with an export share of

some other crop. Consider column 1 of table 5 where the dependent variable is log wages. The

first row (‘sugar’) is our baseline result from table 1, panel A, column 3. The next row (‘cocoa’)

replaces the sugar export share with the cocoa export share. Thus, each element of the column

is a separate regression with a different crop share. Looking down the column, only sugar has a

statistically significant negative coefficient. Further, a number of the coefficients are statistically

positive. Thus, our results for sugar do not hold for any of the placebo crops.19
  17
      The five labor-supply variables in table 4 deal with the market-forces channel and so should be insignificant in the
incarceration-rate equation. This is indeed the case, as shown in online appendix table 2.
   18
      We can also omit colonies one at a time. All the coefficients in table 1 are robust to this omission: coefficients are
stable and always significant at least at the 5% level (usually at the 1% level). For example, in our preferred specification
of table 1 column 7, the coefficient on Nit in the wage equation varies between −0.34 and −0.47 and is always significant
at the 1% level while the coefficient on Nit in the incarceration-rate equation varies between 0.41 and 0.57 and is always
significant at the 1.5% level.
   19
      The result for fruits, the most negative of the non-sugar coefficients, is telling. Starting in the 1890s, the United
Fruit Company emerged as a major buyer and then major producer of fruit (bananas) in Jamaica. When we delete post-

Notes: The dependent variable is listed in the header. In column 1, each entry is a separate regression. The specification
of each is the same as in column 3 of table 1, but with the sugar export share Nit replaced by the indicated crop export
share e.g., the cocoa regressor is exports of cocoa as a share of total exports. Column 2 is a single regression that includes
all the crop shares. Since crop shares sum to unity, we omit one crop (sugar). Columns 3–4 repeat columns 1–2, but with
incarceration rates per capita as the dependent variable. In columns 5–6 we regress log wages and incarceration rates
per capita on log exports, ln(1 + xijt ) where xijt is exports of crop j by colony i in year t. Standard errors are clustered
by colony. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. t-statistics are in parentheses.

    Column 3 of table 5 repeats the exercise for incarceration rates per capita. Again, the first

entry is our baseline results from table 1, panel B, column 3. All of the remaining coefficients are

negative with the exception of limes.20 Again, the results for sugar do not extend to other placebo

crops.

    Alternatively, we can include all the crop export shares together, as is done in columns 2 and

4. Since export shares sum to unity, we must omit one crop (sugar). Comparing columns 1 and 2

or 3 and 4, the results do not change. In short, our sugar results pass the placebo test.

    8. Is Sugar Really Special?: One can ask whether a different specification might offer a more

conventional market-forces explanation for our sugar result. Agriculture is labour-intensive so

that an increase in agricultural exports increases the demand for labour and hence increases

wages. Therefore, a regression of wages on log exports of each crop should yield positive co-

efficients. This regression appears in column 5 of table 5. As expected from the market-forces

channel, the coefficients on all the non-sugar crops are either significantly positive or very close to

zero. In contrast, the coefficient on sugar has the wrong sign: an increase in sugar exports reduces

wages. Clearly, sugar is special.21

    9. Adding Additional Structure: According to the model, wages should depend on coercion

and coercion should depend on the strength of the planter elite. See figure 10. We can thus con-

sider regressing ln wit on Cit and instrumenting Cit with Nit . We implement this in a model with

both colony and year fixed effects. The resulting IV coefficient on Cit is −0.77 (t = −2.55) for

the static model and −0.86 (t = −2.85) for the dynamic model. That is, high levels of coercion

lead to low levels of wages, just as predicted by the model. Further, exogeneity of Cit is rejected.

Online appendix table 5 reports the full results. We do not emphasize these results for three rea-

sons. First, our measure of coercion (incarceration rates per capita) captures just a small part of

the four aspects of legal coercion discussed in the history section. It should therefore be more

weakly correlated with wages than a fuller measure of coercion would be. Second, and reflecting

1890 Jamaica from our sample and re-estimate fruit, the coefficient becomes positive (0.18). Thus, the largest negative
placebo coefficient can be traced directly to power over workers.
   20
      This is associated with the post-1890 coincidence in Dominica of tax riots and increased lime production. When we
delete post-1890 Dominica from our sample the coefficient on lime becomes small and insignificant (0.10 with t = 0.25).
   21
      The political economy of legal coercion is about the strength of planter interests relative to peasant interests, which in
turn depends on export shares. The absolute level of exports should not matter for the political economy of incarceration
rates. In column 6, we regress incarceration rates on log exports and find that none of the coefficients is significant, as
predicted.



                                                              34
this first drawback, these IV results tend to be more sensitive to the choice of specification. Third,

the instrument Nit is itself arguably endogenous, a point we will examine shortly.

       10. Clustering: In the tables above we reported results clustered by colony. This addresses our

largest concern and one raised by Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004), namely, serial corre-

lation within a cross-sectional unit, i.e. a colony. Another concern is correlation across colonies

within a given year due to common shocks such as the repeal of the preferential sugar tariff (see

figure 4) or the cholera epidemic of 1854–1856 (Salmon, 1888). To address these concerns we also

ran all our main specifications with two-way clustering (Cameron, Gelbach and Miller, 2011) that

allows for arbitrary correlations within colony and, separately, for arbitrary correlations within

year.

       An additional issue is that the theory underlying standard clustering relies on asymptotics in

the number of clusters and these asymptotics do not hold with 14 clusters (colonies). One solution

is the standard bias correction. All the standard errors reported in this paper are bias-corrected

for small numbers of clusters. Cameron and Miller (2015) suggest the more radical wild bootstrap

method. This method does not rely on asymptotic theory and has been shown in simulations to

be the most conservative approach to dealing with small numbers of clusters.

       Turning to implementation of these alternative clustering methods, consider our static spec-

ification with colony and year fixed effects and consider the coefficients on Nit in the wage and

incarceration-rate equations. With our baseline approach to clustering, the coefficient p-values are

0.005 and 0.003, respectively. With two-way clustering (colony- and year-level clustering), the p-

values are 0.005 and 0.007. With the conservative wild bootstrap, the p-values are 0.010 and 0.025.

In short, our results survive more conservative approaches to standard errors.22

       To conclude this section, our OLS results in table 1 are robust.
  22
    Standard errors can also be biased downwards when the numbers of observations per cluster vary dramatically
across clusters (MacKinnon and Webb, 2014). This is not a concern here because we have 93% and 84% of all potential
wage and incarceration-rate observations, respectively. Also, Brewer, Crossley and Joyce (2013) suggest using FGLS to
improve efficiency in handling serial correlation with small numbers of clusters. We estimated the AR(1) coefficient ρ
using Hsiao (1986, 55), then generalized-differenced the data (∆xit = xit − ρbxi,t−1 for each variable x), and re-estimated
the model with generalized differences and clustered standard errors. The resulting coefficients changed very little and
had p-values of 0.001 and 0.003 for wages and incarceration rates, respectively.

6 Endogeneity of Nit and Instrumental Variables

Of course, Nit may be endogenous. A first-stage equation is arrived at by totally differentiating

                          eN dN + πp dp + πϕ dϕ + πΦ−L d(Φ − L) = 0 where we have set dW = 0
equation (5). This yields π

and substituted in equation (2). Solving for dN :


                           π )dp + (−θpx/e
                dN = (−θϕx/e             π )dϕ + (θ/eπ )d(Φ − L)

                             +                  +               −


where we have used the fact that in a stable equilibrium π
                                                         eN < 0. See Appendix B.2. That is,

the size of the plantation elite is increasing in the price of sugar, increasing in productivity and

decreasing in the outside options of workers.

   Equation (11) highlights the endogeneity concern, namely, unobserved productivity shocks

and unobserved outside-option shocks can induce a spurious correlation between ln wit and Nit .

The theory gives the direction of potential estimation bias. Figure 11 displays the theoretical im-

pact of shocks to productivity and the outside option. The dashed ovals highlight the biases

caused by unobserved shocks. The presence of productivity shocks in the residual of the wage

equation will induce a spurious positive correlation between ln wit and Nit i.e., β w < plimβ w,OLS <

0. Restated, OLS will underestimate the impact of institutions on wages. In contrast, the presence

of outside-option shocks in the residual will induce a spurious negative correlation between ln wit

and Nit i.e., plimβ w,OLS < β w < 0. The intuition is simple. Productivity shocks are positive labour

demand shocks and so raise both price (wit ) and quantity (Nit ). This pushes up β w,OLS . Outside-

option shocks are negative labour supply shocks and so raise wit and lower Nit . This pushes down

β w,OLS . It follows that our inference about the importance of the institutional-change channel is

threatened by unobserved outside-options shocks, but not be unobserved productivity shocks.


6.1 Instruments: Sugar Suitability and Hurricanes

As discussed in section 2.3, cross-colony variation in the decline of sugar is explained by cross-

colony variation in the suitability of soil for sugar cane cultivation and, in the case of the Virgin

Islands, by hurricanes. In this section we describe our two instruments.

6.1.1 Sugar Suitability

Standard sources for crop-suitability data are too coarse for our colonies. For example, each grid

cell in the Geographically Based Economic Data database (Ramankutty, Foley, Norman and Mc-

Sweeney, 2002) – used, for example, in Michalopoulos (2012) and Alesina, Michalopoulos and

Papaioannou (2013) – has a resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude, which, at

the equator, is over 3,000 square kilometers. To give another prominent example, the crop suitabil-

ity data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the Global Agro-Ecological

Zones (GAEZ) project – used, for example, in Costinot, Donaldson and Smith (forthcoming) – is

at the 5 arc-minute level, which, at the equator, is 86 square kilometers. The smallest island in

our data, Nevis, is as big as one cell in the FAO GAEZ data. The ten smallest islands in our data

together fit into a single cell in the Ramankutty et al. (2002) database.

   We therefore hired an expert to develop a suitability index with finer spatial resolution. The

index uses six factors known to be crucial for sugar (temperature, rainfall, elevation, soil pH, slope,

and soil texture). For example, sugar grows well with rainfall in the range of 1100–1500 millimetres

per year, grows marginally in the ranges of 950–1100 or 1500–1990, grows poorly in the ranges of


                                                                    37
800-950 or 1990–2500, and does not grow in the ranges below 800 or above 2500. Weights for the

six factors were estimated using the artifical neural network described in Jayasinghe and Yoshida

(2010). The estimation makes no use of Caribbean land use patterns (it is based on Sri Lankan

data) so that the weights and therefore the index are entirely exogenous.

       The six factors are available at the grid-cell size of 604 square-meters so that our 14 colonies

have 643,025 cells. The model places each cell into one of four categories (highly suitable, marginally

suitable, marginally unsuitable, and highly unsuitable). A sensible empirical feature of this model

is that almost all the land in our sample is either highly suitable or marginally suitable. We there-

fore define our suitability index Suiti as the share of a colony’s land that is highly suitable. Ap-

pendix C.1 provides more details.23

       We use Suiti as follows. As the price of sugar pt fell during 1838–1913, most of the contraction

of sugar came at the extensive margin, meaning that less-suitable land was removed from produc-

tion.24 We therefore expect that a rise in sugar prices will raise production more at the extensive

margin (where Suiti is low) than at the intensive margin (where Suiti is high). Restated, we expect

Nit to increase with ln pt and especially so where Suiti is low. We capture this by instrumenting

Nit with Suiti × ln pt and expect this instrument to have a negative coefficient.

       To get a sense of the power of this instrument, figure 12 displays the partial regression plot

from the regression Nit = θ(Suiti × ln pt ) + λt + λi + εit i.e., a plot of Nit against Suiti × ln pt

after sweeping out the year fixed effects (λt ) and colony fixed effects (λi ). Three features stand

out. First, θb < 0 as expected. Second, the fit is good: θb = −0.72 (t = −5.50, p = 0.000). Further,

the R2 with just fixed effects is 0.80 and rises to 0.88 with the inclusion of Suiti × ln pt i.e., the

instrument explains 40% (= 0.08/0.20) of the relevant sample variation. Third, there are a large

number of outliers to the top right. These are labelled ‘V’ and are the Virgin Islands in the early

years of 1838–1854. This is the early collapse of Virgin Islands sugar that we will now explain by

reference to hurricanes.25
  23
      Online appendix figure 1 discusses the index in greater detail with particular reference to Jamaica. Jamaica is
interesting because it illustrates at fine geographic detail that our highly suitable cells coincide with those areas that
were under sugar cane cultivation in 1790 (as displayed in figure 5).
   24
      We saw this in figure 8 at the colony level: Sugar output fell most in colonies that were least suitable for sugar. We
can also see this at the sub-colony level by juxtaposing figure 5 with online figure 1 : The decline of Jamaican sugar
production was associated with a decline in the amount of land under sugar cane cultivation and the land which came
out of cultivation tended to be marginally suitable land.
   25
      A fourth and more subtle feature
                                   P     of the figure is the series of observations located vertically at 0. These are Grenada
and are vertical because µt ≡        i Suiti /14 almost exactly equals SuitGrenada so that, after sweeping out year fixed

6.1.2 Hurricanes

Data on hurricane landfalls are from the United States National Hurricane Center (2014) and, for

the pre-1851 period, from Tannehill (1938). Hurricane tracks were digitized and GIS software used

to identify landfalls. The data distinguish between ‘hurricanes’ (categories 1 and 2) and ‘major

hurricanes’ (categories 3, 4 and 5).

    Hurricanes do two types of damage: They destroy crops and they destroy structures such as

sugar mills. Since sugar cane must be processed within hours of harvesting and since cane is dif-

ficult to transport, there was always a sugar mill either on the plantation or nearby e.g., Higman

(2001, figure 2.5). Sugar mills were unique in Caribbean agriculture in that they were expensive

and long-lived assets that were prone to hurricane damage. Further, financing of mills was dif-

ficult, especially in the less successful colonies where planters were cashed-strapped (groups 2

and 3). See Marshall (1996a, 73) and Lobdell (1996, 322, 326). In a period of falling sugar prices,

price covered a marginal planter’s variable costs but not his fixed costs. It thus made sense for

a marginal planter to operate an existing mill, but not to rebuild a destroyed mill. As a result,

effects, (SuitGrenada − µt ) × ln pt almost exactly equals zero. This is a feature of the data that affects the first-stage fit,
but does not affect the second-stage results. Specifically, omitting Grenada does not affect our conclusions.

hurricane strikes had long-lasting effects.

       The experience of the Virgin Islands is illustrative. Hurricanes in 1848 and 1852 decimated the

industry and hurricanes in 1867 and 1871 destroyed most of the remaining mills, including every

single mill on the main island of Tortola (Dookhan, 1975, 126).26 Figure 13 shows the evolution

of sugar as a share of total exports in the Virgin Islands. The hurricanes of 1848 and 1852 led to

permanent reductions in sugar’s importance to the economy. Further, even if sugar had recovered

after 1852, it would have been totally destroyed by the major hurricanes of 1867 and 1871.

       Against this historical backdrop we assign each hurricane a ‘damage’ index, which is the two-

year log change in sugar exports. Let xist be colony i’s sugar exports in year t and let t0 be the date

of a hurricane so that ∆i (t0 ) ≡ max{ 0 , ln xis,t0 −1 − ln xis,t0 +1 } is the two-year log change in sugar

exports. (If sugar exports increased after the hurricane then we set the two-year change to zero.)

The logic for using two-year changes is as follows. We know from our data that crops almost

always bounced back within a year after a major storm. In the first year there are declines in sugar

exports both because of crop damage and because of infrastructure damage. In the second year,

the crop comes back only to the extent allowed by the infrastructure damage so it is two years of

   Our dating of the earliest hurricane differs slightly from Dookhan, but this does not matter for our results. See
Appendix C.2.

       Looking across the 28 hurricanes that made landfall in the British West Indies during 1838–

1913, what stands out is the Virgin Islands: It was hit repeatedly, it was hit early on, and the hits

did major damage. Also interesting is the fact that group-3 colonies tended to be hit much more

often then other colonies. (The exception is Jamaica, which was hit more frequently but with less

impact because of its size.)

       Our hurricane-based instrument is the hurricane damage index HDIit ≡ ∆i (t0 ) for t ≥ t0 and

HDIit ≡ 0 for t < t0 . If there were multiple hurricanes that hit before t then we take the sum of

the ∆i (t0 ).


6.1.3 IV Estimates

Table 6 reports the instrumental variables (IV) results. The first-stage regression is:


                          Nit = θ1 HDIit + θ2 (Suiti × ln pt ) + θ3 ln pt + λi + λt + εit                                 (12)


where the first instrument is the price of sugar times the colony’s suitability for sugar and the

second instrument is the hurricane damage index. The λs are year and colony fixed effects and

ln pt only appears in specifications without year fixed effects. We expect hurricane damage to

reduce Nit (θ1 < 0) and, as discussed earlier, we expect θ2 < 0 and θ3 > 0.

       Consider table 6. Panel C reports the first stage and shows that both instruments have the

expected sign and are statistically significant. Panel A reports the IV second stage. Panel B reports

the OLS counterpart which we report for ease of reference. Consider column 1. The IV coeffi-

cient of 0.50 is statistically significant and larger than the OLS coefficient (0.44). The row labelled

‘Endogeneity test’ shows that the difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.85 > 0.01). The

     wage equation (columns 1–5) and the coercion equation (columns 6–8). Panel B is the OLS counterpart to Panel A and is reported to make it easier to compare the
     IV and OLS coefficients. Large p and F values indicate that instruments are valid (excludable from the second stage and correlated with Nit ) and that endogeneity is
     rejected. All specifications have colony fixed effects. Dynamic columns include the lagged dependent variable (ln wi,t−1 or Ci,t−1 ) and report the long-run coefficients
     on Nit and ln pt . See notes to table 1 for additional information, including a description of the number of observations. Standard errors are clustered by colony. ***, **,
     and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. t-statistics are in parentheses.
‘Hanson J overid’ row shows that the instrument exclusion restrictions are valid (p = 0.24 > 0.01)

and the ‘Weak instruments’ row shows that the instruments are correlated with Nit (F = 68 > 10).

In short, we have valid instruments which lead to IV estimates that are both precisely estimated

and not statistically different from the OLS estimates. This is not surprising: We have argued that

the differential decline of sugar is largely explained by exogenous agro-climactic factors.

       Looking across the five log wage columns, it is clear that the same conclusion applies to all

the wage specifications. Column 2 adds year fixed effects, columns 3–4 repeat columns 1–2 but

with lagged wages included, and column 5 repeats column 4 but for the common sample. It is

remarkable how in the specifications with year fixed effects the OLS and IV estimates are virtually

identical.

       Columns 6–8 are the same as columns 2, 4 and 5, respectively, except that the dependent vari-

able is now incarceration rates per capita. (All the incarceration rate specifications include year

fixed effects because, as usual, ln pt is not significant. There is therefore no need to consider coun-

terparts to columns 1 and 3.) Looking at columns 6–8, we again conclude that the instruments are

valid and that we can reject endogeneity because the IV and OLS estimates are precisely estimated

to be equal.


6.1.4 IV Sensitivity

We made a number of specification choices in constructing the hurricane damage index. First, a

concern about hurricanes is measurement error in the historical hurricane data. To deal with this

we consider a subset of hurricanes that were a priori likely to be the most damaging. We use two

criteria for identifying these. The first is that the hurricane was a ‘major hurricane.’28 The second

is the colony’s vulnerability to storm surges. Hurricanes can generate storm surges in excess of

10 feet. For example, Longshore (2009, 419) reports that an 1876 U.S. Virgin Island hurricane had

a 10-foot storm surge. We define storm-surge vulnerability as a hurricane landfall on a colony

that has a high proportion of low-lying coastal land. Antigua and the Virgin Islands stand out

here: The percentage of land with elevation of 10 feet or less is 35% in the Virgin Islands, 29%

in Antigua, and less than 10% everywhere else. Online appendix figure 2 shows the distribution

of elevations for each colony in our sample. (This is based on authors’ calculations using GIS
  28
       Major hurricanes are indicated by a * in footnote 27.


                                                               43
data.) We therefore code all Antiguan and Virgin Island hurricanes as storm surges. The results

of defining HDIit using major hurricanes and storm surges appear in panel A of table 7. This has

virtually no affect on our conclusions.

          Second, ∆i (t0 ) can be large even when the importance of sugar is small. For example, the 1867

Virgin Islands hurricane caused a large log change decrease in sugar exports, but at a time when
                                                                                                                      x
sugar was already all but gone. To deal with this we modify our instrument by using ∆i (t0 ) xis,t 0 −1
                                                                                               i,t −1                     0

where xit is total exports i.e., by multiplying ∆i (t0 ) by sugar’s share of total exports before the

hurricane strike. The results appear in panel B of table 7. This leads to larger IV coefficients, but

does not change our conclusions because endogeneity continues to be rejected with high levels of

confidence.29
                   xis,t0 −1
          Third,   xi,t0 −1    is arguably endogenous (see the low over-identification p values in panel B).

Since this ratio depends on sugar prices, to avoid potential endogeneity this ratio can be replaced

with pt0 −1 . This is done in panel C of table 7 where we redefine the hurricane instrument as

HDIit = ∆i (t0 )pt0 −1 . Again, the estimates are virtually identical to our baseline estimates of table

6.

          Summarizing, the decline of sugar was largely exogenous to the wage and legal-coercion pro-

cesses that interest us here. As a result, our OLS estimates are consistent.



7 Parish Level Results

At the start of the previous section we observed that the biggest threat to the interpretation of our

results comes from unobserved shocks to outside options. While we saw no evidence of this in our

examination of the Guyana gold rush or the Panama Canal construction (table 4), in this section

we dig even deeper. Outside-option shocks likely affected all parishes within a colony in the same

way and so can be controlled for at the parish level with colony-year fixed effects. Therefore,

we gathered Blue Book data at the parish level on the closest counterparts to Nit and wit that are

available. We measure parish-level Nit as the percentage of cultivated land that is planted in sugar

cane. We do not have parish-level wages, but we have parish-level mortality, which is both a proxy
     29                                            xis,t0 −1
    There is a slight difference between Nit and   xi,t0 −1
                                                             .   The former is lowess-smoothed and the latter is not smoothed.
For example, figure 13 uses the latter.

for wages and an outcome of interest in its own right.30 Parish-level data are available for only

three colonies: Grenada (1866–1891), Jamaica (1883–1913), and Nevis (1901–1905).

       Table 8 reports the results. Columns 1–3 have the same structure as our baseline results in

columns 1–3 of table 1 except that we replace colony fixed effects with parish fixed effects. The

key result is in column 2. The sugar price term ln pt captures the market-forces channel and shows

that as the price of sugar fell worker outcomes deteriorated i.e., mortality rose. The sugar-share

term Nit captures the institutional-change channel and shows that as planter power waned worker

outcomes improved i.e., mortality fell. This institutional-change channel holds with year fixed

effects (column 3) and, more importantly, with colony-year fixed effects (column 4).31

       The parish-level analysis implicitly assumes that legal coercion operated at least in part at the

parish level. While laws were decided at the colony level, their enforcement was by parish-level

judges and constables, both of whom were typically former overseers (McLewin, 1987, 85–87).
  30
      While high mortality could in principle be compensated with high wages, we have already seen that this is not the
case: Wages were low precisely where sugar was king.
   31
      We make three more detailed observations about table 8. First, the results hold even when dropping any one of the
three colonies. Second, the increase in the R2 from column 2 to 3 is explained by epidemics such as cholera which hit
all colonies at the same time and so are ‘explained’ by the year fixed effects. Third, the sign of the price term in column
1 captures the offsetting effects of the market-forces channel (a negative sign) and the institutional-change channel (a
positive sign).




                                                             46
In addition, workers could not easily migrate to jurisdictions with low levels of local coercion

because of vagrancy laws (Craig-James 2000, 65).

   Summarizing, this section provides additional evidence that our results cannot be explained

away be appeal to unobserved shocks to outside options. Further, not only did sugar pay lower

wages, it also killed.



8 Conclusion

According to standard international trade theories, the 19th century collapse of world sugar prices

should have reduced wages in each of the 14 British West Indies sugar colonies. It did not. In

colonies that were either marginally suited for sugar cane cultivation or impacted by hurricanes,

the fall in sugar prices reduced the power of the planter elite and led to a slow dismantling of

coercive institutions. This improved the opportunities available to peasants for employment off

the plantation and, as a result, wages were bid up. Correspondingly, incarceration rates per capita

fell dramatically.

   Remarkably, British West Indies coercion was legal coercion. That is, it operated through the

planter-dominated legislature, judiciary, and police.

   Our analysis highlights the fact that movements in the terms of trade can induce changes in

coercive institutions, changes that can be central for understanding how the terms of trade affect

wages.

Appendix A Sugar Exports and Off-Plantation Options by Colony
In this appendix we review how the relative strength of planters versus peasants changed with
changes in the export shares of non-sugar crops.


A. Group-3 Colonies and Jamaica: Weakened Planter Elite

General Considerations: First, sharecropping was common in Grenada, St. Vincent, Montserrat,
and Dominica. Sharecropping, or metayage as it was called in the Caribbean, was adopted only
reluctantly by planters and usually only by planters who were so weak financially that they could
not afford to pay wages until after the harvest (Marshall, 1996a, 64–66). The use of sharecropping
is thus a clear sign that planters were being forced to make significant concessions to peasants.
Second, in Grenada, St. Vincent, Montserrat, the Virgin Islands, and Jamaica, the phase-out of the
preferential tariff by 1853 led to the collapse of sugar and to the collapse of all exports. It would be
decades before sugar was replaced by another major export crop. Thus, in these colonies, planters
were financially devastated and abandoned estates were commonplace.
Grenada: In Grenada, cocoa was produced both by peasants and planters. It was “the ideal crop
for smallholders” (Richardson, 1997, 194). While exact numbers on peasant production are hard
to come by, the 1853 Blue Book and the 1897 Royal Commission report that peasant production
was substantial. What is clearer is that the same highland geography that allowed cocoa to thrive
also fostered the rapid growth of peasant farms and villages, which in turn provided ample work
off the plantation. See Brizan (1984, chapter 10), Richardson (1997, chapter 6) and the 1911 Blue
Book for the Leewards (Great Britain, 1911, chapter 9). Turning to cocoa grown by planters, these
usually used sharecropping contracts, an indication of planter weakness relative to peasants.
St. Vincent: Richardson (1997, 156–157) writes that “in the decades after slavery ... [arrowroot]
was grown mainly by small-scale black cultivators on the margins of sugar cane estates. ... In the
1870s and 1880s, the success and prosperity of small-scale arrowroot producers on St. Vincent had
inspired several owners of large estates to cultivate it.” See also Handler (1971). Thus, for the first
many decades after emancipation, arrowroot was primarily a peasant crop.
Montserrat: Sugar collapsed very early on and was not replaced by another export crop until
much later when lime came on the scene (circa 1870). As a result, the government allowed former
slaves to control both their cottages and their unusually extensive provision grounds. Further,
planters had little need for their tenants’ time. Thus, even though both lime and, later, cotton, were
plantation crops, provision grounds provided former slaves with an excellent outside option. See
Hall (1971, 49–53).
Virgin Islands: Sugar collapsed extremely early in the Virgin Islands, in part because of hurri-
canes, and was replaced by livestock, a peasant crop (Harrigan and Varlack 1975, 64–65; Dookhan
1975, 138). There were also opportunities for former slaves who made their way to work in the
increasingly prosperous Danish Virgin Islands. (The latter’s capital of St. Thomas was only two
kilometres from Tortola, the main island in the British Virgin Islands.) This proximity drove live-


                                                  56
stock exports.
Dominica: In Dominica, cocoa was primarily a freehold crop. Trouillot (1988, 95) cites testimony
given to an 1884 Royal Commission that seven-eighths of the cocoa crop was produced on free-
holds. Though this strikes us as an exaggeration, it does indicate a substantial peasant presence.
Lime was sharecropped, which as noted above, indicates that planters were making substantial
concessions to peasants.
Jamaica: Two-thirds of coffee production was accounted for by peasants (Eisner 1961, 217; Amer-
ican and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society 1849, 97). Bananas in Jamaica were initially a peasant crop
(Lewis, 1986, 72). In 1883–84, 90% of land holdings in the core of banana country were smallholds
and during the 1880s there was a major increase in the number of local bank accounts, an indica-
tion of the rising prosperity of smallholders (Soluri, 2006, 146). However, in the 1890s, the United
Fruit Company emerged first as a monopsony buyer and then as a grower, which weakened both
the peasantry and the existing planter elite.


B. Group-2 Colonies: Modestly Strong Planter Elite

Trinidad: In Trinidad, cocoa was split between freeholds and plantations e.g., Sewell (1861, 102)
and Bekele (2004), though plantations were substantially more important. The importation of
East Indians is indicative of planter strength (importation was very costly) and depressed peasant
wages.
St. Lucia: In St. Lucia, cocoa was primarily produced by planters, but with a non-trivial peasant
presence mildly counterbalancing planter strength. For example, small farmers cultivated 2,500
acres of Crown land, 75% of which was under cocoa. In addition, there were other opportunities
for peasant agriculture such as coffee, ginger, nutmeg and kola (Harmsen, Ellis and Devaux, 2012,
240–241).
Tobago: Craig-James (2000, 266-267) argues that planters made every effort to diversify out of
sugar, trying a number of crops and placing great emphasis on livestock. Thus, in contrast to
group-3 colonies, diversification into other crops was done within the context of the plantation
economy.


C. Group-1 Colonies: Very Strong Planter Elite

Barbados and Antigua: The islands of Barbados and Antigua were almost entirely cultivated in
large estates. The colonies’ remarkable suitability for sugar ensured that these estates continued
to be worked profitably until the start of the beet bounty in the 1880s. Further, there was little
Crown land. As a result, there was very little room for squatting or freeholding. The plantation
elites were famously strong. See, for example, Starkey (1939, ch. IV).
St. Kitts and Nevis: These colonies share a similar history with Barbados, the primary difference
being that they were not as suitable for sugar and hence declined as sugar prices fell. Nevertheless,
“the opportunity for squatting did not exist, as no public land remained [outside sugar]” (Merril,
1958, 90).

                                                 57
Guyana: Guyana stands out as the colony that experienced the largest sugar boom of our period.
Between 1838 and 1882, Guyanese sugar exports increased more than threefold. There was con-
sequently very little scope for peasant export crops. Indeed, to satisfy the huge labour demands
of sugar plantations, the government organized the large-scale importation of indentured East
Indian labour.

We assume that limi→0 x′ (i) = ∞ and W > pϕx(L). We also assume that ∂x(i)/∂i is sufficiently
negative that π

      First, we show that under these assumptions there exists a unique N ∈ (0, L) satisfying π
                                                                                              e(N ) =
W (equation 5). From equation (2), π
                                   e(N ) = π(N, C(N ), N ) = θ(N )pϕx(N )−θ(N )(Φ−L−C(N ))−
C(N )γ /N . This implies that π
                              e(L) < θ(L)pϕx(L) < pϕx(L) < W . From equation (4), C(N ) = 0 for

N small so that limN →0 C(N )γ /N = 0 and limN →0 π
                                                  e(N ) = θ(0)pϕ limN →0 x(N )−θ(0)(Φ−L) = ∞.
Thus, limN →0 π
              e(N ) > W > π                                       e that there is an N ∗ ∈ (0, L)
                          e(L). It follows from the continuity of π
satisfying equation (5). The uniqueness of N ∗ follows immediately from π
                                                                        eN < 0.
   Second, uniqueness of N ∗ plays no role for our comparative statics, where all that we use is
eN (N ) < 0 evaluated only at N = N ∗ . (See the start of section 6.) To see this, consider the
π
stability of equilibrium. That is, consider an arbitrarily small measure ǫ of potential planters who
deviate by moving from England to the Caribbean. On the one hand, they move to plots (N ∗ , N ∗ +
ǫ), plots which are less profitable than plot N ∗ . On the other hand, their presence generates a
positive externality for the profits of all planters because their presence increases the strength of
the planter elite (αN > 0) and reduces the per planter cost of coercion C γ /N ∗ . This externality
creates the possibility of multiple equilibria and the usual stability considerations come into play.
Specifically, a stable equilibrium is one in which, for all arbitrarily small ǫ > 0, a measure ǫ of
                                                                                            π (i)
potential planters has no incentive to deviate. This means that the utility from deviating (e
for all i ∈ (N ∗ , N ∗ + ǫ) ) is less than the utility from staying (W = π
                                                                         e(N ∗ )). Restated, in a stable
            e(N ∗ + ǫ) − π
equilibrium π            e(N ∗ ) < 0 or π
                                        eN (N ) < 0 for N evaluated at N = N ∗ , which is all that we
need for our comparative statics.

Appendix B.3         Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibrium

We consider existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium with 0 < N ∗ < L. We assume π
                                                                                   eN (N ) < 0
for all N ∈ (0, L), W > pϕx(L)) and limN →0 x(N ) = ∞. For the following lemma, note that if
fixed costs are too high then there will be no entry (N ∗ = M ∗ = 0).
Lemma 1 There is a unique fixed cost f such that for f < f there exists a unique equilibrium and in
equilibrium 0 < N ∗ < L.
Proof: In the main text and Appendix B.2 we established that all of the conditions for a unique
equilibrium with 0 < N ∗ < L are satisfied except for the conditions on M ∗ . It thus remains
to show that an M ∗ exists which satisfies equation (6) and M ∗ > N ∗ . Solving equation (6) for
M ∗ /N ∗ yields                                                                        !

                           N     f      N∗       0

Since N ∗ is unique, we have now solved for the unique M ∗ . Further, equation (5) implies that N ∗
is independent of f . Hence M ∗ /N ∗ is increasing in f and grows without bound as f approaches 0.
It follows that there is an f such that M ∗ (f ) > N ∗ if and only if f < f .                        

Appendix B.4         A Sufficient Condition for Φ − L − C(N ) > 0

C must never be so large that the outside option Φ − L − C is negative. Since CN > 0, a sufficient

condition for this is Φ > L + C(L) where from equation (4) C(L) = L θ(L)
                                                                       γ

rudimentary sufficient condition uses the fact that L1/(γ−1) > C(L) so that a sufficient condition is
Φ > L + L1/(γ−1) .

Appendix C              Details of Instrument Construction
Appendix C.1          Soil Suitability

Suitability was calculated at the grid-cell level. We start with spatial data for six factors: (1) ele-
vation, (2) slope, (3) annual mean temperature, (4) mean rainfall, (5) soil Ph, and (6) soil texture.
Data on elevation and slope are from the SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Database at http://www.
cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1. Data on tem-
perature and rainfall are from the GPCP Version 2.2 Combined Precipitation Data Set at http://
www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html. Data on soil texture and pH
levels are from the FAO/UNECO World Soil Dataset http://www.fao.org/climatechange/
54273/en/.
       Each factor in each cell takes on a value of 1, 2, 3 or 4, with 1 being highly suitable for sugar
and 4 being completely unsuitable for sugar. Temperature is 1 if above 25.5 C◦ , 2 if in the range
23–25.5, 3 if in the range 21–23 and 4 if below 21. Slope is 1 if less than 15◦ , 2 if in the range 15–30,
and 3 if greater than 30. Elevation is 1 if less than 400 feet, 2 if in the range of 400–700, 3 if in the
range of 700–1000, and 4 if above that. pH is 1 if in the range 6.3–6.6, 2 if in the ranges 5.5–6.3 or
6.6–7.5, and 3 if below 5.5 or above 7.5. Soil texture is 1 if sand content is less than 30%, 2 if in
the range 30–48.5, 3 if in the range 48.5–68.4, and 4 if above 68.4. Rainfall is 1 if in the range of
1100–1500 millimetres per year, 2 if in the ranges of 950–1100 or 1500–1990, 3 if in the ranges of
800-950 or 1990–2500, and 4 if in the ranges below 800 or above 2500.
       We aggregated the six factors into a single index using weights generated by the routine de-
scribed in Jayasinghe and Yoshida (2010). These weights sum to one so that the aggregate index
lies between 1 and 4. We then rounded it to the nearest integer so that the index takes on the
values 1 (highly suitable), 2 (marginally suitable), 3 (marginally unsuitable), and 4 (completely
unsuitable). In the paper, ‘suitable’ means an index value of 1 (highly suitable).32
       Guyana is the only colony that is not an island so that in calculating shares of land care must be
given to the denominator. Guyana had a large hinterland of dense jungle and swampland, most
of which was unsuitable for agriculture. We define Guyana’s historical border using the map in
Higman (2000, figure 1.8). We geo-coded this map and calculated Guyana’s sugar suitability share
based on these borders. The original map and our geo-coding of it is displayed in online appendix
figure 3.


Appendix C.2          Hurricanes

The hurricane damage index is max[ 0 , (ln xis,t0 −1 − ln xi,s,t0 +1 ) ] where t0 is the year of the
hurricane and xis,t0 −1 and xis,t0 +1 are sugar exports by colony i in the years before and after the
hurricane. While the year of the hurricane is known, the resulting fall in exports is sometimes
  32
    The only Caribbean-specific modification we make to the index is a slight nod to the fact that hauling sugar cane
over steep terrain from the field to the mill was far more difficult in our limited-mechanization age e.g., de Beer (1982).
To this end, we slightly increase the weight on the slope factor from 0.044 to 0.099 and slightly decrease the weight on
the elevation factor from 0.099 to 0.044. (Weights on the six factors sum to 1 so these are very small changes.)


                                                            60
reported in the next Blue Book year because Blue Books do not necessarily report data on a calendar
basis. Where the fall in exports happened in the year after the hurricane, we increment t0 by one
year. This occurs for Jamaica (1874, 1880, 1896), Montserrat (1851), St. Lucia (1875, 1894), and
St. Kitts (1910). For example, the Jamaican hurricane of 1896 is associated with sugar exports of
£290,000 (1896), £219,000 (1897) and £261,000 (1898) so we set t0 = 1897.
   There are four hurricanes with historical ambiguities. (1) Virgin Islands 1848: Dookhan (1975)
claims that there was a hurricane in the Virgin Islands in 1842 and makes no mention of the 1848
hurricane. Using his hurricane dating rather Tannehill’s (1938) makes no difference to our results.
(2) Barbados and Montserrat 1899: This hurricane was extremely powerful, causing many deaths
in Montserrat and Barbados. The National Hurricane Centre track for this hurricane shows that
it made landfall in Montserrat, but not Barbados. The hurricane had little impact on Blue Book
exports in either location. To investigate potential measurement error we experimented with cod-
ing this hurricane as having a large damage index (1.00) in both colonies. This improves our re-
sults. (3) Antigua 1871: This hurricane overlapped with the disastrous drought of 1870–1874. See
Berland, Metcalfe and Endfield (2013, figure 4). Contemporaries commented much more on the
drought than on the hurricane (Berland et al., 2013, 1338). Indeed, there is no mention of the hurri-
cane in the 1871 Antigua Blue Book listing of Parliamentary Acts, but there is a listing of an Act en-
titled “An Act to raise the sum of £2500 for the Antigua Water Works.” Finally, when the drought
ended, agricultural output completely rebounded: Sugar exports were £228,000 (1870), £239,000
(1871), £136,000 (1872), £153,000 (1873), £96,000 (1874, the worst year of the drought), and £243,000
(1875). In short, the cause of the decline in sugar exports was the drought, not the hurricane. We
therefore code it as a 0. (4) Grenada 1856: This hurricane is assigned a small damage index be-
cause its impacts are confounded with the massive cholera epidemic that began in mid-June 1854
(too late to affect the 1854 sugar crop) and carried on through 1855. Sugar exports were £130,000
(1854), £82,000 (1855), £90,000 (1856), and £148,000 (1857). Hence ln xis,1856−1 − ln xi,s,1856+1 < 0.
If we assign this hurricane a large damage index (1.00) our results improve slightly.

Notes: At the grid-cell level, suitability is scaled from 1 to 4. The top-panel of online appendix figure 1 displays the
results of the model for Jamaica, with 1 being highly suitable (displayed in black/green), 2 being marginally suitable
(displayed in dark grey/blue), 3 being poorly suited (displayed in light grey/orange), and 4 being entirely unsuited
(displayed in very light grey/red). Our measure of sugar suitability fits with the basic facts on the ground, depicted in
figure 5, which shows the actual distribution of land under sugar plantations in 1790 (grey) and in 1890 (dark). These
areas correspond closely to the distribution of our highly-suitable-for-sugar measure.

Most data are from Martin (1839), which provides a statistical overview of the British Empire at the time of Abolition.
Foundation year is the year the colony was founded as a British colony. For instance, St. Vincent and Grenada were
ceded from France after the French and Indian Wars. The 1838 slave price is the price from the compensation tables in
Martin (1839).

Notes: This table reports the results of the regression ln wit = βCit +λi +λt +εit where Cit is instrumented with Nit . The
first stage regression Cit = β ′ Nit + λi + λt + νit appears in columns 1–2. The OLS and IV results appear in columns 3–6.
Even-numbered columns include lagged wages (the dynamic model) and, in columns 4 and 6, long-run coefficients
are reported. The model is just identified. Exogeneity of Cit is rejected at the 5% (static) and 1% (dynamic) levels.
The difference between the OLS and IV estimates is as predicted by the model. Specifically, a positive unobserved
productivity shocks will (1) drive up wages and (2) drive up Nit and hence Cit . It will thus lead to a spurious positive
correlation between wages and coercion. This explains why the OLS estimate is so biased towards zero.
