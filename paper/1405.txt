               The Impact of OSHA and EPA Regulation on Productivity



                                 ABSTRACT


     This paper presents estimates of the impact of OSHA and EPA regulation on

productivity. Production information for 1450 manufacturing industries from 1958

to 1980   is merged with measures of regulation, including both information on
compliance expenditures by industry and enforcement efforts by OSHA and EPA.
     Industries   that faced higher regulation during the l970s had significantly

ipwer productivity growth, and a greater productivity slowdown, than industries

that faced lower regulation. Under certain assumptions, the regulation is

estimated to have reduced average industry productivity growth by .57' percent

per year, 39 percent of the average productivity slowdown. These results are

robust to variations in the itdel and the inclusion of other productivity

determinants, including poor output growth and dependence on ener,r. The

results also suggest a one—time cost of adjustment to regulation, so the

long—run impact nay be less than that estimated here.

     Both OSHA and EPA are found to target their enforcement effort towards

those industries that are doing poorly in meeting the goals of the regulation.

However, in the only area where benefits from regulation can be examined, worker

injury rates and OSHA safety inspections, no significant benefits are found.

 1. INTRODUCTION


       The slowdown in   productivity growth in   the U.S. econorrr during the l9TOs
has   been a matter of great concern to policymakers, associated as it is with
 inflation,   unemployment, and declining real wage growth. Many     possible
explanations   for the slowdown have been proposed, and much research has been

done to determine the contribution of these factors to the slowdown. The

research presented here examines the impact on productivity growth of government

regulation, specifically environmental and worker health and safety regulation

by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (051-IA) and the

Environmental Protection Mency (EPA). Looking at data for 1450 manufacturing

industries between 1958 and 1980, the study finds a large, negative relationship

between this regulation and productivity growth. Under certain assumptions, a

large part of the decline in productivity growth during the l9lOs may be

attributed to such regulation. However, the study also finds some evidence that

this decline could be a temporary one, representing a one—time cost of adjusting

to the regulation rather than a recurring cost to society.

      The major innovation of the study lies in the creation of a data set that

has information on output and inputs for many industries, allowing the

calculation of their productivity growth rates, along with data concerning the

extent of regulation of each industry. The regulatory data are taken from

surveys   of the cost of compliance with regulation and from regulatory agency
records of the enforcement efforts directed toward different industries. The
basic result is that high levels of regulation are associated with low and
falling rates of productivity growth. This result is not fundamentally changed
                                   2


 when measures of other factors that have been suggested as causes of the

 productivity slowdown are added to the model.

     An attempt is made to measure the benefits from regulation, with very

 limited success due to problems with the available data. It is clearly shown

that the regulatory agencies focus their efforts upon industries which are

performing poorly in the areas of concern: worker safety and health, and

environmental pollution. However, other results suggest that in the one area

where there is a useable measure of benefits, worker safety, it is difficult to

attribute significant benefits to regulation.



2. PRODUCTIVITY MEASUREMENT AND RDGULATION


2.1. Definition and Measurement

     Productivity is the ratio of output produced to inputs used. Because

output and inputs are measured in different units, it is the growth of

productivity over time, rather than its level, that is of greatest concern. The

simplest measure of productivity is the single—factor measure, where only one

input is measured. In this case, productivity growth is given by the difference

between the growth rates of output and that input. The st commonly used

productivity statistics, measuring labor productivity, are of this form. These

statistics are easy to calculate, but ignore changes in other factors of

production, such as capital or naterials, which could affect output growth.

     Other productivity statistics, called total factor productivity (TFP)

measures consider the contribution of all factors to output growth.
                                                  3


Consider a production function for a firm,

                        I = TF(Xi,... ,Xn)
where   output, Y, is a function of the productivity level, P,              and   n inputs X1.
For a competitive, profit—maximizing firm, an index of total input growth can be
calculated as

                               E
                               1.
                                  aidx,
where   a    is   the cost share, and dx1 the growth rate, of input i. Then
productivity growth t      =   d log T is given kt

            (i)           = dy —        E   adxi.
                                        i
This   calculation of the growth rate of productivity using the cost shares of

inputs and output and input growth rates is called growth accounting.


2.2.      Effect of Regulation

       A simple nndel of    the impact of regulation on productivity would assert
that the production function remains unchanged, but the firm is required to use
some additional inputs, R, to comply with the regulation.                  If productivity

growth is calculated for the firm without knowing how much of each input was

used to produce output and how itch to produce compliance, inputs and

productivity would be measured as

                    X' Xi+Ri                          and   I'   dy   —   Z aj'dxi'

Suppose   that the fraction of each input used in compliance is given by

                               vi   —
                                    —   0./v..
                                        nil  3-
 where 6 is near zero. True productivity growth t is then approximately


         (2)           =      ÷
                                  1
 Therefore, one would expect an ordinary productivity
                                                          growth nasure, which
 ignores the existence of compliance inputs, to understate true productivity

 growth by an amount equal to the sum of the cost share of each input times the

 fraction of that input used for compliance.

     Regulation nay affect the firm's production beyond simply requiring the use

of some inputs for compliance activities.
                                              Regulation commonly imposes
constraints on the firm's choice of production processes. These constraints

could force firms to change existing
                                       procedures, reducing productivity during
the period of adjustment. Additionally, the presence of regulation and the

possibility of future changes in regulation, increases the
                                                               uncertainty faced by
firms, which could reduce investment in new rthods of production and inhibit

productivity growth.

     A simple test for the presence of an impact of regulation on productivity

beyond the neasurement impact is available. Suppose that
                                                              productivity growth
before regulation is imposed is t0. Also suppose that the fraction of each

input used for compliance sñth regulation is 6j.    If   actual productivity growth
remains unchanged, equation 2 gives the change in neasured productivity after

regulation as


        (3)     dT=t1—t0=         1
                                      csioi

    Now consider taking observations on compliance costs and
                                                             productivity
growth for ny different industries, indexed by j.        Restating Equation 3:
                                           5



                   drj =         +
           (14)             a0           Ii(ajjoij)   +

 Here we recognize that actual productivity growth is
                                                      likely to change over time
 for various reasons, and use a0, the average productivity change for all

 industries, and Cj, an industry—specific component, to account for this change.

      If we believe that there is no relationship between
                                                                    regulation, as measured

 by compliance costs, and changes in actual productivity growth, we would expect

 the regression indicated in Equation 14       to yield y =   —1.   If there is some

 impact of regulation on actual productivity, we would expect Ii * —1 and

 probably li < —1, since ntst of the impacts of regulation would be expected to

 reduce actual productivity.

     When measures of compliance costs are not available, but other measures

 (say M±j) of different levels of regulation applied to different industries are

available, such as enforcement effort, we can rewrite Equation 14 as

                        =                      ÷
          (5)     dtj       a0   +
                                     f
There is no longer a ay to separate the impact of regulation into measurement

and actual effects, but it is possible to examine the magnitude of the impact of

regulation on changes in measured productivity growth.

     We could attempt to nDdel directly the impact of regulation on the demands
for and marginal products of different inputs, using a rre detailed nrdel of
the production process, with impacts on productivity being derived as a result.
As the n3del becomes nore involved, it becomes ucre sensitive to possible
misspecification   or errors in the variables. Since compliance costs tend to be

poorly measured, and are often not measured at all, this can          cause   problems for

the nore complex nodels. This study tends to avoid the xmDre complicated

analysis in order to get some basic results from simpler techniques.

 2.3 Growth of Regulation

      There was a substantial increase in government regulation of business

 during the early l9TOs. Both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration

 (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were created in 1970. The

 pattern followed by both agencies is similar: before the early l9TOs, the

primary responsibility for regulation lay with the states. The states varied

 enormously both in regulatory standards set and in the enforcement effort they

used to ensure compliance. Public dissatisfaction with the poor performance of

the state—level regulation led to pressure for federal action, and federal

agencies were empowered to tighten the standards and especially to increase the

enforcement effort. In the case of 05kM, this meant setting standards on a

national level, and using a large force of federal compliance officers to

enforce compliance.1

     For EPA, the states still bore the responsibility for developing and

administering State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve reductions in

pollution, but the law set strict timetables for the SIP development and gave

EPA the power to force the states to prepare a plan. There were some national

inspectors, to help check on the effectiveness of the states' effort, but not as

many as at 05kM. On the water pollution side, the EPA was required to establish

a permit system for all effluent discharges, designed to met certain water

quality standards. Compliance with both types of regulation was to be enforced

through the courts.

     Both EPA and 05kM are required by law not to consider compliance costs when

deciding what standards to propose. The standards proposed often specify the
                                  I


control techniques to be used, and tend to require capital—intensive compliance

methods. The standards have also changed over time, in response to new

information on health risks, political pressures from various groups, and court

decisions.

     There is some doubt about the power of the agencies to enforce compliance

with the standards, because rare inspections are combined with low fines for

violations to yield very low expected penalties for non—compliance. Table 2.1

presents data on the manufacturing inspections carried out by OSHA and EPA

during the time period of the study. Because OSHA concentrates on manufacturing

to a great extent, the inspection rates are not completely negligible, with

about 10 percent of all manufacturing workplaces inspected each year. Also, the

inspections are not randomly allocated, so some establishments can have quite a

high probability of being inspected in a given year.

     Table 2.1 also provides some information on penalties assessed and an

estimate of expenditures on compliance by the firms. The penalties are quite

low relative to the compliance expenditures, suggesting that nost compliance

expenditures are nntivated by other reasons. The historical neasure of

pollution abatement capital, also presented in Table 2.1, showed that pollution

abatement capital has grown nuch nnre rapidly than other capital, especially

from the late l960s through the middle 1910s. We do not have such time series

data for worker health and safety investment. It seems likely that such

investment has increased since OSHA's inception, but was probably not zero

before.

3.     PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN —      EVIDENCE AND (PLANATIONS


3.1.   Evidence for Slowdown

       The most widely observed measure of productivity is the labor productivity

index produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This measures productivity as

the real output produced per worker—hour of all workers. It is calculated for

several sectors of the econonv, including the private business, nonfarm

business, and inufacturing sectors. Average growth rates for these sectors

during several periods are given in Table 3.1.

       During the early postwar period, all three sectors showed impressive growth

rates: between 1950 and 1969 output per worker hour rose about 2.5 percent per

year. The most rapid growth came during the long expansion of the 1960s. Some

slowdown in the non—manufacturing sector is seen by the period between 1969 and

1913, and nufacturing follows suit in the 1913—1980 period. During the 1910s

all three sectors showed very low rates of labor productivity growth by postwar

standards, dropping to less than half their 1950—1969 levels.

         As mentioned in Section
                                    2, this study concentrates on measures of total
  factor productivity rather than labor productivity. Because
                                                               the input index is
  more complicated for total factor
                                    productivity measures, a wide variety of total
  factor Productivity measures exists, each using different
                                                            procedures to
  calculate total factor input.       This leads to a nixch greater dispersion in
  estimates of productivity
                                 growth, with no single, generally
                                                                     accepted measure.
 The results from several
                              such studies are presented in Table 3.2.
        These studies indicate that total factor productivity
                                                              growth fell
 substantially during the l9TOs, relative to the rest of the postwar
                                                                     period. The
 studies cited here suggest that the decline in productivity
                                                             growth began in the
 early l97Os (around 1913),
                            although others have found the decline
                                                                   beginning in
 the late 1960s. There
                        seems little doubt from these data that there was a
 slowdown in productivity
                          growth, however measured, during the l9TOs (although
Darby (1982) argues that the slowdown
                                              is an illusion, caused by the imposition
and later lifting of price controls in the early l970s).


3.2.
           Possible Explanations for the Slowdown

       What factor or factors could have caused such a decline in
                                                                       productivity?
As indicated earlier, this
                              paper focuses primarily on the impact of
                                                                           increasing
government regulation on productivity,
                                              looking at OSHA and EPA regulation.
However, almost every change in the econon that coincided with this decline in

productivity has been proposed as an explanatory factor.2 Factors
                                                                  suggested

 decline in capital investment by business, a fall in research and development

 activities, and a decline in the quality of inputs (especially
                                                                  labor).

        Denison (1979) uses econonw_wide data and calculations based on the

 growth accounting framework to measure the contribution of different factors to

 the slowdown. His is the most complete attempt to measure the contributions of

 various factors. He discusses all of them, provides estimates for some

 (including government regulation) and concludes that many were involved in the

 slowdown. He ascribes some of the slowdown in total
                                                       factor productivity growth
of 2.17 percent to resource allocation (.30), the legal and human environment

 (.30), economies of scale (.13) and other minor factors.   However, he is left
with an unexplained fall in residual productivity growth of 1.68 percent after

accounting for those factors he could measure.

     Studies which calculate the contribution of regulation to the slowdown

basedon compliance cost estimates tend to produce small estimates. Denison
(1979) estimates that such regulation contributed .35 percent to the
productivity slowdown in the 1972—1975 period, and in a later study (1983)
concludes that the contribution fell to .15 percent in the 1973—1981
                                                                       period.
Portney (1981) notes that little of GNP is spent on pollution control (under 2

percent).

     Estimates using cross—indust or time—series data have generally given

slightly larger, but similar results. Norsworthy, Harper and Kunze (1979) find

that pollution abatement capital had a limited effect on labor productivity.

Scherer (1982) finds that pollution and health and safety investment reduced

productivity growth by .19 to .27 percent, but this effect is not significant.

 Using time series data and measures of total
                                                    federal regulation, Christajnsen
 and I-tavexnan (1981) find regulation
                                          responsible for about 20 percent of the

 slowdown. Crandall (1981) finds a strong relationship between pollution

 abatement capital and productivity, but this
                                                   relationship disappears when a
 measure of enerr intensity is included.
                                                Using time—series data, Siegel (1979)
 observes a significant contribution (.5 percent) from pollution control

 expenditures to the productivity slowdown for 1965—1973, but not for later

 years. Finally, Gollop and Roberts (1983) examine data for a set of electric

utilities and find that regulation of emissions
                                                      had a large impact on total

 factor productivity, lowering it for regulated firms by .59 percent. The

conclusion of these studies (except
                                          perhaps for Gollop and Roberts) is that
pollution abatement costs in particular, and
                                                   regulation in general, explain
about 10 percent of the productivity slowdown.

     We can reach four general conclusions from
                                                     previous work. First, there was
a productivity slowdown during the l970s, at least in measured productivity.

Second, many    different   factors seem to have contributed to it, to different

degrees. Third, government regulation contributed a small but significant

amount to the slowdown. Fourth, a sizeable fraction of the slowdown remains

unexplained by the estimated contributions of all the factors considered. We

now proceed to the empirical analysis in Section 5, after discussing the data

sources used.

  4.      DATA DESCRIflION


  14.1.       Introduction

          The data set used in this
                                      analysis Consists of data for 450
                                                                           manufacturing
 industries at the 4—digit level, based on the 1972 Standard Industrial

 Classification (SIC). Annual data from 1958 to 1980 on real and nominal
                                                                          output
 and inputs are used in the calculation
                                        of industry productivity growth. Data
 are also available on the extent of
                                     government regulation of these industries
 for the ire recent years of the period (as we saw in Section 2, there
                                                                       was
 relatively little regulation before the early l970s). Additional data include

 measures of industry performance on pollution
                                                       abatement and protect ion of worker
 safety and health. The major data sources
                                                    are listed in Table 4.l. We now turn
 to a brief description of each type of data and the way in which they
                                                                       are
 combined. A more extensive description of
                                                    the data is provided in Gray (19814).

14.2.        Productivity Data

        The principal source of the data needed
                                                      to calculate productivity growth
was a joint project by the University of
                                                  Pennsylvania, the Bureau of the Census,
and SRI, Inc. This project assembled
                                               basic input and output data from 1958 to
1976 on all 1450 industries. It is referred to here as the PCS data set.3
                                                                                     Much
of this data, including inputs, outputs, and factor shares, was
                                                                        taken   from the
Annual Surveys of Manufactures and Censuses of Manufactures. The

contribution of the project was the

 14,3,       Regulation Measures — Compliance Costs

         There is very limited data on costs to firms of complying with
                                                                        OSHA
 regulation. The data we consider here
                                           are taken from an annual McGraw—Hill
 survey on capital spending for the 1913 to 1980
                                                      period. Each year McGraw—I-{in
 collects information from a few hundred large firms on current.year capital

 expenditures and projected expenditures for the next year, and for two
                                                                        years
later. One question asks what fraction of total capital
                                                        spending is allocated
to worker safety and health. Problems with this data include the

nonrepresentative nature of the firms sampled, the low response rate

 (especially on the safety and health
                                        question), and the small size of the total
sample. These data are examined briefly in
                                               Section 5,   but   they prove
unsatisfactory.

     The data for EPA—related
                                compliance costs were also taken from a survey,
but this survey was far superior to that used for OSHA—related costs.
                                                                               These
data are from the Pollution Abatement
                                        Costs and Expenditures Survey, taken
annually by the Bureau of the Census since
                                             1913. The survey is sent to about
20,000 establishments a subsample of those in the Annual Survey of
                                                                   Manufactures

  fell from 2.9 percent
                          per year in 1953—1969 to 0.9 percent per year in
  1913—1980, similar to the drop in labor
                                                 Productivity growth, as measured by the
  BLS, from 3.0 percent to 1.3
                                 percent across these periods. Total factor
 productivity growth rates also fell
                                           during this period, as they did in the
 studies previousa.y cited. For closer comparison with the
                                                           aggregate numbers from
 other sources, growth rates
                             weighted by industry size (value of shipments for
 total factor productivity and worker hours for labor
                                                       productivity) are also
 included in the table and are presented in Chart 5.1. The
                                                             slowdown is similar
 in 'gnitude and timing to that described in Section 3.
                                                           The highly cyclical
 nature of productivity fluctuations
                                     is apparent from Chart 5.1. We turn now to
 an examination of the determinants of this slowdown.

For each of the TFPCHG equations the
                                     constant term nEasures the
estimated change in productivity growth if regulation had been
zero. The nean of the dependent variable is the actual change in
productivity growth. The difference between these two numbers is
the estimated contribution of
                              regulation to productivity growth
(negative in all cases). This is expressed above as a fraction of
the actual productivity dec1ine.

  ii.   Appendix Table A—i presents a list of the top 10 industries for each

of the major regulation variables, and some measures of the distribution of

each variable.

  12. The fractions used here are the fractions of all compliance

expenditures accounted for by manufacturing, based on data from the

U.S. Council on Environmental Quality report (1980) which presents

estimates of total compliance costs, and the manufacturing cost data.

  13. From U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1980) which indicates that

manufacturing was responsible for about b4 percent of all workplace

injuries and 25 percent of fatalities.

  lb. One could argue that these abatement expenditures are a

beneficial result of the EPA inspections, not a determinant of them.

However, differences in changes in these expenditures over time are

negatively (not positively) related to differences in the EPA

inspection rates.
