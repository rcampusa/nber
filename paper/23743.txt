The Gender Unemployment Gap

                                         ABSTRACT

The gender unemployment gap, the difference between female and male unemployment rates,
was positive until the early 1980s. This gap disappeared after 1983, except during recessions,
when men’s unemployment rate has always exceeded women’s. Using a calibrated three-state
search model, we show that the convergence in female and male labor force attachment accounts
for most of the closing of the gender unemployment gap. Evidence from nineteen OECD
countries is consistent with this finding. We show that gender differences in industry composition
are the main source of the cyclicality of the unemployment gap.

                        1       Introduction
                        This paper studies the gender differences in unemployment from a long-run perspective and over
                        the business cycle. The left panel of Figure 1 shows the evolution of unemployment rates by gender
                        for 1948-2014. The gender unemployment gap, defined as the difference between female and male
                        unemployment rates, was positive until 1983, though the gap tended to close during periods of high
                        unemployment as the right panel of Figure 1 shows. After the early 1980s, the gender unemployment
                        gap virtually disappeared, except during recessions when men’s unemployment typically exceeded
                        women’s. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced for the last recession. Further examination
                        of the data confirms the visual impression. As Figure A1 in Appendix A1 shows, the gender gap in
                        trend unemployment rates, which started positive and was particularly pronounced in the 1960s and
                        1970s, vanished by 1980. In contrast the cyclical properties of the gender unemployment gap have
                        been steady over the last 60 years, with male unemployment rising more than female unemployment
                        during recessions. This suggests that the evolution of the gender unemployment gap is driven by
                        long-run trends.

                               We first examine whether changes in the composition of the labor force can explain the evolution
                        of the gender unemployment gap. We find that the growth in women’s education relative to men’s,
                        changes in the age structure and in industry and occupation distribution by gender have only minor
                        effects on its evolution, suggesting that compositional changes are not the major factors driving
                        this phenomenon. While we find that industry composition is not important for trend differences
                        in the unemployment rate, we find that it is important for the cyclical dynamics of the gender
                        unemployment gap, a finding that we analyze further later.
                               Our hypothesis is that the disappearance of the gender unemployment gap is due to the con-


                                                                                   2
vergence in labor force attachment of men and women; in particular, it is a consequence of the
drastic increase in female attachment and the notable decline in male attachment. The shrinking
labor force participation gap is probably the most important indication of this convergence. The
labor force participation rate for women increased from 43% in 1970 to 60% in 2000 while for men
it declined from 80% in 1970 to 75% in 2000. The effect of convergence in labor force attachment
is also visible in labor market flow rates that involve the participation decision, which exhibited
convergence in the last thirty years.
       To explore this hypothesis, we develop a search model of unemployment populated by agents of
different gender and skill. To understand the role of the convergence in labor force attachment, the
model differentiates between non-participation and unemployment and thus has three distinct labor
market states: employment, unemployment, and non-participation. In addition to being subject to
separation and job opportunity shocks, agents make quit and search decisions. Employed agents
have the choice to quit into unemployment or non-participation and unemployed agents can leave
the labor force. Similarly, non-participants can decide to search for a job or remain out of the labor
force. Agents’ quit and search decisions are influenced by aggregate labor market conditions and
their individual opportunity cost of being in the labor force. The latter variable, which can be
interpreted simply as the value of leisure or the value of home production for an individual worker,
is higher on average for women to reflect barriers to women’s labor force participation.1 Gender
differences in the skill composition, job-loss probabilities and in the distribution of the opportunity
cost of being in the labor force determine the gender gaps in participation, unemployment and wages
in equilibrium.
       We assess the contribution of changing labor market attachment of men and women to the evo-
lution of the gender unemployment gap with a calibrated version of our model, using 1978 and 1996
as two comparison years. We first fully calibrate the model to 1978, and then change the parameters
to match the empirical skill distribution, skill premium, job-loss and labor force participation rates
by gender in 1996, allowing for the unemployment rate to be determined endogenously. We find
that our model explains almost all of the convergence in the unemployment rates by gender between
1978 and 1996. We find that changes in labor force attachment of men and women accounts for
almost half of the decline in the gender unemployment gap over this period. The effect of the change
in labor force attachment on the unemployment rate is rather subtle. One might think that more
attached workers are more likely to remain unemployed, which would increase the unemployment
rate all else equal. While this effect is still present, increase in labor force attachment also increases
employment. We find that the employment effect quantitatively dominates and the unemployment
rate goes down as a result of an increase in attachment.
       Our calibrated model also implies that part of the convergence in gender specific unemployment
rates is due to the employment-to-unemployment transition rate. This rate was higher for women
in 1978 relative to men, but the reverse was true in 1996. While this reversal explains part of the
   1
    These include medical conditions associated with pregnancy and childbirth, responsibility for the care of depen-
dent family members and other chores, discrimination, etc. We discuss this in detail in Section 3.

convergence in male and female unemployment rates from 1978 to 1996, it is a consequence of the
difference in cyclicality of job-loss by gender rather than a consequence of a long-term trend. Since
our analysis reveals that differences in job-loss probabilities by gender are important in understand-
ing the cyclical behavior of the gender unemployment gap, we analyze further the source of gender
differences in job loss during recessions. Using the Current Employment Statistics (CES) and the
CPS we show that a substantial part of these cyclical differences in job loss rates by gender are the
consequence of differences in industry distributions of men and women.
   The link between convergence in attachment and in unemployment rates by gender is also
supported by international evidence. Based on data from 19 advanced OECD economies starting
in the early 1970s, we find that countries with lower participation gaps, on average, exhibit lower
unemployment gaps and most countries which have experienced closing participation gaps over time
have experienced closing unemployment gaps.
   Our paper contributes to two main strands of work. A growing literature has analyzed the
convergence of labor market outcomes for men and women. See Galor and Weil (1996), Costa
(2000), Greenwood, Sheshadri and Yorukoglu (2005), Goldin (2006), Albanesi and Olivetti (2009,
2014 and 2016), Fernandez and Wong (2011), Fernandez (2013) and Fogli and Veldkamp (2011).
These papers typically focus on the evolution of the labor force participation rate and gender
differences in wages from a long run perspective, but do not examine the implications for gender
gaps in the unemployment rate. Our contribution to this literature is to introduce search frictions
in the labor market and examine the implications for unemployment rates and labor market flows
by gender.
   Our analysis is also related to the literature on unemployment dynamics and labor market
flows. Most of this research focuses on two-state models with no role for participation decisions.
Garibaldi and Wasmer (2005) and Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, and Şahin (2010, 2011, 2017)
also introduce a participation choice in a search model of unemployment. In Garibaldi and Wasmer
(2005), shocks to the opportunity cost of work drive agents’s search decisions, whereas idiosyncratic
productivity shocks and wealth play a role in the other contributions. Our study is the first to allow
for heterogeneity by gender and skill. To capture the forces emphasized in the female participation
literature, we introduce gender differences in the opportunity cost of work as the main driver of
participation decisions. Consistent with the heterogeneity by gender and skill in our model, we
adopt a novel wage determination mechanism that endogenously gives rise to gender differences
in wages conditional on skill, as we discuss in Section 5.4.1. In the quantitative analysis, we also
correct for gender-specific measurement error in employment status to match the empirical flow
rates. Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, and Şahin (2010, 2011, 2017) also discuss the importance of
measurement error in labor market flows but their analysis does not focus on gender differences.
   The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical evidence on the
changing composition of the labor force and its role in the evolution of the gender unemployment
gap. Section 3 introduces our hypothesis and discusses the changes in labor force attachment of
men and women. The model is presented in Section 4. The calibration and the quantitative analysis

                             are reported in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the cyclical properties of gender unemployment gaps.
                             Section 7 presents the international evidence, and Section 8 concludes.


                             2        Changes in the Composition of the Labor Force
                             There are well-documented patterns for unemployment by worker characteristics. For example, as
                             discussed in Mincer (1991) and Shimer (1998), low-skilled and younger workers tend to have higher
                             unemployment rates. If female workers were relatively younger and less educated before 1980, that
                             could account for their higher unemployment rates. To address this issue, we examine the influence
                             of age, education, and industry compositions of the female and male labor force on the evolution of
                             the gender unemployment gap.

                             2.1       Age Composition
                             Female workers were young relative to male workers before 1990 as the left panel of Figure 2 shows.
                             This observation suggests that age composition can potentially contribute to the convergence in
                             male and female unemployment rates.

                                     To assess the quantitative importance of age composition, we follow the methodology in Shimer
                             (1998) and isolate the effect of changing age composition by computing counterfactual unemploy-
                             ment rates. To this end, we first divide the unemployed population into two gender groups, men,
                             m, and women, f . Each group is then divided into three age groups: Am = {16-24, 25-54, 55+} and
                             Af = {16-24, 25-54, 55+ }. Let lts (i) be the fraction of workers who are in group i at time t, and let

                                                                                                 5
ust (i) be the unemployment rate for workers who are in group i at time t. Then unemployment rate
for gender s at time t is ust = i∈As lts (i)ust (i) where s ∈ {m, f }. We then calculate a counterfactual
                               P

unemployment rate, ũft , for women by assuming that the age composition of the female labor force
were the same as men’s, i.e. ltf (i) = ltm (i): ũft = i∈Af ltm (i)uft (i). The right panel of Figure 2
                                                      P

shows both the actual and counterfactual gender unemployment gaps. Since the female labor force
before 2000 was younger than the male labor force, the counterfactual gender unemployment gap
lies below the actual. However, this effect is clearly not big enough to explain the gender gap in
unemployment rates. After 2000, since the age difference disappeared, there is no difference between
the actual and counterfactual unemployment rates.

2.2      Education Composition
Another compositional change in the labor force is the difference between the skill levels of men and
women. The left panel of Figure 3 shows the average years of schooling for workers 25 years of age
and older.2 To compute average years of schooling, we divide the labor force into four education
groups, Ae ={less than a high school diploma, high school diploma, some college or an associate
degree, college degree and above}. We then calculate the average skill of the labor force by gender
   P       j                j
as   i∈Ae lt (i)y(i) where lt (i) is the fraction of education category for gender j and y(i) is the
average years of schooling corresponding to that category.3
       The left panel of Figure 3 shows that before 1990, female workers were on average less educated
than male workers. Between 1990 and 1995, the education ratio converged and after 1995, women
became relatively more educated. We calculate a counterfactual unemployment rate for women
by assigning the male education composition to the female labor force, i.e. ltf (i) = ltm (i). The
right panel of Figure 3 shows both the actual and counterfactual gender unemployment gaps. The
importance of skill composition is very small until 1990. As female education attainment rises
after 1990, the counterfactual unemployment gap becomes higher, as women have lower educational
attainment in the counterfactual. This counterfactual exercise shows that the change in the skill
distribution had a minimal impact on the gender unemployment gap.

2.3      Industry Composition
There have always been considerable differences between the distribution of female and male workers
across different industries. In general, goods-producing industries, such as construction and man-
ufacturing, employ mostly male workers while most female workers work in the service-providing
industries and in government. Figure 4 shows the fraction of male and female workers employed in
the goods-producing, service-providing, and government sectors. As the economy moved away from
   2
     We impose this age restriction since we are interested in completed educational attainment. Consequently, the
unemployment rates in Figure 3 are different from the overall unemployment rates.
   3
     We use 10 years for less than a high school diploma, 12 years for high school diploma, 14 years for some college
or an associate degree, and 18 years for college degree and higher. Note that the education definition changed in the
CPS in 1992. Prior to 1992, the categories were High school: Less than 4 years and 4 years and College: 1 to 3 years
and 4 years or more. These categories are very similar to the post-1992 ones.

                                                   We calculate a counterfactual unemployment rate for women by assigning the male industry
                                            composition to the female labor force to isolate the role of the industry distribution. Since indus-
                                            try classification changed in the CPS over time, we classify industries into three broad categories:


                                                                                                                       7
goods-producing industries, service-providing industries and government. Since industry informa-
tion is missing for some unemployed workers (for example for workers who have not worked before),
we also keep a missing industry as a separate group.4 Figure 5 shows both the actual and coun-
terfactual gender unemployment gap. The industry composition does not affect the evolution of
trend unemployment rates over time. However, its impact is important during recessions. If women
had men’s industry distribution, their unemployment rate would have gone up more during the
recessions, resulting in a smaller gender unemployment gap. If we focus on the three most recent
downturns, which occurred after male and female unemployment rates converged, industry compo-
sition explains more than half of the gender gap during the recessions. As for the 1981-82 recession,
the counterfactual predicts that the female unemployment rate would have been higher if women’s
employment patterns were similar to men’s. We explore this issue further in Section 6.

       In Appendix A2 we repeat the same counterfactual exercise using broad industry groups, 2-
digit SOCs (Standard Occupational Classification) and also following Acemoglu and Autor (2011)’s
occupation classifications and find that industry and occupational composition do not account for the
evolution of the gender unemployment gap. To sum up, we conclude that gender differences in age,
education, and industry composition cannot account for the evolution of the gender unemployment
gap.

    We also computed the counterfactual unemployment rate for women by distributing individuals in the missing
group to other industries based on the prevailing industry share of the rest of the labor force. The results are very
similar.

                                 3             Convergence in Labor Force Attachment
                                 Our hypothesis is that the evolution of the gender unemployment gap was due to the convergence in
                                 labor force attachment of women and men. As women have become more attached to the labor force,
                                 men have become less attached, reducing the difference in the degree of labor force attachment. In
                                 this section, we examine various statistics that are influenced by labor force attachment to document
                                 this convergence. In particular, we focus on labor force participation, interruption in employment
                                 spells, unemployment duration, and labor market flows.
                                              Figure 6 shows the evolution of the labor force participation rate for men and women starting
                                 in 1970. As the figure shows, women had considerably lower labor force participation rates in the
                                 1970s. Among working age women, a higher fraction was not in the labor force (Goldin, 1990).
                                 Moreover, those who ever participated in the labor force experienced more frequent spells of non-
                                 participation (Royalty, 1998), especially in childbearing years. The evolution of labor force behavior
                                 in connection to pregnancy and child birth is documented in the 2008 Current Population Report on
                                 “Maternity Leave and Employment Patterns of First-time Mothers: 1961-2003.” This report shows
                                 that women are now more likely to work both during pregnancy and after child birth. Whereas
                                 in 1976-1980, the fraction of women who stopped working two months or more before the end of
                                 pregnancy was 41%, that ratio dropped to 23% in 1996-2000. Among women who worked during
                                 pregnancy 36% quit their jobs in 1981-1985 and this fraction dropped to 26% by 1996-2000. Leave
                                 arrangements that allow women to keep their positions became more widespread. The fraction of
                                 women who used paid/unpaid leave after childbirth increased from 71% in 1981-1985 to 87% in
                                 1996-2000.5

       On the contrary, for men, labor force attachment got weaker. The labor force participation rate
of men declined from 80% in 1970 to 75% in 2000 as the left panel of Figure 6 shows. Moreover
full-year non-employment, an indication of permanent withdrawal from the labor force, increased
among prime-age men. The amount of joblessness accounted for by those who did not work at all
over the year more than tripled, from 1.8% in the 1960s to 6.1% in 1999-2000, (Juhn, Murphy, and
Topel, 2002).6
       Another dimension of convergence in labor market attachment is the shrinking gender gap
in unemployment duration (Abraham and Shimer, 2002). The right panel of Figure 6 plots the
evolution of average duration of men and women. As the figure shows, men on average experienced
substantially longer unemployment spells relative to women until 1990s. Starting in the 1990s,
women’s average duration increased to values similar to men’s. This observation alone suggests
that women’s unemployment rate should have increased relative to men’s as their unemployment
duration got longer, implying an increasing gender unemployment gap instead of a shrinking one.
This of course is a simplistic argument since it ignores the other determinants of the unemployment
rate, i.e. various flows between three labor market states.
       For a complete picture of the determinants of the unemployment rate, we examine the evolution
of the flow rates between unemployment (U ), employment (E) and non-participation (N ) in Figure
7. As the figure shows, the convergence in labor force attachment of men and women has affected the
labor market flow rates that involve the participation decision. Women have become less likely to
leave employment for non-participation—a sign of increased labor force attachment—while men have
become more likely to leave the labor force from unemployment and less likely to re-enter the labor
force once they leave it—a sign of decreased labor force attachment. For example, employment-to-
non-participation (EN ) flow rates were more than twice as high for women as for men in 1970s, and
this gap closed by 50% percent by mid-1990s as shown in Figure 7. Similarly, there was convergence
in non-participation-to-unemployment (N U ) flows rates. Figure 7 also shows that unemployment-
to-employment (U E) flows did not exhibit any convergence, ruling out the potential explanation
that the disappearance of the gender unemployment gap was due to convergence in job-loss or
job-finding rates.
       As we have shown, the empirical evidence suggests strong convergence in labor force attachment
for men and women. However, at first glance, it is not obvious that these patterns are consis-
tent with a closing gender unemployment gap. Most importantly, we have discussed that women’s
duration of unemployment increased relative to men’s starting in the 1990s. An increase in the
duration of unemployment clearly causes an increase in the unemployment rate and seems inconsis-
tent with our hypothesis. It is true that if attachment only affected the duration of unemployment
for women, everything else being equal, the female unemployment rate would have risen. How-
ever, as female attachment became stronger, women also became less likely to leave employment
for non-participation and experience unemployment when trying to return to the labor force after
   6
     The decline in male participation is typically attributed to two factors: an expansion of the disability benefits
program (Autor and Duggan, 2003) and low levels of real wages of low skill men during the 1990s (Juhn, Murphy,
and Topel, 2002).

non-participation spells. These changes caused a drastic increase in employment, counteracting the
rise in the unemployment duration.
    To summarize, the evidence we surveyed suggests that the evolution of the gender gap in un-
employment cannot be explained without considering the drastic change in women’s labor force
participation and the relatively smaller but still evident decline in men’s participation. Therefore,
in the next section, we examine a search model of unemployment with a participation margin in
order to capture the joint evolution of participation and unemployment gender gaps.


4    Model
The link between gender gaps in labor force participation and unemployment is a critical component
of our hypothesis. We therefore develop a model economy with a frictional labor market, mostly
based on Pissarides (2000), augmented with an explicit participation decision. There are three
distinct labor market states: employment (E), unemployment (U ) and non-participation (N ). Men
and women in the model differ by their individual opportunity cost of being in the labor force, which
influences their quit and search decisions, following Garibaldi and Wasmer (2005). This variable is
stochastic and can be interpreted simply as the value of leisure or the value of home production.
It’s distribution varies by gender and is i.i.d. over time. In each period, agents may receive a new
draw of their opportunity cost of working, with a certain constant probability, which also varies by
gender. Some examples of shocks to the opportunity cost of work that we are aiming to capture
include poor health or disability (own or of family members), pregnancy and childbirth, and change
in income of household members.
    Our main assumption is that women’s opportunity cost of working is higher on average and
more dispersed relative to men’s, and that women have a higher probability of drawing a new value
of this cost in any period. This assumption is intended to capture the relative barriers to women’s
labor force participation and differences in attachment by gender that have been discussed in the
literature on female labor force participation.
    Individuals also vary by skill and there are two skill levels with separate job markets. Hours of
work are fixed and wages are determined according to a surplus splitting arrangement within each
skill group.
    When a firm and a worker meet and form a match, job creation takes place. Before a match
can be formed, a firm must post a vacancy. All firms are small and each has one job that is vacant
when they enter the job market. The number of jobs is endogenous and determined by profit
maximization. Free entry ensures that expected profits from each vacancy are zero. The job-finding
prospects of each worker are determined by a matching function, following Pissarides (2000).
    The skill distribution by gender is exogenous as the model abstracts from human capital invest-
ment decisions. We also abstract from differences in marital status, even as most of the convergence
in labor force participation rates and unemployment rates by gender in the aggregate are determined

by the behavior of married women.7
       We now proceed to describe the workers’ and firms’ problems and derive the qualitative prop-
erties of the model.

4.1      Workers’ Problem
The economy is populated by a continuum of unit measure of workers, of different gender, j = f, m.
Workers of each gender also differ by skill, where h denotes high-skill workers, and l low-skill workers.
Worker skill affects productivity, yi , with i = l, h, with yh > yl .
       Each worker can be in one of three states: employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force (-).
In addition, each worker is characterized by her realization of an idiosyncratic shock x ≥ 0. The
cumulative distribution function of x is represented by Fj (x) for j = f, m, which is i.i.d. over time
and across workers of a given gender.
       The flow values for the worker of type ij, depend on her realized value of x and her labor market
status, and if she is employed, on the wage, w. They are defined as follows. For the employed,
 E (x, w) = w + (1 − e)x, for the unemployed v U (x) = (1 − s)x, and for individuals out of the labor
vij                                           ij
        N (x) = x,s where e ∈ (0, 1] is the fraction of time devoted to market work if employed,
force, vij
s ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of time devoted to job search if unemployed. The values of a worker as
a function of her current x will be denoted by VijE (x, w) for an employed worker, VijU (x) for am
unemployed worker and VijN (x) for workers who are out of the labor force.
       Each individual draws a value of x at time 0 and samples a new draw of x in each period
with probability λij ∈ [0, 1]. With probability 1 − λij , individual’s x remains the same as in the
previous period.8 We assume that the new value of x, denoted with x0 , is drawn at the beginning
of the period. In addition, employed agents may experience an exogenous separation shock, with
probability δij ∈ (0, 1), while unemployed agents may receive a job offer with probability pi ∈ [0, 1]
which is determined in equilibrium.9 The separation and job-finding shocks for that period are also
realized before the agent can make any decisions.
       Under these assumptions on timing, workers’ value functions take on following form.
       For employed individuals:
                                                Z   xj
   VijE (x; w)         E
                                                          (1 − δij )max VijE (x0 ; w), VijU (x0 ; w), VijN (x0 ; w) dFj (x0 )
                                                                                                                 
                 =    vij (x; w)   + λij β
                                                  xj
                               Z   xj
                                            δij max VijU (x0 ; w), VijN (x0 ; w) dFj (x0 )
                                                                              
                      +λij β
                               xj

                      +(1 − λij )β (1 − δij )VijE (x; w) + δij max VijU (x; w), VijN (x; w) ,
                                                                                         
                                                                                                                            (1)
   7
     This modeling choice is driven by the fact that some key labor market statistics we use in the calibration are not
available by marital status, or are subject to large measurement error at that level of disaggregation.
   8
     Note that even though the distribution of x is i.i.d., due to this feature of the model, there is persistence in x at
the individual level.
   9
     We allow the probabilities λ and δ to vary by gender and skill in order to match selected labor market flow rates
by gender and skill in the quantitative analysis. The job-finding rate p will vary by skill in equilibrium, thus, we
incorporate this feature in the worker’s problem.


                                                                    13
with i = l, h and j = f, m, where β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor and xj , xj are the extremes of
the support of the distribution of x for j = f, m. The value function reflects that an agent who
receives a new value of opportunity cost of work, x0 , which occurs with probability λij , and does
not receive a separation shock chooses between remaining in the job or quitting to unemployment
or non-participation. If she does experience a separation shock, she may choose only between
unemployment and non-participation. If instead she does not draw a new value of x, which occurs
with probability 1−λij , she continues in that state as long as she does not receive a separation shock.
If she is hit by a separation shock, then she chooses between unemployment and non-participation.
    For unemployed individuals, the value function is:
                                                        Z   xj
         VijU (x; w) = vij
                        U
                                                                  pi max VijE (x0 ; w), VijU (x0 ; w), VijN (x0 ; w) dFj (x0 )
                                                                                                                  
                           (x) + λij β
                                                         xj
                                         Z    xj
                                                       (1 − pi )max VijU (x0 ; w), VijN (x0 ; w) dFj (x0 )
                                                                                              
                               +λij β
                                             xj

                               +(1 − λij )β pi max VijE (x; w), VijU (x) + (1 − pi )VijU (x; w) .
                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                 (2)

    Thus, an unemployed worker, who draws a new value of x in the period and receives a job offer
decides between becoming employed, remaining unemployed or exiting the labor force. If instead
she does not receive a job offer, she chooses between unemployment and non-participation. If the
worker does not draw a new value of x in the current period, she will choose between employment
and remaining unemployed if she does receive a job offer, and will remain unemployed otherwise.
    Finally, non-participants solve the following problem:
                                         Z    xj
   VijN (x; w)        N
                                                   max VijU (x0 ; w), VijN (x0 ; w) dFj (x0 ) + (1 − λij )βVijN (x; w).
                                                      
                 =   vij (x)   + λij β                                                                                           (3)
                                         xj


This problem reflects that a non-participant would only consider entering the labor force if she draws
a new value of the opportunity cost of work x. In that case, she will transition into unemployment
for at least one period.
    A worker who does not receive a new value of x in the current period will prefer to remain in
her current state, unless an exogenous shock hits, such as a separation shock for employed workers,
or a job-finding shock for the unemployed. Since x is i.i.d., an unemployed worker with a job offer
has the same problem of an employed worker who has not been separated. Similarly, an employed
worker who has just been separated faces the same choice as an unemployed worker without a job
offer.
    Workers’ optimal policies can be represented in the form of cut-off rules, defined as follows. A
worker with current opportunity cost of working x0 will prefer employment over unemployment if
x0 ≤ xaij (w) and will prefer unemployment if x0 > xaij (w). She will prefer employment over non-
participation for x0 ≤ xqij (w) and non-participation to employment for x0 > xqij (w). A worker will
choose unemployment over non-participation for x ≤ xnij (w) and will prefer non-participation for
x > xnij (w). The threshold levels for the cut-off rules depend on the wage through the value of

                                                                          14
employment and unemployment.
   The solution to these optimization problems gives rise to worker flows in equilibrium. The
pattern of worker flows depends on the relation between the cut-off levels xaij (w), xqij (w), and xnij (w)
that we derive in Appendix A3.

4.2    Firms’ Problem and Equilibrium
Production is carried out by a continuum of unit measure of firms using only labor. Firms are active
when they hire a worker, and each firm can hire at most one worker. All workers with the same
skill level are equally productive. There are separate job markets for each skill group and wages are
chosen to split the surplus between the firm and the worker. Each firm posts a vacancy, at a cost
ci > 0 for i = l, h, in order to hire a worker who will produce in the following period. There is free
entry in the firm sector.
   Given that firms do not observe the worker’s individual opportunity cost of working and since
the distribution of x depends on gender, wages may only depend on gender within each skill group.
Since x is on average higher for women, women have higher quit rates and generate lower surplus
for the firm for a given wage. We assume that wages for men are set according to a surplus splitting
mechanism in each skill group and then consider different alternatives for female wages. Our baseline
case imposes that female wages are such that the surplus to a firm is equalized across genders.
   The value of a filled job at wage w, which we denote as Jij (w), is given by:

                                        min{xqij (w),xa
                                                      ij (w)} 
                                   (Z
                                                                  (1 − δij )Jij0 (w) + δVi dFj (x0 )
                                                                                          
            Jij (w) = yi − w + β
                                     xj
                                                                                                           )
                                                                 Z   xj
                                                             +                                   Vi dFj (x0 ) .   (4)
                                                                   min{   xqij (w),xa
                                                                                    ij (w)   }

The first term is the flow value of a filled job, given by productivity minus the wage. Firms discount
the future at the same rate as workers. As discussed above, workers may quit to unemployment
or non-participation if x > min(xqij (w), xaij (w)). If the worker does not quit, the job could still get
destroyed exogenously with probability δij . In this case, the firm creates a vacancy with value Vi .
If the worker does quit, the firm will again create a vacancy. As long as x is i.i.d., Jij (w) does not
depend on x.
   We assume that x is not observed, while gender and skill are observed. Firms offer a wage wij
conditional on observables, based on their assessment of the characteristics of workers who they
might be matched to. For a given candidate equilibrium wage, the distribution of characteristics for
unemployed workers is determined by the workers’ optimal policy functions. We assume that firms
know the distribution of characteristics in the pool of currently unemployed workers. However, the
probability of acceptance, given that pool, depends on the actual wage being offered by firms.
   Appendix A3 describes in detail the mechanism for the determination of equilibrium wages by
sex, and all additional equilibrium conditions.

5         Quantitative Analysis
We now proceed to calibrate our model and run a series of experiments to assess the contribution
of convergence in labor market attachment to the convergence of unemployment rates by gender.
Specifically, we set the base year to be 1978, and calibrate the model to this date. This choice of
base year is motivated by the fact that detailed gross flows data become available starting from
1976. In addition, 1978 is the midpoint between the peak and trough of the 1975-80 expansion.10
The key data targets for the 1978 calibration are participation rates and unemployment rates by
gender.
         We then choose 1996 as a new reference year to assess the role of convergence in attachment.
We choose 1996 for various reasons: 1. The aggregate unemployment rate in 1978 and 1996 are
almost identical; 2. Both 1978 and 1996 are the mid-points of expansions; 3. Female labor force
participation flattened out in the early 1990s (Albanesi and Prados, 2014).
         Throughout the quantitative analysis, we assume that x follows a generalized Pareto distribution
with tail index (shape) parameter κj 6= 0, scale parameter equal to 1, and threshold parameter
xj ≥ 0. We allow the tail index and threshold parameters to vary by gender. In addition, for
computational purposes, we truncate the right tail of the x distribution at xj for j = f, m. This
yields two gender specific parameters to calibrate for the x distribution.

5.1        Calibration
We now describe the 1978 calibration. Our general strategy is to set certain parameters based on
independent evidence, and determine the rest in order to match some key moments in the data.
         We start with the parameters set using independent evidence. We interpret the model as monthly
and set the discount rate, β, accordingly to 0.996. We target the population of workers older than 25
years of age since we focus on completed education. We set the educational composition of the labor
force by skill and gender to their empirical values in 1978. We assume that the matching function
is Cobb-Douglass and set the elasticity of the matching function with respect to unemployment,
α, to 0.72 following Shimer (2005). Worker’s bargaining power, γ, is set to the same value.11 We
set e to 0.625 corresponding to a work day of 10 hours out of 16 active hours. The parameter s is
calibrated to 0.125 to match the 2 hour per day job search time reported in Krueger and Mueller
(2011). We set the vacancy creation cost parameter, ci , to 8.7 for both skilled and unskilled workers,
corresponding to about three months of earnings for skilled male workers. We set the lower bound on
the distribution of the support for x to zero for both genders. Table A1 in Appendix A4 summarizes
the calibration of these parameters.
         The rest of the parameters are set to closely match a set of salient statistics in the data. These
    10
     As we have shown, the male unemployment rate is more cyclical leading to cyclicality in the gender unemployment
gap. By picking the midpoint of the expansion, we tried to isolate the long-term behavior of the gender unemployment
gap. The gender gap in unemployment in 1978 is equal to the average of this variable in the 70s.
  11
     We choose this value to maintain consistency with the literature. This choice does not guarantee efficiency in
this model since the Hosios condition need not hold given our wage-setting mechanism.



                                                        16
moments are: the skill premium, the labor force participation rate by gender, the unemployment
rate by gender, and the EU and EE flow rates by gender and skill.12 The parameters we use to
match these statistics are yi , κj , xj , λij , and δij for i = l, h and j = f, m. Here κj is the tail end
parameter of the generalized Pareto distribution for x for gender j while xj is the upper bound for
the support of x in the discretized distribution we use in the computation. All these parameters
jointly determine the model outcomes we target; though yi is the most important parameter for
matching the skill premium, κj and xj are key for matching the labor force participation and the
unemployment rates by gender, and λij and δij are most relevant for matching the flows. We report
all calibrated parameter values, as well as the calibration targets, in Appendix A4.
       It is well known that three-state search-matching models typically have difficulty matching
the flow rates that involve non-participation, as discussed in Garibaldi and Wasmer (2005) and
Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, and Şahin (2017). An important reason for this problem is the
misclassification error, which is estimated to be larger for women. To address this issue, we introduce
misclassification error in the labor market status outcomes of our model, using the transition matrix
estimated by Abowd and Zellner (1985).13 Correcting for misclassification error, we match all the
targets exactly with the exception of the EU flow rate for skilled workers and the EE flow rates for
female and unskilled workers.
       The model has predictions for labor market flows by gender. Table 1 shows all the flow transition
rates in the data in 1978 for men and women as well as the model’s implications for these flow rates.14
We also present the ratio of women’s flow rates to men’s to assess the model’s performance in
capturing gender differences in flow rates. The biggest gender differences are in flows involving non-
participation. In particular, the EN flow rate is around 3 times higher for women than men and the
U N flow rate is about 2 times higher. Interestingly, flows between unemployment and employment
are very similar across genders. Our model matches these patterns very well. Specifically, the EN
flow in the model is 2.6 times higher and U N is 1.6 times higher for women relative to men.15
       Our model also has implications for the gender wage gap. In our framework, the gender wage
gap arises only because of women’s higher quit rates. High quit rates lower the value of a match
formed with a female worker, especially for high skilled workers for whom the foregone surplus is
larger. This mechanism generates a gender wage gap of 10% for unskilled workers and a gap of 12%
for skilled workers. The corresponding values in the data are 65% and 72%, respectively as shown
  12
     Interestingly, the EU flow rate was almost identical for men and women in 1978 suggesting that the gender gap
in unemployment was not due to differential job-loss probabilities.
  13
     The Abowd and Zellner (1985) transitions are reported in Table A7 in Appendix A4 as our baseline case since
Abowd and Zellner’s correction coincides with the alternative method of purging the data from spurious transitions
as implemented by Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2015). As a robustness exercise, we also use the misclassification error
estimates calculated by Poterba and Summers (1986), and compute a version of the model without misclassification
error. These results are also presented in Table A8 in Appendix A4. The Poterba and Summers (1986) misclassification
error estimates are reported in Table A7.
  14
     The table reports transition probabilities from the state given in the row to the state given in the column. For
example, in 1978, the employment-to-unemployment (EU ) transition rate was 0.010.
  15
     Table A8 in Appendix A4 shows the model predictions without classification error and shows that introducing
misclassification error improves the model’s ability to replicate labor market transition rates substantially. This
confirms the importance of adjusting for misclassification error in three-state labor market models.

in Table 4.16 Thus the model captures less than 20% of the gender wage gap in the data. The rest
of the gap in 1978 is likely driven by other factors that we abstract from in our model.

5.2     Changing Labor Market Attachment: Comparison of 1978 and 1996
To explore the role of labor market attachment for the gender unemployment gap, we perform the
following exercise. We first adjust all labor market parameters that change exogenously between
1978 and 1996. We then change the parameters that affect participation to match participation
rates by gender in 1996, and consider the resulting effect on unemployment rates by gender. We
examine the effects of all these changes jointly, and in isolation, to assess the role of each force.
      The parameters that reflect the variation in outcomes that are exogenous to our model are the
skill distribution, the skill premium, and the EU flow rate. We change the skill composition by
gender to match the 1996 skill distribution, which reflects a stronger growth in the fraction of skilled
workers for women relative to 1978. To incorporate the effects of the rising skill premium, we set
productivity differences between high and low skill workers to match the aggregate skill premium
in the data in 1996. As is well known, the skill premium grows substantially in the U.S. over this
period, and this tends to increase participation for skilled workers in the model, other things equal.
In addition, we vary δij to match the EU flow rate by gender and skill. The EU rate in 1996
is higher than in 1978, especially for men, and this affects the unemployment rate directly, and
participation indirectly, since it affects the value of being employed.17
      To match the participation rates by gender in 1996, we change the upper bound of the support
of the distribution of the opportunity cost of work for women and men, x̄j , for j = f, m. Specifically,
we increase the value of x̄m and reduce the value of x̄f . As a consequence of this change, men can
attain higher values of the opportunity cost of work in 1996, relative to 1978, which reduces their
participation. By contrast, women are less likely to draw high values of the opportunity cost of
work in 1996 relative to 1978, which increases their participation.18 This change in the distribution
 16
    We define the gender wage gap as the ratio of male and female wages.
 17
    Table A2 in Appendix A4 reports the resulting parameters.

    Table A4 in Appendix A4 shows the effect of the change in x̄ on mean and standard deviation of x for women

of x is intended to capture a number of factors that have induced women’s attachment to rise
and men’s to fall. For women, these include the improvement of maternal health, the access to
oral contraceptives, the availability of home appliances, the decline of cultural barriers for women’s
market work, and a possible decline in gender discrimination. For men we capture factors such
as the rise in welfare benefits relative to wage income, disability payments and spousal income, as
well as labor demand factors.19 The parameters κj and λj for j = f, m also affect participation.
We maintain them at their original values for this exercise, choosing instead to match participation
by gender in 1996 by changing the value of x̄f and x̄m , because participation for both genders is
considerably more sensitive to x̄j . We discuss the role of κj and λj for participation in Section 5.4.3.
    Table 2 shows the unemployment and labor force participation rates by gender in the data
and in the model for both 1978 and 1996. Our model matches both statistics for 1978 perfectly
since it is calibrated to do so. For 1996, we match by construction the labor force participation
rates by gender, whereas the unemployment rates are determined endogenously. In the data, the
gender unemployment gap declined from 1.8 percentage points in 1978 to 0.3 percentage points
in 1996. Our model calibrated to match 1996 participation rates by gender predicts a gender
unemployment gap of 0.4 percentage points and thus accounts for almost all of the convergence in
the unemployment rates.We also define a percentage gender unemployment gap by computing the
ratio of the unemployment gender gap to the male unemployment rate, i.e. (uf − um )/um . With
this metric, the gender unemployment gap declined from 52.9% to 7.1% from 1978 to 1996 in the
data while the model’s prediction is a decline to 8.9%, which implies that the model can account
for 96% of the decline in the percentage gender unemployment gap.
    The flow rates that involve non-participation displayed the largest degree of convergence in the
data. Our model captures this feature of the data well.20 The female/male ratio of the EN flow
rate drops from 3.38 to 1.80 in the data, while this ratio changes from 2.55 to 2.08 in the model.
Similarly, U N flow rates display a sizable convergence both in the data and the model. The N U
and N E flow rates display limited convergence for the years we compare, however, there is a general
convergence pattern in the data that is captured by our model.21

5.2.1    Illustrating the Mechanism

An increase in labor market attachment need not lead a decline in the unemployment rate, since a
rise in labor force participation is generally associated with an increase in unemployment duration
and in the unemployment rate. Yet, in the data, and in our model, we find that a rise (decline)
in labor market attachment is associated with a decline (rise) in the unemployment rate. We now
illustrate the different forces at work.
and men. In particular, both the mean and the dispersion of the opportunity cost of market work fall for women
between 1978 and 1996, while they rise for men.

     Note that all the N E flows in the model are driven by misclassification error since we do not allow non-participants
to receive job offers.

Table 2: Empirical values and model outcomes for 1978 and 1996 for key labor market statistics. The 1978 model
outcomes are based on the calibrated model. The 1996 outcomes are based on a version of the model where the skill
distribution, the skill premium and the EU rate are set to their 1996 values and the features of the x are changed to
match labor force participation by gender in 1996.


    First, let us define the unemployment rate for gender j as

                                                  Uj        1
                                                       =      E
                                               Uj + Ej   1 + Ujj

where Uj and Ej are the number of unemployed and employed for gender j = f, m, respectively. This
identity shows that the response of the unemployment rate to the change in labor force attachment
depends on the response of the ratio Ej /Uj .
    To illustrate the intuition for our result we focus on the change in attachment for men. Recall
that in our 1996 experiment, we change the upper bound of the support of the distribution of the
opportunity cost of work. For men, this implies an increase in the upper bound of the support
to capture the decline in attachment. When this upper bound, x̄m rises, there are more men in
the population with higher opportunity cost of work. Consequently, the number of employed men,
(Em ), declines. At the same time, the number of unemployed men, (Um ), also goes down since the
value of being unemployed is lower due to the rise in the opportunity cost of work. As a result, both
employment and unemployment go down for men causing a decline in male participation. What
happens to the unemployment rate depends on the relative change in employment and unemploy-
ment. We find that in all the parametrizations of our model that we consider the employment effect
dominates and Em /Um decreases with x̄.
    Figure 8 shows how Ej /Uj and the unemployment rate varies as x̄j for j = f, m changes from
its 1978 value to its 1996 value. The figure shows the male unemployment rate (left panel) increases
as x̄m rises since the decline in employment dominates the decline in unemployment. For women,
since x̄f declines from 1978 to 1996, the opposite happens and the unemployment rate goes down
as employment rises more relative to the rise in unemployment (right panel).

         values for 20 intermediate points, keeping all other parameters at their calibrated values for 1978.


         5.3       Contribution of Various Forces
         As we previously discussed, the skill distribution, the skill premium, EU flow rates and labor force
         attachment all change from 1978 to 1996 in our model. In order to isolate the contribution of each
         factor, we change the corresponding set of parameters one at a time and examine their effects on
         the participation and unemployment gaps. We also examine the case in which only attachment of
         women and only attachment of men change, together with all the exogenous parameters. These
         results are displayed in Table 3. The third row of the table allows for changes in skill distribution,
         skill premium, and EU transition rate jointly. This variant of the model, which does not allow for
         changes in attachment, predicts that the gender gap in labor force participation rate drops only
         by 2 percentage points from 32% in 1978 to 30%. This suggests that the rise in the skill premium
         and in the fraction of female skilled workers relative to male skilled workers do not determine a
         substantial convergence in participation rates for men and women. Correspondingly, the predicted
         gender gap in the unemployment rate is 0.9 percentage points, or 21.4%, in this counterfactual,
         while it is 0.3 percentage points or 7.1% in the 1996 data. The decline in the gender unemployment
         gap is very modest, and occurs mainly through a rise in the male unemployment rate, due to a rise
         in the exogenous EU rate in 1996, relative to 1978.22
                Table 3 also reports the outcome of the model where each factor is changed in isolation. Chang-
         ing the EU rate alone causes the biggest decline in the gender unemployment gap in these coun-
         terfactuals, since the rise in the male EU rate causes the male unemployment rate to rise. The
         unemployment gap drops from 1.8 percentage points in 1978 (or 53%) to 1 percentage point (or
         24%) in this counterfactual. There is still only a 2 percentage point decline in the gender participa-
           22
                The full set of results for both years are reported in Appendix A4 in Table A8.



                                                                            21
tion gap showing that the increase in the male EU rate is an important factor when one compares
1978 and 1996, even if it does not affect the participation gap. As Figure 7 shows, the EU flow rate
increased from 1978 to 1996, especially for men, but overall there was no systematic variation in the
gender gap in these flows over time. This flow rate is very sensitive to business cycle fluctuations
and the variation mostly reflects business cycle variation rather than a long-term pattern.
   The change in the skill composition in isolation has virtually no affect on the gender gap in
participation and unemployment. This is consistent with the empirical counterfactual analysis of
the role of skill composition presented in Section 2. The rise in the skill premium in isolation actually
increases the gender participation gap. The rise in the skill premium increases participation for both
men and women, though the skill premium rose more for men than it did for women, as discussed in
Albanesi and Prados (2014), which induces male participation to rise more. The effect on the gender
unemployment gap is correspondingly very small, with a 0.1, relative to 1.5 percentage points in
the data. This effect is likely due to the fact that the EU rate for 1978 is greater for men than for
women.
   The last two rows adjust attachment for women and men in isolation, in addition to changing the
EU rates, the skill composition and the skill premium to their 1996 values. These counterfactuals
are intended to capture the separate role of the decline in male attachment and the rise in female
attachment in the convergence of unemployment rates. Just matching female participation, in
addition to EU flow rates, the skill premium and the skill composition to 1996 data, reduces the
participation gap to 22.4 percentage points, or 24%. The gender unemployment gap drops by more
than half, to 0.7 percentage points, or 14%. When female attachment parameters are kept to their
1978 values while men’s participation is matched to the 1996 data, the participation gap is 24
percentage points, or 31%. The corresponding gender unemployment gap in this counterfactual is
0.8 percentage points, or 15%. The contribution of rising female participation to the convergence in
participation rates is slightly larger than the contribution of declining male participation, and this
is replicated for the corresponding effect on the gender unemployment gap.
   Taken together, these results suggest that the change in labor force attachment is the most
important single factor explaining the joint evolution of the gender gaps in unemployment between
1978 and 1996. The counterfactuals also show that the most important among the exogenous factors
affecting the gender unemployment gap is the rise in the male EU , and that this force alone can
explain a large component of the decline in the gender unemployment gap, via the corresponding
rise in the male unemployment rate. However, this finding is driven more by gender differences in
the cyclicality of EU rates than by any long run changes in the gender differentials in these rates.
   Our quantitative analysis treats the EU rate as exogenous, following Pissarides (1985) and
Shimer (2005) and we match its level by skill and gender in both 1978 and 1996. An important
feature of the EU transition rate is that it has always been more cyclical for men than women,
with more pronounced increases (decreases) during recessions (expansions). Even if our choice
of calibration periods, 1978 and 1996, aims to minimize business cycle effects, there is still some

relative variation in EU rates.23 This variation reflect differences in cyclicality of the job-loss rates
by gender rather than structural changes. The lack of convergence in the EU transition rates by
gender was also documented by Abraham and Shimer (2002) who emphasized that the convergence
was instead observed in the transitions involving participation. This is the main motivation for
our modeling strategy which focuses on endogenizing the participation margin rather than the job
destruction margin. As we show in Section 2, the differences in industry composition of male and
female employment is the main driver for the differential cyclicality of job loss, which we abstract
from in our model.
    Table 4 reports the model’s implications for the evolution of gender wage gaps by skill. We find
that gender wage gaps virtually disappear in the 1996 calibration of the model. This outcome is
due to the fact that the rise in women’s labor force attachment causes their quit rates to get closer
to men’s. In the model, when quit rates are similar, the value associated to hiring male and female
workers also converges, causing the gender wage gap to decrease. In the data, a substantial gender
wage gap still remains, suggesting that the remaining gap is most likely due to factors absent in
our model. In Section 5.4.1, we consider alternative wage setting mechanisms to further explore the
implications for changes in wages.

5.4     Robustness
This section discusses the robustness of our results with respect to the choice of the wage setting
mechanism, the magnitude of the gender gap on participation and unemployment, and the choice
of the parameters that we vary to match participation in 1996.

     The female EU transition rate was calibrated to be 1% and 1.1% and the male EU rate was calibrated to be
0.9% and 1.2% in 1978 and 1996, respectively. See Table A2 in Appendix A4.

5.4.1    Different Wage-Setting Mechanisms

In this section, we consider alternative wage-setting mechanisms and repeat our quantitative ex-
periments for each case. In all these variations, we maintain the assumption that male wages are
determined through the same surplus splitting mechanism and let the female wage setting vary.
The cases we consider are: 1.Surplus splitting by sex: wages are determined for men and women
separately through surplus splitting within each skill group. Men’s and women’s bargaining powers
are set to the same value; 2.Exogenous gender wage gap: wages are determined for men through
surplus splitting and the female wages are set such that gender wage gap is exogenously matched
for each skill group; 3.Different bargaining power: wages are determined for men through surplus
splitting and the female bargaining power is set so that the gender wage gap is satisfied for each
skill group. The female bargaining power that matches the gender wage gap in 1978 is 0.26.
    We recalibrate our model for each of these three wage-setting mechanisms for 1978 and then
repeat the exercise performed for the baseline case to examine the implications of the model for
the gender unemployment gap in 1996.24 The results are reported in able A6 in Appendix A4. All
models generate very similar unemployment gender gaps, ranging between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage
points, for 1996 and explain the convergence in male and female unemployment rates.
    The exogenous gender wage gap and different bargaining power specifications, by construction,
match the gender wage gap by skill. However, assuming surplus splitting in segmented markets by
gender and skill generates a negative gender wage gap, implying a higher wage for women than men
for each skill group. The reason is that since women’s surplus conditional on the wage is smaller
than men’s, due to their greater opportunity cost of working, women have a higher outside option
resulting in higher wages.25

5.4.2    The Relationship Between Wage and Unemployment Gender Gaps

Our baseline model captures only a small fraction of the gender wage gap in the data, both in 1978
and in 1996. Since attachment is positively related to wages in the model, it is possible that the
declining gender wage gap explains the convergence in the unemployment rates. To explore this
channel, we employ the exogenous gender wage gap version of the model, where female wages are
  24
     All three models are calibrated in a similar fashion to the benchmark model with the exception of the different
bargaining power case, which targets the gender wage gap using the bargaining power of women as a free parameter.
  25
     For the same reason, assuming take-it-or-leave-it offers by firms will also result in a counterfactual prediction for
the gender wage gap.

set to match the gender wage gap. As reported in Table A6 in Appendix A4, this version of the
model has the ability to account for virtually all the convergence in unemployment rates over this
time period.26 We explore the contribution of the declining gender wage gap, by allowing only this
variable to change between 1978 and 1996. We also run an experiment in which in addition to the
gender wage gap, we vary the additional exogenous variables (EU rates, skill composition and skill
premium) between the two years. The results are displayed in Table 5.

Table 5: Contribution of the declining gender wage gap to the convergence in attachment and unemployment rates.
In this version of the model, male wages are set by surplus splitting whereas female wages are set to match the gender
wage gap in each year, given male wages. We then change only the gender wage gap to its 1996 value, keeping all
other parameters at their 1978 values (second line), or change the gender wage gap jointly with the EU rate, the skill
composition and the skill premium (third line).


    As shown in Table 4, the male/female wage ratio drops from 1.65 to 1.40 for unskilled workers,
and from 1.72 to 1.49 for skilled workers between 1978 and 1996. Yet, this increase in relative wages
for women only brings the gap in labor force participation rate to 26.9 percentage points, or 34.3%
in the model. Similarly, while the gap in unemployment rates drops to 0.3 percentage points or
7.1% in the data, in the model the gap is still 1.7 percentage points or 51.5%, little changed from
1978. Little is changed when the additional exogenous variables are also allowed to adjust to 1996
values. Based on these results, we conclude that the convergence in wages had a small impact on
the convergence in participation and the decline in the gender unemployment gap.

5.4.3    Parameters Affecting Participation Decisions

Our strategy to match participation has been to vary the upper bound of the support of the distri-
bution of the opportunity cost of work for women and men. The two other parameters that affect
attachment in the model are λij and κj and we assume both remained unchanged relative to 1978.
We keep constant for the following reasons: 1. There is no direct evidence to calibrate the gender
and skill specific λ values; 2. Its value has to change dramatically in order to match the increase
in women’s participation. We show in Appendix A5 that for the majority of the increase in par-
ticipation to arise from a change λ, the opportunity cost of work should essentially be unchanged
throughout the working life of an individual. Even this extreme case still falls short of accounting
for increase in female participation. As for κj , which is the tail index (shape) parameter for the
  26
     In this exercise, the change in attachment of men and women required to match their 1996 labor force participation
rates is different than in the benchmark model. In particular, it is smaller for women, as the rise in female wages
tends to increase attachment.

6         Differences in the Cyclicality of Job Loss and Unemployment by
          Gender
Since our analysis revealed that differences in job loss probabilities by gender are important in
understanding the cyclical behavior of the gender unemployment gap, in this section we focus on
gender differences in job loss during recessions and cyclicality of the gender unemployment gap.

6.1        Differences in the Cyclicality of Job Loss by Gender
We use the Current Employment Statistics (CES), known as the payroll survey, to compute the
payroll employment changes during recessions. Since payroll employment data are available starting
from 1964 by gender, it allows us to consider employment changes for the earlier recessions as well.27
For recessions, we report the percentage change in employment from the trough to the peak in
aggregate unemployment for each cycle.
         As Table 6 shows, employment declines have always been higher for men than for women ex-
plaining the higher EU transition rates for men during recessions.28 To isolate the effect of industry
distributions, we consider a counterfactual that assigns the male industry distribution to the female
employment, maintaining the female change in employment by industry over the event window. For
the last three recessions, the difference in industry distribution explains more than 70 percent of
the gender differences in payroll employment changes.29 For the earlier recessions, it can explain
about 40 percent to two-thirds of the gender differences with the exception of the 1979 recession,
where almost all gender differences are explained by gender differences in industry distributions.30
Albanesi (2017) argues the the differential in cyclical behavior of employment by gender gender until
was driven by the strong growth in female participation until 1993, when participation flattened
out. After 1993 gender differences in industry and occupational composition are the main drivers
of gender differences in the cyclical pattern of employment.

6.2        Differences in the Cyclicality of the Unemployment Rate by Gender
Male unemployment has always been more cyclical relative to female unemployment as shown in
Figure 1. Despite the convergence of gender-specific unemployment rates, this pattern has not
    27
     However, the CES only provides information about payroll employment changes and does not allow us to study
unemployment changes. While the participation margin is important in cyclical fluctuations in the unemployment
rate (see Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin, 2015), since employment changes are the main driver of unemployment fluctuations
these counterfactuals are still informative.
  28
     For this exercise, we focus on 12 broad industry groups, while the unemployment rate counterfactual focuses on
only 3 broad sectors.
  29
     See Şahin, Hobijn, and Song (2009) and Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin, (2010) for detailed analyses of gender differences
in unemployment during the Great Recession.
  30
     The fraction explained by industry distribution is computed as one minus the ratio of the percentage difference
after composition is taken into account to the actual percentage difference.

changed since 1948. We find that a substantial part of these cyclical differences in unemployment
rates by gender can be attributed to differences in industry distributions of men and women.
    In Section 2, we calculated a counterfactual unemployment rate for women by assigning the male
industry composition to the female labor force in order to isolate the role of differential industry
distribution. Figure 9 shows both the actual and counterfactual rise in the female unemployment
rates along with the rise in the male unemployment rate in periods where the unemployment rate
exhibited substantial swings. In particular, we start from the aggregate unemployment trough of the
previous expansion and continue until the unemployment rate reaches its pre-recession level. For the
2001 and 2007-09 recessions, since the unemployment rate does not reach its pre-recession trough
after the recession, we focus on a 12-quarter period for the 2001 recession and use all available data
for the 2007-2009 cycle. We find that industry composition explains around half of the gender gap in
unemployment throughout the 1981-82 and 2007-09 recession windows, and at peak unemployment
for the 2001 cycle. However, industry composition explains very little of the difference between the
rise in female and male unemployment rates for the 1981-82 cycle.


7    International Evidence
We conclude with an analysis of the international evidence on the link between labor force at-
tachment and the unemployment rate. Our analysis has two main implications for cross-country
patterns: 1. Countries with lower participation gaps, on average, should also exhibit lower un-
employment gaps; 2. Countries that have experienced closing participation gaps over time should
have experienced closing unemployment gaps. We examine these two implications using data on
labor force participation and the unemployment rate by gender for a group of 19 advanced OECD
countries, starting in 1970.
    Figure 10 displays the average percentage gender gap in labor force participation, defined as
(Lm − Lf )/Lm , and the average percentage gender unemployment gap, given by (uf − um )/um for
19 OECD countries throughout the whole sample period. There is a clear positive relation, with a
correlation of 0.53, between the participation and unemployment gender gaps suggesting that the

                         We have seen that for the U.S., the gender unemployment gap closed as female labor force
               participation rose. We next examine if this pattern is also observed in other countries by comparing
               the evolution of the participation and unemployment gaps over time in Table 7. In particular, we
               compute the participation and unemployment gaps for pre-1985 and post-1985 periods for a subset
               of countries.31 The table shows that the participation gap became smaller for all countries in our
               sample. The unemployment gap also followed a similar pattern for most of the countries: shrank or
               completely closed, with the exception of the Netherlands and Spain. For Finland and Ireland, the

the closing participation gaps were accompanied by shrinking unemployment gaps, consistent with
the implications of our analysis.


8    Concluding Remarks
We study the determinants of gender gaps in unemployment in the long run and over the business
cycle. We show that while the trend component of unemployment has converged by gender over time,
the cyclical component has remained stable. We attribute the closing of the gender unemployment
gap since the 1970s to the convergence in labor market attachment of women and men and assess
the contribution of this factor with a calibrated three-state search model of the labor market. We
find that our model accounts for almost all of the convergence in the unemployment rates by gender
in the data. The change in labor force attachment accounts for almost half of this convergence. A
broad implication of this finding is that the low unemployment rates that prevailed in the 1990s can
be partially attributable to the increase in female labor force attachment. Evidence from nineteen
advanced OECD economies suggests that the convergence in participation is associated with a

decline in the gender unemployment gap for almost all countries.
   We also examine the determinants of the cyclical behavior of unemployment by gender empiri-
cally. We find that the unemployment rate rises more for men than women during recessions. We
show that this difference can mostly be explained by gender differences in industry distribution for
recent cycles.
   The model we developed also has interesting implications for the link between labor force attach-
ment and the unemployment rate. While the prevailing simplistic view is that declining participation
puts downward pressure on the unemployment rate, our model shows that this is not necessarily
true. As discussed by Abraham and Shimer (2002), weak labor force attachment makes workers
more likely to drop out of the labor force, which reduces the duration of unemployment. However, it
also makes workers more likely to quit their jobs to non-participation. These counteracting effects
are present in our model and we have shown that, for both women and men, the second effect
dominated in the 1980s and 1990s, generating a positive relationship between the participation gap
and the unemployment rate gap.
   Another broad implication of our analysis is related to cross-country differences in the unem-
ployment rate. Azmat, Guell, and Manning (2006) have shown that cross-country variation in
unemployment rates is mostly driven by differences in women’s unemployment. Our findings sug-
gest that this difference may in large part be due to differences in female labor force participation.
Since labor force attachment is influenced by fiscal and social policies like the marginal tax on sec-
ond earners or maternity leave laws, cross-country differences in unemployment rates are affected
by these policies as well.

                                 Similar to differences in industry composition, gender differences in the distribution of workers across
                                 occupations have also been sizable. The share of male workers is higher in production occupations,
                                 while the share of female workers is higher in sales and office occupations as Figure A3 shows.
                                          To assess the role of occupation composition, we compute a counterfactual unemployment rate
                                 for women, in which we assign women the male occupational distribution. The results are displayed
                                 in the left panel of Figure A4. The counterfactual unemployment rate for women is higher than
                                 the actual unemployment rate, and higher than men’s unemployment rate starting in the mid
                                 1990s. This finding is driven in part by the high unemployment rate of women in male dominated
                                 occupations in this period, particularly production occupations.
                                          We also compute a counterfactual unemployment rate for women using the categorization in
                                 Acemoglu and Autor (2011), in which occupations are divided into four categories: Cognitive/Non-
                                 Routine, Cognitive/Routine, Manual/Non-Routine, and Manual/Routine. As shown in the right
                                 panel of Figure A3, the share of men in Manual/Routine tasks is relatively high, while the share
                                 of women is high in Manual/Non-Routine tasks. Moreover, the share of women in Cognitive/Non-
                                 Routine tasks, which started out lower than men’s, has been growing at a faster rate than men’s,
                                 leading to a 60% share of Non-Routine tasks for women by 2010, compared to a share of 45% for

                         men. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) document the decline of employment in routine tasks starting in
                         the 1990s, which could have led to a corresponding rise in the unemployment rate for men, relative
                         to that of women. Figure A4 suggests that female unemployment would have indeed been higher
                         since the early 1990s if their occupation composition was the same as men’s. However, occupation
                         composition with this categorization does not account for the gender unemployment gap in the early
                         years of the sample.

                       A3              Optimal Decision Rules and Worker Flows
                       The workers’ optimal decision rules and corresponding workers flows depend on the relation between
                       the cut-off values xaij , xnij , xqij that define the reservation strategies. These three cut-offs can be
                       ordered in six possible combinations, but only two cases are in fact possible under the assumption
                             W (x ) > v S (x ) > v N (x ) with 0 < s < e:

Jim (ŵim )Qim (ŵ, wim ) − Vi ≥ 0 is the expected surplus for the firm and 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is the bargaining
weight of the worker.
       The function Q(ŵij , wij ) represents the fraction of workers of type ij who are in the labor force
given that the candidate equilibrium wage is wij , and would accept a job offer at wage ŵij . With
this formulation, the firm understands that by offering a lower wage it will reduce the size of the
pool of workers that will accept the job, and conditional on accepting, workers will be more likely
to quit. On the other hand, a lower wage will increase current profits for the firm. The solution to
this wage setting problem delivers a policy function: ŵij (w). The fixed point of this policy function
constitutes the equilibrium wage:
                                                          ∗           ∗
                                                         wij = ŵij (wij ).

Since the opportunity cost of work, x, is privately observed and wages do not vary with this variable,
low x workers will earn informational rents, which will reduce the surplus of the firm.32
       We consider several alternative mechanisms for the determination of female wages. In the
baseline case, we impose that firms are indifferent between hiring female and male workers, for a
given skill level. Thus, we determine female wages conditional on skill levels by imposing:

                                                         ∗            ∗
                                                   Jif (wif ) = Jim (wim )                                                    (A4)


for i = l, h. This restriction pins down the female/male wage ratio for each skill level. We denote
the optimal value of a filled job with J i .


A3.2        Equilibrium Conditions
Since the value of a filled job does not depend on gender, the value of a vacancy only depends on
skill and is given by:
  32                      ∗     ∗                                                                                  ∗
       In equilibrium, Q(wij , wij ) = 1, so that the realized surplus for a firm employing a male worker is Jim (wim ) − Vi .




                                                                  5
                                                 Vi = −ci + χi βJ i ,                              (A5)

for i = l, h, where χi is the probability of filling a vacancy, determined in equilibrium.
    We assume free entry so that Vi = 0 for i = l, h. This implies that in equilibrium, using equation
A4, the following restriction will hold:
                                                    J i = ci /χi β.                                (A6)

for i = l, h.
    Following Pissarides (2000), firms meet workers according to the matching function, Mi (ui , vi )
for i = l, h, where ui is the number of unemployed workers and vi is the number of vacancies for
skill i. Mi (·) is increasing in both arguments, concave, and homogeneous of degree 1. The ratio
θi = vi /ui corresponds to market tightness in the labor market for workers with skill i = l, h. Then,
the job-finding rate is:
                                           pi := Mi (ui , vi )/ui = pi (θi ),                      (A7)

while the probability that a vacancy will be filled is:


                                           χi := Mi (ui , vi )/vi = χi (θi ),                      (A8)


with p0i (θi ) > 0 and χ0i (θi ) < 0, and pi (θi ) = θi χi (θi ) for i = l, h.


A3.3      Stationary Equilibrium
Since there are no aggregate shocks, we consider stationary equilibria defined as follows:

    • Household value functions, VijU (x; w), VijN (x; w) and VijE (x; w) and policy functions xaij (w),
       xqij (w) and xnij (w) satisfy equations 1, 2, 3.

    • Firms’ value functions, Jij and Vi satisfy equations 4 and A5.

    • Wages satisfy equations ?? and A4.

    • The job-finding and vacancy-filling rates satisfy equations A7 and A8, and the free entry
       condition (equation A6) holds.

    • The laws of motion for labor market stocks (U , E, and N ), derived in Appendix A3, are
       satisfied.

A5         Parameters Affecting Participation Decisions
Our calibration strategy has been to vary the upper bound of the support of the distribution of the
opportunity cost of work for women and men. Recall that each individual draws a value of x at time
0 and samples a new draw of x in each period with probability λij ∈ [0; 1] where this probability
depends on the individual’s gender and skill. To summarize, λ affects the frequency of changes in
individual’s attitude towards work while x affects their valuation of being in the labor force. In
particular, one can think of events like marriage, having children as events that could potentially
change the trade-off between working or not. λ affects how frequent these events are.

Figure A6: Female labor force participation rate as a function of average duration of opportunity cost of work (x).


       As we have discussed before there is no direct evidence to calibrate the gender and skill specific
λ values. In our calibration strategy we set the values of these parameters to minimize the distance
between the model implied and actual calibration targets and do not change their values when we
conduct our 1996 experiments. This strategy is based on the notion that the opportunity cost of
work has changed dramatically in the last 30 years, while the frequency of life changing events did
not notably change.33 However, even if the frequency of these life changing events have not changed
much, their impact on the trade-off between working and not working has changed considerably as
discussed in Section A5. Another reason not to vary the parameter λ between 1978 and 1996 is
that its value has to change dramatically in order to match the increase in women’s participation.
We illustrate this point in Figure A6.
       We start from our 1978 calibration and change the parameters that reflect the variation in
outcomes that are exogenous to our model: skill distribution, skill premium, and EU transition
rate and compute the female labor force participation rate. Changes in these exogenous parameters
  33
       For example, fertility rates from 1978 to 1996 were essentially unchanged (Albanesi and Olivetti, 2010).


                                                                               11
increase the female participation rate from 46.8% to 51.5%, as seen in Table A8 in Appendix A4.
Then instead of changing the upper bound of the support of the distribution of x, we change the
frequency of the x shock, which corresponds to the parameter λ, and recompute our model. In
particular, the λ values we pick correspond to an average duration between 3 to 42 years. As the
figure shows, even with an extreme increase of the duration for the x shock to 42 years, the female
labor force participation rate only rises as high as 55%, while it was 58.8% in 1996. In other words,
for the majority of the increase in participation to arise from a change in the frequency of x shocks,
the opportunity cost of work should essentially be unchanged throughout the working life of an
individual. Even this extreme case still falls short of accounting for increase in female participation.
   The other parameter that affects the distribution of x is the tail index (shape) parameter κ.
This parameter can also potentially affect participation decisions. Our calibration strategy was to
set the value of this parameter for our 1978 calibration to attain the minimum distance between
our targets and the data. However, we did not change its value for neither men nor women in our
1996 calibration. The main reason for this choice is the unresponsiveness of the participation rate
to this parameter. κ essentially determines the shape of the distribution and it is important for low
values of x. For these values of x, agents in our model always participate in the labor force. The
effect of the shape parameter gets smaller as x increases and this is where the agents on the margin
of participation/non-participation are. As a result, the shape parameter turns out to be much less
important than the upper bound of the distribution which has a direct effect on the mass of the
marginal workers.
