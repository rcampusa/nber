U.S. Presidential Executive Order 13141 commits the United States to a "careful assessment and

consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements." The most direct mechanism

through which trade liberalization would affect environmental quality in the U.S. is through changes

in the composition of industries. Freer trade means greater specialization, increasing the

concentration of polluting industries in some countries and decreasing it in others. Indeed, in this

paper we predict a substantial reduction in U.S. pollution from 1978-94 due entirely to a shift in the

composition of U.S. manufacturing toward cleaner industries. We then use annual industry-level

data on imports to the U.S. to examine whether this compositional shift can be traced to the

significant trade liberalization that occurred over the same time period; we conclude that no such

connection exists. First, we find that a shift toward cleaner industries, similar to that observed in

U.S. manufacturing, has also occurred among U.S. imports. Second, we find no evidence that

pollution-intensive industries have been disproportionately affected by the tariff changes over that

time period.

1. Introduction

        In recent decades, while U.S. manufacturing output increased, total pollution from

manufacturers declined. Much of the decline has been due to a large shift in the composition of

the U.S. manufacturing sector away from polluting industries and toward cleaner industries.

During the same period, U.S. tariffs on imported manufactured goods declined.                These

concurrent trends have led many to conclude that trade liberalization – “globalization” – has

caused the shift in U.S. manufacturing to clean industries, at the expense of environmental

quality in developing countries. In this paper we seek empirical support for that claim, using

data on tariffs, U.S. imports, pollution abatement costs, and industries’ relative pollution

intensities.

        This concern, that trade liberalization leads to a transfer of polluting industries to

developing countries, has been part of the impetus for widespread protests against the World

Trade Organization. It has been the motivation for environmental addenda to trade agreements

such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and it is the subject of President

Clinton’s Executive Order 13141, “Environmental Review of Trade Agreements.” EO13141

requires that the United States “factor environmental considerations into ... its trade negotiating

objectives,” and that the United States Trade Representative and the Chair of the Council on

Environmental Quality oversee analyses of the “environmental impacts of trade agreements.”

        Trade     liberalization   can   affect   the   environment   via   several   mechanisms:

interjurisdictional competition to lower standards, transfer of pollution abatement technology,

cross-border spillovers, changes to the overall scale of economies, etc. But it seems to us that the




                                                  1
most direct effect of trade liberalization on the environment would be through the composition of

industries. Trade liberalization leads to specialization, and countries that specialize in less

pollution-intensive goods will have cleaner environments.

        In this paper we assess the degree to which the reduction of U.S. tariffs on imported

goods accounts for the changing composition of U.S. manufacturing toward cleaner industries.

We do this in three ways. First, in section 2 of the paper, we examine the pollution content of

U.S. manufactured goods, imports, and exports, in the spirit of Kahn (2003), to see whether

imports have replaced the pollution-intensive goods no longer produced in the U.S. Second, in

section 3 of the paper, we use a regression approach, similar to Grossman and Krueger (1993), to

see whether the tariff reductions of the past several decades have exacerbated the “pollution

haven” effect. If this is the case, then broad-based tariff reductions could have caused the

compositional shift observed in the data. Finally, in section 4 of the paper, we investigate

whether the compositional shift in U.S. industries could be due to asymmetric trade liberalization

(i.e., larger U.S. tariff reductions in the more pollution-intensive industries). Specifically, we use

our regression coefficients to predict the changes in the composition of U.S. industries that are

due to past tariff reductions (as well as the changes that would be the result of setting current

tariff levels to zero).

        Our basic conclusion is that tariff reductions over the past several decades cannot account

for the change in the composition of U.S. manufacturing toward cleaner industries.              First,

imports from other countries do not appear to have replaced the domestic production of

pollution-intensive goods in the U.S. Second, we find no evidence that pollution-intensive

industries are disproportionately sensitive to tariff reductions. (In fact, just the opposite appears




                                                  2
likely.) Finally, while it is true that tariff reductions have been greater for polluting industries,

that difference explains only a small part of the overall shift in U.S. manufacturing.



2. The pollution content of U.S. manufacturing

           The various effects of trade on environmental quality can be divided into three

components: first, how trade affects the overall scale of the economy; second, how trade affects

the techniques of production, and third, how trade affects the composition of industries. The

various parties concerned about trade liberalization’s effect on the environment appear to

concentrate on the composition effect: specifically, the concern that trade liberalization will

result in the creation of pollution havens (countries that specialize in polluting industries).

Hence we begin by examining the degree to which the composition of U.S. manufacturing has

shifted towards clean industries, and how much of that shift can be explained by changes in the

composition of imports and exports.

           In order to isolate this composition effect, we need a metric with which to label various

industries as being relatively “clean” or “dirty.” To that end, we rely on the World Bank’s

“Industrial Pollution Projection System” (IPPS).1 The IPPS reports the amount of each of 14

pollutants, in pounds per million dollars of value added, that are generated from each of 459

four-digit SIC codes in 1987. These data are summarized in table 1. They represent a snapshot

of the technique of production, held constant in a single year.

           Figure 1a demonstrates the degree to which the U.S. industrial composition has shifted

towards polluting industries. The first (bold) line plots an index of total real manufacturing

output. The recessions of the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and early 1990s are apparent, and overall

manufacturing grew by 57 percent between 1972 and 1996.

    See Hettige et al. (1994).


                                                   3
         The dotted lines in Figure 1a plot the predicted total emissions of sulfur (SO2), suspended

solids in water, and hazardous waste, three of the 14 pollutants tracked by the IPPS. The

predicted pollution levels are calculated by multiplying each 4-digit manufacturing industry’s

real annual value added by the industry’s IPPS coefficient, and then summing across industries

to get total predicted pollution for each year. By holding the IPPS coefficients constant as of

1987, we are in effect freezing the technique of production, and only looking at changes in

pollution due to changes in the scale and composition of manufacturing. If industrial growth

were balanced, and every four-digit industry grew by the same 57 percent as did overall

manufacturing, then predicted pollution would coincide perfectly with manufacturing growth,

and grow 57 percent. The dotted pollution lines would overlie the bold manufacturing line. But

because relatively pollution-intensive industries shrank, while clean industries grew, the total

amount of predicted pollution grew by much less over this time period. Predicted sulfur grew 21

percent, suspended solids fell 15 percent, and hazardous waste grew 35 percent, all much less

than the growth of overall manufacturing.2

         Table 2 summarizes the data behind figure 1. The first column presents the growth in

real U.S. manufacturing value added from 1972 to 1994 (51 percent), compared with the

predicted growth in each of the 14 pollutants, where the predictions are based on the scale and

composition of manufacturing, holding technique constant.3

         Figure 1a and table 2 demonstrate the degree to which the U.S. manufacturing sector

shifted towards cleaner industries. During this same time period, U.S. tariffs fell: from 1974 to



2
  Thirteen of the 14 pollutants tracked by the IPPS grew by less than manufacturing. The only exception was
biological oxygen demand (BOD), which had predicted growth of 69 percent. Of this growth, 49 percent came from
two industries: "chemical preparations n.e.c." (SIC 2899) and "paperboard mills" (SIC 2631). These industries grew
by 68 and 54 percent, respectively, and had 57 and 32 times the mean IPPS coefficient for BOD.

  Table 2 uses data only up until 1994, which is the last year of the pollution abatement cost data we use later in the
paper.

1994, the average tariff on manufactured imports to the U.S. fell by over 50 percent, from over 8

percent to less than 4 percent. Given the steep drop in tariffs, combined with the dramatic shift

towards cleaner industries, we understand how casual observers could conclude that the two

trends are related. Indeed, such a relation makes sense intuitively, since trade liberalization

could lead to increased specialization, which in turn could result in the U.S. producing cleaner

goods.

         If it is true that the composition shift of U.S. manufacturing toward clean industries has

been caused by tariff reductions, one might expect that the composition of imports will have

shifted towards dirty industries. Figure 1b investigates the pollution composition of imports.

The first (bold) line in figure 1b plots the real value of U.S. imports, which grew by 318 percent

from 1972 to 1994. The dotted lines plot the predicted pollution content of those imports,

calculated in the same way as in figure 1a. We multiply the real value of each 4-digit industry’s

imports by its IPPS coefficient and then aggregate across industries. If the composition of

imports remained the same, then the dotted lines would overlie the bold imports line (i.e., grow

by 318 percent). The fact that the dotted lines lie below the imports line indicates that the

composition of imports to the U.S. has also shifted towards clean industries.

         The second column of table 2 summarizes the data behind figure 1b. Real imports grew

318 percent, while the predicted pollution composition of those imports grew by markedly less.

Of the 14 pollutants tracked by the IPPS, none grew by even 2/3 as much as real imports. Figure

1b and table 2 thus demonstrate that cleaner U.S. manufacturing composition is not offset by

dirtier imports. Rather, the composition of imports has also become cleaner.

         One potential counterargument to our observation that the composition of imports has

become cleaner is that the concerns about tariff reductions exacerbating pollution havens is




                                                 5
based largely on imports from developing countries, not from developed countries. To see

whether the composition of imports from relatively poorer countries has become more pollution-

intensive, in figure 1c we conduct the same exercise for imports from non-OECD countries only.

The first (bold) line plots the real value of imports from non-OECD countries. The dotted lines

again plot pollution predicted from the IPPS coefficients, multiplied by their respective 4-digit

industries’ imports, and aggregated across industries. Again, pollution predicted by the scale and

composition effects, holding technique constant, grew by far less than overall imports, even from

poorer countries. Table 2 summarizes these data in column (3). Real imports from non-OECD

countries grew by 344 percent from 1972 to 1994. But the composition of those imports shifted

towards cleaner industries, so that the pollution predicted from those imports grew by far less.

       So far we have demonstrated that the industrial composition of U.S. imports has become

less pollution-intensive, and that the missing polluting industries have not been replaced by

imports, or even by imports from non-OECD countries. A remaining piece of the puzzle, then, is

to ask what happened to the pollution composition of U.S. exports. If the composition of U.S.

consumption has remained steady, and the composition of U.S. manufactures and imports have

become cleaner, then the U.S. must be exporting the excess clean manufactured goods.

       Figure 1d plots the growth in real U.S. exports, and the predicted pollution content of

those exports, in the same manner as figure 1a-1c. Here the predicted pollution lines also lie

below the real exports line, but the shift is much less stark. Column (4) of table 2 presents the

data behind figure 1d. Real manufacturing exports grew by 269 percent, and most of the

predicted pollutants grew by slightly less. While the composition of U.S. exports has shifted

towards cleaner goods, it has not done so as dramatically as has the composition of U.S.

manufacturing or imports.




                                                 6
           Together, figure 1 and table 2 provide suggestive evidence that shift in U.S.

manufacturing towards cleaner industries has not been caused by trade liberalization, because the

shift in U.S. production has not been matched by an offsetting shift in imports towards more

polluting industries. But this evidence is only indirect. For more direct evidence we turn to a

regression-based approach, and ask whether tariff reductions exacerbate the tendency for

polluting industries to be imported in response to rising domestic pollution abatement costs.



3. A regression approach

           The large and growing literature evaluating the relationship between environmental

regulations and international trade has until recently found little or no effect of environmental

regulations on trade, and sometimes even found counterintuitive results suggesting that strict

environmental regulations increase exports and decrease imports. Through the late 1990s, most

studies used cross-sections of data, making it difficult to control for unobserved heterogeneity

across countries or industries, and to account for the endogeneity of environmental regulations.4

Recent studies have reversed these findings by using panels of data, including industry or

regional fixed-effects to account for heterogeneity, and instrumenting for pollution regulations to

account for their endogeneity.5

           This literature, however, has had little to say about how free trade agreements are likely

to affect the environment, the focus here. As mentioned previously, U.S. tariffs on imports have

fallen, and the composition of U.S. manufacturing has shifted towards cleaner goods in recent

decades, leading many observers to infer a causality between these two trends. However, we

know of no direct empirical tests of whether the trends are related.6

         One problem is that both the economics literature and the public debate have blurred two

alternative definitions of a “pollution haven effect.” The first is what we call the direct effect:

jurisdictions that impose strict environmental regulations may drive out polluting manufacturers

and increase imports of polluting goods. This direct effect has been the focus of all of the

empirical studies to date. These studies regress some measure of economic activity, (such as

imports, M) on characteristics of industries or jurisdictions, whatever the relevant unit of

observation, including the stringency of the prevailing pollution regulations:

(1)                            M it = β1 Pit + β 2Tit + X′it γ + di′α + vt′δ + eit

where Pit is a measure of pollution regulations, Tit is a measure of trade restrictions, Xit is a set of

industry characteristics, and di and vt are cross-section and time dummies. In this context, the

direct effect of pollution regulations (P) on imports (M) is captured by the coefficient β1 in

equation (1). Estimation of a negative coefficient on β1 is taken as evidence for the existence of

a pollution haven effect (i.e., more stringent environmental standards results in more of imports).

         Whether such “pollution haven effects” exist has taken on great importance in the current

policy debates, as the existence of such effects is taken as a potential problem in the negotiation

over trade agreements. Specifically, anti-globalization protests (and Executive Order 13141), are

concerned that international trade agreements, by lowering tariffs broadly, may enable polluting

industries to avoid strict environmental laws by relocating overseas and thus assist in the creation

of pollution havens. However, estimation of β1 tells us nothing about how trade liberalization

will influence the composition of industries and hence pollution patterns. Indeed, if equation (1)
6
 Antweiler, et al. (2001) explore a slightly different question. They ask how trade (rather than tariffs) affects the
environment. Moreover, they divide the overall effect into separate scale, composition, and technique portions, and
show that the composition effect by itself shifts polluting industries towards the U.S., not away from it.


                                                            8
is correctly specified, then trade agreements and tariff liberalization will have no effect on the

composition of industries unless the trade agreements are asymmetrically implemented and result

in disproportionately greater tariff reductions in the more pollution-intensive industries.7

         What is of concern to many environmental activists, however, is what we call the indirect

effect: the effect of trade liberalization on the direct (pollution-haven) effect. Specifically,

implicit in the concerns of many is the assumption that pollution-intensive industries are more

sensitive to tariff reductions than other industries, and thus a broad-based U.S. tariff reduction

will results in a compositional shift with relatively large increases in U.S. imports of pollution-

intensive goods.        Technically, if the direct effect is ∂M/∂P, then the indirect effect is

∂∂M/(∂P∂T). Empirically, this indirect effect can be measured by adding an interactive term to

equation (1) to get

(2)                      M it = β1 Pit + β 2Tit + β 3 P iTit + X′it γ + di′α + vt′δ + eit

where β3 captures the indirect effect of pollution regulations on the sensitivity of trade to tariffs.

         Note that we have interacted Tit with Pi , the average pollution abatement costs for

industry i across all time periods. This means that we are asking whether tariff changes have a

larger effect on imports for industries whose average pollution abatement costs are larger. The

independent effect of average pollution abatement costs on imports is captured by the industry

dummies. We could, of course, have asked a slightly different question, by interacting Tit with

Pit , which would estimate the degree to which tariffs have a larger effect on imports for

industries whose pollution abatement costs rose more. Or, we could have interacted Ti with Pit ,

which would estimate the degree to which increases in pollution abatement costs have a larger

7
  The coefficient on tariffs, β2, is constant across industries and is assumed to be independent of the pollution
intensity of the industry. Thus, a symmetric tariff reduction on all manufacturing industries will have an equal effect
on all industries, and thus no effect on the composition of manufacturing.

effect on industries with higher tariffs. We believe, however, that equation (2) best captures the

concerns of Executive Order 13141 and the WTO protests.

       We estimate versions of equation (2) in which the dependent variable (Mit) is annual

imports to the U.S., by four-digit manufacturing SIC code. We have two main motivations.

First, we believe that this interactive effect (β3) is an important test of the effect of trade

agreements on the environment. One of the chief mechanisms by which trade will change

environmental quality in various countries is by changing the distribution of industries.

Countries that host increasingly polluting industries as a consequence of trade will become more

polluted; countries whose industrial compositions become less polluting will become cleaner. If

a trade agreement lowers tariffs on polluting industries, and raises tariffs on clean industries, the

environmental consequences will perhaps be obvious. More realistically, if a trade agreement

lowers tariffs across the board, the environmental consequences will depend on whether the

polluting industries or the clean industries are more responsive to the tariff reductions: in other

words β3 in equation (2).

       The policy debate seems to presume that this indirect effect is negative for the U.S., that

lowering tariffs will increase imports more in those industries that have stricter pollution

regulations. This inference assumes that the U.S. is at a comparative disadvantage in industries

facing stringent environmental regulations and thus, a reduction in tariff barriers will result in a

relatively greater import surge in these more regulated industries.         We, however, see no

particular reason for this to be true as comparative disadvantages can arise from many factors,




                                                 10
not just environmental costs.8 We test for the interaction anyway, because we believe it to be the

underlying assumption of so much public debate.

          The second important motivation for our empirical strategy is that if equation (2) is the

correct specification, then equation (1) contains an important missing covariate that is clearly

correlated with pollution abatement costs.                 The indirect pollution haven is thus not only

important in its own right, as the focus of policy concerns, but it may also provide an additional

explanation for why early attempts to measure the direct pollution haven effect have been biased

downwards.



3.1 Data

          Because only the United States has collected pollution abatement cost data for a

significant period of time, researchers studying pollution havens and trade barriers have focused

on U.S. imports and exports. This paper, like many before it, starts by following Grossman and

Krueger (1993) by regressing manufacturing imports by industry on industry characteristics, as

in equation (1). Data on imports to the U.S. come from the NBER Trade Database, documented

in Feenstra et al. (2002). Our dependent variable (Mit) is imports divided by the value of

shipments, taken from the NBER Manufacturing Productivity Database (Bartelsman, et al.,

1996).9

          Characteristics of industries include environmental costs, tariffs, capital intensity, and

human capital intensity. Environmental costs come from the Pollution Abatement Costs and


8
  A similar point is made by Copeland and Taylor (2003), in which they point out that increased trade could shift
dirty industries to high-environmental standard (high-income) countries if such countries have a comparative
advantage in dirty goods production (due, for example, to relative capital abundance).
9
  It should be noted that we strictly follow Grossman and Kruger (1993) in using gross imports (not net imports) as
our dependent variable. This is due to the fact that we are estimating the effect of unilateral trade liberalization by
the U.S. on its imports (i.e., we do not have foreign tariff data to measure the corresponding effect of foreign tariff
liberalization on U.S. exports).


                                                          11
Expenditures (PACE) survey (U.S. Department of Commerce). We use the data from 1978 to

1994,10 focusing on pollution abatement operating costs. The PACE data were not collected in

1987, and were not disaggregated by four-digit SIC code in 1979, so we exclude those two years.

Our measure of an industry’s environmental costs (Pit) is pollution abatement operating costs

(U.S. Dept. of Commerce) divided by total materials costs (Bartelsman and Gray, 1996).

         Tariffs by four-digit SIC code are taken from Feenstra et al. (2002), where the tariff rate

for each industry is duties paid divided by the customs value of imports. We converted the 1989-

94 data to the 1972 SIC codes using the Bartelsman and Gray concordance.

         Finally, each industry is characterized by its capital intensity and human capital intensity.

Like Grossman and Krueger we measure capital intensity as one minus payroll’s share of value

added:

                                                                payroll
(3)                                 capital intensity = 1 −
                                                              value added

Human capital intensity is then the total payroll less what would have been paid to workers had

each earned the average wage of an 18-year-old worker with less than a high school education,

all divided by the value added in the industry:

                                              payroll - (low-skill wage)*(worker hours)
(4)              human capital intensity =
                                                             value added

Income data come from the Current Population Survey, May supplemental surveys.

         Table 3 presents summary statistics for these data. The average U.S. manufacturing

industry imported 17 percent of the value shipped by domestic producers, divided about evenly

between OECD countries and the rest of the world. The average industry spent 1.1 percent of

total materials costs on pollution abatement operating costs, ranging from zero to 18 percent.

10
 After 1987 the data switch from the 1972 SIC codes to the 1987 SIC codes. We used the concordance in the
NBER Manufacturing Productivity Database to reallocate pollution costs to 1972 industry definitions.


                                                     12
Tariffs averaged 4.0 percent, ranging from zero to over 40 percent. The question we ask is

whether those industries whose tariffs dropped most saw larger increases in imports if their

environmental costs were high.



3.2 Empirics

         Table 4 begins with a basic fixed-effect regression of import penetration, by industry, on

industry characteristics from 1978 to 1994. It is a panel-data version of Grossman and Krueger

(1993), as represented by equation (1). Industries whose environmental costs increased also saw

their imports increase, and industries whose tariffs increased saw imports decrease.11 Equally

sensibly, higher capital intensity and human capital intensity are associated with lower imports.

         At the bottom of table 4 we have calculated the elasticity of imports with respect to tariffs

(-0.44) as a useful benchmark to compare with later specifications and samples. It suggests that

a 10 percent increase in tariffs is associated with a 4 percent decline in imports.

         In column (2) of table 4 we include an interaction term, as in equation (2).                                 Our

interpretation of public rhetoric, and EO13141, is that the coefficient (β3) on this interactive term

is expected to be negative. However, in practice the coefficient (50.6) is positive and statistically

significant. Polluting industries appear to be less sensitive to tariff reductions rather than more

sensitive, and trade liberalization does not exacerbate the pollution haven effect.12

         If we take the point estimates from column (2) seriously, and calculate the elasticity of

import penetration with respect to environmental costs at the average level of tariffs, that



11
   The fact that the coefficient on the environmental cost variable is negative and statistically significant is consistent
with recent literature that uses time series data and fixed effects, and departs from previous efforts (such as
Grossman and Krueger) that relied on a single cross section.
12
   This result, that polluting industries are less sensitive to tariff reductions, is consistent with previous work
(Ederington et al., 2004), in which we show that polluting industries are less geographically footloose than clean
industries. This would make them less sensitive to changes in tariffs as well as to changes in pollution regulations.


                                                           13
elasticity is -0.38. Though this number is not markedly different from the tariff elasticity when

the interaction term is omitted (-0.44), the important point is that the interaction term is positive,

so that as we consider industries with lower pollution abatement costs, this estimated elasticity

will shrink in absolute value.

         We conclude from table 4 that in general, tariff reductions from 1978 to 1994 did not

significantly increase imports more from polluting industries than from clean industries. In fact,

the opposite is more likely to be true: if anything, trade liberalization has shifted U.S. industrial

composition toward dirtier industries, by increasing imports of polluting goods by less than clean

goods.

         In previous work, we explored the possibility that environmental regulations have

different effects on trade with developing countries than they do on trade with developed

countries (Ederington et al., 2004). It seems plausible that the same forces are at work here.

Trade agreements may alter the pollution intensity of trade between the U.S. and developing

countries, but not with other developed countries.13

         To test whether trade agreements have increased imports in pollution-intensive industries

from developing countries, in table 5 we run versions of equations (1) and (2) separately for

OECD and non-OECD countries.                  The coefficients are smaller than for the whole sample

because the scale of the dependent variable is smaller: imports from OECD divided by U.S.

value shipped. Hence comparisons can be made only by examining the relevant elasticities. In

column (1) of table 5, without the interaction term, the elasticity of imports with respect to tariffs

(-0.15) is smaller for OECD countries than for all imports. Most importantly, as with the full

sample, the interactive term in column (2) of table 5 is positive and statistically significant.

13
   Intuitively, if the U.S. is at a comparative disadvantage in dirty goods production (due to high regulatory
standards) against developing countries but not other developed countries, then trade liberalization might only result
in large increases in polluting imports from the developing world.


                                                         14
         The real test, however, comes with imports from non-OECD countries, where the

concern about pollution havens is strongest. Once again the interactive term between tariffs and

pollution costs remains positive and statistically significant. The point estimate (31.7) implies

that tariff reductions have had a smaller effect on imports from non-OECD countries in the more

pollution-intensive industries. The interacted coefficient in column (4) has exactly the opposite

sign to what we perceive to be the conventional wisdom. Rather than the U.S. manufacturing

sector becoming cleaner at the expense of the manufacturing sector in developing countries,

column (4) suggests that the U.S. manufacturing sector has become more polluting as a

consequence of tariff reductions.14



4. Predicted pollution changes

         Tables 4 and 5 examine whether pollution-intensive industries might be more responsive

to broad-based tariff reductions than clean industries, and finds just the opposite. Thus our

estimates imply that symmetric tariff reductions in the U.S. would have actually shifted the

composition of U.S. manufacturing towards dirtier industries. There is, however, an alternative

mechanism through which the trade agreements could make U.S. manufacturing cleaner. It

might be that trade agreements, either past or future, are skewed towards pollution-intensive

industries. If tariffs fell more for polluting industries than for clean industries from 1978 to

1994, then trade liberalization might be said to have caused a shift of polluting industries

overseas, even if the interactive coefficient β3 in equation (2) is zero. Alternatively, if current

tariffs are higher for polluting industries than for clean industries, then future trade agreements

that lower all tariffs to zero might be expected to shift polluting industries overseas.

14
  This result is actually consistent with those of Antweiler et al., (2001) and Copeland and Taylor (2003) who, using
a different technique, estimate that trade integration has shifted dirty-goods industries to high-standard (high-
income) countries.


                                                         15
       The first thing to note is that on average, industries whose tariffs fell further had higher

pollution abatement costs than industries whose tariffs rose, or fell by less. Specifically, the raw

correlation between the change in tariffs from 1978 to 1994 and average pollution costs is -0.19,

which is statistically significantly different from zero. While this correlation is not strong, it

lends plausibility to the claim that tariff reductions might have caused the shift in U.S.

manufacturing composition, because the reductions were skewed towards polluting industries.

       To explore the magnitudes of the correlations between environmental costs and tariff

reductions, in table 6 we predict the declines in U.S. pollution resulting from U.S. tariff

reductions from 1978 to 1994 using the coefficients of table 4. First, in column (1) of table 6 we

list the estimated change in the emissions of the 14 pollutants modeled by the World Bank’s

Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS) due to scale effects and compositional shift in U.S.

industries. These are the same data used to generate figure 1, but for the shorter time period for

which pollution abatement cost data are available. To generate the numbers in column (1), we

used the IPPS coefficients to predict the amount of pollution generated in each industry in 1978

and then aggregated across all industries. We did the same for 1994 and then reported the

percentage change between 1978 and 1994. The numbers differ because industries with varying

pollution intensities for different pollutants grew by different amounts during the period.

       As in figure 1, while the real value of manufacturing output increased by 36 percent from

1978 to 1994, the predicted pollution either rose by much less, or declined outright. This is

because the manufacturing industries have shifted towards those that produce less pollution. In

other words, while manufacturing output increased, predicted airborne particulate emissions

declined by 6.4 percent because those four-digit industries that produce the most particulates

declined over the period, while those that produced the least increased their output.




                                                16
         To render the pollution changes in column (1) of table 6 comparable with the predictions

from the regression coefficients, in column (2) we report the predicted change relative to the

change in real manufacturing growth. For example, the decline in particulates of 6.4 percent

represents a 31 percent decline relative to the 36 percent growth in manufacturing.                               ([1-

0.064]/[1.36]-1 = -0.31) This amounts to examining the composition effect alone, eliminating

both the scale and technique effects.

         In column (3) we use what we know about the changes in tariffs over this time period to

ask whether the fact that tariff reductions were steeper in more polluting industries could have

caused this shift in U.S. manufacturing towards cleaner industries, presumably at the expense of

other countries’ environmental quality. We used the tariff coefficients from column (2) of table

4, along with the actual industry-level tariffs and environmental costs, to predict the changes in

imports (as a share of value shipped) that resulted from U.S. tariff reductions.                           We then

multiplied this result by the actual value shipped in each industry, to get the predicted change in

imports. We then assumed as a benchmark that changes in imports are offset dollar-for-dollar

with domestic production, so we can multiply the import change by the IPPS coefficients to get

predicted changes in pollution emanating from each industry.15 Finally, we aggregated these

pollution changes across all industries, and divided by the total estimated pollution as of 1978, to

get the predicted percentage changes reported in column (3).

         As column (3) shows, predicted pollution declined only slightly due to the varying

declines in industry-specific tariffs. Given the degree to which tariffs declined over this time

period, the predicted effect of this on imports, and the predicted pollution associated with each

industry, imports are sufficient to replace from 1 to 3 percent of pollution generated by U.S.


15
  Note that this exaggerates the pollution changes, because the IPPS coefficients are calculated per dollar of value
added, and we multiply by value shipped.


                                                         17
manufacturing. This change is small relative to the overall shift in U.S. manufacturing towards

cleaner industries demonstrated in column (2). Though tariff reductions have been steeper in

more pollution-intensive industries, that can explain only a small part of the shift of U.S.

manufacturing towards cleaner industries.

       There is, however, one last interpretation of the environmental opposition to trade

liberalization that we can examine with these data. Observers could be concerned that current

tariff levels offer more protection to polluting industries than to clean industries, and that future

trade agreements that lower all U.S. tariffs to zero could cause U.S. polluting industries to

relocate overseas more than relatively clean industries. In column (3) of table 5 we predict the

change in U.S. manufacturing pollution that would result from a drop in tariffs from their 1994

levels down to zero. For each four-digit SIC code we calculate the level of the 1994 tariffs (from

Feenstra et al., 2002). We then use the tariff and interactive coefficients from table 4 to predict

the change in imports that would result from reducing these 1994 tariffs to zero. We then

assume as a benchmark that those imports replace U.S. production, and use the IPPS pollution

coefficients to generate the resulting change in each of the 14 pollutants. As column (4) shows,

this results in very small changes in pollution relative to actual changes over the 1978 to 1994

period. Once again, we find little basis for the fear that tariff reductions themselves will generate

large shifts in the composition of U.S. manufacturers away from polluting industries.



5. Conclusions

       The “trade and environment” debate has captured public interest, from the street protests

outside WTO meetings to President Clinton’s executive order requiring that trade agreements be

accompanied by environmental impact statements. The general consensus seems to be that tariff




                                                 18
barriers protect U.S. manufacturers that would otherwise move overseas to avoid increasingly

strict U.S. environmental standards, and that trade agreements, by lowering these tariffs, will

disproportionately affect the most polluting industries.

       This story is, on the surface, consistent with recent U.S. experience that has seen the U.S.

manufacturing sector shift towards cleaner industries. As we show in this paper, while the

sector’s real value added grew by 51 percent from 1972 to 1994, that growth occurred mostly

among the least polluting industries, causing the estimated emissions of most of the 14 pollutants

tracked by the World Bank’s IPPS to rise by much less than 51 percent, or even to decline. This

shift has occurred simultaneously with a general reduction in U.S. tariff barriers due primarily to

the success of GATT negotiations.

       We show, however, that these two trends appear unrelated. We find no evidence that

domestic production of pollution-intensive goods in the U.S. is being replaced by imports from

overseas. In addition, we find that symmetric tariff reductions in the U.S. have most likely

induced a compositional change towards dirtier industries (not cleaner) among U.S.

manufacturing. Finally, while polluting industries have experienced larger tariff reductions than

other industries in the U.S., these tariff reductions do not appear to be of sufficient magnitude to

explain more than a small fraction of the shift in U.S. manufacturing towards cleaner industries.
