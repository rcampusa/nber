           Services in the Domestic Economy and In World Transactions

                                       ABS TRACT

       A new interest in the role of services in world transactions         has been

generated    by the current efforts of the U. S. Government to reduce barriers
to   international trade in services.

       The paper distinguishes    four different classifications of economic

activities between    services and corrmodities. Service industries - those
producing    non—storable outputs -   have   been growing in nost domestic
economies relative 1-o corrirodity—producing industrIes, though ah)ut half
the growth in their share in GDP is attributable to relative price
increases.
       The U.S. policy effort focuses on a somewhat different set of services
which are referred to as "private nonfactor services". Exports of such
services have not expanded relative to comrrodity extorts. However, their
sales by U.S. affiliates abroad are much larger than exports from the tJ.S.
and have been growing uor rapidly than affiliates' corrmdity sales.             It

will not be easy to obtain       the consent of foreign countries to   a general

easing   of restrictions on direct foreign investment in service sectors.
Also, it may be asked     why,   if growth is to be the criterion of special
negotiating effort, the coimodity-service dichotomy is         relevant. Wiy not

       Fbever, a   successful effort to reduce some foreign barriers ann the

compensatory reductions in       U.S. barriers that this would entail might
provide   a mDdest counterweight on the side of liberalization in a world

in which   restrictions   are growing.

      A new   interest   in the role   of services in world transactions has   been

generated   by the current efforts of the U.S. Government to reduce barriers to

international trade in services. The services that are the focus of this

attention are not the same as those often spoken of in discussions of the

"service economy". Yet generalizations based on definitions of services in

the   domestic context are sometimes drawn upon to support policy proposals in
the international area.

      This paper has two obejctives. One is to sort out these various

congeries of services and. to assess their importance in the domestic economies

of various nations and iii international transactions. The second is to

examine the implications of the empiricaJ. findings for current U.S. policy

with regard to international trade.

                                       I Introduction

      It seems like a natural extension of the concept of an evolving service

economy to conceive of a relative expansion of international transactions in

services. Yet when an effort is made to assess these prospects in the trade

of nations, a large stumbling block is posed by the uncertainty that clouds

the identity of the "services" involved. There are different congeries of

services, each based on a different cross cut of economic activity. In the

domestic economy there is a difference between services defined as final—

demand products (e.g., public passenger transport)** and service industries in

     Final demand refers to purchases for own use; that is, they are
purchases not intended for re—sale, with or without further processing.
the sense of those that add value mainly by nans of the use of capital and

labor with relatively little intermediate inputs of physical things (e.g.,

finance). When       it   comes to international transactions, still other

classifications are used.            A. major difference from the usual domestic concepts

is that incomes from factors of production operating abroad, particularly

capital in the case of the U.S., are often grouped with services in

international classifications, regardless of the type of output produced by

these factors. Another difference, recently emphasized in U.S. trade

negotiating policy, is that the concept of trade in services is extented to
include services rendered within foreign host countries by affiliates of U.S.
parent companies.

       Similar   problems of classification do not arise with respect to
commodities      even though the obverse character of the definitions of

commodities      and services    as two mutually    exclusive but exhaustive sets of
economic activities might be expected to lead to common difficult border
areas.* Indeed, the analysis of international commodity trade             flows has a

long   history, relatively untroubled by definitional questions. In recent
years in particular the         commodity composition, the country origins, and

destinations     of trade have been investigated by many analysts, often under the
stimulus provided by claims and counterclaims about the role of trade in
stimulating or curbing employment in the U.S. or other industrialized
countries    or in promoting or retarding economic growth in developing

countries.     This attention has been almost entirely focused on the merchandise
component of international trade. Trade in services has been largely

defined so that together they exhaust the GOP. In the balance of payments,
however, flows of capital assets form another important component.

neglected.
     Now, however, this neglect is being replaced, especially in the U.S., by

an increasing degree of attention to                the   role   of services in the international

business   activities of American firms and in the world economy.* The reasons
for this change are probably to be found among the following factors:
      1. The widely perceived growth of the service sector in the domestic
economy of the U.S. and          other countries was likely sooner or later to             turn

attention to the      role of services in world transactions.
     2.    The unprecedented growth of the world economy between World War II and

the onset of the slow—down of the 1980' s (as measured by real world GDP**) w

accompanied      by an even more rapid expansion of international commerce and
investment which brought concurrent demands                   and   opportunities for expansion   in

service    transactions.
     3. In the U.S., the          Reagan Administration has launched             a diplomatic
campaign    to   remove obstacles to the exports of                 services by U.S. firms and,
equally vigorously, to reduce barriers to the establishment and operation of
U.S.—owned affiliates in service industries in foreign countries. The

explanations for this         decision include (a) the reaching of a stage of low
returns    to further efforts at liberalizing merchandise trade; (b) the barriers

encountered      by more and more       U.S. service industry companies as they            tried to
expand their operations, sometimes with the motivation of                       servicing their U.S.

customers    in commodity producing industries who are engaged in export or in
production       abroad; and (c) the perception that service barriers abroad often

affect U.S. interests more adversely than those of other countries,

particularly in such fields as insurance, telecommunications and data

processing and     construction         and   engineering     services.* Another possibility is

that   a   strong effort to clear away barriers to U.S. service                   business   may   be

seen   as a positive policy that           will   help counter protective pressures in

import—vulnerable commodity industries •**

        'le do not attempt to delve further into these motivations, and we leave

it to the Stalson paper in this volume to describe the iziscitutionaJ. and other

details of the Administratio&s program for liberalizing international

business     in the service industries. We are interested primarily in examining
the role of services in       the       domestic economies of the       U.S.   and other

countries,    in U.S. international business activities, and                   in   world

transactions and then on          the    basis   of   the findings to assess        the broad
objectives    of the   program.

       The role of     services    in the domestic economy has been            written about

extensively     and siimmries and         further     contributions   appear   elsewhere in this
volume. However, it        will    be useful in        considering    international transactions
in services briefly to highlight some salient features of services in the
domestic setting, with       attention not only to the U.S.              but to     ocher   countries
as   well.

   nong the service categories that are the focus of attention in the U.S.
efforts are communications, computer and data processing, construction and
engineering, consulting and management, educational services, equipment
leasing, financial services, franchising, health services, hotel—motel
services, insurance, motion picture, air transportation, and maritime
transportation. (U.S. ITC (1982). See also the largely overlapping list in

       We take as our working definition of services, goods that are
nonstorable, but this definition like others, such as intangibility, has its

margins at which    it fails to make clear cut distinctions. (E.g., Bauinol's
question whether messages taken      by telephone answering service should be
regarded as storable.) The difficulty of definition arises because by almost

any   characteristic   that can be selected, services, whether viewed from the

standpoint of final—product services, service industries, or internationally

transacted services, are very heterogeneous.* Any statement made about the

average characteristics of services — such as the labor intensity of service

industries, their record of productivity change **     or   their growth relative to

the rest of the economy —    is   apt to be subject to the qualification that the

average is accompanied by a great deal of dispersion for individual Kinds of

services.

       Perhaps the characteristic of services which is least subject to wide

dispersion is the relatively low value of commodities embodied in them as

intermediate      inputs. Starting with almost any plausible definition of
services,     it will be found that the proportion of value added to gross output
is high in services and that the proportion of intermediate inputs in the form
of services is high relative to commodity inputs.*** Commodities to a much
greater degree involve the further processing of physical things, so that
commodity inputs loom large in     value added and even larger among intermediate

*
     These various classifications of services are explained below. For a
fuller   discussion of the nature of services see Irving Leveson's paper in this
volume, Hill (1977) and Kravis, eston, and Summers (1982, p.129f).
**  See, for example, Baumoi's paper in this volume for a discussion of the
variability of service industries with respect to their susceptibility to
productivity improvements.
       Evenon this point, an exception has to be entered for wholesale and
retail trade if the goods distributed are counted as intermediate inputs.

inputs relative to service inputs.* These input characteristics are, of

course, the other side of the output coin; services involve little piiysical

tangibility at either end.

The expansion of spending on final demand services

    A hypothesis that is frequently advanced is that the demand for services

is income elastic —   that   is, that at any relative price of services the

quantity absorbed rises more than the quantity of commodities as real income

per capita increases. Sometimes this notion is at the root of the perception

that services may be expected to expand rapidly in international

tranSactiOll8. The appropriate concept of services for considering the

underlying economic propostion is in terms of service categories of final

demand (e.g., haircuts, medical care).

    The ist important final—product or final—demand services are government,

housing and education; they account for roughly 60 to b5 percent of service

spending in both poor and rich countries. (See Table 1, columns I and 2.)

The addition of medical care and hotels and restaurants raises the proportion

of service spending accounted for to 80 to 854. Other services that come to

mind, including communications and personai. care, add relatively little, but

the importance of some as contributors to international transactions may be

greater than the domestic figures imply.

     The similarities of the aggregate proportions in low and high income

countries do not extend to the individual components. For example, public

transport absorbs a higher share in poor countries and housing a lower

share. There is a difference also in that the share of aggregate service

   In the U.S. in 1972, 9 percent of the value of service industries' output
was accounted for by commodity inputs and 19 percent by service inputs with
the other 72 percent representing value added. The corresponding percentages
for commodity industries were 44, 16, and 40 respectively. i(ravis, 1{eston,

spending in total spending on GD? is much lower in the poor countries.

However, this       is   due to much lower service prices in the low income

countries. When a common set of average international prices is used to value

the quantities of aiJ. components of GD? (Table 1,           columns   4   and 5), the
resultant real" share of spending on aggregate services is not very different
between poor and         rich   countries. However, some compositional ditferences
(government,       housing, education,    and medical care) become greater.

      Two    inferences may       be drawn from these similarities and differences in

the   use   of   GD? for the provision of final demand services in poor and rich
countries.        (1) For the aggregate of services in GD?, the cross—country income
elasticity of demand is near unity. (2) For individual kinds of final—demand
services, income elasticities can          be   very different.
      On the first point, earlier work (Kravis, eston, and Summers, l933,

Table 7) produced an income elasticity for the aggregate of final—demand

services of .99, virtually identical with the elasticity of 1.00 for aggregate

commodity finaL demand. On the second point, Suuuner& paper in the present

volume shows, income elasticities for six major            subdivisions    of services

ranging from 0.79 (recreation and education) to 1.46 (medical care).*

      The reasons for this combination of overall unitary elasticity and

component diversity, it has been suggested (Kravis, lieston, and Summers,

1983), is to be found in the evolution of technology. Changes in technology

continually shift the modes through which            the age—old basic wants of people
are satisfied. Broad categories of wants tend to be satisfied by mixtures of

services and commodities that vary at different times, places and income

levels. This is true for a want like recreation             which is   often identified



*
    For     a comparison of elasticities for 26 detailed service and           77   detailed
commodity categories, see Kravis, Heston and Summers, 19b3, Table b.

with services     and    for one like food which is usually identified with
commodities. Within         recreation, for example, the demand for musical

entertainment     in    the U.S.   today is met overwhelmingly by commodity spending on
a    mix of commodities     and services     that includes concert tickets) radios,

records    and record players, TV,         and videotape recorders.*
        Thus when services are viewed in terms of final—demand,, they may become
more expensive relative to commodities            and absorb larger fractions   of current
spending as    income grows, but there is no support in the cross country data

for the view that the physical quantities of services as a whole will on

average expand more than           the   physical quantities of commodities.

The contribution of service industries to GDP

       Another and more common way to identify and classify service activities

is in terms of the industries which produce them. A more or less standard

classification of the main service industries in these terms is set out in

Table 2. In this classification the key is the intangibility or

nonstorabi.Lity of the output without regard to the oature or motive of the

purchaser; intermediate as well as final—demand services are included.

        The table shows the contribution the main service industries make to

total production in developing countries, developed countries, and the

U.S. In these terms the service industries are of even larger importance in


*
   Uowever, a systematic element may operate in these changes. It arises out
of the probable tendency for technological changes to reduce costs wore in
commodity production than in service production. See Kravis, Fleston, and
Summers 1983. As Robert Lipsey has pointed out, national. accounting
conventions also have an effect. If consumer durables were treated as capital
goods and their services imputed as those for housing are now, final
expenditures on commodities would be reduced and those on services increased,
particularly in the U.S.
**
    The underlying figures doubtless suffer from serious incomparabilities for
the two sets of countries and even for countries within each set, but the main
outlines of the service sector are probably correctly reflected.

rich countries    relative to poor ones than in terms   of   the   final—demand figures
of Table 1. The difference between the 46 percent share for developing

countries and    the   62 percent share for industrialized countries is more than

fully   accounted for by the larger shares or finance and government       in the

latter.   We know from the cross—country data of Table 1 that the larger share
of government in the rich countries is attributable mainly to         higher

compensation of government employees rather than to larger numbers of them,*
and similar differences in the compensation or employees in other labor—
intensive services probably increase shares of other service sectors in the
industrialized countries relative to those in the developing countries. The
large role of wholesale and retail trade in the developing countries
accounting for nearly one—fifth of gross production and over one—third of
service output, despite low wages, raises questions about the efficiency of
this sector in these countries.
     The relative roles of price and quantity changes in changing the share of
service industries in domestic production over time are examined in Table 3.
The table shows that for the world" consisting of 49 market ecoclomies** the
share of service expenditures in own—currency current prices rose by 6
percentage points between 1960 and 1975. Half of the increase was
attributable to price increases and the other half to real quantity
increases. Similar changes occurred in the industrial countries, but in the

current prices.

       Thus the time series data for service industries point to a small                rise in
their shares in the production of GDP. This expansion of service shares over

time seems to be in conflict with            the   stability of final—demand service shares

in the cross section data considered earlier. Each set of service

classifications encounters great difficulties in factoring out price and

quantity     ctianges, and in the time—to—time data these problems are not met in

the same way by all        countries.
       There is a high         correlation   (rZ        .71) between the share of final—

demand services in expenditures on G1)P             and the   share of service industries in

the production of GUP (1975 data for 27 ICP countries), but the a priori

grounds for expecting such concordance are not strong. The reason is the

factors affecting the changes in the relative importance of service industries

in the production of GDP are different in some important respects from those

trkat influence the share of final—demand services in the absorption of GD?.

All   or    almost   all final—demand    services are produced by service industries*

and   the    forces that lead      changes   in the     consumption   of final—demand services

produce      matching   changes in    the production of the relevant service

industries. However, the            important   group of intermediate services produced by

service industries rises or declines relative to commodity production in

response to entirely different sets of influences. Some of these influences

like those affecting the relative importance of trade, transportation and

finance      are linked to the general expansion of economic activity and wealth.
But these services and others are often necessary concomitants of commodity
production. In          this   context, they may either be carried on         as ancillary



*
     A few in which individuals proffer their labor directly to households may
or    may   not   be regarded as "industries'.

operations of firms whose primary function is to produce some given commodity,

or they may be contracted out to specialized service firms. In this sense,

the relative size of service industries depends not only on the volume of

service (accounting, delivery, etc.) that are necessary to bring a commodity

(or a specific service) to the buyer, but also on how the performance of the

necessary activities will be divided among firms.

     In general, the influences that favor contracting out services to

specialized service industries probably have been growing stronger. As tax

laws become more complicated with important acnuai. changes, specialized

externa.L law or accounting firms gain an advantage over in—house lawyers or

accountants. The same effect comes from the growing complexity and

uncertainty of other regulations (e.g., anti—trust, labor, pollution

control). Contracting out services such as delivery, cleaning, and meals for

employees not only involves specialized management for these subordinate

operations but may also bring a degree of employment flexibility that is not

available when in—house   sta.tf are employed to carry out these functions. The
advantages   of specialization increase as the technology with which the service
can be provided becomes more complicated (e.g., computer accounting, food
preparation   techniques).

     While it seem plausible to think that these changes are pressing towards

the expansion of specialized service industries, it is possible that they are

operating most strongly in service sectors that are very visible but that

account for only relatively small shares of total service industry output and

employment. (See Table 2.) Even so, the argument if accepted would support

the view that there are growth sectors within the services that may be worthy

of attention from policy makers.

     More broadly, the overall time—to—time data for service industry shares



                                        14
(Table 3) do show expansion, and        this finding        should not be set aside because

it is not supported by the cross— section analysis based on final—demand

services.     To be sure the expansion is      nderate in real terms       and not   nearly

as dramatic as is sometimes protrayed in the literature on               the shift to a
"service economy". The widely noted shift              in   employment to service industries
is attributable at least as much        to   different average productivity trends as
to   differences in the response of demand to rising incomes. However, the wide

dispersion of individual, services around these average tendencies must be

borne in mind in considering their implications for the role of services in

world transactions. There are as noted some service activities that are

experiencing rapid growth in both current and constant prices.

                         IV Services in World Transactions

      The classification of services usually presented in statistics of

international transactions includes both factor and nonfactor services. The

former   represent direct services rendered by the            factors of production such as

interest    payments for the     foreign capital or wages to a foreign
                               use of

laborer, regardless of the nature of the output. Nonfactor services, on the
other hand, are those which require the addition of intermediate inputs to
                                                   *
labor   and/or capital for their production.

*
   In the domestic economy classifications considered in the previous section,
virtually all services are nonf actor services. Purchases of these services
involve payments for some distinct form of production or output rather than a
payment made solely for the services         of a factor of production. (This is true
even when the service output is measured by the input of the factor, as is
often done in national accounting.) Nonfactor services in balance of payments
classifications include a mixture of categories found in the final—demand and
industry—of—origin   classifications. Forexample, transportation is a standard
category in the industry—of—origin classification, where it includes both
final and intermediate purchases. Components such as passenger fees would be
found on a sufficiently detailed list of final—demand expenditures. On the
other hand, some categories found in standard classifications of domestic
service industries are not found in the classifications used for international
transactions. Trade, for example, is an important domestic service industry
but the value of distributive services in international transactions is


                                              15
Services in the U.S. balance of payments

    In balance   of payments   terms,   services inclusive of direct factor
services   and nouf actor services accounted for over one—third of the U.S

exports of "goods and services" in 1980 and nearly 257. of U.S. imports (see

Table 4). However, policy—oriented discussions often concentrate on nonfactor

services which constitute   only 19     percent of the export    total and   II percent

of the import total.    En some contexts     only   investment   income is excluded in
order to obtain the total for nonfactor services. The treatment of royalties
and fees in services does not change the picture very much; if as in the table
they are regarded as (direct factor) services, the share of total exports
counted as services is only a couple of percentage points righer cian would
otherwise be the case.
     These classifications, it should be borne in mind, are not without their
arbitrary elements. The same kind of activity may wind up with its
transactions value   in one category or another according to the accounting
convenience of different reporters or the practices of the statistical
authorities. For example, the income derived by a U.S. parent from a foreign
service affiliate may appear in balance of payments statistics as investment
income, as a royalty or fee,* or as a payment for a professional or a
managerial service.
    Among the nonfactor services, transport (including freight, passenger
fees and travel) accounts for around 70 percent of the total. Government


included in the value of the commodity or service traded. The difference is
related to the fact that the contribution of service industries to the
production of GDP is measured from a value added approach, while the value of
nonf actor services in international transactions is measured in terms of gross
sales revenue or purchase values.
   In the U.S. statistics royalty and fees include compensation of U.S.
empLoyees temporarily assigned to foreign affiliates of U.S. parents.

transactions make     up a good part of the balance. The private services other

than   transportation,     such as communications and data processing, that appear

to   be the main   concern    of current U.S. policy are found mainly in the     'other"


category   which   constitutes    less than 10% of nonfactor services and   1   percent
of trade in goods and        services.

Service    activities of U.S.     foreign affiliates
       Eowever, account must be taken of the important role of U.S.—owned
foreign affiliates in rendering private nonfactor services in order to round

out    the picture of the role of services in U.S. international business

activity. Foreign service revenues earned through majority—owned affiliate

sales are larger than those earned from a U.S. base. Thus, for 1977, the most

recent date for which official data on affiliate sales are available, sales of

U.S. affiliates abroad amounted to close to $280        billion (see Table 5), far in
excess    of private nonf actor service exports of $19 bilhion.*     The service
affilates    accounted for over 40 percent of the income of all affiliates and

over 25 percent of their employment. Petroleum related services and trade

accounted for three quarters of service income and nearly 60 percent of

service industry employment. The remlning service sectors, where the service

activities on which U.S. policy efforts seem to be concentrated are found,

thus account for about one sixth of total affiliate income and        employment.

        Reliable   and comprehensive estimates of income, sales, and employment are

not available for subsequent years. However, the U.S. direct investment

position abroad (book value of direct investors' equity and net loans to

affiliates) increased by about 50% in service industries between 1977 and

1981, and, if      past   experience is any guide, sales probably increased by     a

Growth of U.S. foreign service transactions

       The behavior of service industry shares in domestic transactions,

considered earlier, would lend some support to expectations for above—average

growth rates for trade by service industries, if it could be assumed that

growth in domestic and international transactions are likely to go hand—in—

hand. This does not, however, appear to be the case. The 1980/70 expansion

ratios (i.e., the ratios of the 1980 values to those f 1970), shown in Table

4, are lower for services than for commodities and lower still for nonfactor

services. However, international transactions of the U.S. expanded more

rapidly over the decade than the domestic economy, and trade in both services
                                                                               **
and in its nonfactor component increased at a faster rate than U.S. GDP.

       Comprehensive data for the other and larger component of international

business services, foreign sales by U.S. owned foreign affiliates, are

available for the period 1957—77. The nst reliable data are from major

surveys for 1957, 1966, and 1977. (See Table 6). There are serious

imeomparabilities in the three data sets in the defInitions of the foreign

affiliates covered and in the industrial classifications, the latter bearing

especially   on service" industries. The summary of the expansion ratios

   As Helena Stalson points out in her paper in this volume, widely varying
estimates of revenues from foreign service sales have been offered. An
estimate by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC, 1982) covering 14
service categories (listed in a footnote on page 4) that accounted for a large
part   but not for all     of the service sector   placed 1981 service revenues from
foreign sources at $105.5 billion.

    The 1980/70 expansion ratio for GD? (in current prices) was 2.63.   INP,
1983. Here and elsewhere, relative quantitative evaluations about services
must be hedged with reservations about the comprehensiveness of statistical
coverage for service transactions relative to that for merchandise. It is
possible that both the relative level and growth of services may be
understated.

Here   a relationship opposite to that found for exports emerges: the sales of

service affiliates expanded more rapidly than those of commodity producing

affiliates, and this was true in both periods. Trade and finance were the

fastest growing sectors in both periods, while transportation, communications

and public utilities sector had the lowest expansion. Other private nonfactor

services such as lodging places, advertising, engineering, and accounting are

in the "other" service category, which has intermediate expansion ratios. The

"other" service ratios were higher than the commodity ratios, and both sets

were substantially above the expansion ratio for the domestic economy.*

       Although as noted above, direct investment in service industries did not

expand more rapidly than in commodity producing industries between 1977 and

1981, it seems clear that at least some sectors in the "other" set expanded

very rapidly. A U.S. International Trade Conunission (ITC) survey that

elicited responses from 143 international service firms in 14 selected service

   The GDP expansion ratios were 1.70 and 2.53 for the two periods, while
those for merchandise exports were 1.46 and 3.98.

industries* concluded that between 1980 and 198Z foreign revenues increased

by more than 50 percent, rising from 12.9 to 14.9 percent of the total foreign

and domestic revenues.

      By way of summary, the dominant components of U.S. international business

in services are transport in the private nonf actor export category and         trade
and petroleum related services in the foreign sales of service affiliates.

There is evidence that a selected set of private nonf actor services that are

the focus of U.S. trade policy have been growing rapidly in foreign affiliate

sales, but there is not much reason to believe that service exports have

increased relative to commodity exports in any general way. The services to

which most policy attention is being given still constitute modest shares both

of exports and of affiliate sales.

Role of services in world trade

      A   picture of the role of   services in world transactions that is     broader
in country    coverage   is provided in Table 7, though   the   source does not permit
a   decomposition into factor and   noafactor  services.* When "services' are
taken     to include investment income as   payment for a direct factor service,
services    constituted about one—quarter of world transactions in merchandise

and services in 1980. The U.S. service share in exports of goods and services

was larger than the world average while that for developing countries was

smaLler. On the import side, the main deviation from the world average was

the large share of the developing countries.

*
   The 143 responses came from a questionnaire mailed to 479 'known
international service companies 4n 14       categories of services". For the     1.1st

f categories  see footnote on-.4.
   The difficulty is with the category "ocher private goods, services and
income" given in the source. The category includes payments to labor and for
royalties as well as for nonfactor services such as communications and non—
merchandise insurance. "Other official goods, services, and income" seems to
be constituted mainly of nonfactor services; it is dominated by payments for
diplomatic representation and joint military arrangements abroad. LNF, 1977a.

      When the more usual procedure of excluding                  investment      income is followed,

the service share in world trade in goods and                   services   drops to 17 or 18

percent of which 10 or U. percent           represents        transport and       travel.   The U.S.

share is below the world average due mainly                to   a lower proportion for

transportation.

       In Table 8 we return    to   the recent U.S. balance of payments position and

place it     in an   international setting. The U.S. is far from a dominant

exporter     of private nonfactor services although it has had modest surpluses in
this category.* Furthermore, the U.S. share in                    both   world exports and
industrial     country exports of these services declined during the preceding

decade:

      It seems probable, however, that the U.S. role taking both exports and

affiliate sales abroad into account would loom larger relative to other

countries     than is the case when exports alone are considered.
The growth of world service transactions
      The    decade of the 1970' s was     not    only   marked by rapid economic growth but

by   rapid   growth that was widely dispersed throughout the world economy.**

Growth was accompanied by a rise           in   the proportion of world production that

   The fliP classification other private goods services and income shows
gradually rising U.S. surpluses for the years 1970—80. The U.S.
classification private nonfactor services excluding transportation (Table 4)
gives the same results though with smaller absolute magnitudes.

and 1980, while the current dollar value of world exports of goods and

services was 4.8 times as great in 1980 as in 1970 (see          Table 9). The
expansion of service exports was        only    marginally smaller   ttian   that of
merchandise exports, but       if   investment income is excluded the expansion ratio
for services drops to       4.6.    Growth during the decade ror both GD? and          all   the
trade   categories including private services was higher for the developing

countries than for the industrialized countries.

     Thus both for the U.S. and the world economy international transactions

have grown faster than domestic transactions. The service component of

international transactions has expanded more rapidly than world GD? although

it has not marched the rate of growth in merchandise trade, especially in the

case of the US.

Assessment

        How then shall we assess the relative importance of private nonfactor

services in the internationa]. busines8 activities of the U.S.? Growth in

service exports and in sales of foreign service affiliates have been greater

than domestic growth, but service exports have not expanded as rapidly as

merchandise trade. Revenues from the sales of foreign affiliates are much

larger than export proceeds. Service industry affiliates accounted for about

40Z of total affiliate sales, but much of this was in trade and petroleum

related    services which do not seem      to   be the focus of policy attention. Sales
of foreign service affiliates have been more dynamic than sales of foreign
commodity affiliates, at least until the last few years. ven within this
period, however, an ITC survey has identified some specific areas of rapid
expansion.

for policy attention, the classification of an industry as a service or

commodity activity becomes irrelevant. The data we have examined and the

heterogeneity of services stressed earlier suggest that there are some (many?)

private aouf actor services not characterized by rapid growth. On the other

hand, a search into the commodity sectors would doubtless produce some

industries characterized by rapid growth in affiliate sales.

       Some types of services may of course warrant special attention for

reasons other than their direct quantitative importance or growth potential.

For example, telecommunications and data transfers are areas to which

importance is sometimes attached not only owing            to   their growth potential, but

to their high technological character and their strategic importance to other

international, business activities. 1ut here again the commodity—service

dichotomy is not the key element.

            V. International Services in Current U.S. Commercial Policy

       The kinds of services that are the focus of U.S.            commercial   policy are

represented by the 16 industries found in Table 10*. The industries all fail

under    the heading of private nonfactor services found in balance of

transactions statistics. ilowever, there are two important differences between

the U.S. list and those found in the xre standard balance of payments

classification. For one thing, no effort has been made in the U.S. list to

provide a comprehensive classification of all private nonfactor services.

While the list is extensive, the         criteria   of   inclusion   seems to have been

services     about which the concerned U.S. Government agencies (mainly the Office
of the     U.S.   Trade Representative and the     Department of Commerce)      learned

*
    This    list, which is     not intended to be exhaustive, is based        on industries
that    appear in    the   documents produced by and for the Office of        the U.S. Trade
Representative. The list overlaps substantially             with     the 14 industries
included in the IIC study cited above.

through receipt of complaints or through surveys of U.S. business firms of tne

existence of barriers to foreign service sales. A second major difference is

that the focus is not on exports out on service transactions carried our in a

host country by a U.S. affiliate. The fact that the ITC reported that most of

the foreign service revenue of the responding firms            were produced by foreign
affiliates, joint ventures, and franchising and licsensing suggests that the

main    targets       are investment rather than trade restrictions. (Incidentally,

the liberalization of the           imports   from the U.S. of the commodities and

services necessary to support service sales are also included in            U.S. policy

objectives.)

       The economic characteristics of the industries included in the U.S. list

can   only   be treated impressionisticai.ly. A numoer including information

services,      accounting,      adverstising and the   engineering and design features of
construction          services are probably intensive in riuman capital. Some of these

and   others    such as leasing and      fraacnising   are industries in which firms nave

developed special managerial techniques which can be exploited abroad with

relatively limited additional development effort on the part of the              firm
(Caves'      public goods analogy      applies   here (1971).) liuman capital intensity

and advanced managerial methods           in these industries probably confer a
comparative       advantage on the U.S. companies. 'dowever, the list also includes

industries such as tourism and transportation, where comparative advantage

rests    with other countries having lower wages and sunnier climes. Even in the

latter cases, of course, a U.S. firm may have a company—specific comparative

advantage, leading, for example, to the escablishnent of U.S. aotei. affiliates

in    tropical climates.

        With    respect to growth prospects also, the incustries seemed to vary
widely.        Some    like   information and data processing services seem to   be strong


                                                  31
growth points of great strategic importance while others such as

transportation appear to be tied to a slower pattern.

     The emphasis on the investment—related sales       relative   to exports from the

U.S. is suggested also by a classification of the barriers offered in an

official briefing paper, at least if the degree of detail provided under

various headings is any guide.* The       classification   with some   modifications   is


as follows:

 I. Restrictions on right    of   residents to import services from foreign

country. Examples:

         Quotas or license requirements

         Sales below cost by govermnentowned service company

         Restrictions on availability of foreign exchange



 II. Limitations on right of establishment

    Examples:

         Outright prohibition on establishment of local operations

         Local ownership requirements

         Procedural impediments to establishment process

 III. Discrimination against      operations   of foreign—owned firm   once it is

         established

    a. Restrictions on management control

         Examples:

                Discriminatory taxes on income, profits, or royalties of

                foreign—controUed establishments

                Controls on reinvestment or repatriation of earnings

      b. Interferences with marketing

            Examples;

                 Discriminatory government procurement policies

                 Inadequate protection of intellectual property

                 .egulatory procedures that discriminate against

                  foreign firms

      c.   Interferences with support facilities

            Examples:

                 Restrictions on visas for specialized personnel

                 High tariffs or undue delays on imports of necessary

                         inputs such as advertising layouts or specialized

                        machinery.

         classification invites several comments relating to the similarity
       This

and dissimilarity of these restrictions compared to those chat might be found
on   a list focussed on commodities. The similarities are obvious; there are
few   i.f any items in the service classification that would not be found also     in

a    similar survey of    restrictions   on commodities, although the commodity list
might well include more numerous references to restrictions on exports (I).
       The dissimilarities are not inherent in the restrictions per se but
rather in the political, context in which they are found. With respect at
least to restrictions on commodity trade, GATT provides a set of rules and a
surveillance    mechanism (although that may be coo strong a term) which is

entirely absent for services.* When it comes to investment (II and III),

there is no worldwide code like GAT] either for commodities or services. The

disagreements among countries about the investment provisions of the Charter

for an International Trade Organization (ITO) were among the main causes that

*
     Except for motion pictures which are included in the GATT.

                                              33
led to the failure of that document to receive ratification. It is hardly

likely that it will be easier today than it was then for capital exporting and

capital importing countries to reach a meaningful agreement on an investment

code.

        The other important difference between commodity and service restrictions

is the extensive degree to which restrictions on foreign service activities

are bound up with social, political and economic objectives that transcend the

merely protective motivations of the restrictions. In a number of service

industries domestic firms are subject to various restraints and regulations

designed to protect the public from monopoly power, fraud, deception or the

invasion of privacy. The regulation of banking and of foreign exchange markets

to promote financial stability are almost universal. Similar motivations,

particularly those related to the protection of public health and safety, lead

to regulation of some commodity producing industries (e.g., drugs, electric

applicances), but they are probably less pervasive.

        Not only is it to be expected that foreign controlled firms will also be

subject to such regulations and restrictions, but foreign ownership often

raises special fears and problems. The concentration of financial power iii

foreign hands and the foreign control of advertising stereotypes are

illustrations. A crude and rather arbitrary classification of the lb service

industries    according to the extent   to which discrimination against foreign

firms    may be   based on or reinforced by such social motivations is presented in
Table 10. The classification is meant to be suggestive; it is not based on

any effort to assess the nature and strength of foreign attitudes. Nor is it

intended to deny that a protective motivation may often enter into barriers

that are justified on social grounds. What seems very likely, however, is

that strongly held positions in support of barriers to foreign control in



                                           34
certain services are deeply embedded in the domestic values and institutions

of many countries (not excluding the U.S.). It         is   important to add that these

objections     to foreign control do not necessarily apply to the same industry in
each actual. or potential host country. The inference for negotiations is that
an industry by industry, country by country approach is called for. (The
efforts     to resist protective pressures in the commodity field have pretty much

returned us to such an approach in that sector.)




                                      VI. Conclusion

      In considering the policy implications of the findings of the previous

sections, due regard has to be caien of our concentration on the empirical

aspects of a very complicated subject. Only limited attention has been

devoted to the political and diplomatic context in which the U.S. service

initiative must be placed. With this caveat, the following points emerge from

our considerations:

       1. Services probably represent a relative growth sector in the domestic

economies. Measurement problems abound, but as a rough approximation it may

be   taken that something like half of the growth in service industry shares in
the production of GD? tends to reflect a relative increase in prices and only
the other half an increase in real quantities.
       2.   There is little evidence of rapid growth in private non.f actor services

relative     to world trade   in   commodities or as a share of trade in commodities
and services. This may represent inadequate measurement. Also, trade in both
commodities and services has expanded more rapidly than the world GD? of

marKet      economies. However,    a policy based on a sweeping view of the entire

category of private rionf actor services as an area of great future trade growth



                                             35
relative to commodity trade does not seem warranted. If growth prospects are

to be the criteria for special negotiations of trade barriers, the couiniodity—

service dichotomy is not very relevant.

     3. Trade in many services does not have characteristics that provide any

justification for their exclusion from the GA11 regime. Trade in nonfactor

services, amounting to something liie 10 or 15 of world trade in commodities

and services appears to have been omitted from the GA1 rules more by

oversight and lack of knowledge than for any compelling reason. An effort to

extend the GATT rules to trade in nonf actor services seems warranted.

     4. In the case of U.S.firms, nonf actor service sales by affiliates,

branches, etc. in host countries are much more important than service sales

made from the U.S. (i.e., exports). Thus, though much of the language of U.S.

policy statements is cast in terms of trade, what is really at staI.e is the

treatment of U.S. direct investment in foreign host countries. Service

activities do not seem to warrant special treatment related to direct foreign

investment. The   general   case for the removal of restrictions on the right of

establishment and on the business operations of a foreign affiliate is not

different for commodity— and service—producing industries (unless it is argued

that restrictions on direct investment should be more lenient for services

because they cannot be exported).

     5. With the exception of a general extension of the GATT suggested in

paragraph 3, there appear to emerge strong reasons for industry by industry,

country—by—country negotiations. One set of reasons rests in the often deeply

embedded objections to equal treatment for foreign suppliers of services in

certain industries particularly ones that are domestically regulated in

pursuit of nationally accepted objectives. The strength of these attitudes

and the industries upon which they focus vary from one country to another. An



                                         36
effort to include all countries in a broad coverage negotiation might                    produce
a very low common denominator. Also, a more selective approach will enaole

the U.S. negotiators to concentrate on situations (industries and countries)

where the pay—off from the relaxation of restrictions would be high.

       6. The evaluation of the prospects of a program that is based on so many

unknowns and so many uncertainties is hazardous. However, the size of the

industries included, the subset for which              a   large expansion in U.S. exports

could be expected even with the relaxation of barriers, and a realistic

appraisal   of the extent to which        barriers are likely to be negotiated down,

ail suggest   that     the potential gains to the          U.S. balance of    payments   from the
present program are not liKely to be large. A similar evaluation seems

appropriate for U.S. sales of services from foreign based affiliates and

branches. The prospects for gains           are   enhanced by the greater importance of

such sales and by the rapid growth of some sectors, but the difficulty of

reducing obstacles to direct investment is an offsetting factor. However,

particular industries and firms may benefit substantially. (This would appear

to be the case whether a selective strategy suggested in the previous

paragraph was purposefully adopted or not.)

       All this    is not   to   denigrate the    U.S. initiative. While it is obviously

mercantilist      in its    search   for further sales opportunities          for U.S. firms, it

does   identify and     attack restrictions on         international business. If the
restrictions      it   seeks out are foreign ones, our trade partners can             be relied

upon to identify ours. En any case,   considering the growing speed with which
imitation overtakes innovation in world markets, any improvement in the U.S.
balance of payments or other U.S. gains may                turn   Out to be   mainly of a

transient   character. Nonetheless, the program provides a modest counterweight
on   the side of liberalization in a world in which restrictions are growing.
