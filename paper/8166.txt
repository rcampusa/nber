1       Introduction
Among the ¯rms that now list on the stock exchange one can ¯nd more than one
hundred vintages of ¯rms. Most have entered the market since the second world war,
but some date back to the 19th century. Figure 1 provides an accounting of the value,
in 1998, of all ¯rms that were then listed on the three major U.S. stock exchanges:
the NYSE, the AMEX and the NASDAQ.1 The solid line accounts for the total 1998
value of the stocks by year of their ¯rst listing.2 An OLS regression of its logarithm
on a constant and linear time trend indicates annual growth of 4.4 percent.

      We extended the CRSP stock ¯les backward from their 1925 starting year by collecting year-
end observations from 1885 to 1925 for all common stocks traded on the NYSE. Prices and par
values are from the The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, which is also the source of ¯rm-
level data for the price indexes reported in the Cowles Commission's Common Stock Prices Indexes
(1938). We obtained ¯rm book capitalizations from Bradstreet's, The New York Times, and The
Annalist. The resulting dataset de¯nes our sample of 21,516 ¯rms, and though limited to annual
observations, actually includes more common stocks than the CRSP ¯les in 1925. As such, the
dataset complements others that have begun to build a more complete view of securities prices in
other markets for the pre-CRSP period. See, for example, Rousseau (1999, 2000) on Boston's equity
market.
    2
      AMEX ¯rms enter CRSP in 1962 and NASDAQ ¯rms in 1972. Since NASDAQ ¯rms traded
over-the-counter before 1972 and AMEX's predecessor (the New York Curb Exchange) dates back
to at least 1908, we adjust the entering capital in 1962 and 1972 by re-assigning most of it to
an approximation of the \true" entry years. We do this by using various issues of Standard and
Poor's Stock Reports and Stock Market Encyclopedia to obtain incorporation years for 117 of the
274 surviving NASDAQ ¯rms that entered CRSP in 1972 and for 907 of the 5,213 ¯rms that entered
NASDAQ after 1972. We then use the sample distribution of di®erences between incorporation and
listing years of the post-1972 entrants to assign the 1972 ¯rms into proper \IPO" years, starting with
1971 and re-scaling the distribution of post-1972 di®erences to include only the relevant distances.
In 1971, for example, this procedure implies taking the percentages associated with listing lags of 0
years and 1 year, re-scaling them to sum to unity, and applying the re-scaled percentages of the share

Figure 1: Annual U.S. gross investment and the 1998 value of all listed ¯rms by year
of listing.

   Some vintages retain a strong presence in 1998, even per unit of investment. The
dashed line in Figure 1 accounts for all cumulative real investment by the vintage of
that investment.3 Relative to that investment, the '50s and even the '60s, which saw
the Dow and the S&P 500 indexes do very well and which some economists refer to
of ¯rms incorporated in 1971 to the 1971 and 1972 entry years. We repeat the procedure for each
year from 1970 back to 1885, re-scaling the post-1972 sample density each time to include only the
relevant year ranges. The result is a vector of percentages of the 1972 NASDAQ entrants that should
be assigned to each prior year. Even though 13.4% of the surviving 1998 capital can be attributed to
¯rms that entered CRSP in 1972, not all of this capital entered via NASDAQ. We therefore assume
that the average percentage of 1998 capital attributed to the years 1969-1971 (1.7%) entered CRSP
in 1972 through NYSE or AMEX, leaving the di®erence of 11.7% to re-distribute. We use a similar
procedure for the 1962 AMEX entrants.

      The cumulative investment series is private domestic investment from Kendrick (1961), table
A-IIa for 1885-1953, joined with estimates for more recent years from the National Income and
Product Accounts.

as a golden age { did not do as well as the 1920's.
    In a one-sector world in which every ¯rm ¯nanced its startup investment with a
stock issue and then simply kept up its capital and paid for all parts and maintenance
out of its pro¯ts, each ¯rm's current value would be proportional to its initial invest-
ment, and the dashed lines and the solid lines would coincide. Why, then, does the
solid line deviate from the dashed line? Why, for example, do the vintage-'20s ¯rms
account for relatively more stock-market value than they do for gross investment?
Several explanations come to mind:

   1. Technology: The entrants of the 1920's came in with technologies and products
      that were better and therefore either (a) accounted for a bigger-than-average
      share of all '20s investment, (b) delivered a higher return per unit of investment
      or (c) invested more than other ¯rms in subsequent decades. The state of
      technology prevailing at the ¯rm's birth a®ects that ¯rm for a long time, sort
      of like the weather a®ects a vintage of wine; some vintages of wine are better
      than others, and the same seems to be true of ¯rms.

   2. Mergers and spino®s: The dashed line is aggregate investment, not the invest-
      ment of entrants (on which we do not have data). The entrants of the 1920's
      were, perhaps, not new ¯rms embodying new investment but, rather, existing
      ¯rms that split or that merged with other ¯rms and re-listed under new names,
      or privately held ¯rms that went public in the '20s. We accordingly adjust
      Figure 1 for mergers to the extent that is possible with available data.4 Some
      mergers may embody a decision by incumbents to redirect investment and re-
      deploy old capital to new uses. Such mergers arise because of technological
      change. Others may arise because of changes in antitrust law or its interpreta-
      tion. Either way, a new listing may be a pre-'20s entity disguised as a member
      of the '20s cohort.5
   4
     The merger adjustment uses several sources. CRSP itself identi¯es 7,455 ¯rms that exited the
database by merger between 1926 and 1998, but links only 3,488 (46.8%) of them to acquirers. Our
examination of the 2000 Edition of Financial Information Inc.'s Directory of Obsolete Securities and
every issue of Predicasts Inc.'s F&S Index of Corporate Change between 1969 and 1989 uncovered
the acquirers for 3,646 (91.9%) of these unlinked mergers, 1803 of which turned out to be CRSP
¯rms. We also recorded all mergers from 1895 to 1930 in the manufacturing and mining sectors from
the original worksheets underlying Nelson (1959) and collected information on mergers from 1885
to 1894 from the ¯nancial news section of weekly issues of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle.
We then recursively traced backward the merger history of every 1998 CRSP survivor and its targets,
apportioning the 1998 capital of the survivor to its own entry year and those of its merger partners
using the share of combined market value attributable to each in the year immediately preceding
the merger. The process of adjusting Figure 1 ended up involving 5,422 mergers.
   5
     An analysis of mergers in the manufacturing and mining sectors in the '20s, however, suggests
that capital brought into the market by entering ¯rms shortly after a merger cannot account for
very much of the entry in Figure 1. We reached this conclusion after examining all 2,701 mergers
recorded for the '20s in the worksheets underlying Nelson (1959). Many mergers involved a single
acquirer procuring multiple targets in the course of consolidation. We included the value of acquirers


                                                  3
   3. Financing. The entrants of the 1920's may have ¯nanced a higher-than-average
      share of their own investment by issuing shares, or they later (e.g., in the 1990's)
      bought back more of their debt or retained more earnings than other ¯rms did.

   4. Bubbles: The '20s cohort may be overvalued, as may be the high tech stocks of
      the 1990s, while other vintages may be undervalued.

   5. Market power, monitoring: The '20s cohort may be in markets that are less
      competitive or in activities for which shareholders can monitor management
      more easily.

    Only the ¯rst explanation invokes the quality of the entering ¯rms. We build a
model in which di®erences between the solid and dashed lines in Figure 1 arise because
of factors 1(a), and 1(b) alone { a quality explanation as one would naturally use with
vintage wines, for instance. Implicitly, we appeal to the market power that a ¯rm
derives from the patents that it may own on its inventions and products. In the data
work, we control for factors 2 and 3. We believe that factor 4 does not contaminate
our estimates because di®erences among values of vintages have been highly stable
over time (see Figure A1 in the appendix). That is, if a ¯rm today is overvalued
relative to its fundamentals, it has always been overvalued, and that seems highly
improbable. Finally,we have not tried to see the products invented in the 1920's are
more sheltered from competition than other generations of products, but on the face
of it the idea seems even more far-fetched than vintage-speci¯c bubbles.

Results We estimate a time-series for the organization-speci¯c technological change.
The series grows at about 1.75 percent per year but is more variable than the technol-
ogy shocks extracted from productivity data or from information on the relative price
of capital. Indeed, the series is nonmonotonic. This makes sense if patent-protection,
technological secrecy and customer loyalty allow a generation of entrants to protect
its products and techniques from being imitated by later entrants. Far from explain-
ing why such imitation seems to be di±cult, our model will simply assume that such
imitation is impossible.
that entered the NYSE anytime in the next two years and remained listed in 1998 as part of value
brought into the market via a '20s merger. We also checked delisted '20s acquirers to determine
if they were predecessors (through a later acquisition or sequence of acquisitions) to a CRSP ¯rm
that was listed in 1998, and treated these mergers similarly. The percentages obtained by dividing
the 1998 value of all entering post-merger capital by the 1998 capital implied by the solid line in
Figure 1 for each year of the 1920's were 6.81 in 1920, 0.53 in 1921, 0.67 in 1922, 1.77 in 1923, 0.02
in 1924, 1.91 in 1925, 7.32 in 1926, 2.07 in 1927, 5.95 in 1928, 0.41 in 1929, and 1.59 in 1930. Since
the method attributes all entering capital to the merger targets even though much of it probably
resided with the acquiring ¯rm prior to merger and some may re°ect post-merger appreciation of
market value, these ¯gures are likely to overstate the actual amounts of entering capital associated
with mergers. This was necessary because we have no record of the value of unlisted targets prior
to merger and entry of the acquirers.


                                                  4
    The volatility of the estimated shock is not surprising considering that it is based
on stock prices. Hayashi (1982, p. 223) and Pakes (1986, p. 403) have found that a
rise in a ¯rm's stock of capital or a rise in the number of its patents is accompanied
by an increase in its stock-market value far larger than one would expect based on
reasonable adjustment costs of capital and knowledge. Grossman and Shiller (1981)
found that the S&P 500 index °uctuates more than the dividends of the ¯rms that
comprise it, and De Long and Shleifer (1991) found that closed-end fund values
°uctuate more than the values of their component securities.
    Our estimated cohort e®ects are stronger than one would ¯nd in other data.
Previous work on vintage e®ects by Johnson (1980) on wages and by Levin and
Stephan (1991) on research publications considers individuals (not ¯rms) for whom
one would expect negative age e®ects and positive vintage e®ects on performance.
Since age and vintage are perfectly negatively correlated, if each variable operates
linearly, their separate e®ects cannot be identi¯ed. To complicate things further, the
passage of time matters too. Figure 1, however, uses data from a single date; it is the
1998 cross-section of stock-market shares arranged by vintage. This is where our 113-
year series of technology estimates comes from, and so our estimates are free of any
possibly \excess" volatility common to all ¯rms. Indeed, Figure A1 shows that the
di®erences in values of the various vintages are quite stable over time, which suggests
that age per se does not matter here { the '20s ¯rms are not especially valuable
because they are 65 years old but because the pre-'20s vintages had much less value
at a comparable age. We are not the ¯rst to have detected vintage e®ects in stock
prices because Gerdes (1999) has already found them in the returns to buy-and-hold
portfolios of stocks entering the CRSP.


2    Model
Our model follows a string of vintage capital models in the last few years, such as
Atkeson and Kehoe (1997), Cooley et al (1999), Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998),
Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1998), and Hornstein and Krusell (1996). As in Lucas's
(1978) exchange economy, the representative agent, Crusoe, plants trees that bear
fruit. He faces no uncertainty. The output of the ¯nal good is denoted by yt , and
Crusoe's consumption by ct . Crusoe's lifetime utility is
                                     1
                                     X

                                     t=0

   Trees. A tree's fruit-crop, y, depends on the tree's quality, µ; which is ¯xed over
time, and on its variable input, m:

                                     y = µ1¡® m® :                                  (1)


                                             5
The variable input is produced using the services of capital, k, and labor, h:

Since ® < 1, returns to the variable inputs diminish and Crusoe prefers to have many
trees. A tree's quality has a vintage-speci¯c part z and a tree-speci¯c part ":

                                        µ = zv ":

Crusoe starts every period with the same menu of tree-speci¯c qualities given by the
density of ", f ("). Crusoe knows a tree's " before he plants it, and therefore plants
only qualities above some threshold. Once planted, the tree springs forth and yields
fruit right away. The ¯rst few trees that Crusoe plants are of very high quality, and
he will plant some at each date. Trees yield fruit in the same period and continue to
yield that fruit for ever.
    Variable inputs. Physical capital is homogeneous and it evolves as follows:

                               kt+1 = (1 ¡ ±) kt + qt xt ,

where xt is fruit set aside for capital production. Labor quality, h, evolves exoge-
nously, with a growth-factor °. That is,

                                      ht+1 = ° h ht:

    Planting: We assume that Át is the ¯xed cost of planting
                                                           R 1 a tree. If st is the worst
tree planted at t, the number of trees planted is n (st ) ´ st f (") d", and in units of
fruit the cost is Át n (st ).
    Income identity : Aggregate output, Yt , is divided between consumption, invest-
ment in physical capital, and investment in trees:

                                Yt = ct + xt + Át n (st ) :

2.0.1   Interpretation
The model contains four sources of technological change:

  1. In trees: zt is the quality of the technology embodied in trees planted at date
     t. We refer to z as organization capital.

  2. In equipment: qt is a technology parameter embodied in the equipment made
     at date t.

  3. In ¯nance: Át is the cost of planting trees, the cost of starting a project. One
     part of this cost is presumably the cost of getting funds.

  4. In labor quality: ht is a labor-augmenting technological change parameter.

                                            6
   To get something that we can work with, we have sacri¯ced much realism. First,
technology is exogenous and perfectly foreseen. Second, trees do not need main-
tenance and so, as in Solow (1960), they are never abandoned, regardless of their
quality. Third, obsolescence of trees occurs only through interest-rate changes, an
assumption that Hobijn and Jovanovic (forthcoming) relax. Fourth, tree-quality is
known before the tree is planted, an assumption that Jovanovic (1982) relaxes.

2.0.2       Crusoe's decision problem
Each period, Crusoe spreads his capital among trees so as to maximize total output

2.0.3    Decentralizing the allocation

                                                                       0

centralizes. De¯ning the rate of interest rt implicitly by 1+r t
                                                                  = ¯UU 0(c(ct+1

                                                                                   , we combine
(4) and (5) into one condition:
                      µ                  ¶           µ                               ¶

           1 + rt = qt ®´      +            =         (1 ¡ ®)     +

                                               8
This asset market condition equates the returns to three di®erent forms of saving
and storage: (1) earn 1 + rt dollars per dollar saved in the bank; (2) convert the
dollar into qt machines, use them to produce (i.e., receive a rental of) qt ®´yt+1 =kt+1
units of tomorrow's output, and sell the undepreciated machines at 1=qt+1 dollars
per machine; and (3) convert the dollar into 1=Át trees of quality zt st each, get their
dividends tomorrow and then sell them. Trees draw   ³ ´the´®residual income and their
                                                      k        (1¡´)®
share of output is (1 ¡ ®) : The quantity (1 ¡ ®) At+1  t+1
                                                             ht+1     is the additional
                                 Á
dividend, and the quantity zt+1t+1
                                 st+1
                                      is the resources that Crusoe can save tomorrow
by having the additional surviving trees. So, the last (or worst) tree that is planted
in each period has the same yield as the purchase of a machine. In other words, the
cost of planting the marginal tree equals the discounted sum of the (marginal utility
of) consumption that is provides. The discounted output of the inframarginal trees
exceeds the cost of planting them. Good vintage years (i.e., high z years) will see
more of the low-quality trees being planted which means that mean vintage-quality
should be positively related to its within-vintage variance.6
    Next, the factor market. A ¯rm equates the marginal product of capital to its
user cost Jt . That is,
                           qt ®´yt+1            qt (1 ¡ ±)
                                     = 1 + rt ¡            ´ Jt                            (6)
                              kt+1                  qt+1
                                     ¼ rt + ± + gq;t

where gq;t is the growth of qt at date t. In units of the ¯nal good, the price of capital
is 1=qt and the user cost of an e±ciency unit of capital is Jt =qt :
    Similarly, while Crusoe takes his labor endowment as exogenous, for a ¯rm it is
a choice variable. The ¯rm will set the marginal product of skill equal to its shadow
price:
                                              yt
                                   ® (1 ¡ ´) ´ wt

    When the inputs of k and h are priced in this way, the net income from a tree is

    Fernando Alvarez pointed this property out to us, and it is strongly con¯rmed by the data {
see Figure 6.

                                                 9
The price of a tree is the discounted present value of the income it generates:

                                              pt (µ) = ¼ t µ;

where                                     1
                                          X             U 0 (ct+j )
                         ¼ t = (1 ¡ ®)             ¯j               ­ (wt+j ; Jt+j ) :   (7)
                                             j=0
                                                         U 0 (ct )

Let Pt;v be the date - t value of all vintage - v trees:
                                              Z 1
                                Pt;v = ¼ t zv     "f (") d"                              (8)
                                                          sv

It depends positively on the tree-vintage shock zv , positively on vintage v investment
as indexed by the identity of the marginal project sv ; negatively on the growth of qt
because that raises Jt , and negatively on the price of skill wt .
    We can now predict the series for the solid line in Figure 1. Since y is linear in µ,
so is p: That is, pt (µ) = ¼ t µ, where ¼ t does not depend on the tree's vintage. At any
date, then, the value of the capital of various vintages is proportional to the aggregate
quality that each vintage accounts for. Thus we get a series for the percentage of

growth factor of variable \b". We shall describe a path along which c grows at the
growth factor °. The following result is proved in the appendix:

of the extensive margin. If the planting of trees becomes cheaper over time, ° Á < 1
and gÁ < 0. If Á declines, the parameter ¸ determines how much that decline will
raise growth, and we shall elaborate on how it works.
                                              R1
    The number of trees planted is n (s) = s "¡(1+¸) d" = ¸1 s¡¸ ; and their aggregate

                                             s, converges to zero as s ! 0. As Figure 2
shows, the higher is ¸, the more slowly does quality converge to zero, and this opens
the door to a bigger boost to growth as the extensive margin rolls down to zero.


3     Estimation
To relate the model to the data, we assume that a ¯rm owns and manages exactly
one tree, so that each tree planted at date t represents an initial public o®ering of a
new ¯rm. Thus we shall explain the pattern in Figure 1 with the z's { that is, with
vintage organization capital shocks. In reality, ¯rms can and often do produce output
without listing on the stock market, and we shall adjust for that fact, among others.

3.1    Estimating the z's from the series in Figure (1).
Now let pmin
         t;v denote the period-t price of the lowest-quality (i.e., µ = zv sv ) tree planted
at date v. Then,
                                                         pmin

(1952), and that of bank loans is from All Bank Statistics and the Historical Statistics of the United
States. Since the last two sources report June 30 ¯gures, we average across years for consistency
with the calendar-year basis of the Flow of Funds. After ratio-splicing these components into a
continuous series, we convert to market values using the average annual yields on Moody's AAA-
rated corporate bonds for 1919-98 and Hickman's \high grade" bond yields, which line up precisely
with Moody's, for 1900-18. We use yields on \high-grade industrial bonds" from Milton Friedman
and Anna J. Schwartz (1982) for 1885-99. To determine market value, we let rt be the bond interest
rate and compute the weighted average

multiply the book value of outstanding debt by the ratio rtt to obtain its market value.

3.1.3         ^ to the z^'s
         From ¸
Having found ¸, ^ we compute the series for the z^'s shown in Figure 4. Since not all
of the early years have surviving ¯rms, we denote interpolated values by a dashed
line. An OLS regression of the logarithm of the z^'s on a linear time trend implies an
average growth rate of 1.75 percent per year. Gort, Greenwood and Rupert (1999,
Figure 2) ¯nd that the vintage e®ects in the rent on structures are similar to our
estimates of the shocks { a U-shaped pattern { but their estimates are not \cleansed"
of quality in the way that we have tried to cleanse ours using pmin .


4       Vintage organization capital
The z^v 's are our estimates of cohorts' organization capital. What does it mean to say
that the '20s cohort has more organization capital than the '50s cohort? Why would
¯rms ability to organize get worse in that way? Organization capital is whatever
makes a group of people and assets more productive together than apart. Firm-
speci¯c human (Becker 1962), management (Prescott and Visscher 1980), and phys-
ical (Ramey and Shapiro 1996) capital, and a cooperative disposition in the ¯rm's

workforce (Eeckhout 2000 and Rob and Zemsky 1997) are examples of organization
capital. Most of that capital is probably not on the ¯rm's books and is an \intangible"
asset.
    Now, not all organization capital is intangible, nor is all intangible capital a form
of organization capital. For example, prior to 2000, general-purpose software was
expensed and, being highly durable, it would be a form of intangible capital but not
a part of organization capital { in our model it would be part of k and not part of z.
Conversely, any physical capital that is partly speci¯c to the ¯rm's product is a form
of tangible capital, a fraction of which is organization capital. Organization capital
di®ers from other capital { tangible or intangible { because it is worth more to the
¯rm than it is to other ¯rms. An example is a patent on a technological invention.
To get the most out of its patent, a ¯rm will buy speci¯c machinery and hire the kind
of labor needed to work that technology. The organization is then built around the
idea, and it determines the value of the ¯rm. The idea, the labor, and the capital,
have all been chosen to ¯t one another, and any component taken on its own is worth
less elsewhere.
    Being costly to adjust, an organization's capital will re°ect conditions that pre-
vailed when the organization was created. The ¯rm founder's idea, the patents that
he may take out on it, and the plant and equipment that he acquires at the IPO
stage will, presumably, all re°ect technology that was state of the art and the relative

prices of inputs that prevailed then. The ¯rm's founder and its original managers
will often pick their successors and the initial character of the organization may live
on even after they are no longer with the ¯rm. The ¯rm will, in other words, carry
an \imprint", as Carroll and Hannan (2000, ch. 9) put it, and, if the organization
capital is subject to adjustment costs, the imprint will persist. Organization capital
must indeed be costly to change, because many a ¯rm will disband, sell its assets o®
at a mere fraction of their marginal internal value and impose on its members the
costs of searching for new jobs, rather than reorganize internally.
    To sum up: A cohort can partially appropriate the new technologies and products
of its day, thereby leaving less rents for incumbents and for succeeding cohorts. The
precise mechanism by which this happens is not yet clear to us, but this is what the
data seem to be saying, and what our model simply assumes.

4.0.4   Estimating ®
One estimate of ® is the private returns to scale of the reproducible factors k and h.
Organization capital is not reproducible here. Now, ® must be less than one if we
are to have a range of e±ciencies in equilibrium. We could take an estimate from the
literature (which would put ® at around 0:9 or 0:95), but it is more instructive to
derive it from the observed market-to-book (M=B) values of ¯rms since this source

                                           16
of information on ® has not yet been used.
    Figure 5 is the frequency distribution of M=B for all 6,051 ¯rms listed in the
combined CRSP and Compustat ¯les in 1998 that include a book value suitable
for computation. Market values represent common equity only, while book values
correspond to the ¯rm's residual claim.8 In the model, all ¯rms have the same M=B
if q is constant and if Á is not on the books (e.g., underwriters' and lawyers' fees).
Let us derive M=B in this special case. From (6) one ¯nds that in consumption units
the capital inside a ¯rm k would be proportional to y as follows:
                                        kt    ®´yt
                                           =        ´ B:
                                        q    rt + ±
This is the ¯rm's book value If rt were constant at r, the market value of such a ¯rm
would be M ´ (1 ¡ ®) y=r. Therefore, for all ¯rms
                                      M   (1 ¡ ®) (r + ±)
                                        =                 :
                                      B        r®´
The 1998 median of the M=B distribution in Figure 5 is 1:79. If ´ = 0:33; r = 0:055;
and ± = 0:125, we should have
              (1 ¡ ®) (r + ±)                  ®            (0:18)
                              = 1:79, so that     =                       ;
                   r®´                        1¡®   (1:79) (0:33) (0:055)
which gives ® = 0:85.
    Now, as Figure 5 shows, M=B is not the same for all ¯rms. It turns out that
M=B varies widely both within and across vintages. Moreover, it does so in a way
consistent with Á being partly on the books. Optimal planting implies (see (5)) that
when z is high, s is low. That is, the better the vintage, the more low-quality trees
are planted, and this raises the dispersion of qualities in that vintage. Now, when Á
is on the books, this translates into a rise in both the mean and variability of M=B
within a vintage, and this is exactly what happens. The solid line in Figure 6 presents
the average M=B and its standard deviations by entry year for a large subsample of
¯rms in our extended CRSP database.9 Dispersion in the market-to-book values is
highly correlated with their level (½ = :90).
   8
     The residual book claim is the sum of common shares valued at par and any premia on stock,
surplus, retained earnings, and net undivided pro¯ts that might appear on the ¯rm's consolidated
balance sheet. We omitted ¯rms with negative values for net common equity from the plot since
they imply negative market to book ratios. We also excluded ¯rms with market to book ratios that
exceeded 100, since our \residual" de¯nition of book equity could at times be negligible even though
the ¯rm's total liabilities were quite large.
   9
     The ratios depicted in Figure 6 are annual averages. We collect the balance sheet quantities
in 1998, 1989, 1980, 1955, and 1928, all business cycle peaks, and use the market-to-book ratio in
the latest year for ¯rms with multiple observations. To excise time e®ects, we multiply non-1998
observations by the ratio of the average M=B of all ¯rms (not just entrants or latest observations) in
1998 to that in the appropriate sampling year. The M=B's were 1.79 in 1928 (227 obs.), 1.58 in 1955

(256 obs.), 3.21 in 1980 (4,769 obs.), 3.63 in 1989 (5.952 obs.), and 3.58 in 1998 (6,051 obs.). Book
values from 1998, 1989 and 1980 are from Compustat (data item #60), while those from 1955 and
1928 are from Moody's Industrial Manual and Moody's Railroad Manual. Of the 10,658 observations
included in Figure 6, 6,051 are from 1998, 2,457 from 1989, 1,769 from 1980, 156 from 1955, and
225 from 1928. Overall, this represents nearly half of the ¯rms in our extended CRSP database.
   Figure 6 is not quite the same as Figure 2 of Jovanovic and Rousseau (2001) who de¯ne the
market-book ratio di®erently, using total balance sheet liabilities as the book value of the ¯rm, and
obtaining market value by subtracting out common equity at par and adding it back in at market
value. This is equivalent to adding debt and current liabilities to both numerator and denominator
of the ratios, thereby making them smaller and less variable than those presented here. That paper
tests an entirely di®erent model. Since our present model focuses on common equity, we consider
the current measure more appropriate here. Figure 6 is based on a sample that is larger by 4,164
observations.

    We have already estimated ¸ and the zt sequence, and we shall use the average
size of the smallest one-third of entrants in a given year from the data as a robust
estimate of pmin
               t . Figure 7 presents the series.
                                                11
                                                   Finally we need the model's prediction
for ¼ t in (7). To compute this, we shall assume that U (c) = ln c and use the actual
sequence for per capita real consumption.12 For w we would want the time-wage (wh)
divided by h, but we do not have a reliable measure of h, and so hold w constant at
1 throughout.
    As for J, we will use the growth rate of relative equipment prices, after correcting
for changes in quality, to estimate the technology parameter q. Krusell et al. (2000)
build such a series from 1963 using the consumer price index to de°ate the quality-
adjusted estimates of producer equipment prices from Gordon (1990, table 12.4, col.
2, p. 541). Since Gordon's series ends in 1983, they use VAR forecasts to extend it
through 1992. We start with Krusell et al. and work backward, de°ating Gordon's
remaining estimates (1947-62) with an index for non-durable consumption goods
prices that we derive from the National Income Accounts. Since we are not aware of
  10
     The average corporate tax rates for 1953-85 are from Auerbach (1983) and are continued through
1998 as the ratio of income taxes before credits to taxable income from various issues of the Statistical
Abstract of the United States. We use the ratio of income taxes to net income from Historical
Statistics (series Y-389 divided by series Y-388) for 1909-52, which marks the inception of the
corporate income tax. A ratio splice in 1953 adjusts for di®erences between net and taxable incomes
that make the denominators of the tax rate measures not directly comparable across data sources.
  11
     The average ¯rm size and average number of employees per business concern are also included
in Figure 7. These series indicate that the decline in entry size after 1960 was not simply the result
of a tendency for businesses to downsize.
  12
     We construct the consumption series from unpublished tables underlying Kuznets (1961) for
1885-1928 and the NIPA for 1929-1998.

a quality-adjusted series for equipment prices prior to 1947, we use the average price
of electricity as a proxy for 1902-46, and an average of Brady's (1966) de°ators for the
main classes of equipment for 1885-1902.13 We de°ate the pre-1947 composite using
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) consumer prices index of all items (Historical
Statistics, series E135) for 1913-46 and the Burgess cost of living index (Historical
Statistics, series E184), which has greater precision than the BLS series, for 1885-1912.
Figure 8 presents the resulting equipment price series.
    With the model calibrated, we pool the data in each ¡ decade,
                                                             ¢     calculate the number
and value of entering ¯rms, and then compare Nt pmin       t    and V^t to the observed
                        14
quantities by decade. To do this, we set the sum of the predicted decadal values
  13
      Electricity prices from 1926-46 are the average of all electric services in cents per kilowatt-hour
from Historical Statistics series S119. We use prices for all consumption uses of electicity for 1902-
26, and interpolate under a constant growth assumption between ¯ve-year benchmarks from 1902
through 1917. The equipment price de°ators that we average in 1879, 1889 and 1900 (Brady, 1966,
table 2b, p. 111) include industrial machinery, farm equipment, o±ce and store equipment, railroad
equipment, ships and boats, conveyances, professional and scienti¯c equipment, and carpentry and
mechanics tools. We again interpolate using constant growth rates between these benchmarks, and
to avoid smoothing bias use a similarly interpolated version of the consumer price index over this
period.
   14
      We should note, however, that the predicted entry values are conditional on the realized pmin   t
sequence that we cannot predict because we have no measure of Át so that we treat the latter as a
residual.

that successful ¯rms will be more highly valued from the start than unsuccessful
ones, many of which in fact (but not in the model) disband, the average 1998 value
of surviving ¯rms of earlier cohorts will be higher than those of later cohorts. This
selection bias, when combined with estimates of pmint   (see Figure 7) that are no larger
in the 1890's than in 1998, tends to generate entry values for the early decades that
are too large.15
    There is reason to believe, however, that the selection bias is not too severe. Figure
9 presents histograms of entering ¯rms pooled within decades that mark the entry
positions of the ¯rms that we featured in Figure 1. Most of the ¯rms that ended up
large and successful in 1998 had their value recognized in the market from the start.
This is clear from the right-tail positions of most of these ¯rms in the histograms,
and o®ers additional support for our model. Firms that enter with good ideas and
technologies do indeed seem to generate lasting value.
    The second reason why we overpredict entry in the early years may have to do
with the wage rate which, though it is a key part of the model, is held constant when
computing ¼. While we cannot identify a good proxy for wt , the existing literature
on skill premia (i.e. Goldin and Katz 1999) show that the price of skilled labor
was highest before 1915 and fell rapidly between 1915 and 1925. A large wt would
generate a larger ¼ t and reduce the amount of entry that the model predicts. Though
our model has no role for the skill premium, it may still be the right proxy for wt if
one wants to predict lifetime returns on ¯rms that are adopting a new technology,
since skilled labor matters for adopting new technologies and less so for using old
ones.
    The third reason why we overpredict entry early on may be an inadequate adjust-
ment for the quality of capital before 1907 and a consequent underestimate of the
decline in the relative price of equipment in the early decades. Underestimating q
leads to a J that is too low and, hence, a to a ¼ and to a predicted entry that are
too high for the 1890s.


6        Conclusions
The stock-market reveals large cohort e®ects in the surviving value of ¯rms. Some
cohorts of ¯rms retain more value { per unit of investment and in the aggregate {
than others. These vintage e®ects, or seeming quality di®erences among the cohorts,
persist over long periods of time. They do not seem to re°ect bubbles, Nor do they
seem to be the result of merger waves or shifts between equity and debt ¯nance.
   We have argued that these di®erentials persist because technology grows in spurts,
and because good technologies are appropriated by the new ¯rms of their day. Firms
sometimes do manage to rede¯ne themselves by imitating the successful ¯rms, by
merging with them, by raiding their personnel, and so on. More often than not,
  15
       In a related model Campbell (1998) analyzes this sort of bias.


                                                   23
however, such attempts fail, which is why, say, the 1970's cohort did not do as well as
the 1960's cohort. Patents and other barriers do confer an advantage on ¯rst movers,
and the advantages persist. Indeed, the inter-vintage value di®erentials persist over
periods longer than the 18- or 20-year patent protection window. Our model asserts
but does not explain why initial conditions should matter so much to the long-run
value of the organization capital.
    Finally, if vintage e®ects really do re°ect technology, the data seem to show that
the most successful implementors come in 15, 20 or even 30 years after a technolog-
ical revolution has begun. The microprocessor dates back to 1971 but it isn't until
1986 that Apple and Microsoft ¯rst list on the stock exchange; the WW2 inventions
took 20 years to materialize in the successful entrants of the late 1960s; the Niagara
Falls hydroelectric dam was completed in 1895 which was the starting gun for the
commercial-electricity era and yet the successful entrants did not come until 20 - 25
years after that. The long delay is a puzzle. A ¯rm usually does begin producing out-
put before it has its IPO, but, nevertheless, it is not until it lists on a stock exchange
that the ¯rm's idea gets implemented on a large scale.
