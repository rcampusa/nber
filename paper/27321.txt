                                        ABSTRACT

We evaluate the employment effect of the green part of the largest fiscal stimulus in recent
history, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Each $1 million of green ARRA
created 15 new jobs that emerged especially in the post-ARRA period (2013-2017). We find little
evidence of significant short-run employment gains. Green ARRA creates more jobs in
commuting zones with a greater prevalence of pre-existing green skills. Nearly half of the jobs
created by green ARRA investments were in construction or waste management. Nearly all new
jobs created are manual labor positions. Nonetheless, manual labor wages did not increase.

I.     Introduction

       The effect of environmental policy on employment is still hotly debated and polarized, with

advocates on both sides ignoring or exaggerating the labor market costs and benefits of

environmental regulations. Advocates of stronger environmental policies argue that such policies

create high-paying "green jobs", while critics point to the job losses in energy-intensive industries

that they are sure will follow. Previous literature finds that net effect of environmental policies on

employment is small especially when general equilibrium effects and offsetting mechanisms are

accounted for (Morgenstern et al., 2002; Hafstead and Williams, 2018; Metcalf and Stock, 2020).

However, other studies find job losses concentrated in polluting industries (Greenstone, 2002,

Kahn and Mansur, 2013) and among unskilled workers (Yip, 2018; Marin and Vona, 2019).

Adverse impacts on manual labor are of particular concern for policy-makers, given the secular

decline in their employability and wages driven by automation and globalization (Autor et al.,

2003; Autor et al., 2013).

       While the previous literature has evaluated the effect of policies imposing a cost on

pollution (either through standards or prices) on labor markets, less attention has been devoted to

the potential of green subsidies opening up new employment opportunities in the so-called green

economy. Our paper informs the burgeoning policy debate on green fiscal plans, by focusing on

the evaluation of a big push for the green economy, namely the green part of the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, henceforth). The full stimulus package included over

$350 billion of direct government spending, and an additional $260 billion in tax reductions (Aldy,

2013). We focus on the direct spending targeted at green investments, which constituted

approximately 17% of all direct government spending in ARRA. Examples of such spending

include Department of Energy (DOE) block grants to states to support energy efficiency audits

                                                      2
and retrofits, investments in public transport and clean vehicles, and Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) spending to clean up brownfield sites. Because a large share of green spending was

devoted to public investments, green ARRA may have a cumulative effect stretching beyond the

stimulus period (Council of Economic Advisers, 2013, 2014). We thus differentiate between the

short- and long-term effect of green ARRA. We evaluate the employment gains triggered by the

green stimulus, its heterogeneous effect depending on the level of local green capabilities and the

way in which the green stimulus has affected different sectors and groups of workers. Our

evaluation is timely and important as proposals for green stimuli investments have attracted a great

deal of attention, both as part of possible recovery packages after COVID-19 lockdowns and as

part of Green New Deal plans proposed by the European Commission, the International Energy

Agency, the International Monetary Fund and some Democrats in the US (Helm, 2020).

       Our analysis makes three contributions to the discussion of heterogeneous labor market

effects. First, using data on green skills from Vona et al. (2018), we show that the effectiveness of

green investments varies depending on the pre-existing skill base of a community. Second, we

estimate the effects of green ARRA investments on different sectors and sets of occupations to

identify those workers receiving the most benefits from green investments. Third, our focus on

heterogeneous effects across different types of workers also adds to the literature on structural

transformations and inequality in local labor markets (e.g., Autor et al., 2013; Acemoglu and

Restrepo, 2020). A key difference between investments in the green economy, especially in

building retrofitting and energy infrastructures, and in automation is that the former increase the

relative demand of manual workers, while the latter decreases it. This implies that manual workers

that are displaced by carbon pricing policies in energy intensive sectors (Marin and Vona, 2019;

Yip, 2019) may find new employment opportunities in sectors related to the green economy, such



                                                     3
as construction and waste management. Our research considers whether green investments can

facilitate this transition in local labor markets.

        Our analysis also contributes to the broader literature estimating the effects of the 2009

Recovery Act. We add to the empirical literature on fiscal multipliers looking at the effect of a

type of spending, i.e. in the green economy, that will become increasingly important in the future

(see Chodorow-Reich, 2019 for a survey). In the spirit of recent contributions seeking to isolate

the microeconomics mechanisms of the local multiplier (e.g. Moretti, 2010; Garin, 2018; Dupor

and McCrory, 2018; Auerbach et al., 2019), we study the time profile of the effect, the role of key

mediating factors and some mechanisms through which the green stimulus impact on the local

economy.

        Previous literature on other aspects of the Recovery Act exploit geographical variation in

expenditures and isolate its exogenous component, and thus a causal effect, using pre-existing

formulas to allocate federal funds (Wilson, 2012; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2012; Nakamura and

Steinsson, 2014; Dupor and Mehkari, 2016; Chodorow-Reich, 2019). However, identifying the

causal effect of the green stimulus presents three additional challenges. First, the green stimulus is

small relative to the non-green stimulus. Controlling for non-green ARRA expenditures is

essential, but potentially introduces another endogenous variable complicating the identification

of the green ARRA effect (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). The trade-off is between an error of

misspecification from not including non-green ARRA and a bias in estimating the green ARRA

effect for including a bad control (non-green ARRA) correlated with the error term. We address

the first challenge by including a set of twenty dummies representing each vigintile of per capita

non-green ARRA. This allows us to compare the effect of green ARRA in communities that

received similar levels of non-green ARRA investments and to test the robustness of our results to



                                                      4
the exclusion of vigintiles in which the dispersion of green ARRA spending is very high or low or

for which the correlation between green and non-green ARRA is very high.

       Second, the allocation of green investments may be dependent on characteristics of the

local economy. In general, ARRA spending targeted areas hardest hit by the recession and is

endogenous by construction. The share of ARRA that is green may be further influenced by

features of the economy specific to green investments, such as the presence of a federal DOE

laboratory or the renewable energy potential of a region. We address these concerns through two

sets of control variables. The first set captures the economic conditions in commuting zone  before

the great recessions and are quite standard in the literature evaluating the Recovery Act (e.g.

Wilson, 2012; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2012; Chodorow-Reich, 2019). The second set of controls

are specific to the green economy, such as the stringency of environmental regulation in the local

area (Greenstone, 2002), wind and solar energy potential (Aldy, 2013) and the pre-existing base

of green skills in each commuting zone (Vona et al., 2018).

       Third, we observe that even after controlling for these observables, areas receiving more

green ARRA experienced higher employment growth before the great recession. While standard

state or regional fixed effects are sufficient to eliminate the pre-trend for non-green ARRA

investments, they do not eliminate the pre-trend on total employment for green ARRA. We address

these pre-trends in two ways. First, we allow the effect of green ARRA investments to vary across

three periods: the pre-ARRA period (2005-2007); the short-term (2009-2012) and the long-term

(2013-2017). We compute the long- and short-run effect of green ARRA by subtracting its effect

before 2008. Second, we use a standard shift-share instrument (e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson,

2014), where we combine the pre-sample share of different types of green spending in each

commuting zone with the green ARRA shift. While neither solution is perfect, comparing the OLS



                                                    5
and the IV results is very informative, as each approach minimizes a different source of

endogeneity. The IV mitigates endogeneity related to non-random assignment of green ARRA

subsidies but it represents an upper bound, as it may capture the effect of past green spending on

areas that were already on a green path (Jaeger et al., 2018), i.e. compliers in a LATE terminology

(Imbens and Angrist, 1994). The OLS does the opposite: the effect should be smaller as it is the

average of the exogenous shock on compliers and the endogenous shock on non-compliers.

However, it is less likely to conflate the effect of green ARRA with that of past green policies.

         Finally, we contribute to the voluminous literature that evaluates the labor market impact

of environmental policies. 5 Our critical contribution rests on the fact that we are the first to evaluate

the effect of a green subsidy rather than that of a policy imposing a cost (i.e. an emission standard

or a carbon tax). The only exception is the related paper of Vona et al. (2019), which uses similar

data. Following Moretti (2010), they estimate the additional number of jobs indirectly created in

the local economy by a new green job. We extend their work by estimating the direct effect of

green subsidies, its time-profile and the heterogeneous effects across workers, sectors and

communities.

         We find that green ARRA increases total employment, but that it works more slowly than

other stimulus investments. The results from our preferred specification is in the mid-range of

previous estimates, with just under 15 jobs created per $1 million of green ARRA in the long-run.

The persistency of the job creation effect is clearly a positive aspect of the green fiscal stimulus.

However, we find little evidence of short-run employment gains. The timing of green ARRRA's

impact differs from previous studies of other ARRA investments, which generally find short-term

  For the evaluation of the effect of the US Clean Air Act see, e.g., Greenstone (2002), Walker (2011), Ferris et al.
(2014), Curtis (2018) and Vona et al. (2018). For estimates of the effect of energy prices and carbon taxes, see, e.g.,
Kahn and Mansur (2013), Martin et al. (2014), Marin and Vona (2017, 2019), Yamzaki (2017) and Yip (2018).

effects. While the unavoidable presence of pre-trends prevents us from drawing firm conclusions

on the overall effect of green ARRA, its impact becomes much clearer when we explore several

dimensions of heterogeneity, for which pre-trends are less of a concern. Green ARRA creates more

jobs in commuting zones with a greater prevalence of pre-existing green skills. As the presence of

green skills in a community is also strongly correlated with the allocation of green ARRA

subsidies, our results provide evidence of the green stimulus as a successful example of picking

winners. Looking at specific sectors of the economy, we see the potential of a green stimulus to

reshape an economy and increase the local demand for green tasks. Nearly half of the jobs created

by green ARRA investments were in construction or waste management. Nearly all of the new

jobs created are manual labor positions. Importantly, while we find evidence of pre-trends when

evaluating total employment, we find no evidence of pre-trends when we study heterogeneous

impacts across sectors and workers, providing us with confidence that our results are credible.

Even though the largest employment gains were for manual laborers with at least some college

education, manual labor wages did not increase. These missing wage gains may either reflect the

fact that the green stimulus was too small to offset the long-term deterioration of the bargaining

power of manual workers, or the poor quality of the jobs created. While further research is required

to understand the impact of green subsidies on labour market inequalities, these results suggest

that the green stimulus may create new opportunities for those most affected by globalization and

automation.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the necessary

background on the green part of the Recovery Act. Section 3 presents the data used for this project

as well as preliminary descriptive statistics. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy, while

Section 5 the main results. Section 6 discusses the policy implications of our study.

II.    The Green component of the Recovery Act

       In response to the Great Recession, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)

of 2009, commonly known as the stimulus package, invested over $800 billion in the forms of tax

incentives and federal spending programs to stimulate the US economy. Through ARRA spending

programs, federal agencies partnered with state and local governments, non-profit and private

entities to help "put Americans back to work". Naturally, much of the spending programs funded

projects that provide immediate job opportunities, such as highway construction, or filled state

budget shortfalls to bail out the school system and save the jobs of teachers and school staff. Figure

1 shows the breakdown of funds by federal agency, which confirms large ARRA spending on

education and transportation.

       While the primary goal of ARRA was to stimulate macroeconomic growth and provide job

opportunities, part of the funds were invested in "... environmental protection, and infrastructure

that will provide long-term economic benefits" (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of

2009). These include both direct spending intended for immediate job creation, such as Department

of Energy spending for renewable energy and energy efficiency retrofits and Environmental

Protection Agency grants for brownfield redevelopment, as well as tax breaks and loan guarantees

for renewable energy. Our work focuses on the impact of direct spending intended for job creation,

asking both whether these green investments stimulated employment and what types of workers

may benefit from a green stimulus.

       Among the key principles motivating infrastructure investments in ARRA was that

facilitating the transition to energy efficient and clean energy economy would lay the foundation

for long-term economic growth (Office of the Vice President, 2010). As a result, ARRA included

more than $90 billion for clean energy activities, including $32.7 billion in Department of Energy

contracts and grants to support projects such as energy efficiency retrofits, the development of

renewable energy resources, public transport and clean vehicles, and modernizing the electric grid

(Aldy, 2013). To meet the Obama administration's target of doubling renewable energy generation

by 2012, DOE provided assistance for a large number of projects related to renewable energy; for

example, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center received $24.8 million to design, construct and

operate a wind turbine blade testing facility (Department of Energy, 2010). Moreover, $3.4 billion

in cost-shared grants supported the deployment of smart grid technology, generating more than

$4.5 billion of co-investment (Aldy 2013). ARRA funding also supported the expansion of the

Weatherization Assistance Program, which supports low-income families for energy efficiency

improvements (Fowlie et al., 2018).



                                                    9
        The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversaw most ARRA programs designated

for environmental protection. The largest of these programs was $6.4 billion for Clean and

Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, which are among the programs analyzed in Dupor and

McCrory (2018). An additional $600 million was set aside for EPA's Superfund program to clean

up contaminated sites such as the New Bedford Harbor site in Massachusetts and the Omaha Lead

Site in Nebraska, to which the EPA allocated $30 million and $25 million, respectively 6 (Office

of the Vice President, 2010). Another $200 million was invested in the Leaking Underground

Storage Tank Trust Fund for the prevention and cleanups of leakage from underground storage

tanks. Other EPA funds were allocated to improvements of infrastructures such as wastewater

treatment facilities and diesel emissions reduction (Environmental Protection Agency, 2009).

A.      Data on ARRA awards

        Our analysis covers the universe of contracts, grants and loans awarded under the ARRA

between 2009 and 2012. Recipients of ARRA funding are required to submit reports through

FederalReporting.gov, which include information on the amount of expenses and the description

of projects. 7 We retrieved data from FedSpending.org on these records derived from reports

submitted by non-federal entities who received ARRA funding.

        In line with most recent evaluations of ARRA (Dupor and Mehkari, 2016; Dupor and

McCrory, 2018), our unit of analysis is the local labor market, i.e. the so-called commuting zone

(CZ). We aggregate county-level data into 709 Commuting Zones based on the official CZ

definitions from the 2000 Decennial Census. As in Dupor and Mehkari (2016), we exclude 122

commuting zones with less than 25,000 inhabitants in 2008, which represent less than 0.5% of the

US population and employment. We also drop the commuting zone pertaining to New Orleans,

LA, as their employment and population data are heavily influenced by the recovery from

Hurricane Katrina. Our primary estimation sample is thus constituted by 587 CZs. As the entities

known as prime recipients who directly received funding from the federal government may make

sub-contracts to other entities, we use the reported place of performance of prime and sub-prime

recipients to allocate the dollar amount of awards to commuting zones based on the zip code.8

         Nearly all DOE and EPA projects relate to the green economy. 9 Thus, our measure of green

ARRA includes all ARRA projects from the DOE and EPA and their subordinate agencies, such

as various national laboratories. All other ARRA spending is coded as non-green ARRA. 10 Table

A1 in Appendix A1 provides descriptive data on both green and non-green ARRA. Overall, the

stimulus included over $61 billion on green investments and $265.5 billion on non-green

investments. Of these green investments, $52 billion come from the DOE, while just $9 billion

come from EPA. Roughly 10% of green ARRA spending supported R&D. A small $228 million

supported job training for green occupations.




8
  Unlike other evaluations of ARRA, we do not consider the location of vendors when allocating funds. Our goal is to
ascertain the effectiveness of green ARRA given the "greenness" of the local economy. If a recipient must use vendors
from outside the local commuting zone to satisfy a need of the project due to a lack of qualified suppliers in the
commuting zone, the funding has been less effective for stimulating local employment.
9
  To verify this, we checked projects with the term "oil", "gas", or "coal" in the description. None of these projects
related to discovery of new sources. More commonly, they referenced reducing consumption, clean coal, carbon
sequestration, or biofuels as a substitute.
10
   In addition to the EPA and DOE, a few other agencies funded investments that were plausibly green. While small
(totaling just $496 million), the Department of Labor (DOL) supported four job training programs that focused on
energy efficiency and the renewable energy industry. Including these as green results in less precise estimates, but
does not change the interpretation of our results. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
also supported green building retrofits, we did not include these programs in our analysis. These do not fall under a
single green program, and thus must be identified manually. In our attempt to label HUD investments as "green", we
found that many of the "green" HUD grants were trivial ­ e.g. installing LED lightbulbs in a building ­ and should
have little to no impact on green employment.

                                                             11
       The mean value of green ARRA and non-green ARRA per commuting zone in our sample

are $103 million and $442 million dollars, respectively, so that green ARRA is slightly over-

represented in our sample relative to the data provided in Figure 1. The per-capita level of green

ARRA and non-green ARRA are $260 and $988, respectively, based on population in 2008. We

highlight the skewed distribution of both green and non-green ARRA, as the median commuting

zone received only $105 and $821 dollars per capita of green and non-green ARRA awards.

       Figures A1, A2 and A3 in Appendix A1 illustrate the geographic distribution of green

ARRA and non-green ARRA. We do not observe any apparent, systematic patterns across

geographic areas, as both areas receiving high per capita amounts (Figures A1 & A2) and areas

receiving large shares of green stimulus (Figure A3) are spread throughout the country (see Table

A2 for a list of commuting zones that received the largest ARRA). Figure 2 shows the correlation

between green (y-axis) and non-green (x-axis) ARRA expenditure per capita for commuting zones

with at least 25000 inhabitants. The bivariate correlation between the two components of ARRA

is positive and somewhat strong (0.339). As such, controlling for non-green stimulus spending in

a flexible way is important to accurately estimate the impact of green stimulus spending. We

discuss our technique for doing so in section IV.

III. Data and Descriptive Statistics

A.     Data

       We combine the ARRA data with data on local labor market conditions. These data include

several control variables designed to serve two purposes. Some controls describe each commuting

zone's potential exposure and resilience to the Great Recession. Others capture the stringency of

environmental policies in the local labor market as well as the relative importance of green versus

non-green employment in the local economy. Here we briefly describe our data on employment

and green skills. Our additional outcome and control variables in the empirical analysis are

collected from standard sources and are described in Appendices A2 and A3.



                                                                        13
       Data on total employment and employment by industry were retrieved from the Quarterly

Census of Employment and Wages by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (QCEW-BLS). These data

report average annual employment by US county and by industry. Data on the occupational

composition of employment by CZ are collected from the 1% sample of the US population of the

annual American Community Survey (ACS), available at IPUMS (Integrated Public Use

Microdata Series, Ruggles et al., 2020). Occupation-level data for working-age population (16-64

years old) are used to build our indicators of occupational composition of the workforce.

       Our measures of green employment and green skills are based on Vona et al. (2018). For

each occupation, the O*NET database provides the tasks expected of workers and the skills needed

to complete these tasks. Tasks are further divided into `general' tasks, which are common to all

occupations, and `specific' tasks that are unique to individual occupations. The greenness of each

occupation is the share of specific tasks that are green (see also Dierdorff et al., 2009, and Vona et

al., 2019). Computing the average of occupational greenness (weighted by sampling weights and

annual hours worked) for each commuting zone provides the number of full time equivalent green

workers in each commuting zone.

       Using O*NET data on the importance of general skills to each occupation, Vona et al.

(2018) identify a set of green general skills (GGS, hereafter "green skills") that are potentially

used in all occupation, but are particularly important for occupations with high greenness. They

aggregate this set of selected green skills into 4 macro-groups: Engineering and Technical,

Operation Management, Monitoring, and Science. To assess the existing base of green skills, for

each occupation we first compute a unique indicator of GGS as the simple average of these four

macro groups. Then, using the distribution (weighted by hours worked) of green skills across

different (448) occupations in 2000 (IPUMS 5% sample of the Decennial Census), we identify the



                                                     14
occupations with green skills importance in the 75th percentile or higher across all US workers.

This includes 113 occupations, which are listed in Table A3 in Appendix A2. Consistent with the

types of skills included in Green General Skills, these occupations include many scientific and

engineering occupations. However, not all jobs using Green General Skills are "green jobs." Green

General Skills are also important in occupations such as physicians, mining machine operators,

and some transportation workers. The key point is that workers in these jobs have the skills

necessary to do the work required of green occupations. We compute the local green skills base in

each commuting zone using microdata from the annual American Community Survey (ACS, years

2005-2017, 1% sample of the US population) from IPUMS. For each commuting zone and year,

we calculate the share of total employees (weighted by sampling weights and annual hours

worked) in jobs at the top quartile of green skills importance.

B.     Descriptive evidence

       To motivate our empirical analysis, here we provide evidence on the relationship between

ARRA spending and per-capita employment growth, rescaled by the population of the CZ in 2008.

Figures 3 and 4 explore simple unconditional correlations between, respectively, green and non-

green ARRA (2009-2012) per capita and employment growth rate for three different time

windows: 2005-2008 (pre-ARRA), 2008-2012 (short term), and 2008-2017 (long term). Overall,

we see a positive but very weak correlation between ARRA spending per capita (both green and

non-green) and pre-ARRA employment growth across different commuting zones. This positive

correlation suggests that the distribution of ARRA spending was not fully random, and that more

stimulus funds may have been awarded to commuting zones less in need of assistance. We test this

relationship between stimulus spending and pre-recession employment growth more formally

further in our regression analysis.


                                                    15
       The unconditional correlations between ARRA spending per capita and employment

growth remain weak even in the short run (2008-2012) and in the long-run (2008-2017). However,

it interesting to note that while in the short run the positive correlation between employment

growth and ARRA is stronger for the non-green component of ARRA (0.137) than for the green

component (0.069), in the longer run the opposite is found. Green ARRA has a positive correlation

(0.118) with long run employment growth, while non-green ARRA has a weakly negative

correlation (-0.054). While the goal of stimulus spending was to create jobs quickly, green ARRA

may have been less effective at rapid job creation. In contrast, green ARRA seems more effective

in strengthening local labor markets in the long-run. We will explore this further in our regression

analysis.

IV. Empirical Strategy

       This section is organized as follows. Subsection A introduces the main endogeneity issues

to estimate the effect of green ARRA on employment. Subsection B discusses our approach to

tackle them, while Subsection C presents key extensions to highlight the mechanisms through

which green spending affects the local economy.

A.     Illustrating endogeneity issues

       ARRA spending has been primarily designed to mitigate the effects of the great recession

on local labor markets. Thus it targets areas hardest hit by the recession and is endogenous by

construction. For green ARRA, identification is complicated by the presence of an additional


                                                                                                       17
source of endogeneity. Given the significant share of green ARRA spending devoted to long-term

investments and research, the allocation of such spending may have followed criteria related to

other structural features of the local economy such as the presence of a federal R&D laboratory or

high-tech manufacturing.

       To illustrate the difference in the allocation of green and non-green ARRA, we examine

the distribution of the two types of spending along the non-green ARRA distribution. Figure 5

reports the deviations from the mean and the standard deviation of green and non-green ARRA

spending per capita relative to the national mean for each vigintile of non-green ARRA spending

per capita. Since non-green ARRA has been directed to areas hardest hit by the recession, the

Figure illustrates the extent to which green ARRA has been allocated following a different

criterion. The left panel of Figure 5 shows that the positive correlation between green and non-

green ARRA masks substantial variation across vigintiles as we observe CZs with low non-green

ARRA and high green ARRA or vice versa. In addition, the right panel suggests that the standard

deviation of green ARRA within each vigintile is very similar across vigintiles with the exception

of the first two vigintiles of non-green ARRA spending and a vigintile in the middle (the 14th). In

our econometric analysis, we will use twenty dummies for non-green ARRA vigintile to make sure

that the effect of green ARRA is not capturing that of other ARRA programs. This particular

functional form to treat non-green ARRA allows testing the robustness of our results to the

exclusion of vigintiles in which the dispersion of green ARRA spending is very high or low or the

correlation with non-green ARRA very high.

       Notes: unweighted vigintiles of non-green ARRA per capita across all CZ. Within-vigintiles average and SD
       is weighted by CZ population in 2008.



       Next, we directly explore the observable characteristics of a CZ that are associated with

green ARRA spending. Strong unbalances in the observable characteristics of CZs receiving

different amount of green ARRA are a red spy of an unbalanced distribution also in unobservables

(Altonji et al., 2005). We consider the association between the log of green ARRA spending per

capita and two sets of covariates that will be used also as controls in our econometric model

presented in the next section. The first set captures the economic conditions in commuting zone 

before the great recessions and are quite standard in the literature evaluating the Recovery

Act (e.g. Wilson, 2012; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2012; Chodorow-Reich, 2019).11 The second set

of variables are more specific to the green economy such as the stringency of environmental

regulation in the local area (Greenstone, 2002), wind and solar energy potential (Aldy, 2013) and

the index of the green capabilities of the workforce described in section III.A (Vona et al., 2018).12

         Table 1 shows that the inclusion of the vigintiles of non-green ARRA is not enough to

eliminate differences in observable characteristics that are significantly correlated with the

intensity of green ARRA spending per capita. The Table also highlights the different sources of

endogeneity in the allocation of green ARRA: CZs receiving more green subsidies are both

stronger in terms of technological expertise (workforce skills for the green economy, higher share

of manufacturing employment and the presence of a federal R&D lab) and weaker in terms of

economic performance (lower average income per capita and higher share of employment in

construction, that was particularly badly hit by the great recession).




11
   We consider both the level and the pre-trends (2005-2007) in several variables such as total employment,
unemployment and employment in different sectors. As in Wilson (2012), we include the pre-sample level (average
2006-2008) and long pre-trends (2000-2007) for the following variables: total employment, employment in health,
public sector and education, employment in manufacturing, construction and extraction, unemployment. We also add
other confounders of local labor market conditions such as pre-sample income per capita, a dummy equal one for CZ
with positive shale gas production and import penetration. See data Appendix A2 for details on data sources and
construction of these variables.
12
   As in Greenstone (2002), we use changes in the attainment status to National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for the six criteria air pollutants defined by the US Clean Air Act (CAA). We classify as nonattainment
commuting zones in which at least 1/3 of the population resides in nonattainment counties. We also add a dummy
variable to identify areas with nonattainment status for at least one of the NAAQS in 2006 and that therefore were
already exposed to stringent CAA regulation. Since wind and solar energy received other types of support from the
federal and state governments, including tax credits and loan guarantees as part of ARRA (Aldy, 2013), we add proxies
for the wind and solar potential interacted by year fixed effects. We include a dummy equal one for areas hosting a
public R&D lab and the log of local population as Vona et al. (2019) shows that is highly correlated with the size of
the green economy in metropolitan areas. Finally, to proxy for the green capabilities of each CZ, we add the share of
workers using intensively green general skills, i.e. skills most relevant in green jobs (see Vona et al., 2018 for details
on the green skill measures). This is computed as the share of workers in the local workforce above the 75th percentile

                 The last diagnostic concerns the presence of pre-trends in our data: the possibility that

       employment growth before the great recession differs depending on the level of green ARRA

       received, even after controlling for observable commuting zone characteristics. We check for pre-

       trends by regressing our main dependent variable used in the econometric analysis of the next

       section, the change in per capita employment from year  to our base year of 2008, on both the log

       of per capita green ARRA spending and the two sets of control variables described above, for the

       years 2005-2007. Regardless of whether we model regional effects through state or census division

       dummies, columns (1)­(3) of Table 2 show that, conditional on our set of controls, more green

       ARRA went to areas with greater growth in total employment before the great recession. This is

       not surprising given that the characteristics that define areas receiving more green ARRA are

       usually thought to be associated with sustained employment growth, such as the presence of an

       R&D lab, of manufacturing activities or of shale gas production. While the coefficient on green

       ARRA is insignificant in our model without any region fixed effects (column 1), note that this is

       largely because the estimates are less precise when omitting these regional effects.

                                                                           22
       Columns (4)­(6) of Table 2 show that the issue of pre-trends is specific to green stimulus

spending. Here, we replace the vigintiles of per capita non-green ARRA with a continuous measure

of per capita non-green ARRA (in logs). State fixed-effects are sufficient to remove the pre-trend

for non-green ARRA spending. Yet the results for green ARRA remain the same: pre-trends are

strongest when including state fixed effects. A likely explanation for this finding is that many

ARRA funds were allocated as block grants to states using pre-existing formulas. As such, the

allocations to states are plausibly exogenous (e.g. Wilson, 2012). However, states have discretion

as to how to allocate these block grants within the state. For instance, states could have prioritized

allocating green ARRA block grant funds to commuting zones that were already "green". Our

results suggest that such targeting of stimulus spending to well-performing areas by state

governments was the case for green stimulus spending, but not for non-green stimulus spending.

State fixed effects identify the effects of ARRA based on within-state variation only, which is not

necessarily exogenous. Division dummies allow for a broader comparison group that is more likely

to be exogenous. Using census division fixed effects, rather than state fixed effects, reduces but

does not eliminate the pre-trends for green ARRA. For this reason, we use division dummies in

our preferred empirical specification.

       While the role of unbalances in the covariates can be mitigated by directly testing the

robustness of the results to the exclusion of areas with shale gas production or R&D labs, the

presence of pre-trends requires greater care to provide an accurate estimate of the effect of green

ARRA on employment. We discuss the possible solution to this problem in the next section.

B.     Estimating equation and instrumental variable strategy

       Our main econometric model is an event-study model that jointly estimates the effects of

green ARRA for years before and after the crisis. The first main advantage of this approach is that


                                                     23
we can explicitly tackle the issue of pre-trends discussed above. The second advantage is being

able to assess whether the effect of green ARRA lasts beyond the stimulus period, possibly

generating a virtuous circle of green investments. Our dependent variable is the long-difference

between our measures of per-capita employment in year t relative to our base year of 2008.13 So

that the value can always be interpreted as growth in employment, we define the dependent

variable as follows:

                  ,                                            ,
         ln ,  =        ,                             =         ,
                                                                                     if t < 2008
                               ,                 ,


                               ,       ,                        ,
         ln ,  =                          =                                          if t >2008
                           ,                     ,              ,


        Using this, we estimate the following equation for the 587 commuting zones in our primary

estimation sample:

                             
( ) =  +                                  +        
                                                +    +  , +  , +  .                                      (1)
                               ,


where  , is an error term, , are period-specific dummies for the vigintiles of non-green

ARRA spending and , are period-specific region fixed effects, i.e. census division fixed effects

in our preferred model and state fixed effects in an alternative specification.

        Importantly, we estimate equation (1) by stacking all years together, but we allow the

coefficient of green ARRA and of all the other covariates, including region fixed effects and the

vigintiles for non-green ARRA to vary only among three periods: the pre-ARRA (2005-2007); the

short-term (2009-2012) and the long-term (2013-2017). This reduces the number of coefficients

to be estimated which is important to assess the role of mediating factors of green ARRA effects,




13
  Employment is either green employment, total employment or employment in a particular sector (construction,
manufacturing, etc.) or occupation (managers, manual workers, etc.). See Appendix A3 for more details on data
sources and measurement of our dependent variables.

                                                         24
such as availability of the right know-how in the local labor market. To visually convey our main

result, we also plot the green ARRA coefficients estimated on a yearly frequency through equation

(1).

       The main variable of interest is green ARRA spending, also rescaled by total population in

2008. While effective green spending spanned several years between 2009 and 2012, nearly all

outlays were announced in 2009 (see, e.g. Figure 2 in Wilson, 2012). Therefore, we build a time

invariant measure of green spending as the total spending across those four years.

       We take a log transformation for both our dependent and main explanatory variable to

account for the skewness in their respective distributions. In all regressions, we cluster standard

errors at the state-level, using the state of the main county in each commuting zone. We cluster at

the state level because of the discretion that state governments have allocating ARRA funds. This

results in slightly more conservative standard errors than if we cluster at the commuting zone level.

We weight observations using population level in 2008.

       Given the unavoidable presence of pre-trends documented earlier, we cannot assume that

the allocation of green ARRA spending to commuting zones is quasi-random, even after including

a rich set of controls given the unbalances in the covariates shown in Table 1. The pre-trend effect

 reflects the presence of unobserved variables that are correlated with both the allocation of


green ARRA and the outcome variables. Thus, we compute the long- and short-term effect of green

ARRA by subtracting its effect before 2008. That is:    and    can be

interpreted as the average effect of green ARRA in the short- or long-run, respectively.

       The credibility of such differences to estimate the effect of green ARRA rests upon an

untestable assumption regarding the functional form of the relationship between employment and

green ARRA. More specifically, interpreting these differences as average short-run or long-run


                                                     25
effects assumes that employment trends (and pre-trends) across different commuting zones are

affected by observable and unobservable covariates in a linear way. As such, the pre-trend in the

effect of green ARRA accurately approximates the counterfactual employment dynamics

conditional on all covariates, in commuting zones receiving a larger fraction of green ARRA. For

instance, the amount of green ARRA received may be a function of the pre-existing size of the

green economy or past government policies in each commuting zone.

        As an alternative identification strategy, we exploit the well-known fact that ARRA

spending was allocated according to formulas that were in use before the passage of the Recovery

Act (see the discussion of Chodorow-Reich, 2018). 14 Importantly, the formulaic instrument has a

typical shift-share structure used in the seminal literature on cross-sectional multipliers (e.g.

Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014). In previous studies, such instrument satisfies the exclusion

restriction of affecting total employment only through ARRA spending because the main source

of endogeneity was the local effect of the great recession.

        Unfortunately, such an instrumental variables strategy is not as clean in the case of green

ARRA, because endogeneity of green ARRA is also related to the persistent effect of pre-ARRA

green spending. In this context, we must be careful in the interpretation of the results obtained

using a similar shift-share instrument; that is: an instrument that combines the initial "share" of

EPA plus DoE spending in the CZ (over total DoE and EPA spending) with the green ARRA

"shift". Such instrument adds an exogenous shock in green expenditures to areas that were already

receiving larger amount of green spending before ARRA. Again, it is crucial that the pre-recession




14
   According to Conley and Dupor (2013), 2/3 of ARRA spending were allocated using such formulaic approach to
privilege shovel-ready projects that have an immediate impact on the economy. For instance, spending in road
construction, education and health were allocated by the Recovery Act using the formulas in place before the act
(Wilson, 2012; Garin, 2018).

                                                          26
effect of green ARRA properly instrumented mimics the effect that pre-ARRA green spending

would have had in the long-run. The problem here is similar to that put forward by Jaeger et al.

(2018) by noting that shift-share instrument conflates short- and long-term effects. We follow their

suggestion and take a "share" far in the past (i.e. an average share of DoE plus EPA spending

between 2003 and 2004), under the assumption that the effect of past spending gradually fades

away. Moreover, the existence of a clear shock eases the interpretation of the pre-crisis effect of

green ARRA, which is similar to the effect of past policy shocks in their setup. However, the

effectiveness of this strategy is limited by the difficulties accurately measuring pre-ARRA green

spending, as explained in the data Appendix A4.

       Overall, both the IV and the OLS solution of the endogeneity problem rest upon the

untestable assumption that the pre-crisis effect of green ARRA is a good estimate of the

counterfactual employment growth, conditional on the covariates. However, while neither solution

is perfect, comparing the OLS and the IV results can be very informative as each approach

minimizes a different source of endogeneity. The IV mitigates endogeneity related to non-random

assignment of green ARRA subsidies but it represents an upper bound, as it may capture the effect

of past and present green ARRA on areas that were already on a green path, i.e. compliers in a

LATE terminology (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). The OLS does the opposite: the effect should be

smaller as it is the average of the exogenous shock on compliers and the endogenous shock on

non-compliers, which is however less likely to conflate the effect of green ARRA with that of past

green policies.

       Finally, the estimates obtained from the above empirical strategy provide the average effect

of green stimulus on total employment. To explore the mechanism through which green stimulus

affects employment, we extend our analysis to test for heterogeneous impacts of green spending.



                                                    27
We do this in three ways. First, we consider whether the existing skill composition in each

commuting zone changes the effectiveness of green ARRA. Second, we estimate separate models

for different sectors and occupations, to ascertain whether there is heterogeneity across different

types of workers. Finally, we assess the distributional effect of green ARRA spending by

estimating the green ARRA impact for different broad groups of workers, such as manual labor.

This exercise will indicate whether skill-biased shifts in labor demand induced by green ARRA

create winners and losers in particular workers' categories.


V.     Results

       This section presents the main results of the paper. Subsection A focuses on the effect of

the green stimulus on total employment. In subsection B, we show that the pre-existing level of

green skills matters. Subsection C presents results by sector. Subsection D explores the

distributional implications of this further, by focusing on the effect of green ARRA on manual

labor. Finally, subsection E reports various robustness checks.

A.     Results on Total Employment

       Table 3 shows four specifications to compare the OLS (columns 1 and 2) and the

instrumental variable (3 and 4) specifications described in section IV.B. We are also interested in

comparing how different ways of modeling regional effects influence the results, thus in columns

1 and 3 we use census division dummies and in columns 2 and 4 state dummies. For sake of

completeness, the Table reports the point estimates of the green ARRA coefficients for the pre-

ARRA period ( ), the short-term ( ) and the long-term ( ). However, the key statistics

of interest are:    and    , which measure the effect of the green stimulus net

of the pre-trend. Our comments focus on these statistics as well as on the corresponding number

                                                    28
of jobs created per millions of dollars spent. Since the quantification of the number of jobs created

is not straightforward as in related papers, we report in Appendix B the arithmetic to translate the

estimated coefficients into number of jobs created.

         We first discuss the selection of a preferred specification among the four presented in the

Table. We find that IV results are larger than the OLS ones, especially when using state dummies

(column 2 vs. 4). However, the precision of the estimated    difference drops

significantly when using census division dummies and the IV (column 3). The lack of precision is

not primarily associated with a weak instrument problem (Angrist and Pischke, 2008)15 and thus

highlights higher heterogeneity in the effect within the compliers. As a further check of the

credibility of the IV strategy, we perform an over-identification test on instruments' exogeneity by

splitting the IV in its two components: EPA spending and DoE spending (the first-stage results are

shown in Table C2 in Appendix C). Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2018) propose to use this diagnostic

for the standard shift-share instrument which is a linear combination of multiple instruments. We

find that only the specification with census division dummies fails to reject the null of hypothesis

that the exclusion restrictions are satisfied (Table C3 in Appendix C). This is consistent with our

previous observation that, since states have discretion in allocating part of the ARRA funds,

controlling for state dummies amplifies the endogeneity problem.




15
  The instruments are not very strong, but the first-stage is above the usual cut-off threshold of 10 (e.g., 12.7 in column
3 and 13.8 in column 4). The full set of first-stage results is contained in Table C1 of the Appendix C.

                Our preferred specification in column (1) indicates that the effect of the green stimulus is

      much stronger in the long- than in the short-run. While definitive explanations for a stronger long-

      run effect are left for future research, potential explanations include government investments

      attracting additional private investments in favored green sectors (Mundaca and Ritcher, 2015) as

      well as administrative delays related the realization of key green programs. 16 The long-term effect,

      net of the pre-ARRA trend, implies that the cost per job of the green stimulus is 67,750 dollars.




      16
        For example, weatherization grants were delayed by (1) requirements that weatherization grants only go to projects
      paying a "prevailing wage" and (2) completing a National Historic Preservation Trust review of renovation plans
      affecting historic buildings (https://abcnews.go.com/WN/Politics/stimulus-weatherization-jobs-president-obama-
      congress-recovery-act/story?id=9780935, last accessed May 14, 2020).

                                                                           30
The creation of 1.47 job per 100K is in the middle of the range of estimates of papers evaluating

other programs of the Recovery Act (Chodorow-Reich, 2019). However, the long-term effect is

statistically different from the pre-ARRA effect only at 10% level (p-value 0.082) and in all three

alternative specifications it becomes statistically insignificant. As a result, although our preferred

estimate appears plausible compared to the previous literature and substantially lower than the

estimate of the green stimulus of the Council of Economic Advisors (2014), we cannot firmly

conclude that the green stimulus boosted job creation in the long-run when focusing on overall

employment.

        We subtract  when interpreting coefficients because the green stimulus was directed to

commuting zones with more sustained job growth before 2008. We acknowledge, however, that

the length of time span used in our estimates is not symmetric before and after the great recession.

Using only three years to estimate the pre-ARRA effect may lead to a misleading estimate of a

long-term pre-ARRA pattern. To shed light on this issue and fully track the time profile of the

green stimulus, we re-estimate our OLS specifications using data from 2000-2017, allowing all

the coefficients of equation (1) to vary yearly. We plot the coefficients as well as the 95%

confidence intervals for green ARRA in Figure 6. For these regressions only, our dependent

                                      
variable is   ,               ,
                                 both before and after 2008, so that we can interpret the
                      ,                   ,


slope of this plot as the effect of green ARRA on the annualized growth rate in per capita

employment between adjacent years. 17 Most notable in this figure is that the pre-trend we observe

(green ARRA going to commuting zones with greater employment growth) begins between 2004




17
  That is, each coefficient represents the effect of green ARRA on per capita employment relative to the base year of
2008. Thus, the difference between the point estimate in any two adjacent years is the effect of green ARRA on the
annual growth rate of employment between those two years.

                                                             31
and 2005. Prior to that, we observe a flat line, so that while per capita employment in areas

receiving more green ARRA was lower than 2008 in the 2000-2004 period, the annualized growth

rate of employment in these commuting zones was no different. This helps support our use of the

2005-2007 period for estimating the pre-trend. Overall, this figure shows that green ARRA

investments reinforced a positive employment growth pattern that emerged just a few years before

the crisis.

B.      The Mediating Effect of Green Skills

        We next ask whether the effectiveness of green stimulus spending depends on the existing

skill base of workers in each commuting zone. The types of skills workers need to work in green

jobs may be different than the skills needed in other sectors. We use the data on green skills

described in section III to identify the share of employment in each commuting zone in occupations
                                                                          32
with green skills importance in the 75th percentile or higher in 2006 (i.e. prior to the recession).

While these jobs need not themselves be green, this captures the local endowment of the types of

skills in high demand in a green economy. One might expect green stimulus to be more effective

in areas with a higher concentration of green skills.

        We augment our baseline model, which already controls for the initial concentration of

green skills in a region, by interacting our green ARRA variables (pre-, short- and long-) with the

share of employment in occupations with green skills importance in the 75th percentile or higher.

Table 4 presents these results, and Figure 7 shows the marginal effect of green ARRA net of the

pre-trend at different levels of initial green skills. The results show the importance of the initial

skill base. Both    and    becomes statistically significant at the 5 percent

level for commuting zones with a sufficiently large base of green skills. Using the specification

with census division dummies, the net effect of green ARRA becomes significant for commuting

zones with a share of green skills above the cutoff of 0.308 in the short-run and 0.249 in the long-

run. 18 The long-term effect at the last quartile of the GGS distribution is 26 jobs created per $1

million (column 1), which is definitely in the upper bound of the range provided by Chodorow-

Reich (2019). The result is even more remarkable by noting the fact that the initial share of

occupations in the upper quartile of GGS importance itself has a large effect on future employment

growth. Recall from Table 1 that the initial share of occupations in the upper quartile of GGS

importance is also strongly correlated with the allocation of green ARRA subsidies. In

combination, these results reinforce our interpretation of the green stimulus as a successful

example of picking the winners.




18
  These thresholds correspond, respectively, to the 97th and 46th percentile of the cross-CZ distribution of our GGS
variable.

C.      Mechanisms

        In this section, we explore further how the green stimulus affects employment by focusing

on specific sectors of the economy. As the effect of the green stimulus is likely to be concentrated

in certain sectors, our analysis will shed light on how green policies reshape the structure of the

local economy. This exercise provides an initial account of the mechanics through which green

ARRA stimulates employment and acts as a validation check that green ARRA really hits these

target sectors. Table 5 considers green employment (the share of specific tasks in each occupation

that O*NET defines as "green", see Appendix A3 and Vona et al., 2018) and four additional

sectors: manufacturing, construction, professional and scientific, and waste management. We

focus on green employment, manufacturing, construction and waste management since they are

                                                                                       35
the activities are most likely to receive green subsidies. We add professional and scientific services

because they make use of Green Skills such as engineering and technical competences that were

shown above to enhance the impact of the green stimulus.

        As expected, the green stimulus has a positive and statistically significant long-term effect

on green employment. While 4.6% of total employment is green, roughly 20 percent of the jobs

created by green ARRA were green. 19 The additionality effect (   ) is large in absolute

term with 2.9 green jobs created per $1 million spent, but statistically insignificant at conventional

level (p-value=0.16). Note, however, that the insignificant effect of the joint test is not because

green ARRA went disproportionately to regions that had a higher share of green jobs, but rather

because of the imprecise negative estimate of the pre-ARRA coefficient. The direct long-run effect

is significant at the traditional 5% level.

        The green stimulus also led to job creation in the construction and waste management

sectors. Of the 14.8 total jobs created per $1 million green ARRA, over half (8.06) are in these two

sectors. This is consistent with green ARRA targeting projects such as building renovation for

energy efficiency, construction of renewable energy projects (e.g., new wind turbines testing

facilities at Clemson University and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center), and remediation of

hazardous waste sites (e.g., a $ 5 million award to support the remediation work at the Vineland

Chemical Superfund Site in New Jersey). Once again, pre-trends are less of concern in these

sectors, as the coefficients of  are statistically insignificant. In contrast, we do not find any

significant effect on manufacturing, although the long-term effect of green ARRA is positive and

significant. In this case, the lack of statistical significance in the additionality effect is associated




19
  4.6% is slightly higher than the estimate of 3.1% provided by Vona et al. (2019) for 2014. This can be due to an
aggregation bias or to the fact that we add three years after 2014. See Appendix A3 for greater details.

                                                           36
            with a positive pre-ARRA effect, meaning that green ARRA reinforced a pre-existing advantage

            in manufacturing. Moreover, despite our finding that the presence of green skills enhances the

            effectiveness of green ARRA investments, we find no evidence of increased employment in the

            professional scientific, and technical services sector.

                     Overall, the green stimulus reshaped labor markets by increasing the size of the local green

            economy as well as employment in construction and waste management. However, the

            distributional effect of the stimulus is less clear. While greener tasks are concentrated in high-skills

            and thus well-paid occupations (Vona et al., 2019), construction and waste jobs may boost the

            creation of jobs that pay less. We explore this issue in the next section.

D. Distributional Effects of Green Stimulus

       Our results for different sectors of the economy suggest that the green stimulus might have

important distributional effects. In this section, we consider whether the effect of green stimulus

varies for different types of workers. We estimate separate models for different broad groups of

workers following a standard grouping in the literature on task-biased technological change

(Acemoglu and Autor, 2011): abstract occupations, service workers, clerical occupations, and

manual labor (see Table A5 in Appendix A4).

       Table 6 shows results for these four occupational groups. The important result here is that

nearly all job creation from green ARRA occurs in manual labor occupations. Recall from column

(1) of Table 3 that $1 million green ARRA created 14.76 total jobs in the long-term. Nearly all of

those (13.74) are manual labor jobs. Interestingly, the pre-trends associated with green ARRA

allocation also appear insignificant (and are negative) when focusing solely on manual labor.

Given the importance of manual labor in the debate on the distributional effects of trade and

technology shocks (e.g., Autor et al., 2013; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020), we provide an in-depth

look at how the green stimulus affected manual labor. Table 7 considers the effect of green ARRA

on manual labor wages (columns 1-3) and on educational attainment of manual workers. First,

column 1 replaces changes in per capita employment as the dependent variable with the average

hourly wage of manual workers. Despite increasing demand for manual labor, green ARRA

investments did not increase the wages of manual workers. In columns (2) and (3), we see that

most of the increase in manual labor jobs occurred in jobs where workers earned less than the US

median wage for all manual workers. This missing wage gains highlight the well-known

deterioration of the bargaining power of manual workers that requires other solutions than public

spending in the green economy. While the manual labor jobs created by green ARRA were not


                                                    39
high-paying jobs, they are not necessarily low skilled jobs. In the last two columns, we see that

most of the increase in manual labor work is among manual workers who have more than a high-

school education. In fact, this is the one group of workers where green ARRA investments created

jobs in both the short term (5.46 jobs per $1 million) and long term (7.44 jobs per $1 million).

While the green stimulus increased demand for manual labor workers, these jobs still required

higher education and were not better paying than existing jobs.

E. Robustness Checks

       Finally, we present a series of robustness checks that address some critical aspects of our

identification strategy (Table 8). Each of these robustness checks uses our preferred specification

using census division fixed effects. In column (1) we exclude commuting zones in the highest and

lowest vigintiles of non-green ARRA spending, as the standard deviation in per capita non-green

ARRA is much higher for these two groups. In column (2), we drop commuting zones from other

potentially problematic vigintiles. Recall that the standard deviation of green ARRA within each

vigintile is very similar, with the exception of the first two vigintiles of non-green ARRA spending

and a vigintile in the middle (the 14th vigintile). We drop those three vigintiles here. Columns (3)

and (4) exclude commuting zones with unbalanced characteristics of some key covariates: those

CZ hosting federal R&D laboratories (column 3) and those with a high level of shale gas activity

(column 4). Finally, our main models exclude commuting zones with less than 25,000 residents in

2008. In column (5) we include those communing zones. Our results are generally robust. The

number of jobs created remains between 11.6 and 21.81 per $1 million green ARRA. The long-

run effect of the stimulus is highest when excluding commuting zones with high levels of shale

gas activity, and lowest when excluding commuting zones with federal R&D laboratories. The

additionality effect (   ) is insignificant when excluding federal laboratories, although


                                                    40
            the direct long-run effect is statistically significant. Pre-trends are insignificant in this

            specification, and are about 20 percent smaller than in our main model.

            VI. Discussion

                     We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the economic effect of green stimulus using

            the historical experience of the American Recovery Act, which represents the largest push to the

            green economy to date. Our results inform both current policy debates and address longer-term

            concerns about job losses in the transition to a green economy. Currently, some environmentalists

            advocate green new deal programs as a win-win solution to both relaunch sluggish economic

            growth in developed countries and to tackle climate change. The Covid-19 lockdown has led to

            calls for large-scale investments in the green economy. While the size of the green stimulus of

                                                                               41
2009 is small compared to what is at stake for a post-Covid-19 recovery, our research highlights

interesting features of a green stimulus that can offer guidance to the design of future green

stimulus programs.

       First, our results suggest green ARRA works more slowly than other stimulus investments.

The long-run effect of green ARRA on total employment is in the mid-range of previous estimates,

with just under 15 jobs created per $1 million of green ARRA. The persistency of the job creation

effect is clearly a positive aspect of the green fiscal stimulus. However, the timing of green

ARRRA's impact differs from previous studies of other ARRA investments, which generally find

short-term effects. For green ARRA, we find little evidence of short-run employment gains. Green

stimulus investments reinforce long-run growth, but alone are not sufficient for a short-term

stimulus. The timing of green stimulus investments has two implications. First, green stimulus

investments appear more effective for reshaping an economy than for restarting an economy.

While our focus is on the potential employment benefits from green investments, future research

should also consider the potential environmental benefits of green stimulus, as the long-run

impacts on employment suggest that green investments lead to durable changes in the green

economy. Second, while beyond the scope of this analysis, it may be that green stimulus

investments need to be combined with other standard short-term responses, such as extensions to

unemployment benefits and financial support to business, to provide immediate impact.

       Second, the impact of the green stimulus becomes much clearer when we explore several

dimensions of heterogeneity. The pre-existing level of green skills matters. Green ARRA creates

more jobs in commuting zones with larger initial shares of occupations that use intensively such

skills. The bottom line is that the green stimulus has been particularly effective in picking winners

­ e.g. enhancing opportunities in communities already in position to support a green economy.



                                                     42
Care must be taken to match green investments to the skill base of the local economy. To support

communities without the required green skills, expanding specific technical programs and

engineering education (the most important green skills) could complement green stimulus

investments. Evaluation of such training programs is left for future work.

       Third, a green stimulus has potential to reshape an economy and thus may have important

distributional effects. Because nearly half of the jobs created by green ARRA investments were in

construction or waste management, green ARRA increases the demand for manual laborers.

Importantly, pre-trends are not an issue when we study how the effect of green ARRA varies across

sectors and occupations. Beyond the direct impacts of a green stimulus, these results also have

broader implications for whether governments can help ease labor market transitions in response

to environmental policy. Recent studies suggest that environmental regulation may reduce jobs in

specific sectors, particularly for lower skilled manual labor (Marin and Vona, 2019; Yip, 2019).

In contrast, subsidies to green infrastructure can benefit unskilled workers and thus may enhance

the political support for other climate policies. However, wage gains did not follow the increase in

the demand of manual tasks in areas receiving higher green subsidies. Exploring whether this is

due to the fact that green jobs in construction are of low quality compared to similar jobs, or to the

widespread deterioration of employment opportunities of the unskilled requires the use of

longitudinal worker-level data and is left for future research.

A2 - Control variables: definitions and data sources

       Data on average annual employment level by county and year is retrieved from the BLS-

QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages of the Bureau of Labor Statistics). County-

level data are then aggregated up at the CZ level. We use BLS-QCEW also to estimate employment

by industry. In all regressions, we account for the base-year (2008) level of CZ employment per

capita by industry as well as the growth in CZ employment per capita (population in 2008) by

industry and total over the period 2000-2007 (pre-trends).

       Data on unemployed persons is obtained from the BLS-LAUS Local Unemployment

Statistics database while data on county-level population and personal income per capita is

retrieved from the database maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

       Data on occupations and skills are based on microdata from the Decennial Census (5%

sample, year 2000) and the American Community Survey (ACS, 1% sample of the US population,

years 2005-2017) available at IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, Ruggles et al.,

2020). We just consider working-age (16-64) employed persons. We allocate worker-level

information to CZs based on the worker's place of work (county place of work: 59.2% of workers;

PUMA place of work: 32.5% of workers) and, when not available, county of residence (8.3% of

workers). Based on the definition of commuting zone, most of these residual workers should be

employed within the same CZ where they reside.

       As described briefly in Section III.A of the paper, we use ACS microdata to build our

indicator of GGS endowment. For all 448 SOC-based occupations, we compute for years 2000

(Decennial Census) and 2005 (ACS) the average importance score of Green General Skills (GGS,

see Vona et al., 2018) using data on tasks and skills from the O*NET (Occupational Information

Network) database (version: 18.0). Based on the national cross-occupation weighted (by sample


                                                   50
weights times hours worked) distribution of GGS importance scores in 2000, we compute the 75th

percentile of the distribution. Then, using data from ACS for 2005, we compute the share of hours

worked by employees in each CZ in occupations above the threshold of GGS (see Table A3) over

total hours worked by employees in each CZ.

           To calculate import penetration, we begin with data at the US-level (year 2005). We

compute sector-specific (4-digit NAICS) import penetration as the ratio between total import of

manufactured products of each sector and total 'domestic use' of products of the same sector

(import + domestic output ­ export). Data on import and export by sector are retrieved from Schott

(2008), while domestic output is retrieved from the NBER-CES database. We then estimate CZ-

level import penetration as the weighted average of sector-specific (4-digit NAICS) national

import penetration, using employment by CZ and 4-digit NAICS sector as weights (source: County

Business Patterns database).

           To account for the presence of shale gas extraction, we obtained geospatial data on shale

gas and oil play boundaries from the US Energy Information Administration. 20 We use GIS to

compute a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CZ overlaps any of the shale oil and gas resources.

Thus, the indicator represents the potential for shale oil or gas activity. To avoid endogeneity, we

do not include actual drilling activity.

           Indicators of wind and photovoltaic energy potential are based on detailed information

from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 21 For wind, this information includes speed and

variability of winds at different heights and for the presence of obstacles. For solar, this

information considers the intensity and slope of solar radiation and for obstacles and terrain slope.

We attribute to each CZ the average indicator of potential for wind and photovoltaic energy

generation, ranging from 1 (low potential) to 7 (high potential).

       We compute two dummy variables to account for the presence of local stringent

environmental regulation to limit air pollution within the Clean Air Act. The dummy variable NA

CAA old standard is set to one if at least 1/3 of the CZ resides in counties that were designed as

nonattainment according to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set in the pre-

sample period: carbon oxide (1971), lead (1978), NO2 (1971), ozone (1979; 1997), particulate

matter <10 micron (1987), particulate matter <2.5 micron (1997), SO2 (1971). The dummy

variable NA CAA new standards, instead, considers recently approved more stringent NAAQS:

lead (2008), ozone (2008), particulate matter <2.5 micron (2006), SO2 (2010).

       Finally, we manually detect the presence of Federal R&D laboratories and state capitals in

each CZ and create two dummy variables.

       Table A4 reports descriptive statistics, weighted by population in 2008, for all our control

variables.

A3 - Dependent variables: definitions and data sources

        Our main dependent variable is the change in total employment per capita (using

population in 2008) compared to the base year 2008. Data on average annual employment level by

county is retrieved from the BLS-QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages of the

Bureau of Labor Statistics). County-level data are then aggregated up at the CZ level. We also use

BLS-QCEW to estimate employment by industry (columns 2-5 of Table 5).

        Our measure of green employment (column 1 of Table 5) is estimated as:

                   , =  × __, , ×  ,

        where:




                                                                 55
           x    is computed as the importance-weighted share of green specific tasks

               over total specific tasks (source: O*NET, version 18.0) in occupation o as in Vona

               et al. (2019);

           x   __, , is the share of hours worked by employees in SOC

               occupation o in CZ i and year t (source: IPUMS-ACS);

           x    , is total employment in CZ i and year t (source: BLS-QCEW).

       Our estimate of green employment is found to be, on average, an upper-bound compared

to recent figures due to possible aggregation bias at the occupational level and to the fact that we

consider three additional years (2015-2016-2017). Our benchmark is Vona et al. (2019), who

estimate green employment using data on `pure' 6-digit SOC occupational classification (775

occupations) from BLS-OES at the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area level. According to

their estimate, green employment accounts for 3% of total US employment in 2006-2014. Our

estimates here, which use 448 occupations in IPUMS-ACS data by commuting zone, suggest that

green employment is 4.6% of total US employment over a similar but slightly longer timeframe.

       An example to illustrate the possible aggregation bias is the following. In ACS the

occupation "17-3020 Engineering Technicians, Except Drafters" is not broken down into its 8 6-

digit occupations. While the average greenness of 17-3020 is 0.16, it includes both 6-digit

occupations with zero greenness (e.g. "17-3021 Aerospace Engineering and Operations

Technicians") and occupations with greenness equal to one (e.g. "17-3025 Environmental

Engineering Technicians"). Clearly, taking the unweighted average, as we did here, over-estimate

the weight given to green occupations that taking the weighted average, as in Vona et al. (2019)

whereby BLS data are available at a more disaggregated level from BLS-OES at the metropolitan

and nonmetropolitan area level. The simple reason for this is that the relative size of green


                                                    56
occupations within a broad category such as "17-3020 Engineering Technicians, Except Drafters"

is smaller than the uniform weights that one would attribute in absence of employment statistics

at a more disaggregated level. We refer the interested reader to Vona et al. (2019) for further

evidence and discussions of the aggregation bias associated with the use of too coarse occupation-

based measure of green employment.

        Occupational groups (Table 6) are identified following the definition provided by

Acemoglu and Autor (2011). The list of SOC occupations (ACS definition) by each macro

occupational group is reported in Table A5. Similarly to the measure of greenness, we compute

the share of hours worked (weighted by sampling weights) by employees in each macro-

occupational group and CZ over the total hours worked in the CZ using data from IPUMS-ACS.

The number of employees by occupational group is then computed as the product between the

share of hours worked in CZ and the total number of employees (BLS-QCEW).

                  In our focus on manual occupations (Table 7), we identify sub-categories of manual

        workers based on data from IPUMS-ACS. We compute the hourly wage (column 1) as the ratio

        between total wages received and total annual hours worked. In column 2 and 3 we use,

        respectively, the share of manual workers with hourly wage above or below US-median hourly

        wage in the US. Finally, in columns 4 and 5 we consider the educational attainment of manual

        workers using information on educational attainment from IPUMS-ACS: we define manual

        workers with high school degree or more as those manual workers that completed at least the 12th

        grade.

A4 ­ Limits of using non-ARRA local spending from USASPENDING.GOV

       Pre-ARRA government spending on the green economy are the most serious candidate to

explain pre-trends in green ARRA. Quality data on green spending before ARRA would enable us

to clearly disentangle the effect of ARRA from that of past government spending. Data on local

government spending are publicly available at USASPENDING.GOV. However, for two reasons

these data are not good proxies of local green spending before ARRA. First, while EPA spending

could be considered as 'green' both during ARRA and prior of ARRA, the same is not true for

DoE. While a very large part of DoE local spending in ARRA goes to fund renewable energy

investments, energy efficiency and other green programmes (Aldy, 2013), much DoE spending in

earlier years was aimed at the exploitation and use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy (Department

of Energy Budget Highlights, various years). More importantly, local spending for assistance

available at USASPENDING.gov (e.g. CFDA Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is

attributed to the prime recipient while sub-awards are consistently recorded only starting from

2010-2012 onwards. As a result, assistance given to local state governments to be distributed to

countries is recorded as fully attributed to the CZ where the state capital is. Despite these important

limitations, we do observe a relatively strong correlation (0.485) between DoE+EPA local

spending per capita in 2005-2007 and DoE+EPA (i.e. green) ARRA spending per capita. Overall,

we can use these data to build our instrument but not as a direct proxy of pre-ARRA spending.

Appendix B ­ Quantification of the green ARRA effects

Because we use a log-log model with per capita variables, interpreting the magnitude of our

coefficients is challenging. However, converting our elasticities to jobs created per million dollars

of ARRA spending produces estimates that are comparable to other papers.

For this conversion, define the predicted value from our model as:

             ,      ,
 , =                  
             ,     ,

                                          
                = +                   +      +   (1)
                                    ,     ,
                                                          


We can add $1 million of green or non-green ARRA and re-calculate:

                 ,     ,
     , =                 
                 ,     ,

                                         + 1    
                   = +                       +    
                                         ,      ,
                                                                


                   +   (2)

Subtracting one from the other gives us:

                        ,     ,     ,      ,
      ,   , =                          +     
                        ,     ,     ,      ,

                              ,     ,
                    =                 
                              ,     ,

                                    + 1   
                    =                         (3)
                                   ,       ,
                                                             


We can re-write the log quotients to simplify further:




                                                     60
                           ,      ,
            ,    ,
                       =            
                           ,     ,

                          = ,    ,    ,  +  , 


                                                             ,
                          = ,    ,  =                           (4)
                                                             ,

Converting to levels, we get:

                                          
                                          , 
                                           ,          ,
                                                  =      (5)
                                                      ,

We want

                                                                      
                               ,              , 
                                               ,
                          ,
                            =          =          1
                       ,
                               ,  ,  ,    ,



Using (3), (4) and (5) we can replace (Y+1/Y) above with the difference of our predicted values

from (3), giving us:
                                                  
                                                      
             ,      , =  ,                   ,      ,                         1


For a given time period (e.g. short-run or long-run), this simplifies to:

                                                
                                                   
                                              ,  ,
                ,       , =  ,                                               1
