                   Financing vs. Forgiving A Debt Overhang



                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the tradeoffs facing creditors of a country whose
debt is large enough that the country cannot attract voluntary new lending.
If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current
income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending
at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to
repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one
that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US
has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for
forgiveness instead.

     The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness
represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the
country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down
their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the
country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to
creditors rather than itself.

     The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both
financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the
country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc.

     Discussion of new approaches to the developing country debt

problem is more intense now than at any time since 1983. Some

proposals, such as the Baker initiative, involve revitalization

and continuation of the 1983 strategy of financing without either

debt forgiveness or change in the nature of claims. Other

proposals, such as the Bradley Plan, call for major debt
forgiveness in an effort to clear the books and restore normal

conditions. In between are a variety of proposals for changing the

character of the relations between debtors and creditors,

including interest capitalization,     lending or debt relief
contingent on world prices, conversion of debt into equity or

equity-like claims, and so on.

     Somewhat surprisingly, this practical discussion is taking

place with little parallel analytical discussion among economists.

While there is a fairly substantial theoretical literature on the

problem of sovereign risk (survey-ed by Eaton, Gersovitz, and

Stiglitz(1986)), the bulk of this literature has focussed either

on the case of creditor rationing of a country that is borrowing

with no existing debt, or the choice by a country whether to repay

or default. The position in the real world, however, is one of

both repayment and new borrowing; countries have arrived in the




                                 1
current situation with a stock of "inherited" debt, which they

cannot fully service without new borrowing. If the countries'

future repayment were not in doubt, they would have no difficulty

in borrowing to service existing debt, but for a group of large

debtors doubt about future repayment is sufficient that only

through extraordinary measures have creditors been induced to

provide new money.

     Now there does exist a small theoretical literature that

bears on the actual debt problem fairly closely. This is the

literature on the problems posed by a debt overhang. By a debt

overhang I mean the presence of an existing, "inherited" debt

sufficiently large that creditors do not expect with confidence to

be fully repaid. The effects of such a debt overhang have been

analyzed in only a few papers, including Sachs (1984,1986) and

Krugman (l985a,1985b). These papers have shown that the presence

of a debt overhang may give creditors an incentive to lend at an

expected loss to protect their existing claims (Sachs 1984;

Krugman 1985a, 1985b). It also shows that there may be a conflict

between creditors' individual and collective interest, and that

free rider problems may compromise the ability to achieve

desirable new lending. On the other hand, the incentives of a

debtor may be distorted by the presence of a debt overhang, and

the distortion will be reduced if creditors provide immediate debt




                                2
forgiveness rather than providing new money and hoping for more

favorable future conditions (Sachs 1986). The debt overhang

approach is highly suggestive of the desirability of innovative

approaches to the provision of funds, and perhaps of changes in

the nature of bank claims on developing countries.

      The purpose of this paper is to provide a synthetic

presentation of the debt overhang analysis that, although
abstract, may help clarify ideas for practical discussion. The

first part of the paper sketches out three examples that are

intended to convey some of the key issues. The second part of the

paper presents a more formal model that focusses on the tradeoff

between new lending and debt forgiveness as ways of coping with a

debt overhang. The third part then examines how changing the

nature of claims might help resolution of a debt overhang.



fl   debt overhang problem: some illustrative examples.


     A debtor country is something like a debtor firm, although

the parallel is not exact. At any given time, the creditors of a

firm view that firm as having a probability distribution over

streams of future earnings, out of which debt service can be paid.

If the present value of the stream of earnings is expected to be

less than the firm's debt, then creditors will not expect to be




                                 3
fully repaid - -   although   they may prefer to wait and see rather

than force the firm immediately into bankruptcy proceedings.

    A country, like a firm, has an expected stream of earnings,

but not all of this stream is potentially available to service

debt. Instead, some fraction of national income represents the

maximum resource transfer that the country can be induced to make.

Loosely, we can think of the expected stream of potential resource

transfers from a country to its creditors as analogous to the

expected stream of earnings of a firm.

     Now the analogy is less than exact, because the potential

resource transfer from a country to its creditors is not really a

fixed number. Instead, the maximum level of resource transfer is

determined ultimately by the country's willingness to pay, which

in turn reflects both rational calculations of the cost of default

and internal political considerations. There is a bargaining

problem between creditors, who would like to get the most possible

out of a country, and the country, which would like to minimize

resource transfer. Some progress has been made on the bargaining

issue, for example by Bulow and Rogoff (1986). However, it is

useful for analytical purposes to put this bargaining issue aside,

and imagine that the rate of resource transfer that is possible at

any point in time is a well-defined number (although perhaps

uncertain ex ante).




                                    4
     If we grant ourselves the enormous simplification of taking

maximum resource transfer as given, we are left with a
straightforward definition of the problem of debt overhang.

country has a debt overhang problem whenthe expected present value

of potential future resource transfers is less than its debt.

     To illustrate the implications of debt overhang, I will

consider three highly stylized examples of the problems that such

overhang can cause. The three examples share a common structure,

in which the action takes two periods. In the first period a

country starts with an inherited debt, all of which (for

simplicity) is due during that period. The country attempts to pay

that debt with resource transfer plus new borrowing. The new

borrowing, in turn, must be repaid with resource transfer in the

second period.

     What happens if a country is unable to repay fully at the

end? For the moment, I will ignore the problem of costs of default

and assume that creditors simply share the maximum resource

transfer the country can make. Thus if the country is unable to

repay fully in the second period, the result is effectively that

part of the debt is forgiven. This shifts the emphasis to the

first period. The key question is whether the country will

experience a liquidity crisis. Will the country be able to attract

new borrowing in order to service its inherited debt? This depends




                                5
on the behavior of lenders. I will assume that lenders are risk

neutral, and face a given opportunity cost of funds on world

markets. An important question is whether creditors are purely

competitive or can operate collusively in their joint interest. We

will consider both cases.



Debt overhang without uncertainty



         Consider first the situation where there is no uncertainty,

i.e. ,    the   potential resource transfers in period 1 and 2 are

known from the beginning. We assume that all of the debt comes due

in period 1, with required debt repayment D; the resource transfer

possible in each period is x1, x2. We let i be the opportunity

cost of funds to lenders.

          Does this country have a liquidity problem? The country can

make repayment of debt equal to x1 out of current resources; if

current debt service exceeds this amount, it must engage in new

borrowing equal to D-x1. Lenders will supply this voluntarily at

their opportunity cost i if they believe that they will be fully

repaid, as they indeed will provided that (l+i)(D -
                                                         x1) < x2, or,
                                     > D. Not surprisingly, there will
equivalently, if x1 +     x2/(l+i)
be no problem of liquidity if the present value of potential

resource transfer exceeds the inherited debt.




                                     6
      Suppose on the other hand that x1 +
                                            x2/(1-1-i) < D. Then the
 country will not be able to meet its debt service. It certainly

cannot borrow the needed resources D -      at   the safe rate, since

it will be seen to be unable to repay its loans in full. Nor can

it attract additional lending by offering an interest rate above

the safe rate. The total resources available for debt repayment in

period 2 are x2, with a present value of x2/(l÷i). Regardless of

the interest rate on period 1 loans, that is what creditors will

get, and it is less than the value of the necessary loans.

     Thus the best that the initial creditors can do is reach a

settlement with the country that immediately reduces the country's

obligations. The mechanics of the settlement are, at this level of

abstraction,   arbitrary.   Any combination        of   rescheduling,

forgiveness of principal, forgiveness of interest, and new lending

at concessional rates will do as long as it brings the actual

resource transfer in line with what is possible.

     In the absence of uncertainty, then, the problem of what to

do about debt overhang would be straightforward. If the country

can pay, there will be no liquidity problem. If it cannot, the

debt must be written down at the outset.



Debt overhang with uncertainty



    Now consider a country that similarly has inherited a debt D,




                                 7
but faces an uncertain future. Either because the world economic

environment is uncertain, or because the country's own economic

performance cannot be predicted, the potential resource transfer

in period 2 is a random variable. To keep things simple, we

suppose that first period resource transfer is a known value x1,

while in the second period the maximum transfer will take on only

one of two values, XG (good case) or x (bad case). In the bad

case, the present value of potential resource transfer will be

less than the initial debt, while in the good case it may be

possible that the debt can be repaid.

     Is this country solvent? This is not a well-defined question.

Unless the present value of resource transfer is less than the

debt in both states, it is simply unknown whether the country can

earn enough to repay its debt. However,we can ask whether the

country will have a liquidity problem, and here there is a

straightforward answer: it will be able to borrow to service its

debt if and only if the expected present value of the resource

transfer is at least as great as the debt.

     To see this, let p be the probability of a good outcome, i-p

be the probability of a bad outcome. What we want to ask is

whether there is an interest rate that the country can offer that

will induce lenders to supply the resources L —   D   -        that are
                                                          x1
necessary to allow debt service. Suppose that the country offers




                                8
an interest rate r on its new borrowing such that L(l+r)
                                                               X.
This is the highest interest rate that makes sense, since the

country cannot even in the best case pay more than this. Then

lenders will receive all of the potential resource transfer in

either state. The expected present value of their receipts will be

[pxc + (l-p)xB]/(1+i). They will be induced to lend if this
exceeds the necessary lending D -
                                      x1. But the condition [px +
(l-p)xB]/(l+i) > D-x is simply the condition that the expected

present value of resource transfer exceed the value of the
inherited debt.

     As long as this criterion is satisfied, the country will be

able to borrow enough to service its debt simply by paying a

sufficiently high interest premium. If it is not satisfied, the

country will not be able to attract voluntary borrowing, and will

thus be unable to service its debt.

     Now if that were that, we would simply see a default whenever

financial markets view a country as having less future ability to

pay than its existing debt. However, it is in the interest of

existing creditors to prevent this. Even without any explicit

modelling of how a liquidity crisis is played out, it seems

obvious that the creditors are not likely to collect the full

potential resource transfer from the country if there is a

disorderly default.Let Z be the present value of what creditors




                                9
expect to be able to collect from a country if there is a

liquidity crisis in period 1; it seems safe to assume that Z < x1

+          +                   < D. Yet it is not necessary that
    [pxc       (lp)xBJ/(l4i)
creditors accept the certainty of loss. Suppose that they are able

to relend enough to the debtor to avert default in period 1, and

postpone the reckoning until period 2. Then if they are lucky,

they may receive full repayment after all; while if they are

unlucky, they will still be better off than if they had allowed a

default to take place immediately.

      We can easily construct a strategy that will achieve this

                                                                    x1 at
                                                            D   -
aim. Let the existing creditors relend the country L =

an interest rate such that L(l+r) =
                                          x.   Then the creditors will

receive all of the potential second period resource transfer in

either state. Viewed in isolation, this will still be a losing

proposition: the expected present value of their receipts will be

                           < L. Thus no lender would voluntarily enter
[pxG +     (lp)xB]/(l+i)
the package if she had no stake in the repayment of the original

debt. From the point of view of the initial creditors, however, a

lending package insures that they receive the full present value

of the country's potential resource transfer, which is more than

they would get without the lending. Thus lending that would be

unprofitable viewed in isolation is worth doing as a way of

defending the value of existing debt.




                                    10
     There are several points worth noting about this kind of

defensive lending scenario, since even this simple an example is

enough to show that several commonly held beliefs about debt

problems are incorrect.

     First, much discussion about the debt problem tries to make a

clear distinction between liquidity and solvency, with the

argument being that new lending to cover debt service is

appropriate for liquidity but not for solvency problems. Even this

simple schematic approach makes clear, however,              that the

distinction is not useful. If we knew that the country could repay

the full present value of its debt - -   or   even if the expected

value of potential payments were large enough - -   the   country could

attract voluntary lending by offering a sufficiently high interest

premium. The inability to attract funds comes because the expected

ability to pay is too low; a liquidity crisis must occur because

of doubts about solvency. As we have just seen, however, the

expectation of insolvency does not prevent new lending from being

in the interest of existing creditors.

     Second, some commentators have pointed to the large discounts

at which developing country debt sells on secondary markets as

evidence that further lending is inappropriate. Clearly in this

model new lending to the debtor would immediately sell at a

discount, since it has an expected present value less than the




                                11
value of the lending. The discount is just another aspect of the

fact that the new lending is unprofitable viewed in isolation. The

point is, however, that it is still worth doing beacuse it does

not take place in isolation; it is essential to the repayment of

existing debt.

     Third, we have seen that it is in the interests of existing

creditors to relend enough to avoid an immediate default on the

part of the country. However, it is only in their .collective.

interest. Any individual.creditor would be better off if it could

opt out of the new lending and let other creditors carry the

burden. Thus we have the free rider problem emphasized by Cline

(1983) and many others. This free rider problem could lead to a

liquidity crisis even though this is not in anyone's interest.

      Fourth, we often ask whether or not the new lending that

takes place to debtors is at concessionary terms or not. The

standard usually used is a comparison with market interest rates.

However, the example makes it clear that the market rate
comparison is essentially irrelevant. From the point of view of

the lenders, the loans yield an expected return less than the

market rate, whatever the face interest rate; thus they will view

this as lending at concessional terms. Whether the interest rate

on the loan is more or less than their opportunity cost of funds

depends on how favorable the good state is. The interest they




                                12
charge is defined by the relationship L(l+r) =         The rate r will
                                                 XG.
exceed i if xG/(l+i) > D-x1, be less than i if xG/(l+i) <

that is, on whether even in the good state the present value of

resource transfer exceeds the opportunity cost of funds.

     This last observation raises a puzzle. The example suggests

that if there is y state in which the present value of resource

transfer exceeds the value of existing debt, the interest rate

charged by creditors on new lending should exceed their
opportunity cost of funds. Presumably for most debtors there is at

least the possibility of such a favorable state; even Bolivia

might discover a valuable, unsuspected natural resource. Yet this

description of creditor behavior seems both wrong in practice and

disturbing; isn't there any circumstance under which new lending

(or rescheduling of existing debt) will take place at concessional

rates? To develop any motivation for debt forgiveness, we need to

have an example in which creditors have to be concerned about the

incentives they give the debtor.



Incentive effects



     In the last example, creditors have an incentive to lend to

the debtor, even at an expected loss, as a way to defend the value

of their existing claims. However, their incentive is to lend at

the highest interest rate that could be paid, even in the most




                                   13
favorable state of nature; only in this way can they insure that

they collect the maximum resource transfer from the country. In

effect, while the creditors are taking an expected loss, they will

have an incentive to provide financial relief to the country

entirely through new money rather than through interest rate

reduction. Indeed, as long as there is any state of nature in

which the present value of resource transfer exceeds the value of

inherited debt, the creditors will charge an interest rate that is

higher than their opportunity cost of funds.

     In order to soften this result, we need to take into

consideration the effect of the debt burden on the incentives

facing the debtor. In the real world there are a variety of

actions that debtors can take which affect their future ability to

make resource transfers: exchange rate adjustment, investment,

budget policies, and so on. Let us summarize these policies under

the vague heading of "adjustment effort". Then creditors will want

a country to make as much adjustment effort as possible, certainly

more than the country would like to undertake. Now suppose that

the debt burden on a country is as large as the maximum that the

country could possibly pay, even with maximum adjustment effort.

Then there is in fact no reason for the country to make the

adjustment effort, since the reward goes only to its creditors. It

makes sense, therefore, for the creditors to demand less than this




                                14
maximum, in order to provide the creditor with some incentive to

adjust.

     For our third example, we consider the extreme case where the

potential resource transfer depends only on the action of the

debtor, and not at all on the state of nature (this is the case

considered by Sachs (1986)). In period 1, as always, there is a

debt service requirement D and a known maximum resource transfer

x1. Creditors thus must lend D-x1 to prevent a liquidity crisis.

In the second period, however, the potential resource transfer

depends on the adjustment effort. If the adjustment effort is

high, maximum resource transfer is xH; if it is low, xL. Other

things equal, the debtor would prefer to make the lower adjustment

effort.

     The maximum interest rate that could conceivably be paid is

defined by L(l+r) = x.fl.   If the creditors charge this interest

rate, however, the debtor will have no incentive to make the high

adjustment effort. It may thus be in the interest of creditors to

charge an interest rate sufficiently low that the debtor makes the

higher adjustment effort. If there is a liquidity problem, and no

uncertainty, the optimal interest rate in the absence of

uncertainty must be one that is below the market rate i.

     Several observations follow from this example. First, we note

that charging an interest rate that is below the maximum resource




                                15
transfer and below the market rate is actually in the interest of

the creditors. If we compare the value of their claims with the

optimal interest rate with the value with a higher interest rate,

we will find that reducing the face value of loans actually raises

their market value.

     Second, this example suggests both the motivation for

conditionality and the problems of enforcing it. The creditors

would like to impose a requirement for high adjustment as a

condition for the loan -   - in   which case the interest rate could be

higher. On the other hand, the threat not to lend if the country

fails to act correctly may be hard to establish credibly, since it

remains in the interest of the creditors to avoid provoking a

liquidity crisis.

     Third, while debt forgiveness may be desirable from the point

of view of creditors as a way of creating incentives, it is

clearly a blunt instrument for this purpose. The example

immediately suggests that loans are the wrong form of claim; some

form of contingent claim would be preferable. (The specification

of the optimal claim is left to the more elaborate discussion

below).

     We have now gone about as far as we can with simple examples.

In order to integrate the insights from these examples, we now

turn to a formal model.




                                    16
2. A formal model of debt overhang



     As in the simplified examples, we consider a country that has

inherited a stock of debt D, all of it due in the first of two

periods. In period 1 the country can make a known maximum resource

transfer x1. In period 2 the country's resource transfer potential

is unknown, so that




(1) x2s+z

where s is a random variable that ranges from s to s and z is a

choice variable capturing the concept of "adjustment effort" by

the debtor country.

     The country is assumed to care about two things: the level of

resources left to it in the second period, and the size of the

adjustment effort it is required to make. Let C2 be the difference

between the country's potential resource transfer x2 and the

actual payment it must make to creditors:



(2) C2 =        -   P
           x2



     For simplicity, and to avoid mixing insurance issues into our




                                17
analysis, the country's objective function will be assumed linear

in C:




(3) U =
            C2
                     -
                         v(z)               v'>O, v''>O



where the function v(z) captures the dislike of the country for

making adjustments that enlarge its future ability to pay
creditors.

        Suppose that the creditors are able to overcome the free

rider problems we mentioned in the previous section and lend

enough to avert default in the first period. Then it follows that

first period lending will be equal to the difference between

maximum potential debt service and the value of the debt,

        Suppose that the creditors have charged an interest rate r on

their new lending. If potential resource transfer exceeds L(l+r),

the loan will be repaid in full. If it does not, we assume that

the creditors will receive the maximum possible, so that



(5) P =
            x2 if x2 < L(l-i-r)
        =   L(l+r)         if x2 > L(l+r)




                                            18
     We can now think of this as a game in which the creditors

fir;t choose the interest rate, then the debtor chooses the level

of adjustment effort. To solve this game, we first solve the

debtor's problem conditional on the interest rate. From (3) and

(5) we derive the expected utility of the country:



(6) EU        J[(s+z) -     L(l+r)]f(s)ds         -
                                                      v(z)
         L(l+r)-z



     An increase in the adjustment effort z raises the resources

of the country in favorable states when it does not have to pay

all of its potential resource transfer to the creditors, but is

costly in and of itself:



(7) 8EU/Bz =         Jf(s)ds     -
                                     v'(z)
               L(l+r) -z



If the effort level has an interior maximum, we must have ÔEU/8z=O

and 32EU/3z2 < 0, where



(8) 32EU/3z2 =   f[L(l+r)   -
                                z]   -
                                         v''(z)

    We now want to calculate the response of adjustment effort to

the interest rate charged by creditors. To do this we first




                                          19
calculate the cross-derivative



(9) 82Eu/azar        -
                             L[L(l-i-r)   -
                                              z]   < 0



     Then we use the implicit function theorem to derive the

response



(10) dz/dr          Lf[L(1+r) -           z]/(32EU/8z2)     <0



     Thus the higher the interest rate, the lower the country's

adjustment effort.

     The objective of the creditors is to maximize the expected

value of their new lending. From (5)


            L(1+r)-z                                    s
(11) ER =       f(s+z)f(s)ds +                L(l+r)$f(s)ds
            S                                  L(1+r)-z



     The creditors' first-order condition is therefore

                         S           L(1+r)-z
(12) 3ER/Br =       LJf(s)ds + (dz/dr)Jf(s)ds               = 0
            L(l+r)-z                               s




     This condition clearly indicates the two motives facing the

creditors. The first term, which is always positive, is the




                                                   20
 "new-money" bias imparted by the presence of uncertainty. Since

 something may always turn up that allows the debtor to pay more

 than you expected, creditors have an incentive to roll over debt

at as high an interest rate as possible in order to be able to

benefit from good news. The second term, which is always negative,

represents the "debt forgiveness" bias imparted by the problem of

incentives for the debtor. Creditors do not want to make the

country's situation too hopeless, or it will have no incentive to

improve its ability to repay.

     If the situation were dominated only by one or the other

consideration, the choice between new money and debt forgiveness

would be clear. If uncertainty were the only issue, it would

always be best for creditors to finance but not forgive, so as to

preserve the option of cashing in on unexpected good fortune. If

incentives were the only issue, it would on the contrary be best

for creditors to take their loss up front so that it does not act

as a prohibitive tax on debtors' effort. Unfortunately, in reality

both issues are present, so that the choice of the right strategy

is not an easy one.

     The dilemma presented by this tradeoff, however, is not

inescapable. It is due to the fact that both new money and debt

forgiveness are rather blunt instruments for dealing with the

problem of debt overhang. Can an innovative repayment scheme, one




                                21
that effectively changes the nature of claims, do better? In

principle, at least, it can.



3. Changing the nature    claims



     A number of proposals have been advanced for converting debt

into some other kind of claim. The proposals range from piecemeal

debt-equity conversions, to Bailey's (1982) proposal to convert

debt to proportional claims on exports, to proposals that either

interest rates or new lending be indexed automatically to prices

of exports. The approach taken inthis paper cannot do justice to

the details of such schemes, since it treats the real economy as a

"black box" out of which resources are somehow extracted.

Nonetheless, it is possible to capture some of the spirit of

innovative proposals by considering schemes in which the required

repayment depends on the size of the potential resource transfer.

     We may divide proposals to change the nature of claims into

two broad classes. First are schemes that link repayment to some

general measure of ability to repay. The best-known examples are

proposals that debt repayment beproportional to export revenues.

The key point about these schemes is that they make no distinction

between favorable results due to national effort and those due to

factors outside the nation's control. On the other side are




                                   22
proposals to link repayment to some measure of the shocks

experienced by a country, such as the level of world interest

rates or the price of the country's principal export good. These

two kinds of proposal are quite different at least in principle.

     There is a further distinction within these proposals between

debt postponement and debt forgiveness. Most proposals that link

repayment either to ability to pay or to the state of nature do

not, at least on paper, reduce the eventual obligation of a

country to pay: the obligation is simply rescheduled, at market

interest rates, into the future. However, it will be easier

analytically to imagine that what is at stake is immediate debt

forgiveness. We can then ask whether debt postponement is similar

in its implications.



Repayment linked to ability to repay



     Suppose that we have a country exactly like that described in

the previous section, but the its creditors take an innovative

approach to its problem. Instead of lending it the money needed to

service its debt, they establish a claim that varies with the

ability to repay. We can approximate such a scheme by supposing

that repayment is a function of second-period potential resource

transfer:




                               23
(13)P—A+Bx2                  O<B<l

     Does such a scheme resolve creditors' conflict between taking

advantage of good news and providing debtors with an incentive to

adjust? Unfortunately, it does not. Consider the first-order

condition of the debtor. Given the repayment schedule, the

difference between potential and actual resource transfer will be



            -A +
(14) C2            (l-B)x2

Thus the debtor will maximize




(15) EU =   f   [-A +   (l-B)(s+     z)Jf(s)ds -   v(z)


with the first-order condition



(16) 8EU/3z =   (1-B)    -
                             v'(z)   = 0



This condition may be interpreted as follows: the country receives

only a fraction (1-B) of the benefit from any improvement in its

resource transfer capacity. There is a tradeoff in substituting a




                                           24
claim contingent on ability to repay for a simple loan: it is no

longer the case that in bad states of natureextra adjustment

effort provides no benefit to the debtor, but the benefit it

receives in good states is diluted. It is unclear without a

detailed model of the economy which will distort incentives more.

        This analysis shows that proposals to link repayment to

exports or other measures of capacity to repay do not eliminate

the problem of incentives, and therefore do not eliminate the

tradeoff between new money and debt forgiveness. Notice, however,

that while this is the only issue that can be addressed in the

stylized framework presented here,         in practice   exchange

participation notes or other schemes might still be valuable for

other reasons, for example as a way to allow debt service to rise

over time in line with economic growth and inflation.



Payment linked to the state of        nature



        The alternative class of proposal would link repayment to

sonic   measure of the state of nature. An ideal measure would

separate perfectly between the consequences of the country's

effort and events outside its control; it is easiest to

concentrate our formal analysis on this case, then discuss how the

imperfection of real measures affects the argument.




                                 25
     In the context of our formal model, the form of an optimal

scheme is obvious: it would appropriate all of the gains that

result from the state of nature s, but none of the consequences of

the effort level z:



(17) P A + s


     The resulting first-order condition will be



(18) 3EU/Bz   1 -   v'(z)   0



Thus the distortion in the country's incentive to adjust is

completely eliminated.

     For the creditors, the degree of freedom in the scheme would

be in setting the constant term A. At first glance, it might seem

that the creditors could set A equal to the optimal z, so that

they would provide the debtor witha marginal incentive to adjust

yet in the end capture all of the debtor's potential resource

transfer by the debtor. This may look too clever to be real, and

it is. In addition to satisfying the marginal conditon (18), the

debtor's choice of adjustment effort must be globally optimal. If

there is no gain from adjusting, the debtor will be better off

choosing its own preferred level of effort and simply defaulting




                                26
on the payment scheme (17). Thus the expected resource transfer

that can be extracted from the country will be limited by the need

to provide enough incentive for the country to participate in the

debt initiative. This constraint is not, however, unique to

state-contingent schemes. The only unique feature is that a

perfect state-contingent sheme would extract from the country less

than its maximum reasource transfer in all states of nature, even

the least favorable.

    It is clear from the analysis that an ideal state-contingent

scheme should be able to do better than either a simple loan that

will probably not be repaid in full or a claim linked to broad

ability to repay. In reality, of course, a scheme will be less

than ideal, if only because the state of nature cannot be fully

specified. For example, repayment might be linked to the price of

the country's principal export, but shocks arising from weather

fluctuations might not be included. What this imperfection will do

is to blur the effectiveness of the state-contingency in

eliminating incentive problems. There will be some states of

nature in which the country will be unable to meet its
obligations, even though these will in principle be indexed to the

state of nature. At the margin, an improvement in the country's

ability to pay will in these states of nature benefit only the

creditors, not the country; thus the country's incentive to adjust




                               27
will be diluted. Clearly, however, the dilution will be less if

the obligations at least somewhat reflect the state of nature than

if they do not. So an imperfect state-contingent claim is

stilibetter than a claim that is not state-contingent at all.



Debt postponement



     So far we have discussed only schemes that link debt

forgiveness to either ability to pay or the state of nature.

However, the more immediate issue is one of proposals to link new

money to export revenues or export prices. Is this something

completely different, or is the analysis similar?

    The essential point here is that once we are in a situation

of defensive lending by existing creditors, the creditors do not

expect to be fully repaid --   nor do the debtors expect to pay
fully. Thus new money contains a concessional element, even if it

does not do so on paper. As a result, the same considerations that

apply to eventual forgiveness also apply to new money.

     Consider an extension of our basic model to three periods. In

period 1 the country makes a decision about adjustment effort,

which affects maximum resource transfer in period 2; ability to

repay in period 3 is also uncertain. Then any relief from the

burden of resource transfer in period 2 will not be fully offset




                                28
by an increase in the expected burden in period 3. Itfollows that

the incentive to adjust initially will depend on the conditions

attached to new money in period 2. If creditors will demand the

maximum possible resource transfer regardless of the state of

nature, there will be noincentive to adjust. If, on the contrary,

new lending is linked to the state of nature, so that adjustment

effort at the margin benefits the country rather than the

creditors, the incentive to adjust will be greater.

     Although the analysis is highly abstract, then, we seem to be

left with a clear conclusion: linking either eventual repayment or

new money to measures of the state of nature is a good idea.



4. Concluding remarks



     This paper has presented a highly abstract analysis of the

issues involved in dealing with the developing country debt

problem. I have argued that the best way to think about that

problem is as one of debt overhang: the 'tinherited debt" of some

countries is larger than the present value of the resource

transfer that their creditors expect tham to make in the future.

    Much popular discussion seems to presume that the appropriate

handling of a debt problem is simply contingent on the
distinctione between liquidity and solvency. If it is a liquidity




                                29
problem, financing should be provided until the country has worked

its way out; if it is a solvency problem, some kind of bankruptcy

procedure is called for. What even a highly abstract analysis of

the debt overhang problem shows is that this is a misleading way

to view the issue. There is no such thing as a pure liquidity

problem; it must arise because of doubts about solvency. Even if

there is a significant possibility that debt will not be repaid in

full, however, it may still be in creditors' interest to provide

enough financing to avert an immediate default. As is fairly

widely appreciated, however, there is a conflict between the

collective interest of creditors in providing financing and the

individual interest of each creditor in getting out.

     The choice between financing and debt forgiveness should not,

according to the analysis presented here, hinge on some attempt to

settle the liquidity vs. solvency question. Instead, it represents

a tradeoff between the option value of a large nominal debt and

the incentive effects of a debt that is unlikely to be repaid.

Since good news is always possible, creditors would like to keep

their claims high, so that if by some chance a country should turn

out to be able to repay, they will not turn out to have forgiven

debt unnecessarily. On the other hand, if a country is not going

to be able to repay except in exceptional circumstances, it will

have little incentive to try to adjust. Thus creditors may wish to




                                30
forgive part of a country's debt to increase the likelihood that

it will repay what remains. It is because of the tension between

these two objectives that the issue of how much to rely on debt

forgiveness and how much to rely on financing is a difficult one.

     There seems to be a compelling case that the tradeoff between

forgiveness and financing can be improved by indexing repayment to

the state of nature. If paymentis linked to some measure of

conditions outside the country's control,the probability for any

given expected payment that adjustment effort will at the margin

benefit the country, not its creditors, will be increased. Thus

the analysis in this paper, abstract though it is, does suggest

that linking new money and possibly debt relief to measures of

economic conditions could be to the mutual benefit of debtors and

their creditors.
