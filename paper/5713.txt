                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper applies the rational addiction model, which emphasizes the interdependency          of
past, current, and future consumption      of an addictive good, to the demand for cocaine by young
adults in the Monitoring the Future Panel. The price of cocaine is added to this survey from the
System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) maintained by the Drug Enforcement
Administration     of the U.S, Department of Justice.     Results suggest that annual participation   and
frequency of use given participation are negatively related to the price of cocaine. In addition current
participation is positively related to past and future participation, and current frequency of use given
participation is positively related to past and future frequency of use. The long-run price elasticity
of total consumption      (participation   multiplied   by frequency   given participation)   of -1.18 is
substantial.     A permanent   10 percent reduction in price due, for example, to the legalization     of
cocaine would cause the number of cocaine users to grow by slightly more than 8 percent and would
increase the frequency of use among users by a little more than 3 percent. Surely, both proponents
and opponents of drug legalization should take account of this increase in consumption        in debating
their respective positions.

        The period from the late 1980s to the present has witnessed a lively debate concerning the

costs and benefits of legalization of such substances as cocaine, marijuana, and heroin.

Legalization of these hatilly       addictive goods surely will reduce their prices. 1 By the law of the

downward-sloping     demand function, their consumption will rise. Prices will also fall and

consumption will rise if these substances remain illegal, but resources allocated to enforcement

activities are permanently lowered.     But by how much will consumption rise? According to

conventional wisdom, which is adopted by some proponents of legalization, the consumption               of

these illegal addictive substances is not very responsive to price. Opponents of legalization argue

that consumption    may be quite responsive to price based in part on research on the demand for

two widely used legal addictive substances--alcohol      and cigarettes--particularly   by teenagers and

young adults.2

        The conventional wisdom that the demand for addictive substances is not sensitive to price

also is contradicted by Becker and Murphy’s (1988) theoretical model of addictive behavior

which assumes that addicts behave rationally. The main element of this and other models of

addictive behavior is that an increase in past consumption of an addictive good raises the marginal

utility of current consumption    and therefore raises current consumption.      A key feature of the

Becker-Murphy      model which distinguishes it from other models of addictive behavior is that

addicts are rational or farsighted in the sense that they anticipate the expected fiture

consequences of their current actions. This is in sharp contrast to myopic models of addiction in

which consumers ignore the effects of current consumption on fiture utility when they determine

the optimal or utility-maximizing     quantity of an addictive good in the present period.

        The Becker-Murphy        model predicts intertemporal complementarily      of consumption   or

negative cross price effects and a long-run own price elasticity of demand which exceeds the
short-run elasticity (the former allows past consumption to vary while the latter does not).

Intertemporal    complementarily    arises because increases in past or fiture consumption (caused by

reductions in past or fiture prices) cause current consumption to rise. Put differently, the

reitiorcement    property of an addictive good, which is emphasized by psychologists, suggests that

an increase in past consumption raises the marginal benefit of current consumption.        By symmetry,

an increase in fiture consumption also raises the marginal benefit of current consumption.

Reinforcement     produces the gap between the long-run and short-run price elasticities.     Since this

property does not hold for a non-addictive good, the long-run price elasticity of demand is

expected to be larger for addictive than for non-addictive goods.

        The purpose of this paper is to inform the debate on legalization by providing estimates of

the price elasticity of demand for cocaine consumption      in the context of the rational addiction

model. These estimates also are usefil in evaluating policies such as crop reduction and criminal

justice that raise price. There are few previous empirical studies in this area, and no previous

attempts to study the demand for illegal drugs with a panel of individuals in the context of rational

addiction because data on prices and quantities consumed of illegal drugs have been dificult to

acquire. The data employed in this study consist of the panel formed from the nationally

representative   cross-sectional   surveys of high school seniors conducted each year since 1975 by

the Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan as part of the Monitoring the

Future research program,      The members of the panel range in age from seventeen through twenty-

nine. Since the prevalence of cocaine consumption        is highest in this age range, and few people

initiate use afier age twenty-nine (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1991), information on the

responsiveness to price in this segment of the population is crucial in evaluating the impacts of


                                                     2
alternative price policies in all segments of the population.   The price of cocaine is taken from the

System to Retrieve Ifiorrnation     from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) database maintained by the Drug

Etiorcement    Administration   of the U, S. Department of Justice,

        We find that cocaine consumption by young adults is addictive in the sense that increases

in past or fiture consumption     cause current consumption to rise. The positive and significant

fiture consumption    effect is consistent with the hypothesis of rational addiction and inconsistent

with the hypothesis of myopic addiction.     The long-inn price elasticity of-1,18   is substantial and

approximately 70 percent larger than the short-run price elasticity.




                                             1, Prior Studies

        Prior to the 1990s, there were very few studies on the effects of price on the use of

cocaine, marijuana, heroin, or other illegal drugs. Nisbet and Vakil (1972) report a price elasticity

of demand for marijuana ranging from -0,36 to -1.51 in an anonymous mail sumey of students at

the University of California at Los Angeles,    Silverman and Sprull (1977) estimate the price

elasticity of demand for heroin in an indirect manner from the relationship between crime and the

price of heroin in a monthly time series of forty-one neighborhoods in Detroit.      They obtain an

elasticity of-0,27.

        DiNardo (1993) studies the effect of cocaine price on cocaine use in the past month using

the 1977-1987 Monitoring the Future high school senior surveys. Our panels are formed from

these baseline surveys, DiNardo did not have access to the individual data, and his results are

based on aggregations   to the state level. Thus, his outcome is the fraction of high school seniors

in a state who used cocaine in the past month in a time series of state cross sections.    This


                                                    3
outcome is not sensitive to the price of cocaine. van Ours (1995) examines the demand for opium

in Indonesia from 1923 through 1938, and Liu, Liu, and Chow (1996) perform a similar analysis

of the demand for opium in Taiwan from 1914 through 1942. By allowing present consumption

to depend on past consumption,     these two studies are the only ones to explicitly allow for

addiction. van Ours obtains a substantial long-run elasticity of-1.00,    which is approximately 40

percent larger than the short-run price elasticity.   He also estimates an elasticity of the annual

number of opium users with respect to price that ranges from -.30 to -.40        Liu, Liu, and Chow

also obtain a substantial long-inn elasticity of-1.22,    which is over 300 percent larger than the

short-run elasticity. Neither study finds evidence of rational addiction because the coefficient of

fiture consumption is not significant when this variable is included in the demand finctions.3

        Saffer and Chaloupka (1996) consider monthly and annual cocaine and heroin

participation (use in the past month or use in the past year) as outcomes in the 1988, 1990, and

1991 National Household Surveys of Drug Abuse conducted by the National Institute of Drug

Abuse. The past year cocaine participation elasticity with respect to its price is -0.44, and the

corresponding   elasticity for heroin is -0.82. The price elasticities for participation in the past

month are -0.28 in the case of cocaine and -0,94 in the case of heroin. Using the percentage of

arrestees testing positive for cocaine and heroin in the Drug Use Forecasting System and specific

assumptions about the relationship between drug use and the probability of arrest, Caulkins

( 1996b) estimates price elasticities of demand of-2.50     for cocaine and -1.50 for heroin.

Bretteville-Jensen   and Sutton ( 1996) study the price responsiveness    of heroin in a sample of 500

users in Oslo, Norway,    Unlike the other studies conducted in the 1990s, they rely on self-




                                                      4
reported price data. They find a price elasticity of demand of-1.23 for non-dealing users (66

percent of the sample) and a price elasticity of demand of-0.20 for users who are also dealers.~

          Between 1973 and 1978, eleven U.S. states enacted laws that decriminalize the possession

of small amounts of marijuana.     Although the possession and use of this substance is not filly

legal in these states, first offense possessions are civil (not criminal) offenses with small fines of

typically less than $100 for possession of less than one ounce, Thus, the enactment of these laws

reduced the “fill price” of marijuana, defined as the sum of the money price and the expected

penalty for possession.    Johnston, Bachman, and O’Malley(1981 ) find no effect of

decriminalization   on marijuana use in the 1975-1989 Monitoring the Future high school senior

surveys and in the panels formed from the first two surveys. DiNardo and Lemieux (1992) report

a similar finding in the time series of state cross sections formed by DiNardo (1993) from

Monitoring the Future as described above. Theius and Register (1993) replicate this result in the

National Longitudinal     Survey of Youth.   On the other hand, Model (1993) finds that

decriminalization   increased use based on hospital emergency room episodes related to marijuana

in the Drug Abuse Warning Network.

          The Becker-Murphy    (1988) rational addiction model has been applied successfully to the

demand for cigarettes byChaloupka(1991);         Keeler, Hu, Bamett, and Manning (1 993); and

Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1994),         It also has been applied successfully to the demand for

alcohol by Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1996) and to the demand for gambling by Mobi[ia

(1990).   All these studies report negative and significant price effects, positive and significant past

and fiture consumption     effects, and larger long-run than short-run price elasticities.
                                      II. Analwical Framework

        Following Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1994), we assume that consumers maximize a

lifetime utility finction given by

                             m t-1
                         V=X     ~ U(Yt, Ct, Ct ~, et).                                            (1)
                            t= 1

Here Yt is consumption    of a non-addictive good at time or age t, C, is consumption      of an

addictive good (cocaine in our case) at age t, Cl.l is cocaine consumption    at age t-1, et reflects the

effects of unmeasured life cycle variables on utility, and ~ is the time discount factor

[~= 1/(1 + r), where r is the rate of time preference for the present].5 An increase in lagged

cocaine consumption (Ct.1) lowers utility if the addiction is harmful (8U/~t.l    < O), while an

increase in the lagged consumption raises utility if the addiction is beneficial (~U/Mt.l > 0), In

this paper, presumably, the partial derivative just defined is negative, although the model simply

assumes that this term is nonzero.   Regardless of the nature of the addiction, an increase in past

consumption    must raise the marginal utility of Ct in order for an increase in past consumption of

C to increase current consumption.

        When the utility finction is quadratic and the rate of time preference for the present is

equal to the market rate of interest, equation (1) generates a structural demand finction for

consumption   of C of the form

                C,= eC,.1 + ~9C,+l + elPt + ezel + O~et+l.                                         (2)

Here P~is the price of C,, and the intercept is suppressed.   Since 8 is positive and 81 is negative,

current consumption is positively related to past and fiture consumption     (Cl. 1and Ct+l,

respectively) and negatively related to current price. In particular, 0 measures the effect of an


                                                   6
increase in past consumption      on the marginal utility of current consumption.    By symmetry, it also

measures the effect of an increase in fiture consumption on the marginal impact of current

consumption on next period’s utility. The larger the value of 6 the greater is the degree of

reitiorcement   or addiction.

        Equation (2) is the basis of the empirical analysis in this paper, Note that ordinary least

squares estimation of the equation might lead to biased estimates of the parameters of interest.

The unobserved variables that affect utility in each period are likely to be serially correlated,       Even

if these variables are uncorrelated,     Ci.1 and Cl+l depend on el and el+l through the optimizing

behavior.   These relationships imply that an ordinary least squares estimation of the equation

might incorrectly imply that past and fiture consumption affect current consumption,          even when

the true value of e is zero, Fortunately,     the specification in equation (2) suggests a way to solve

the endogeneity problem.        The equation implies that current consumption is independent of past

and fiture prices when past and fiture consumption are held constant; any effect of past or future

prices on current consumption       must come through their effects on past or fiture consumption.

Provided that the unobservable         are uncorrelated with prices in these periods, past and fiture

prices are logical instruments for past and future consumption, since past prices directly affect

past consumption,    and fiture prices directly affect fiture consumption,      Therefore, the empirical

strategy amounts to estimating equation (2) by two-stage least squares, with past and future

prices serving as instrumental variables for past and fiture consumption.

        This strategy can be modified when measures of some of the life cycle events that affect

utility and therefore partially determine Q, such as marital status and unemployment,        are available,

If &U/~%+l~t.equals      zero, while &U/~e~Nt is nonzero, Cl depends on et but not on ei+l in


                                                       7
equation (2). Then current marital status, for example, is a relevant regressor in the structural

demand finction given by equation (2), and past and fiture marital status are instruments for past

and fiture consumption,

        The statistical significance of the coefficient of fiture consumption       provides a direct test

of a rational model of addiction against an alternative model in which consumers are myopic. In

the latter model they fail to consider the impact of current consumption         on fiture utility and

fiture consumption.         That is, the myopic version of equation (2) is entirely backward looking.      In

it current consumption depends only on current price, lagged consumption,            the marginal utility of

wealth (which is one of the determinants of the current price coefficient), and current events,

Because of these distinctions, myopic models and rational models have different implications

about responses to fiture changes,        In particular, rational addicts increase their current

consumption when fiture prices are expected to fall, but myopic addicts do not.

        Equation (2) implies intertemporal complementarily          or negative cross price elasticities

between cocaine consumption at various points in time. These effects pertain to changes in the

price of cocaine in period t on consumption in period t. They are temporary in nature since prices

in other periods are held constant.       For example, a reduction in price in period t-1 (P~.l) with

prices in all other periods held constant will increase consumption       in that period. In turn, Cl will

rise since 6 is positive.     Along the same lines, a reduction in Pi+l with prices in all other periods

held constant will increase Ct+l, which will increase Ct since ~6 is positive.

        Equation (2) also implies that there are important differences between long- and short-run

responses to permanent price changes (price changes in more than one period) in the case of

addiction.   The short-run price effect describes the response to a change in price in period t and all


                                                       8
fiture periods that is not anticipated until period t. The long-run price effect pertains to a price

change in ~ periods.    Since Ct.1 remains the same if a price change is not anticipated until period

t, the long-run price effect must exceed the short-run price effect,

        These results can be seen more formally by solving the second-order difference equation in

(2). The solution, which is contained in Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (1994), results in an

equation in which consumption       in period t depends on prices and life-cycle variables in all periods,

The roots of this difference equation are

                $,= [I -(I - 4e2p)’f’l/2e, $, = [1 + (I - 4e2p)1’21/2e,                            (3)

with 4e2~ <1, +1 <1, and ~’ > 1 all for stability. Given these roots, the temporary current, past,

and fiture price effects are

                Wt/aP, = e ,Ie02                                                                   (4a)

                W,/~Pt.l = e,ie(~)’                                                               (4b)

                m,/aPl+l = el@l/e$2.                                                              (4C)

All are negative since el is negative.    The short-run price effect is

                w,/m    = el/[e(l    - $1)~21,                                                    (5)

while the long-run price effect is

                dc/dP = el/[e(l     - $1)($2-    1)1= e,/(1 - Q - pe).                            (6)

The ratio of equation (6) to equation (5) equals ~/(@2 – 1). This ratio must exceed 1 since $2

exceeds 1.




                               III. Data and Em~irical Implementation

A. Sample
       Each year since 1975 the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research has

conducted a nationally representative random sample of between 15,000 and 19,000 high school

setiors during the months of March and April as part of the Monitoring the Future research

program.   These surveys, which are described in detail by Johnston, O’Malley, and Bachman

(1994), focus on the use of illegal drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes.   Starting with the class of 1976,

a sample of approximately 2,400 individuals in each senior class has been chosen for followup.

Individuals reporting current daily marijuana use or use of any other illegal drugs in the past 30

days in their senior year are selected with a higher probability (by a factor of 3). The 2,400

selected respondents are divided into two groups of 1,200 each; one group is surveyed in even-

numbered calendar years, while the other group is surveyed in odd-numbered        calendar years. As

a result of this design, one group of panels (termed the A panels from now on) is resurveyed for

the first time one year after baseline (the senior year in high school), while the other group

(termed the B panels from now on) is resurveyed for the first time two years afier baseline.

Subsequent followups are conducted at two year intervals for both groups.

        We estimate cocaine demand finctions using the nineteen panels formed from the high

school senior surveys conducted from 1976 through 1985. b The last followup in our data set,

which contains approximately 22,800 persons, took place in 1989. We have between one and five

observations on each person since we require information on current, past, and fiture

consumption   of cocaine. For example, the first observation on a given person pertains to the first

followup (which could have taken place from 1978 through 1987) with past consumption of

cocaine taken from baseline (1976 through 1985) and fiture consumption taken from the second

follow-up (1980 through 1989). The last observation pertains to the next to the last followup


                                                   10
(1986 or 1987) with past consumption      taken from the second to the last followup or from

baseline (1984 or 1985) and fiture consumption taken horn the lastfollowup(1988           or 1989).

Since an annual measure of consumption     is used in the regressions, past consumption    coincides

with the second annual lag and fiture consumption coincides with the second annual lead.’ For

the A panels, we have five observations   for persons from the 1977 and 1978 baselines, four

observations for the 1979 and 1980 baselines, three for the 1981 and 1982 baselines, two for the

1983 and 1984 baselines, and one for the 1985 baseline. For the B panels, we have five

obsemations for persons from the 1976 and 1977 baselines, four observations for the 1978 and

1979 baselines, three for the 1980 and 1981 baselines, two for the 1982 and 1983 baselines, and

one for the 1984 and 1985 baselines.

       Although Monitoring the Future obtains information on the use of a variety of illegal

drugs, we limit the empirical analysis to cocaine for several reasons. Cocaine prices (described in

more detail in Section 111.B) are available for many more areas and are based on much larger

samples than the prices of other illegal drugs. Moreover, cocaine was the second most widely

used illegal substance next to marijuana during the sample period. While the cocaine epidemic of

the late 1970s and 1980s peaked by 1986 in Monitoring the Future (Johnston, O’Malley, and

Bachman 1994) and by 1985 in the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (National

Institute on Drug Abuse 199 l),s it is not clear whether these trends represent long-term

movements or cycles in the use of various illegal drugs. Some examples of cycles or new trends

in other drugs follow. The number of inmates arriving at the Rikers Island Correctional Facility in

New York City who are addicted to heroin increased by 23 percent from 1994 to 1995 (Purdy

1995). The number of high school seniors using marijuana in the past year rose by 40 percent


                                                 11
between 1992 and 1994 in the Monitoring the Future baselines (Johnston, Bachman, and

O’Malley 1995). In addition, 1995 has witnessed widespread illicit use of the stimulant Ritalin on

college campuses (Leland 1995) and the sleeping pill Rohypnol in Florida (Navarro 1995). It is

probable that the demand functions for these substances have similar properties to the demand

finction for cocaine.

           One problem with the Monitoring the Future panels is that persons who dropped out of

high school prior to March of their senior year are excluded.     Dropouts may have different

cocaine consumption patterns than persons who remain in school, Nevertheless,          the Monitoring

the Future sample is the longest nationally representative panel with information on cocaine

consumption      in the age group that has the highest rate of cocaine use.




B, Cocaine Prices

           Information on county identifiers at baseline and at each followup allowed us to augment

the data set with cocaine prices from the System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence

(STRIDE) maintained by the Drug Enforcement Administration           (DEA) of the U. S. Department of

Justice.    DEA and FBI agents and state and local police narcotics officers purchase illicit drugs on

a regular basis in order to apprehend dealers. Taubman (1991) argues that DEA agents must

make transactions     at close to the street price of cocaine in order to make an arrest. because an

atypical price can cause suspicion on the part of dealers,

           Information on the date and city of the purchase, its total cost, total weight in grams, and

purity (as a percentage) is recorded in STRIDE.9 There are 139 cities in STMDE with usable

data for the period from 1977 through 1991. Following DiNardo ( 1993), Caulkins (1 994), and


                                                     12
Stier   and Chaloupka ( 1996), we obtained the price of one gram of pure cocaine by year and city

from a regression of the natural logarithm of the total purchase cost on the natural logarithm of

weight, the natural logarithm of purity, dichotomous     variables for each city and year except one,

and interactions between the year variables and dichotomous variables for eight of the nine

Census of Population divisions. 10 The regression is based on over 25,000 purchases.          Since

purchasers are likely to have imperfect information about purity, we treat it as endogenous           and

predict it based on the other regressors just mentioned,     To identi~ the model, the coeticient       of

the natural logarithm of predicted purity is constrained to equal the coefficient of the natural

logarithm of weight.    The price of one gram of pure cocaine is then given as the antilogarithm of

the sum of the intercept, the relevant city coefficient, and the relevant time-division coefficient,

The money price is converted to a real price by dividing it by the annual Consumer Price Index for

the U.S. as a whole (1982-1984=       l).ll

         Several things should be noted about the methodology just described,        First, it eliminates

variations in the price or unit cost of cocaine due to variations in weight and purity.     Second, the

resulting year- and city-specific price is akin to a geometric mean, Hence, the influence of outliers

is mitigated.   Finally, we experimented with alternative specifications of the total cost regression.

In one specification, interactions between time and Census division were eliminated.         In a second,

purity was treated as exogenous with an unconstrained      coefficient,   In a third, purity was deleted

as a regressor, but its predicted value was included as an independent variable in the cocaine

demand finction.     The estimates presented in Section IV are not sensitive to these alternative

specifications of the total cost regression.




                                                    13
           To match DEA cities to Monitoring the Future counties, we assigned each to its

Metropolitan     Statistical Area, Central Metropolitan   Statistical Area, or Primary Metropolitan

Statistical Area (whichever was smaller), For any county where a match could not be made, price

was defined as a population-weighted       average of price in all DEA cities in that county’s state. 12

The second annual lag and the second annual lead of the real price of cocaine, which are

employed as instruments in two-stage least squares regression models, were added to the panels

in the same manner. 13 Changes of residence to a different county by panel members during the

sample period were taken into account when the prices were added,

           Although our sample period includes the widespread introduction      of crack cocaine in late

1985 or early 1986, we do not distinguish between the price of crack and the price of powder

cocaine.    Crack’s reputation for being less expensive than powder is due primarily to the smaller

quantity at which it is retailed (Caulkins 1995). Caulkins (1996a) finds that the price per pure

gram of crack is the same as the price per pure gram of powder cocaine.         Crack cocaine gives a

more intense but shorter high than powder cocaine. If quantity is defined as the product of

intensity and duration, it is not clear which type of cocaine is more or less expensive,

           The national trend in our measure of the real price of one gram of pure cocaine from 1978

through 1994 is depicted in Figure 1. Prices in the last three years are based on the assumption

that the trend in our series is the same as the trend in the series constructed by Rhodes and

Pittayathikhun    (1996).   The current price in our empirical analysis fell by 78 percent in the sample

period of 1978 through 1987 which is used to fit the demand functions in Section IV. lJ Similar

declines have been found and discussed in detail by Kleiman ( 1992); Caulkins and Padman (1 993);

Caulkins (1 994); and Rhodes, Hyatt, and Scheiman ( 1994), One factor was the development of


                                                     14
the production sector and the results of learning-by-doing     that followed the reintroduction   of

cocaine into the U. S, market in the early 1970s after a long period of absence (see below for more

details). A second was vertical integration, which reduced the number of levels in the chain of

distribution and the cost of wholesaling and retailing. Finally, there was a shift to low-cost labor

as the professionals who dealt cocaine in the 1970s were replaced by unemployed residents of

urban ghettos in the 1980s. 15

        The fill price of consuming cocaine consists of three components: (1) the money price; (2)

the moneta~      value of the travel and waiting time required to obtain cocaine; and (3) the monetary

value of the expected penalties for possession or use (the probability of apprehension and

conviction multiplied by the fine or the monetary value of the prison sentence).      We assume that

variations in cocaine prices among cities can be used to trace out a demand finction because they

reflect differences in the three components of the fill price among cities. Put differently, larger

transportation    costs, stiffer fines and prison terms imposed on dealers, and higher probabilities of

apprehension and conviction cause the supply finction of cocaine to shifi upward and raise the

money price of cocaine. To the extent that the number of dealers in the market falls, travel and

waiting costs also rise. The fill price will also increase if the expected penalty for possession and

use is positively related to the expected penalty for selling cocaine. 16 Since the direct and indirect

price of obtaining cocaine are likely to be positively correlated, consumers may respond to

changes in money prices even if they have imperfect knowledge about these prices,

        In order to support the above assumptions, we present some evidence based on an analysis

of variations in the price of cocaine among DEA cities for the year 1991. For that year, state-

specific measures of the penalties for the possession and for the manufacture, delivery, or sale of


                                                    15
cocaine are available from the National Criminal Justice Association (199 1). These variables

reflect the statutory minimum and maximum dollar fines and prison terms for first offense cocaine

possession and sale. The correlation and regression results summarized below use the midpoints

of the minimum and maximum fines and prison terms, but similar results were obtained with the

mitimums or the maximums.        We also included four positive correlates of the probability of

apprehension and conviction [police employment per capita, police expenditures per capita,

criminal justice employment per capita, and criminal justice expenditures per capita, all measured

at the state level and obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (1992)] and one negative

correlate (the population of each city), Ehrlich (1973) argues that offenders find it relatively

easier to elude the police in densely populated areas. Population size also may reflect the

development of the cocaine market and the cost of distribution in different cities. Finally, we

identified eight cities that serve as ports of entry for cocaine from the DEA Intelligence Division

(various years): New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, New Orleans, Dallas, and

Phoenix.   Due to the costs of shipping cocaine to other cities, prices should be lower in ports of

entry,

         The results of the correlation and regression analysis are summarized below. Tables and a

more complete analysis are available upon request.       The results should be interpreted with caution

for a variety of reasons.   First, the fines and prison terms are measured at the state level rather

than at the county level. Moreover, statutory penalties may be weakly related to penalties that are

actually imposed.   Resources allocated to law enforcement may be high in cities and states with

large cocaine markets and low prices. Finally, many of the variables are highly correlated and




                                                    16
cannot be included in the same regressions.     With these caveats in mind, findings emerge that

justifi our interpretation of the sources of price variation among areas.

        (l).   The prison term for cocaine sale is highly correlated with the prison term for cocaine

possession (r= 0.83).    Similarly, the dollar fine for sale is highly correlated with the dollar fine for

possession (r= 0.56).

        (2). The simple correlation coefficient between the real price of cocaine and the prison

term for cocaine sale and between the price and the fine for sale are positive and statistically

significant (r = 0.19 and r = 0,17, respectively),   The penalty measures retain their positive signs,

although not always their significance, in the multiple regressions,

        (3). Regardless of the other variables that are held constant, the relationship between

price and population is negative and significant,    Price is lower in the eight port of entry cities than

in other cities with differentials ranging from approximately    $6 in the case of New Orleans to S38

in the case of Miami.

        (4). With population held constant, three of the four law enforcement measures are

positively related to price, and the positive coefficient of police employment is significant. The

exception pertains to criminal justice expenditures per capita.




C. Measurement      of Variables

        Table 1 contains definitions, means, and standard deviations of variables that are employed

in the regression analyses in Section IV, They are based on the sample of38,885         person-years or

person-followups    that results by deleting persons who failed to respond to at least three

consecutive questionnaires (including baseline) and by deleting observations for which the use of


                                                     17
cocaine in the past year, the real price of cocaine, and real annual earnings are missing, Given

three observations per person on average, there are approximately 12,962 respondents          in the final

sample.

          There are no missing values for age, male, black, and other race/ethnicity.    Missing values

for the other variables listed in the table are replaced by panel- and strata-specific means, Recall

that there are two strata for each panel. One consists of persons who used marijuana daily at

baseline or used another illegal drug during the past month at baseline, and the other consists of

persons who did not exhibit these illegal drug use patterns at baseline. The means and standard

deviations in the table are weighted to correct for oversampling--by      a factor of three--of persons

in the illegal drug stratum.    In particular, they are weighted by the inverse of the probability of

selection, which is equivalent to multiplying values of a given variable from the illegal drug

stratum by one-third.      Thus, the means and standard deviations in the table are representative    of

those in the population.

          Panel members report the number of occasions in the past year on which they used

cocaine. This is an ordered categorical variable with 7 outcomes: O occasions, 1-2 occasions, 3-5

occasions, 6-9 occasions, 10-19 occasions, 20-39 occasions, and 40 or more occasions.           Since

many persons did not use cocaine in the past year, two dependent variables are considered.           One

is a dichotomous variable that identifies users (termed cocaine participation),     and the second gives

frequency of use (number of occasions) conditional on positive participation.       Cocaine

participation has a weighted mean of 15.9 percent.        Since the unweighed   mean is 23,0 percent,

the sample of positive users contains 8,926 observations (person-years).        Cocaine frequency is




                                                     18
converted into a continuous variable by assigning midpoints to the closed internals and a value of

50 to the open-ended interval.

       Monitoring the Future did not distinguish between the use of crack cocaine and the use of

other forms of cocaine until the 1986 baseline survey (not included in our sample) and the 1987

followup sumey. In that followup and in the 1988 and 1989 followups, two-fifihs of the

respondents were asked separate questions on crack and powder cocaine, These answers have

been aggregated to form indicators of the use of any form of cocaine and the frequency of use by

means of an algorithm developed by the Institute for Social Research.

       To account for the possibility that cocaine and alcohol or cocaine and marijuana are

substitutes or complements, we include the minimum legal drinking age for the purchase and

consumption   of low-alcohol beer and a dichotomous     variable that identifies respondents of states

that have decriminalized the possession of marijuana. 17 Since no state has ever had a legal

drinking age greater than twenty-one, the drinking age is multiplied by a dichotomous variable

that equals one for persons twenty-one years of age or younger,      In reality, since precise birth

dates are not available and respondents could have changed from illegal drinkers to legal drinkers

during the past year, the variable just mentioned takes the form of a dichotomous indicator for the

first two followups, 18

        In addition to the own-state minimum legal drinking age, a dichotomous        indicator equal to

one if a respondent resides in a county within 25 miles of a state with a lower legal drinking age is

employed as a regressor,   This variable is equal to zero if the respondent does not live in a county

within 25 miles of another state or if the drinking age in his or her state is as low or lower than

that in nearby states. It is interacted with the dichotomous   indicator for persons whose age is less


                                                  19
than or equal to twenty-one for the same reason that the drinking age is interacted with this

indicator.   The border age variable is included in the model to capture potential border crossings

by youths from states with high drinking ages to nearby lower age states to obtain alcohol, With

the own-state legal drinking age held constant, the coefficient of the border age variable in the

demand finction should be negative if alcohol and cocaine are substitutes (the own-legal drinking

age coefficient is positive in this case) and positive if they are complements,

        Panel members are approximately age seventeen at baseline. The A panels, whose first

followup occurs one year afier baseline, are age eighteen at that followup, age twenty at the

second followup, age twenty-two     at the third , age twenty-four at the fourth, and age twenty-six

at the fifih. The B panels, whose first followup occurs two years after baseline, are age nineteen

at that followup, age twenty-one at the second followup, age twenty-three         at the third, age

twenty-five at the fourth, and age twenty-seven at the fifth. In the absence of precise birth dates,

the five even ages in Table 1 are dichotomous variables for the first, second, third, fourth, and

fiRh followups, respectively, for the A panels, Similarly, the four odd ages are dichotomous

variables for the first, second, third, and fourth followups, respectively, for the B panels,

        In addition to the age variables just described, a variety of independent variables were

constructed from the demographic and socioeconomic        information collected in the sumeys.

These include sex; race (black or other); real annual earnings;lg years of formal schooling

completed; college student status (fill-time, half-time, or less than half-time); work status (fill-

time, part-time, or unemployed);20 religious participation (infrequent or frequent); marital status

(married, engaged, or separated or divorced); and the respondent’s number of children, Finally, all

models include dichotomous     variables for nine of the ten years covered by current consumption


                                                   20
(1978 through 1986). The time-varying variables serve as proxies for life-cycle variables that

affect the marginal utility of current consumption.




D. Estimation Issues

        Given the sharp downward trend in the real price of cocaine in Figure 1, it is worth

considering trends in cocaine participation and frequency.   These trends for eighteen and nineteen

year olds are shown in Figure 2. They coincide with information reported in the first followup.

The unbalanced nature of the panel distorts trends if they are not shown on an age-specific basis.21

Twenty and twenty-one year olds do not enter the panel until 1980; twenty-two and twenty-three

year olds do not enter until 1982; twenty-four and twenty-five year olds do not enter until 1984;

and twenty-six and twenty-seven year olds do not enter until 1986. Hence, age is positively

correlated with calendar time, Eighteen and nineteen year olds are present in all years for which

we have observations on current consumption (1978-1987),       Data in the figure for the years

1990-1994 were provided by the Institute for Social Research,

        Participation   rose from 11.8 percent in 1978 to 16.9 percent in 1982. Mer    a decline to

13.8 percent in 1983, it grew to 15.9 percent in 1986 and then fell continuously afier that year.

The trend in frequency is more erratic. There was an overall peak of 9,6 occasions in 1981, but

the value in 1988 (9.5) was almost as large. In the sample period frequency grew between 1978

and 1981 and between 1982 and 1985, while it declined in 1986 and 1987,

        How should these trends be taken into account in the regression models? One approach is

to omit the time dummies and to attribute the trend in consumption to the trend in price, From a

practical point of view, this amounts to omitting the age dummies as well as the time dummies,


                                                      21
As indicated above, age is a positive correlate of time, and time effects are reflected by age effects

if time is omitted.

           A second approach is to employ the time dummies to capture unmeasured national

developments that may have impacted cocaine consumption.          These developments   include the

“just say no” to drugs campaign begun by Nancy Reagan shortly after Ronald Reagan became

President in 1981, efforts by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America to publicize the harmfil

effects of cocaine, and the dramatic cocaine-related deaths in June 1986 of the basketball star Len

Bias and the football star Don Rogers.      They also include the increase in resources devoted to

interdiction and criminal justice as part of the Federal War on Drugs and the introduction    and

difision    of mandatory drug testing in a variety of settings.

           One can argue, perhaps in hindsight, that the hazards of cocaine have been recognized for

a long time. Cocaine use was fairly widespread in the U. S. from the late 1880s until the early

1900s when many states enacted criminal prohibitions.       This process culminated in a Federal ban

under the 1914 Harrison Act (Musto 1973), and the drug virtually disappeared from use until the

early 1970s. Apparently, so did the knowledge about the harm that it can do, In August 1974

Dr. Peter Boume, who later served as President Jimmy Carter’s science advisor, stated: “Cocaine,

once a component of many tonics and of Coca-Cola, is probably the most benign of illicit drugs

currently in widespread use. The number of people seeking treatment as a result of cocaine use is

for all practical purposes zero (quoted by Kerr 1986, p. B6).” In the 1980 edition of the

Comprehensive      Textbook of Psvchiatw, the main psychiatric textbook in the U. S., Dr. Lester

Grinspoon and James B. Bakalar wrote: “If it is used no more than two or three times a week,

cocaine creates no serious problems .,. At present, chronic cocaine use does not usually appear as


                                                    22
a medical problem (pp. 1621 -1622).”       Given these statements and the developments summarized

above, our preferred specification includes the time and age dummies.       We do, however, indicate

how the results are altered when these variables are omitted.

         We estimate separate equations for participation and for frequency given positive

participation.     This is an application of Cragg’s (1 971) model for an outcome (cocaine

consumption)       with many nonparticipants   or zero values. We prefer it to Heckman’s (1979)

sample selection procedure because the latter pertains to a situation where the use of cocaine is

not observed for some individuals,      In our case this variable is observed and equal to zero for

nonparticipants.     22

         Given the nature of the panels, we estimate the participation version of equation (2) with

the second lag of participation as the measure of past consumption and the second lead of

participation as the measure of fiture consumption.       Similarly, we estimate the equation for

frequency conditional on positive use with the second lag of frequency as the measure of past

consumption and the second lead of frequency as the measure of fiture consumption, 23 Since

past consumption       and future consumption are endogenous, the equation is fitted by two-stage

least squares (TSLS).      The instruments consist of the exogenous variables in the model, the

second lag of the annual real cocaine price, the second lead of the annual real cocaine price, the

second annual lag and lead of the marijuana decriminalization      indicator, the second annual lags of

the two measures pertaining to the legal drinking age (legal drinking age*age<21 and lower

border drinking age indicator*age<21 ), and the second leads and the second lags of all time-

varying socioeconomic       vanables.24 These include real annual earnings, years of formal schooling

completed, college student status, work status, religious participation, marital status, and number


                                                     23
of children. The second leads of the two measures pertaining to the legal drinking age are not

used as instruments because the values of these two variables are zero except at the first followup.

The second leads and second lags of all time-varying socioeconomic variables are valid

instruments for reasons given in Section II.

        At the first followup, second lags of socioeconomic variables pertain to baseline data. For

this followup, the second lag of years of formal schooling completed equals 11 for all

respondents, and the second lags of the fill-time, half-time, and less than half-time college student

status indicators all are equal to zero, The second lag of work status is taken from a baseline

question on average hours of work per week during the school year.25 High school seniors who

do not work at all during the school year are assumed to be not in the labor force rather than

unemployed.    The second lag of earnings as of the first followup equals the sum of income from

work during the school year and other sources such as allowances and summer j obs,2G

        Linear probability models for participation and linear models for frequency given

participation are obtained.   The two-stage least squares participation equations correspond to

Heckman and MaCurdy’s (1985) simultaneous equations linear probability model. Frequently,

Cragg’s model is estimated by taking a logarithmic transformation    of use conditional on positive

use. We avoid this since the quadratic utility finction, which is the most simple form in the

context of addiction, generates a linear demand function,

        In interpreting the estimates in Section IV, one should bear in mind that both cocaine use

and price are subject to measurement error. Cocaine frequency is measured with error because of

the open-ended frequency category of 40 or more occasions in the past year. Clearly, the

magnitudes of the elasticities may be affected by the number of occasions assigned to this


                                                  24
category.    Thus, it is more important to focus on the relative magnitudes of the elasticities (the

long-run relative to the short-run or relative to the temporary) than on the absolute magnitudes of

the elasticities.

         Cocaine use also is measured inaccurately if self-reports are subject to response error.

The validity and reliability of self-reported illegal drug use data in the Michigan surveys have been

examined by Johnston, O’Malley, and Bachman a number of times (for example, 1994). They

conclude that the data have very high degrees of validity and reliability. In a related area, the

implications of response error in self-reported alcohol use for the estimation of alcohol demand

finctions   are considered in detail by Grossman, Coate, and Arluck (1987) and by Coate and

Grossman (1988).        They conclude that computed price effects are unbiased or conservative

lower-bound     estimates under a variety of alternative assumptions.

         The real price of cocaine contains measurement error for several reasons.     First, the price

data pertain to the DEA survey city nearest to the respondent’s     county of residence rather than to

the city or town in which the respondent actually resides,    Second, the respondent may have

imperfect information concerning the market price and the quality (purity) of the purchase, which

creates a difference between this price and the perceived price that governs his or her

consumption.        Third, the fiture price employed assumes that respondents who moved filly

anticipated the move. Random measurement error in an independent variable biases its coefficient

and t-ratio toward zero, Thus, the price coefficients and associated t-ratios in Section IV are

conservative lower-bound       estimates.27

         Despite the oversampling of illegal drug users in the past month at baseline, unweighed

regressions are obtained.     Maddala (1983, pp. 170-171) shows that this is the appropriate


                                                    25
procedure in the case of exogenous stratification (oversampling on the basis of an exogenous

variable in a regression model). In particular, if wj is the inverse of the sampling fraction for the

jth stratum, there is no justification for a weighted least squares procedure in which (wj)l’2 is the

weight.    The reason is that in regression analysis weighting is employed to produce efficient

estimates rather than to produce consistent estimates.     There is no reason why the drawing of

non-equiproportionate     samples from different strata should introduce heteroscedasticity    such that

the residual variance is s2/wj, where S*is a constant.

          Maddala (1983, pp. 17 1-173) also shows that it is appropriate to weight by (wj)l’2 in the

case of endogenous stratification (oversampling on the basis of the depencient variable in a

regression model). In our case, the oversampling is based on a variable--illegal drug use in the

past month at baseline--that does not enter the regression model as a dependent or independent

variable, Perhaps an argument could be made for weighting because this variable is positively

related to current annual cocaine participation or frequency.     But Maddala’s model assumes that

slope coefficients are the same in the two strata. For large enough samples, this could be

investigated by obtaining separate regressions for each stratum,28 But the stratum generated by

persons who used illegal drugs at baseline does not account for a sufficient percentage of cases

(person-years) to obtain reliable parameter estimates.

          Our preferred strategy is to pool the two strata and fit unweighed    regressions.   The

resulting coefficients essentially are averages for the two strata. This is the strategy suggested by

DuMouchel and Duncan (1983).         They show that weighted regressions are not appropriate in a

stratified sample if the linear homoscedastic   model is correct or if averages of strata-specific

regression coefficients are desired, We did, however, experiment with weighted regressions and


                                                    26
found that they were very similar to the unweighed        estimates in Section IV. This statement

pertains to coefficients, standard errors, and elasticities. Note that the difference between the

weighted and the unweighed         frequency of use in the sample of positive cocaine users is small:

(9.20 occasions versus 10.23 occasions).




                                           IV. Em~irical Results

        Tables 2 and 3 test the rational addiction model of cocaine consumption        by estimating

structural demand finctions      given by equation (2) for cocaine participation (Table 2) and for

frequency of cocaine use given positive participation (Table 3). The first two columns of each

table contain two-stage      least squares (TSLS) regressions in which past and fiture participation or

past and fiture frequency are endogenous.        In the first column the legal drinking age, the border

drinking age indicator, and the marijuana decriminalization measure are omitted, while in the

second column they are included.       Columns three and four contain the corresponding      ordinary

least squares regressions,     The tables also contain chi-squared statistics resulting from Hausman’s

(1978) test of the hypothesis that OLS estimates are consistent,

        With two degrees of freedom, the critical chi-squared values are 5.99 at the 5 percent level

and 9,21 at the 1 percent level. Since the computed values always are smaller than these critical

values, the consistency of the OLS estimates is accepted. Nevertheless,       it is usefil to consider all

the estimates in the two tables because they are similar and because the consistency of OLS is

rejected in some of the alternative specifications discussed later.

        The estimated effects of past and fiture participation on current participation     are

significantly positive in the four regressions in Table 2, and the estimated cocaine price effects are


                                                     27
significantly negative.   The same comments apply to the past frequency, fiture frequency, and

cocaine price coefficients in the four regressions in Table 3. The positive and significant past

participation or past frequency coefficient is consistent with the hypothesis that cocaine

consumption is an addictive good. The positive and significant fiture participation or fiture

frequency coefficient is consistent with the hypothesis of rational addiction and inconsistent with

the hypothesis of myopic addiction.     The sum of the past and fiture participation or frequency

coefficients is always smaller than one. This means that the long-inn, short-run, and temporary

price effects, which are discussed in more detail below, are negative.    The stability of these results

across alternative outcomes, specifications, and estimation methods is quite impressive.

         Clearly, the estimates indicate that cocaine consumption is addictive in the sense that past

and fiture changes significantly impact current consumption.      The evidence is inconsistent with

the hypothesis that cocaine consumers are myopic, Moreover, based on the frequency demand

finctions,   three of the four estimates of the implied discount factor (~)--given by the ratio of the

coefficient of fiture consumption to the coefficient of past consumption--are     quite reasonable,

The discount factor is 0.90 in the first regression in Table 3, 1.03 in the second regression, and

0.96 in the third and fourth regressions,   The first discount factor corresponds to an interest rate

of 11 percent, while the last two correspond to an interest rate of 4 percent,    The second gives a

negative interest rate of-3 percent. The same computations      applied to the participation equations

yield discount factors ranging from 1.19 to 1,08 and negative interest rates ranging from -16

percent to -7 percent. These results are not filly consistent with rational addiction.29

         We imposed a discount factor of 0.95 (interest rate of 5 percent) a priori and reestimated

the eight regressions in Tables 2 and 3, The price coefficients in these models are extremely close


                                                    28
to their unconstrained counterparts.    These results, combined with the detailed analysis in Becker,

Grossm~     and Murphy (1 994) and in Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1996) suggest that

data on cocaine, cigarette, or alcohol consumption may not be rich enough to pin down the

discount factor with precision even if the rational addiction model is accepted.

        Table 4 uses the estimates horn Tables 2 and 3 to compute the elasticity of participation

(Panel A) or the elasticity of frequency given positive participation (Panel B) with respect to the

various price changes defined in Section II at the weighted sample means of price, participation,

and frequency [see equations (4a-c), (5), and (6)]. Panel C of Table 4 contains unconditional

price elasticities defined as the sum of the relevant participation and frequency elasticities,    The

long-inn participation price elasticity is substantial.   It ranges from -1.26 to -1.56 with a mean of

-1.40. The short-run participation price elasticity ranges from -0.68 to -0.80 (average equals

-0.73). Thus, the average long-run participation elasticity is approximately twice as large as the

short-run elasticity.

        Frequency conditional on positive use is not as sensitive to price as participation.      The

average long-run elasticity is -0.47, and the average short-run elasticity is -0.33.   The

unconditional price elasticities are quite large: -1,87 on average in the long run and -1.06 on

average in the short run. The ratio of the long-run elasticity to the short-run elasticity of 1,76

should be compared to a ratio of approximately       1.91 in the case of cigarettes (Becker, Grossman

and Murphy 1994) and 1.60 in the case of alcohol (Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan 1996).

Becker, Grossman, and Murphy (199 1) show that the ratio of the Iong-mn price elasticity to the

short-run price elasticity rises as the degree of addiction, measured by the coeticient      of past

consumption,    rises. Hence, our results suggest that cocaine is less addictive than cigarette


                                                     29
smoking but more addictive than alcohol consumption.        There is no consensus in the

pharmacological    literature concerning the ranking in terms of addiction of these three substances.

But our results are consistent with some of the evidence presented in this literature (Kozlowski,

Wilkinson; Skimer, Kent, Franklin, and Pope 1989; Hemingfield,           Clayton, and Pollin 1990;

Henningfield, Cohen, and Slade 199 1).

        With regard to the tempora~     price elasticities, a 10 percent reduction in the current price

causes the number of cocaine users to increase by approximately 3.4 percent and causes the

frequency of use to rise by approximately 2.4 percent.      A 10 percent reduction in current price

also leads to a 1.6 percent increase in participation next year and a 1,8 increase in participation

last year, Finally, the frequency of use next year rises by 0.7 percent, and the frequency of use last

year also rises by 0.7 percent,   These negative cross price effects are inconsistent with

nonaddictive behavior, and the negative fiture price effect is inconsistent with myopic behavior.

        There is some evidence in Tables 2 and 3 that cocaine and marijuana are complements in

consumption,   while cocaine and alcohol are substitutes.    Both cocaine participation and frequency

are higher in states that decriminalized marijuana than in other states, although the frequency

coefficients are not statistically significant. Another interpretation   of this finding is that the

expected penalty for cocaine use is smaller in states that decriminalized marijuana.       An increase in

the legal drinking age raises cocaine participation and use, although again the frequency effects

are not significant.   Although the coefficient of the lower border age drinking indicator has the

wrong sign, the sign and significance of the drinking age coefficient itself are not altered when the

border age measure is deleted. But the conclusion that cocaine and alcohol are substitutes must be




                                                    30
tempered because states with higher drinking ages may allocate more resources to enforcement of

drinking age laws and less resources to apprehending and convicting cocaine users and dealers.

        The last finding we wish to note is the positive effect of real earnings on participation   and

frequency.   Although the participation coefficients are not significant at conventional levels, the

frequency coefficients all have t-ratios in excess of three. The long-inn e~mings elasticity of

participation equals 0.11 in the four models in Table 2, and the Iong-mn earnings elasticity of

frequency falls between 0.14 and 0.22 in the four models in Table 3. The long-run unconditional

earnings elasticity ranges from 0.25 to 0.33.

        In Table 5 we examine the sensitivity of the price and consumption effects to the omission

of the time and age variables. Age is omitted because it is strongly correlated with calendar time

(see Section 111for more details).   Since the legal drinking age has a sharp upward trend, the

models that include it are not part of the sensitivity analysis.

        In a qualitative sense, the results in Table 5 are consistent with those in Tables 2 and 3.

The past and fiture consumption coefficients are positive and significant, and the current price

coefficients are negative and significant.   The price elasticities are, however, smaller. 30 Based on

averages of the two models estimated, the unconditional price elasticity is -0.82 in the long run,

-0.46 in the short run, and -0.26 for a temporary current price change. Each of these elasticities is

approximately two-fifihs as large as the corresponding     elasticity in the model that control for age

and time (-1. 87, -1.06, and -0,57, respectively).

        In Table 6 we examine the robustness of the price and consumption effects by estimating

two-stage least squares fixed-effects models, Using this technique, we transform all time-varying

variables into deviations from person-specific means and delete time-invariant variables and cases


                                                     31
where there is only one observation for a given person from the regression.     This approach is

equivalent to including a dummy variable for each person in an untransformed       specification and

controls for unobsemed heterogeneity.31     Since the Hausman tests strongly reject the consistency

of OLS, only the TSLS coefficients are presented in the table.32

        On the whole, the results in Table 6 cofirm    those in Tables 2 and 3. The past and fiture

consumption   coefficients are positive and significant, The current price coefficients are negative,

although the frequency effects are not significant. The average long-run unconditional      elasticity

of-O. 83 is smaller than the one in Table 4 but almost exactly equal to the one in Table 5, The

average short-run and temporary price elasticities (-0. 62 and -0.42, respectively) are bigger than

those in Table 5 but smaller than those in Table 4.

       Which of the three sets of estimates are preferable? The specification in Table 4 is based

on the questionable assumption that information about the harmful effects of cocaine was filly

diffised at the beginning of our sample period (1978) and that the various anti-dreg campaigns in

the 1980s had no impact on the use of cocaine, As pointed out in Section 111.D, the real price of

cocaine contains random measurement error for a variety of reasons.      The downward biases in the

price coefficient and its t-ratio due to this factor are exacerbated in the fixed-effects model in

Table 6 (Griliches 1979; Griliches and Hausman 1986). Thus the estimates in Tables 5 and 6 are

not necessarily superior to those in Tables 2 and 3, Taken together, however, the four tables

underscore the stability and validity of our findings. Despite our misgivings about the fixed

effects model and the model that ignores time trends, we summarize the magnitudes of the price

elasticities by averaging over the three models. This gives a long-run unconditional    price

elasticity of- 1.18, a short-run price elasticity of-O.71, and a temporary current price elasticity of


                                                  32
-0.42. We view these figures as consemative      lower-bound estimates,




                                             V, Discussion

        We find that cocaine consumption      is quite sensitive to its price, A permanent 10 percent

reduction in price would cause the number of cocaine users to grow by slightly more than 8

percent in the long run and would increase the frequency of use among users by a little more than

3 percent.   Total or unconditional   frequency would rise by almost 12 percent in a fixed

population in the long run and by almost 7 percent in the short run. Surely, both proponents       and

opponents of drug legalization should take account of this increase in consumption       in debating

their respective positions.

        A good deal of caution, however, must be exercised in extrapolating our findings to a

regime in which cocaine consumption       is legal. One consideration is that the response to the large

price cut caused by legalization would be smaller than the one suggested by our estimates if the

price elasticity of demand is smaller at lower prices. A second consideration is that government

tax policies could counteract part of the price cut, and government education policies could be

used to increase knowledge about the harmfil effects of cocaine consumption.         A third factor is

that “forbidden fruit is attractive, particularly to the young (Friedman 1989, p. Al 6).” A factor

that goes in the opposite direction is that legalization may stimulate consumption    by removing the

stigma associated with cocaine consumption.

        A misleading impression about the reaction to permanent price changes may have been

created by the effects of temporary police crackdowns on drugs or temporary federal “wars” on

drugs. Since temporary policies raise current but not fiture prices (they would even lower fiture


                                                    33
prices if drug inventories are built up during the crackdown period), there is no complementary

fall in current use from a fall in fiture use. Consequently, even if drug addicts are rational, a

temporary war that greatly raised the street price of cocaine may well only have a small effect on

drug use, whereas a permanent war could have much bigger effects. For example, according to

our estimates, a 10 percent price hike for one year would reduce total cocaine consumption      by

approximately 4 percent, whereas a permanent 10 percent price hike would lower consumption by

12 percent.

        Clearly, we have not provided enough evidence to evaluate whether or not the use of

cocaine should be legalized,   A cost-benefit analysis of many effects is needed to decide between a

regime in which cotiaine is legal and a regime in which it is not, What we have shown is that the

permanent reduction in price caused by legalization is likely to have a substantial positive effect on

use, particularly among young adults.

         1 See Reuter and Kleiman (1986), Kaplan (1988), Tregarthen (1989), and Kleiman (1992)

for rough estimates of these reductions.

        2 See Grossman ( 1993) for a summa~ of this research.

        3 This maybe traced to attempts to fit the rational addiction model to relatively short time

series of aggregate data.

         4 Dealers may be less sensitive to price than non-dealers because an increase in price raises

the real income of the former group, while it lowers the real income of the latter group. Hence, if

heroin is a superior good, the substitution and income effects of a price reduction go in opposite

directions for dealers.

         5 Equation(1)    assumes that the rate of depreciation on the addictive stock is equal to one,

so that the stock is replaced by lagged consumption (Cl-l) in the current period utility finction.

Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1 996) report that empirical results for a model with a rate of

depreciation smaller than one are ve~ similar to those for a model with a rate of depreciation

equal to one in the case of alcohol. Equation (1) also assumes no uncertainty about becoming

addicted.     For an analysis that alters this assumption without changing the basic predictions of the

rational addiction model, see Orphanides and Zervos (1995).

         b There is no odd-numbered     calendar year panel from the 1976 baseline survey.




                                                    44
        7 For the A panels, the first value of past consumption@         coincides with the first annual

lag of consumption.     The same comment applies to lagged values of socioeconomic

characteristics, the price of cocaine, and related variables which are discussed below, From now

on, we refer to the past value of a given variable as its second lag even though the first past value

is the first lag for the A panels. In prelimina~ estimation, we found that results obtained for the B

panels only were ve~ similar to those reported in Section IV.

        s Trends in the National Households Surveys on Drug Abuse between             976 and 1990 are

based on surveys taken in 1976, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1988, and 1990.

        9 Weight and purity are measured in DEA laboratories,         STRIDE is described in detail by

Frank (1987), DiNardo (1993), andCaulkins(1994),

        10Missing data for some cities in certain years preclude a specification with city-time or

state-time interactions.

        11We also experimented with deflation by a city-specific cost of living index multiplied by

the amual CPI for the U. S. as a whole. The city index is the one reported by the American

Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association (ACCRA various years) and described in detail

by Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1996). Preliminary results with this price variable were

similar to those contained in Section IV. We do not emphasize estimates with it because in many

cases an ACCW         city must be matched to a different DEA city,

        12Except in two cases, the price from one state was never assigned to residents of another

state. The Washington, D, C. MSA includes portions of Virginia and Maryland.           Those living

within this MSA were given the D, C. price even if they lived in Virginia or Maryland.       The Kansas

City, Kansas-Kansas        City, Missouri MSA includes residents of two states.   The DEA city pertains

                                                     45
to Missouri.      All residents of the MSA were given the same price since neither state is the

dominant one in the population of the MSA. Although St. Louis, Missouri also is a DEA city,

residents of Kansas City, Missouri were not assigned a state-weighted          average price because the

distance between the two cities is very large.

            13Recall that the first value of lagged price is the first annual lag for the A panels, In

additio~ for the B panel from the 1976 baseline, the first value of lagged price pertains to 1977

since there are no cocaine prices prior to that year,

            14In an accounting sense, the decline in price between 1978 and 1987 can be traced to a

large increase in purity from 32 percent in the former year to 73 percent in the latter year and to a

modest 12 percent decline in the money price of one gram of cocaine not adjusted for purity at the

same time as the Consumer Price Index rose by 75 percent.

            15Much of the above discussion is based on a personal conversation with Jonathan P,

Caulkins.

            lb If the supply curve of cocaine slopes upward and the expected penalties for use and

distribution are positively related, the positive correlation between the money price and the fill

price is reduced but not eliminated.      Lee (1 993) reaches somewhat different conclusions than

those in the text, but he assumes an upward-sloping        supply curve and a Cobb-Douglas      utility

finction,     Moreover, he holds the expected penalty per contact with users imposed on dealers

constant.     In the context of our analysis, if the expected penalty imposed on users (f) is

proportional     to the money price of cocaine and the supply finction is infinitely elastic, the price

elasticity of demand is not biased by the omission off        To see this, define fill price (n) as the sum




                                                      46
of money price (p) and ~ and let f= kp, where k is a constant.       If the demand finction is linear, it

can be written as

                 c=a-~n=a-~(l+k)p.

The elasticity of c with respect to n is

                 e=   ~7KC-1 = ~p(l   +   k)c-’.

Along the same lines, one can show that the elasticity of c with respect to p is smaller than the

elasticity of c with respect to n if f = a + kp, a >0 or if f = kpY,y <1.   For y > 1 the money price

elasticity exceeds the fill price elasticity.

        17DiNardo and Lemieux (1992) report that an increase in the legal drinking age increases

the percentage of high school seniors who used marijuana in the past month,         They also find that

the percentage of high school seniors who used alcohol in the past month is lower in states that

decriminalized marijuana.      Decriminalization,   however, has no impact on the use of marijuana.

These findings are based on the time series of state cross sections used by DiNardo (1993) and

described in Section 1, Using individual observations from the 1989 Monitoring         the Future

baseline surveys, Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1994) indicate that monthly or annual alcohol

consumption is lower in states that decriminalized marijuana and is positively related to the money

price of marijuana.    They do not study marijuana consumption and their marijuana price is taken

from a DEA source other than STRIDE that contains data for 19 cities in 16 states,         Taken

together, the two studies suggest that marijuana and alcohol are substitutes.

        18The construction      of this variable accounts for the grandfather clauses many states

adopted when raising their legal ages for all alcoholic beverages to 21 years to comply with the

Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984. Similar variables were constructed           for high alcohol

                                                      47
beer and for distilled spirits. The three series are extremely highly correlated, and the choice of

the drinking age variable has little impact on the resulting estimates.    For more details on the

construction   of the drinking age measure, see Chaloupka, Saffer, and Grossman (1993).

        19Money earnings are deflated by a city-specific cost-of living-index multiplied by the

annual CPI for the U.S. as a whole. The city index is the one reported by the ACCRA (see note

11 and Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan 1996).

        20Full-time work status and fill-time college student status are not mutually exclusive

categories in theory or in the followup questionnaires.

        21The regressions presented in Section IV do not include age-time interactions because

these interactions are not significant as a set, But this is in the context of a specification that

controls for past and fiture consumption,

        22For detailed discussions of the Cragg and Heckman procedures,          see Lin and Schmidt

(1984) and Manning, Duan, and Rogers (1987). The latter authors refer to Cragg’s model as the

two-part model.

        23The sample of positive current users includes persons whose past or fiture values of use

can be zero. In fact, the weighted means of past and fiture participation are 64 percent and 69

percent, respectively.

        24In some specifications the current legal drinking age and marijuana decriminalization

measures are omitted from the demand finctions,         In these specifications the past values of the

drinking age variables and the past and fiture values of the decriminalization     indicator are not

employed as instruments.




                                                   48
       25Full-time workers at baseline are students who work more than 20 hours per week

during the school year.

       26The only income question in the followup surveys pertains to own earnings

       27Kloek(198 1) and Moulton (1 990) argue that t-ratios of coefficients of aggregate

variables in micro regressions are biased downward if the disturbances in the regression are

correlated among persons who live in the same area, This assumes, however, that the aggregate

variable is measured without error. Another mitigating factor is that Kloek (1981) shows that the

bias in the t-ratios increases as the number of people in each group (in our case, the county) rises,

We have a small number of observations from a given county. A related issue pertains to the

effects of the panel nature of the sample on standard errors of regression coefficients.     In

particular, the disturbance terms for a given person are likely to be correlated over time.

Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1996) find that Huber (1967) standard errors, which take

account of these correlations, are no larger than uncorrected standard errors in their study of

rational addiction demand finctions     for alcohol in the Monitoring the Future panels.

       2s These estimates would have to be corrected for sample selection using Heckman’s

(1979) methodology.       Identification by means other than the nonlinear relationship between the

inverse of the Mills ratio and the regressors is highly problematic.

       29Strictly speaking, equation (2) in the text pertains to a continuous outcome.       Therefore,

the estimates in Table 2 and their implied discount factors should be viewed as first-order

approximations.

       30The participation elasticities in the first model in Table 5 are smaller than the

corresponding     elasticities in Table 4, even though the price and consumption coefficients in the

                                                    49
two models appear to be very similar. Indeed the price coefficients appear to be identical.      They

are very small numbers (.000 1 in absolute value to four decimal places). But the computation         of

the elasticities uses more than four decimal places.

        31If individuals did not move among counties, the fixed-effect specification would filly

control for unmeasured county-specific        factors since county dichotomous   variables would be

time-invariant.   Along the same lines, if persons move among counties but not among states,

unmeasured state-specific factors are eliminated, More generally, the fixed-effects model reduces

biases due to unmeasured area-specific forces,

        32Although the models in Table 6 contain the same time-varying regressors as the models

in Tables 2 and 3, it is not surprising that the Hausman test decisively rejects OLS in Table 6 but

not in Tables 2 and 3. Nickell (1981) shows that fixed-effects OLS estimation produces a

negative bias and inconsistency in the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable in the absence

of serial correlation.    Using his techniques, one can demonstrate that the coefficients of past and

fiture consumption       are understated   in the OLS fixed-effects model. Indeed, we obtain negative

past and fiture consumption       coefficients when this procedure is used.
