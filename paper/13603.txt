Business Cycle Fluctuations and the Life Cycle: How Important is On-The-Job Skill Accumulation?

                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effects of on-the-job skill accumulation on average hours worked by age and the volatility
of hours over the life cycle in a calibrated general equilibrium model. Two forms of skill accumulation
are considered: learning by doing and on-the-job training. In our economy with learning by doing,
individuals supply more labor early in the life cycle and less as they approach retirement than they
do in an economy without this feature. The impact of this feature on the volatility of hours over the
life cycle depends on the value of the intertemporal elasticity of labor supply. When individuals accumulate
skills by on-the-job training, there are only weak effects on both the steady-state labor supply and
its volatility over the life cycle.

1       Introduction
Inspired by the research agenda proposed by Lucas (1980), the equilibrium
business cycle literature has demonstrated that surprisingly simple model
economies display ‡uctuations with quantitative properties similar to those
of business cycles experienced by actual economies. Most of this literature,
beginning with Kydland and Prescott (1982), has studied versions of the
in…nite horizon stochastic growth model calibrated to match secular growth
facts. Ríos-Rull (1996) showed that this basic claim extends to stochastic
life cycle economies as well.
     Life cycle models, being models of heterogeneous agents, have implica-
tions for business cycle properties about which the in…nite horizon model
is silent. In particular, individuals in these models respond to aggregate
shocks di¤erently depending on age. Understanding why and how individ-
uals respond to business cycle shocks as they grow older is important for
understanding how the properties of business cycles might change as the
population ages and for evaluating government policies that a¤ect individ-
uals di¤erently depending on age or, immigration policies for example, that
might change the age composition of the population.1
     Previous work [Ríos-Rull (1996) and Gomme, Rogerson, Rupert and
Wright (2004)] has documented the behavior of time averages of market hours
worked per person by age and the volatility over time of hours by age from
U.S. time series data and compared this with the same statistics computed
from simulations of a life cycle model.2 In the data, the standard deviation
of hours displays a U-shape over the life cycle: volatility is high when young,
falls as individuals age reaching a minimum and remaining ‡at during prime
age, and then increases as individuals reach retirement age. Market hours
worked per person increases with age, remains ‡at from age 25-55, and falls
as individuals approach the normal retirement age.
     These papers establish that a crucial modeling feature needed to account
for these life cycle properties of hours worked is wages that change over the
life cycle due to age speci…c human capital di¤erences. In particular, an
hour of labor from a younger worker is assumed to provide fewer productive
    1
     See Jaimovich and Siu (2007) for evidence that demographic change has had a signif-
icant e¤ect on business cycle volatility.
   2
     These papers follow the real business cycle tradition of measuring business cycle
volatility by computing the percent standard deviation of time series that has been de-
trended using the Hodrick-Prescott …lter.

labor services than an hour worked by a prime age worker due to exogenous
e¢ ciency weights.
    In actuality, of course, the di¤erences in productivity by age are not ex-
ogenous, but instead the result of human capital accumulation. In this paper,
we explore how these …ndings are a¤ected when the age-varying wages are
not due to exogenous time invariant e¢ ciency parameters, but the result of
endogenous on-the-job skill accumulation. While young workers may be less
productive than prime age workers and therefore earn less per hour, the to-
tal compensation of these younger workers that they take into account when
making their labor supply decision also includes whatever return from ex-
perience they receive from working. That is, their e¤ective wage may be
much higher than their current wage given that they will be compensated
with higher wages in the future as a result of the human capital they ac-
cumulate while on the job. This aspect of compensation is ignored when
exogenous e¢ ciency weights are assumed. In addition, the e¢ ciency weights
themselves will vary in response to shocks, potentially a¤ecting the business
cycle behavior of other endogenous variables.
    We formulate and study the steady state and business cycle properties
of a stochastic life cycle growth model calibrated to growth properties of
the U.S. economy.3 Two forms of on-the-job skill accumulation are consid-
ered: learning by doing (LBD) and on-the-job training (OJT). In the …rst
case, human capital is perfectly complementary with providing productive
labor services–human capital is accumulated simply as a result of working.
This contrasts with the second case where no productive labor services are
provided while spending time engaged in OJT. Both have been extensively
studied in the micro labor literature.4 We also compare the results obtained
with on-the-job skill accumulation with those from an economy with exoge-
nous age-speci…c wage parameters. All three economies are calibrated so
that the steady state values for the age-speci…c wage parameters are identi-
   3
     We assume the human capital production function used by Chang, Gomes, and
Schorfheide (2002) in their analysis of learning by doing in an in…nite horizon business
cycle model. We modify this production function to allow for OJT in addition to LBD.
   4
     Early papers on human capital accumulation that incorporates OJT include Ben-
Porath (1967), Becker (1964), Blinder and Weiss (1976), Heckman (1976), Mincer (1974),
and Rosen (1976). Shaw (1989) estimates a dynamic labor supply model with LBD. Imai
and Keane (2004) estimate a structural model of labor supply with LBD and …nd that
this feature can reconcile the relatively high labor supply elasticity that is consistent with
aggregate data with the low elasticity typically found in the micro literature.



                                              3
cal.
    We …nd that introducing OJT gives steady state and business cycle prop-
erties that are essentially identical to the case without skill accumulation.
LBD, on the other hand, a¤ects both sets of properties signi…cantly. In
particular, the impact of learning by doing is greater when labor supply is
more elastic. The reason for this di¤erence is that, in our calibrated econ-
omy, LBD a¤ects labor market decisions at all ages, while OJT turns out
to be important only during the early years of an individual’s working life.
Hence, exogenous e¢ ciency weights appears to be a useful abstraction when
studying the relationship between business cycles and the life cycle if skill
accumulation occurs through OJT. If LBD is important for skill accumula-
tion, exogenous e¢ ciency weights may not be a good modeling assumption
for studying this issue.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The model is de-
scribed in the next section and the third section describes the calibration.
The …ndings are discussed in section 4 and concluding comments are provided
in the section 5.


2     Model
The economic setup follows the overlapping generations structure of Diamond
(1965). Time is discrete t = 0; 1; : : : and the economy is subject to random
‡uctuations arising from shocks to the production technology as in Kydland
and Prescott (1982).

2.1    Demographics
At each date t a new generation of individuals is born that faces an uncertain
life span. The population of new agents born each period grows at the time
invariant rate n. We study the equilibrium properties of the model assuming
stationary demographics (constant cohort shares), in which case n is also the
growth rate of the total population. Let si denote the conditional probability
of surviving from age i to age i+1: Conditional on survival, individuals retire
at age IR : The maximum life span is I: Given n; fsi gIi=1 ; the time invariant
cohort shares, f i gIi=1 ; are given by
                                 si 1
                       i   =             i 1;   for i = 2; :::; I;         (1)

                                               i   = 1:
                                         i=1


2.2       Technology
There is a representative …rm with access to a constant returns to scale
Cobb-Douglas production function:

                                  Yt = ezt Kt (Ht )1        ;                         (2)

where Kt and Ht are aggregate physical capital and labor inputs, respectively,
and is capital’s share of income. Total factor productivity follows an AR(1)
process:
                                                     2
           zt+1 = zt +   t+1 ;     t+1     N (0;         ); 0 <   < 1; z0 given.      (3)

   The capital stock depreciates at the rate                and follows the law of motion

                                 Kt+1 = (1         )Kt + Xt ;                         (4)

where Xt is aggregate investment in period t:
    The …rm is assumed to behave competitively, choosing capital and labor
to maximize pro…ts while taking the wage rate and rental rate of capital as
given.

2.3       Households’Problem
An individual born at time t maximizes expected discounted lifetime utility

       i=1      j=0

where is the subjective discount factor, ci;t+i 1 ; hi;t+i 1 ; and ui;t+i 1 are
consumption, hours worked in production, and time spent in on-the-job train-
ing (OJT) for an age-i individual at time t + i 1; respectively. The variable
h represents time spent producing goods in return for which an individual
receives current labor income. OJT is also part of measured hours worked,

                                               5
but the individual is only compensated by higher wages in the future. Mea-
sured labor supply is equal to hi;t+i 1 + ui;t+i 1 . The parameter A represents
the importance of leisure in the period utility function and determines the
elasticity of labor supply. It can be shown that the compensated elasticity
of labor supply is given by (1 hi;t+i 1 ui;t+i 1 )=( (hi;t+i 1 + ui;t+i 1 )):5
    At each age, the individual faces the following budget constraint:

   ci;t+i   1   + ai+1;t+i = Rt+i 1 (ai;t+i      1   + bt+i 1 ) + wt+i 1 "i;t+i 1 hi;t+i 1 ;   (6)

where Rt+i 1 is the interest factor, ai;t+i 1 is the amount of assets available
at age i; ai+1;t+i is the amount of assets to be available at age i + 1; bt+i 1
is a lump sum distribution of accidental bequests, wt+i 1 is the real wage at
time t + i 1, and "i;t+i 1 is the e¢ ciency or human capital of an individual
at age i and time t + i 1:
    In addition, the individual’s human capital over the working portion of
the life cycle, f"i;t+i 1 gIi=1
                             R 1
                                 , follows the law of motion

                     "i+1;t+i                    "i;t+i    1             xi;t+i 1

                       "i+1                          "i                     xi
                                            hi;t+i   1     for learning-by-doing,
                       xi;t+i   1   =
                                            ui;t+i   1    for on-the-job training,

where "1;t = "1 for all t; 1 2 (0; 1); 2 > 0: That is, all individuals are
born with the same human capital. The variable xi;t+i 1 is time spent on
skill accumulation by an age i individual at time t + i 1: Variables with
bars above them indicate steady state values for the corresponding perfect
foresight economy with        = 0.
    Equation (7), as part of the household’s optimization problem, implies
that when the individual is making the leisure-labor choice at time t + i 1
he takes into account not only the market wage rate per e¢ cient unit of
labor, wt+i 1 ; but the impact of his hours decision on future compensation
wt+i+j 1 "i+j;t+i+j 1 , for j 1:
    We consider two cases incorporating skill accumulation. First, skills may
be accumulated as a by-product of working. In this learning-by-doing (LBD)
   5
     An implication of using this utility function is that the labor supply elasticity will
change over the life cycle as the fraction of time spent working changes. We have also
experimented with a utility function which implies a constant elasticity but found that
utility function (5) delivered somewhat better results.


                                                     6
case, we have x = h in equation (7) and ui;t+i 1      0 in the lifetime utility
function. As an alternative, our second case takes the opposite extreme by
following Becker (1964) and Ben-Porath (1967) and assumes that skill accu-
mulation is achieved when an individual spends time for on-the-job training
(OJT). In this case, x = u in equation (7).
    We assume that all individuals are born with zero wealth. Furthermore,
conditional on survival, the lack of a bequest motive will lead the individuals
to exhaust their wealth in their last period of life. That is, we have a1;t =
aI+1;t+I = 0 for all t.

2.4     Stationary Equilibrium

ters fn; fsi gIi=1 g consists of sequences indexed by t for unintended bequests

                                                R 1
                                                    follows equation (7).

3       Calibration
To be consistent with the majority of the real business cycle literature, we
calibrate the model so that one model period is equal to one quarter of a
year.

3.1     Demographics
We …rst need to specify an actual age that corresponds to the …rst period of
economic life (i = 1), the retirement age (IR ), and the maximum age (I).6
While the maximum age is set equal to 100 years in all experiments, the
beginning and retirement ages are chosen independently in each case in order
to ensure that individuals do not choose zero or negative hours before they
reach age IR . Our goal is to make the working life as long as possible subject
to the fact that our solution procedure cannot handle inequality constraints
(hi;t    0) that are only sometimes binding. Hence, we choose i = 1 to
correspond to age 18 or, if h1;t 0 is binding in some states, we choose i = 1
to be the minimum age where this constraint never binds in our simulations.
Similarly we choose IR to be the maximum age satisfying this condition for
the last working age, i = IR 1 . Therefore, while retirement age is exogenous
in our model, it varies across experiments since, as is reduced, individuals
choose to retire earlier.
    The conditional survival probabilities fsi gIi=1 are taken from the life tables
provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) [see Bell and Miller
(2002)]. They are the averages between males and females for the cohort
born in 1950. The population growth rate, n; is assumed to be 1.2 percent
per year, which is the average over 1950-2000. The steady-state e¢ ciency
pro…le, f"i gIi=1
               R 1
                   , is calculated as in Hansen (1993) using updated data. This
yields seven data points over the life cycle, corresponding to averages over
seven age ranges, which we then interpolate to obtain human capital weights
for speci…c ages.
    6
    More speci…cally, suppose an individual starts economic life at some age A0 (e.g. 18)
and lives to some maximum age A1 (e.g. 100): Then, given our assumption of a quarterly
time interval, I = 4(A1 A0 + 1).




                                           8
3.2     Technology and Preferences
Many of the parameters of our model are standard in the real business cycle
literature, so we calibrate them following standard practice. In particular,
capital’s share ( ), the depreciation rate ( ), the discount factor ( ), and
the preference parameter A are chosen so that the steady state of the model
matches long-run averages computed from U.S. aggregate time series data.
The four statistics targeted are an average capital share of 0:36, an average
investment to output ratio of 0:25, an average capital to output ratio of 3:0,
and an average time spent working (h + u) across all ages equal to 0:33. In
addition, the persistence parameter for the Solow residual ( ) is taken to be
0:95 and the standard deviation of its innovation ( ) is set to 0:007.
    We consider three di¤erent values of : 2, 1, and 0.67. This parameter
is directly related to the compensated labor supply elasticity (EIS) in our
model, which is (1 hi;t ui;t )=( (hi;t + ui;t )) for an individual of age i:
Estimates of this parameter vary considerably and range from close to 0
[MaCurdy (1981), Altonji (1986), and Browning, Deaton, and Irish (1985)] to
3.8 [Imai and Keane (2004)]. If we evaluate the labor supply elasticity at the
average time spent working in our experiments (0.33), then these elasticity
estimates imply values for from in…nity to 0.53. Given the …ndings of Imai
and Keane (2004), who estimate this parameter under learning by doing,
lower values of may be of interest. For computational reasons, we do not
consider values below 0.67.7

     In fact, to compute results for the = 0:67 case, we needed to not only reduce the
retirement age, but to increase the age at which individuals start working.

3.3    Skill Accumulation
We consider two skill accumulation technologies in our experiments to assess
the relative importance of LBD and OJT for hours volatility over the life
cycle. One has only LBD and the other only OJT. While this enables us
to clearly assess the impact of each type of on-the-job skill accumulation, we
are also unaware of any empirical studies that would guide us in calibrating
an accumulation technology that incorporates both types simultaneously.
    The skill accumulation technology (7) in the LBD case becomes,

                 "i+1;t+i                "i;t+i   1    hi;t+i 1
            ln              =   1   ln                +   2   ln :
                   "i+1                      "i           hi
    Our calibration of this version of the skill accumulation function follows
Chang, Gomes, and Schorfheide (2002) who use PSID data set to estimate
this equation. In particular, we use their posterior point estimates of 1 =
0:7973 and 2 = 0:1106:
    When skill accumulation takes the form of OJT, equation (7) becomes,

                 "i+1;t+i                "i;t+i   1                ui;t+i   1
            ln              =   1   ln                +   2   ln                :
                   "i+1                      "i                       ui
     In this case, we follow Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (1998) and Ku-
ruşcu (2006) who estimate a skill accumulation process originally proposed
by Becker (1964) and Ben-Porath (1967). Their estimates imply that the
lifetime pro…le for the ratio of time spent for OJT to market hours starts at
about 40-50% at ages 20-22 and then sharply declines to near zero by age 45.
Furthermore, the ratio of the average time spent for OJT over the lifetime to
market hours is about 6%. In order to reproduce these calibration targets,
we set 1 = 1 and 2 = 0:001 in equation (7). Our choice of 1 = 1 is in
line with most of the empirical literature that assumes zero depreciation of
human capital when skill accumulation is the result of OJT, as in Heckman,
Lochner, and Taber (1998) and Kuruşcu (2006). A value of unity for 1
provides an incentive to accumulate skills relatively early in the life cycle.

4.1                  The Importance of Age-Speci…c Human Capital
As discussed in the introduction, previous work [Ríos-Rull (1996) and Gomme,
Rogerson, Rupert and Wright (2004)] has established the importance of as-
suming a hump-shaped labor e¢ ciency pro…le in order for labor market be-
havior in a quantitative general equilibrium life cycle model to be similar to
what one …nds in actual economies. While the focus of this paper is to doc-
ument how the properties of the model are a¤ected if these e¢ ciency weights
are determined by on-the-job skill accumulation, it is useful to review why
age speci…c e¢ ciency weights are important in the context of our particular
model.

model increase early in life, decrease slightly during the prime ages, and then
declines more sharply as the individual nears retirement. As will be shown
in the next subsection, this is not too di¤erent from a life cycle hours pro…le
computed from U.S. data. The solid line in Figure 1 shows steady state

    Figure 2 displays the volatility of hours worked by age groups using the
two time invariant e¢ ciency pro…les described above. In particular, we re-
port the means from 500 simulations of our model where the simulated data
have been logged and detrended using the Hodrick-Prescott …lter. With hu-
man capital constant over the life cycle, the volatility of hours rises monoton-
ically with age. However, when the empirical hump-shaped pro…le is used,
the standard deviation of hours over the life cycle displays a U-shape, similar
to what one …nds in U.S. data on hours worked by age (see next subsection).

for both the steady state hours pro…le and the volatility of hours by age, we
are motivated to explore the role of on-the-job skill accumulation that gives
rise to di¤erences in human capital by age.
    In the remainder of this section we …rst examine the impact of on-the-job
skill accumulation on the steady state life cycle pro…le of hours worked and
then consider its impact on the volatility of hours worked by age. In all cases,
we compare the statistics computed from the model economy with analogous
statistics from U.S. data. We use quarterly averages of monthly time series on
total hours at work in non-agricultural industries derived from the Current
Population Survey and available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In
particular, using this data, it is possible to construct quarterly time series
for four age groups (18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) from 1955Q3 to 2002Q4 and
time series for seven age groups (18-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64,
65+) from 1976Q3 to 2002Q4.8

of hh=pop
     i =popi
             for each of the seven age groups, where the numerator is average
hours worked per capita for age group i and the denominator is average hours
worked per capita for the total population. We have chosen this particular
statistic because this ratio is stationary in the data and it allows us to correct
for the fact that hours worked are measured in di¤erent units in the model
and the data. In constructing the pro…les for the model economies, we
extend the retirement age as far as possible without causing steady state
hours worked to be negative and report the same measure as computed from
actual data.
    What we …nd is that LBD causes individuals to work more early in life
and to work less later in life. This can be seen in Figures 3a-3c. This e¤ect
becomes more pronounced as labor supply becomes more elastic (as is
reduced). This follows from the fact that the e¤ective wage is higher early
in life since workers are not only paid their current wage, but are rewarded in
the future with higher wages due to the skill accumulated while working. It
is interesting how closely the pro…les match those computed from U.S. data
  8
    Both Ríos-Rull (1996) and Gomme et. al. (2004) use annual data. Our data stops at
the end of 2002 because the BLS ceased publishing hours data for all seven age groups.

(see especially Figure 3b).
    The life cycle hours pro…les with OJT, however, are essentially identical to
the pro…les with no skill accumulation whatsoever. This is true for all values
of considered. This follows from the calibration of equation (7). Both the
high value for 1 and low value for 2 implied by our calibration contribute to
this result. In particular, since human capital does not depreciate, individuals
can accumulate skills early in life and spend relatively little time on OJT later
in their working life. This can be seen in the time allocated on OJT by age
shown in Figure 4. In addition, the fraction of work time spent on OJT
decreases rapidly with age. This is consistent with what has been found in
the micro literature.

Table 3 presents business cycle statistics from the data and the calibrated
models. As is standard in the literature, both the actual and the simulated
quarterly series are …rst transformed to natural logarithms and Hodrick-
Prescott …ltered with a smoothing parameter of 1600. The statistics dis-
played are the means of statistics computed from 500 simulations of the
model. The volatilities are percent standard deviations from the Hodrick-
Prescott trend.

    Given that the initial age and the retirement age matter for these statis-
tics, and given that as is reduced (the labor supply elasticity increased) the
computationally feasible age range is narrowed (especially for the learning by
doing case), we use a di¤erent initial age and retirement age for each value
of considered (see Table 2).
    The …rst column of Table 3 displays the volatilities of key aggregate vari-
ables and their contemporaneous correlations with real GDP. The data over
the period 1955Q3 and 2002Q4 yield a standard deviation of 1.604 for real
GDP which is slightly lower than that in earlier studies, including Ríos-Rull
(1996) and Gomme et. al. (2004), re‡ecting the moderation in ‡uctuations
since the mid-1980s and our use of quarterly data as opposed to annual data.

                                      18
Consumption is about half as volatile as real GDP and investment is about
three times as volatile as output. Total hours volatility is 94% of that of
real GDP, somewhat higher than what is reported in both Ríos-Rull (1996)
and Gomme et. al. (2004). Productivity is about two-thirds as volatile
as output. The contemporaneous correlations of aggregate consumption, in-
vestment, hours and productivity are very similar to what has generally been
reported in the real business cycle literature.
    Volatility of hours over the life cycle has the U-shape that has been well
documented in the previous literature. Hours’volatility is high in the 18-24
group, falls considerably in the next age group and even more so in the prime
ages of 45-64 but rises sharply after age 65. Contemporaneous correlations
of output and hours worked monotonically decline over the life cycle.
    Table 3 also reports business cycle statistics from our calibrated economies.
Our models explain about 75 percent of the ‡uctuations in output, although
this varies somewhat depending on and skill accumulation. As is typical
in the real business cycle literature, model consumption is too smooth rela-
tive to data. Volatility in total hours is between 23 and 37% of that in the
data and increases with a higher compensated labor supply elasticity (lower
  ). Skill accumulation has little impact on total hours volatility except for
the = 1 case when learning by doing substantially increases volatility.9 In
general, skill accumulation has little e¤ect on volatilities and correlations of
aggregate variables.
    Skill accumulation does, however, impact the volatility of hours worked
by speci…c age groups. Our calibrated models deliver the general U-shape
of hours volatilities over the life cycle seen in the U.S. data. However, in
all cases, the volatility of hours in the 45-64 age group is higher than the
volatility of the 25-44 age group, which is the opposite of what we observe
in the U.S. data. This anomaly is shared in common with Ríos-Rull (1996)
and Gomme et. al. (2004), and continues to hold with endogenous skill
accumulation. Similarly, the model economies do not exhibit the decreasing
correlation as age increases between output and hours worked by age observed
in the U.S. data.
    We now turn to a more detailed examination of the role played by skill
accumulation on the volatility of hours worked by age (see Figure 5). In
   9
     Comparisons across the three values of is complicated by the fact that the range of
working ages di¤ers for the three cases. This de…nitely matters for the results obtained
[see discussion in Gomme et. al. (2004)].



                                          19
particular, we focus on the seven age groups for which we have data from
1976Q3 to 2002Q4. In order to display the e¤ect of skill accumulation on
the volatility of hours by age, we compute the standard deviation of hours
for the seven age subgroups and divide that by the standard deviation of
total hours. For each value of , we report results from the model with no
skill accumulation (NSA), the model with learning by doing (LBD) and the
model with on-the-job training (OJT). For comparison, we also report the
same statistic computed from the U.S. data.
    We …nd that for all values of considered, OJT makes no di¤erence
for hours volatility by age relative to the no skill accumulation (NSA) case.
Once again, the main reason for this is our calibrated version of equation (7)
which provides an incentive to allocate time on OJT very early in life and
reduce this time to essentially zero after the …rst decade of working life.

    Our …nal case, = 0:67, is perhaps the most empirically relevant given the
…ndings of Imai and Keane (2004) on labor supply elasticities with learning
by doing. In this case, learning by doing reduces volatility for age brackets
from 25 to 54. Again, as in the = 1 case, learning by doing signi…cantly
increases volatility for the 55-64 bracket. Unlike this case, volatility also
increases volatility for the youngest age group.

    By adding skill accumulation to a life cycle model, we can evaluate the
extent to which this feature changes the business cycle properties of the
model relative to the standard (NSA) case that has been studied in the pre-
vious literature. If skills are accumulated by time devoted to OJT, then
our theory predicts little impact of skill accumulation on the business cycle
properties. However, if LBD is important for human capital accumulation
, skill accumulation does matter. In particular, in the LBD case, the gap
between the business cycle properties implied by the model and those com-
puted from actual data is widened, primarily because individuals at the end
of their working life respond more strongly to shocks.


5    Concluding Remarks
Hours’volatility exhibits a U-shape over the life cycle. At young and old ages,
individuals seem more willing to intertemporally substitute labor than those
at prime working ages. Consistent with the previous literature, this paper


                                       22
documents that this U-shape emerges from a calibrated general equilibrium
life cycle model in which human capital is exogenous. When human capital
changes exogenously over their working life, an individual’s response to a
wage shock today only a¤ects the usual static labor/leisure trade-o¤ and
ignores the impact of current labor market decisions on future wages.
     In this paper, we explore the impact of endogenizing human capital over
the life cycle on the steady-state hours pro…le and the volatility of hours by
age. We concentrate on these properties because these are features of the data
present in life cycle economies, but which are absent in standard business
cycle models based on the in…nite horizon stochastic growth model. We
consider two di¤erent technologies for skill accumulation; learning-by-doing
and on-the-job training. In the former case, skill accumulation occurs as a by-
product of providing market hours, where as in the latter case the individual
has to devote time for training during which no productive labor services
are provided. In both cases, the individual fully incorporates the future
impact of current hours’decision on future wages through a higher stock of
skills in the future. We calibrate our general equilibrium life cycle economy
to key long-run U.S. aggregates and relevant micro studies. In particular,
we use microeconometric estimates in the labor literature to calibrate our
parsimonious speci…cation of the skill accumulation process. Future work
may want to consider other forms of the human capital production function
that have been explored in the micro literature, especially ones where the
ability to learn might be age dependent.
     Our main …nding is that the introduction of OJT gives steady state and
business cycle properties that are essentially identical to the case without
skill accumulation. On the other hand, LBD a¤ects both sets of properties
signi…cantly. In particular, when labor supply is more elastic, the impact of
learning by doing is greater. The reason for this di¤erence is that, in our
calibrated economy, LBD a¤ects labor market decisions at all ages, while
OJT turns out to be important only during the early years of an individual’s
working life.
     We have shown that, at least in some cases, incorporating human capital
does not change the business cycle properties of our life cycle economy much
compared to the case in which human capital is exogenous. Still, the life
cycle model does not completely account for the pattern of hours volatility
by age and the correlations of output with hours worked by age observed in
the data, which leaves room for additional work on this topic.
