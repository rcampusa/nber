                                          ABSTRACT

In closed or open economy models with complete markets, targeting core inflation enables monetary
policy to maximize welfare by replicating the flexible price equilibrium. We analyze this result in
the context of developing economies, where a large proportion of households are credit constrained
and the share of food expenditures in total consumption expenditures is high. We develop an open
economy model with incomplete financial markets to show that headline inflation targeting improves
welfare outcomes. We also compute the optimal price index, which includes a positive weight on food
prices but, unlike headline inflation, assigns zero weight to import prices.

1     Introduction

    Most central banks view low and stable inflation as a primary, if not dominant, objective
of monetary policy. In the existing literature, the choice of price index to target has been
guided by the idea that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Core inflation (excluding
food, energy, and other volatile components from headline CPI) has been viewed as the
most appropriate measure of inflation since fluctuations in food and energy prices represent
supply shocks and are non-monetary in nature (Wynne, 2008). Moreover, since these shocks
are transitory, highly volatile, and do not reflect changes in the underlying rate of inflation,
they should not be a part of the targeted price index (Mishkin, 2007, 2008).
    Previous authors have used models with price and/or wage stickiness to show that tar-
geting core inflation maximizes welfare. Existing models have looked at complete market
settings where price stickiness is the only distortion (besides monopoly power). Infrequent
price adjustments cause mark-ups to fluctuate and also distort relative prices. In order to
restore the flexible price equilibrium, central banks should try to minimize these fluctuations
by targeting sticky prices (Goodfriend and King, 1997, 2001).
    Using a New Keynesian model, Aoki (2001) demonstrates that targeting inflation in the
sticky price sector leads to macroeconomic stability and welfare maximization. Targeting
core inflation is equivalent to stabilizing the aggregate output gap as output and inflation
move in the same direction under complete markets. Benigno (2004) argues that in a common
currency area the central bank should target an index that gives higher weight to inflation in
regions with a higher degree of nominal rigidity, effectively ignoring exchange rate and com-
modity price fluctuations. In a more general multi-sector setting, Mankiw and Reis (2003)
show that, in order to improve the stability of economic activity, the targeted “stability”
price index should put more weight on sectors that have sluggish price adjustment, are more
procyclical, and have a smaller weight in the consumer price index.
    The results from the prior literature generally rely on the assumption that markets are


                                               1
complete (allowing households to fully insure against idiosyncratic risks). The central bank
then only needs to tackle the distortions created by price stickiness. However, in developing
economies, a substantial fraction of agents are unable to smooth their consumption in a
manner consistent with the permanent income hypothesis. Moreover, developing economies
have other structural differences from advanced economies, including the relatively high share
of food in household consumption expenditures.
   In this paper, we provide an analytical framework for determining the optimal price
index for developing economy central banks to target. We make three main contributions.
First, we generalize the results of Aoki (2001) and Benigno (2004) by developing a model
that encompasses their frameworks. Second, we show that incomplete financial markets and
other characteristics of developing economies substantially alter the key results. Third, we
derive optimal price indexes and compare them with feasible rules such as headline inflation
targeting that also improve welfare relative to core inflation targeting but are easier for
central banks to communicate and implement.
   Our model has three sectors to make it more representative of the structures of developing
economies. First, the food (or informal) sector, which comprises a large fraction of the
economy and where prices are flexible. Workers in this sector live hand-to-mouth, i.e., they
have no access to credit markets and simply consume their current labor income. Second,
the sticky price (or formal) sector that is subject to productivity shocks and mark-up shocks,
and where workers do have access to credit markets. Third, a sector that is open to foreign
trade and where prices are flexible but also highly volatile. This sector, which proxies for
the commodity-producing sector, faces large external shocks.
   Financial frictions that result in consumers being credit constrained have not received
much attention in models of inflation targeting. When markets are not complete and agents
differ in their ability to smooth consumption, their welfare depends on the nature of id-
iosyncratic shocks. Thus, this model also allows us to analyze the welfare distribution under



                                              2
alternative inflation targeting rules. Under incomplete markets, household income, which is
influenced by the nature of shocks and the price elasticity of the demand for goods, matters
for consumption choices. For instance, a negative productivity shock to a good with a low
price elasticity of demand could increase the income of net sellers of that good and raise the
expenditure of net buyers of that good.
   Our model incorporates other important features relevant to developing economies. In
these countries, expenditure on food constitutes 40-50 percent of household expenditures,
compared to 10-15 percent in advanced economies. Low price and income elasticities of food
expenditures as well as low income levels make the welfare of agents in developing economies
more sensitive to fluctuations in food prices. These features imply that agents factor in food
price inflation while bargaining over wages, thus affecting broader inflation expectations
(Walsh, 2011). Thus, in developing economies even inflation expectation targeting central
banks must take into account food price inflation.
   Our key result is that in the presence of financial frictions targeting headline CPI inflation
improves aggregate welfare relative to targeting core inflation (i.e., inflation in the sticky
price sector). Lack of access to financial markets makes the demand of credit-constrained
consumers insensitive to interest rates. These consumers’ demand depends only on real
wages, establishing a link between aggregate demand and real wages. Thus, the relative
price of the good produced in the flexible price sector not only affects aggregate supply but,
through its effects on real wages, also influences aggregate demand.
   Our model allows us to compute optimal price indexes that maximize welfare. The opti-
mal price index also includes a positive weight on food prices but, unlike headline inflation,
generally assigns zero weight to import prices. This is because agents in that sector have
access to financial markets and, unlike in the case of food, the price elasticity of the demand
for goods produced in this sector is high.
   These results differ from those of the prior literature based on complete markets settings.



                                               3
For instance, in Aoki’s (2001) model, relative prices of the flexible price sector only appear
as a shift parameter of inflation in the sticky price sector. Under incomplete markets, by
contrast, the central bank has to respond to price fluctuations in the flexible price sector in
order to manage aggregate demand. Financial frictions break the comovement of inflation
and output, implying that stabilizing core inflation no longer stabilizes the output gap.
Thus, in the presence of financial frictions, targeting a broader measure of inflation improves
welfare.
    In related work, Catão and Chang (2010) show that, for a small open economy that is
a net buyer of food, the high volatility of world food prices causes headline CPI inflation
targeting to dominate core CPI inflation targeting. Adding this feature would strengthen our
results but make our model less general since few developing economies import a large share
of their food consumption. Frankel (2008) argues that a small commodity-exporting economy
should target the export price index in order to accommodate terms of trade shocks. Our
results suggest that ignoring sectors with nominal rigidities and targeting this set of flexible
prices, which has a small weight in the domestic CPI, would reduce welfare.
    The paper is organized as follows. The next section contains some empirical facts to
further motivate the structure of the model and its relevance to developing economies. In
Section 3, we outline the main feature of the model and contrast it with the prior literature.
In Section 4, we discuss the main results and in Section 5 we conduct various sensitivity
experiments to check the robustness of our baseline results and also present some extensions
of the basic model. Section 6 concludes the paper.



2     Basic Stylized Facts

    We first discuss some stylized facts that are relevant to monetary policy formulation in
developing countries, starting with the share of food in household consumption expenditures



                                               4
and measures of the elasticity of food expenditures.1 Engel’s law states that as average
household income increases, the average share of food expenditure in total household ex-
penditure declines. When this idea is extended to countries, we expect poorer countries to
have a higher average share of food expenditure in total household expenditure. In Table
1, we present recent data on shares of food expenditure in total expenditure for selected
developing and advanced economies. As expected, expenditure on food constitutes a much
larger share of total household expenditure in developing relative to advanced economies.
   Moreover, the income elasticity of food in developing economies is on average twice as
large as that in advanced economies (0.63 versus 0.30 for a selected group of economies).
We also note that the average price elasticity of food is much lower in absolute terms than
the typical assumption of a unitary price elasticity, suggesting that food is a necessary good.
As the share of expenditure on food is high in developing economies, the price elasticity
of food is higher in these economies (average of about -0.38) but still lower than the value
normally used in the literature. Low price and income elasticities of the demand for food
have considerable significance for the choice of price index.
   To examine the extent of credit constraints in developing countries, in Table 2 we present
data from the World Bank (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper, 2012) on the percentage of the
adult population with access to formal finance (the share of the population using formal
financial services) in developing countries. These data show that, on average, more than half
of the population in developing countries lacks access to the formal financial system. By
contrast, in advanced economies, nearly all households have such access.
   Finally, we note that both food and nonfood inflation are higher on average in devel-
oping economies than in advanced economies. In the former group, food inflation is more
volatile than nonfood inflation, consistent with the notion that food prices are more flex-
ible than prices of other goods. Innovations to food price inflation are also more volatile


   1
       Details on the data and stylized facts discussed in this section are in Anand and Prasad (2010).

                                                       5
than innovations to nonfood inflation. These observations are consistent with other evidence
that headline inflation is more volatile than core inflation in both developing and advanced
economies (Anand and Prasad, 2010). The two measures of inflation exhibit a high degree
of persistence in both sets of economies and, contrary to conventional wisdom, food price
shocks tend to be quite persistent in developing economies (also see Walsh, 2011).
    The main observations from this section are that, relative to households in advanced
economies, those in developing economies have a higher share of food expenditures in to-
tal consumption expenditures, a higher income elasticity and lower price elasticity of food
expenditures, and significantly lower access to formal financial institutions. These features
potentially have implications for households’ responses to changes in monetary policy.



3     Model

    In this section, we develop a small open economy model incorporating features that are
particularly relevant for developing economies. To examine whether the existing results
about optimal inflation targeting are affected by these features, we adopt a model setting
that is otherwise standard but broad enough to encompass features that previous authors
have focused on.


3.1    Households

    The economy consists of a continuum of infinitely-lived households of two types: (i)
measure λ > 0 of households producing food, the flexible price domestic good and (ii)
measure 1 − λ of households producing a continuum of monopolistically produced sticky
price goods (nonfood) for domestic consumption and a flexible price good for export (nonfood
exports). Our model is thus more general than that of Aoki (2001), which is for a closed
economy, and allows for comparisons with Benigno’s (2004) open economy setting. The



                                             6
model also embeds other key features of both Benigno (2004) and Mankiw and Reis (2003),
whose models include multiple sectors with varying degrees of price rigidity.
    We assume that labor is immobile across the food and nonfood sectors.2 The represen-
tative household, denoted by the superscript i, is indexed by f (food sector) and n (nonfood
sector). Household i maximizes the discounted stream of utility:

                                                      ∞
                                                      X
                                                 E0         β t [U (Cti , Nti )]                           (1)
                                                      t=0


where β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor. The utility function takes the form:


                                U (Cti , Nti ) = u(Cti ) − vi (Nti ),              i ∈ {f, n}              (2)


where u(Cti ) is the utility of consumption and vi (Nti ) is the disutility of labor supply. Cti
is the composite consumption index of household i in period t, including food and nonfood
goods. It is defined as

     This assumption reflects the large inter-sectoral wage differentials in developing economies. Galı́ et al.
(2004) demonstrate that, even with free labor mobility, financial frictions lead to similar results as ours
(aggregate demand increasing when the central bank raises the policy interest rate).

                                                                7

    The elasticity of substitution between the flexible price and sticky price goods is given
by η ∈ (0, +∞) and γ ∈ (0, 1) is the weight on food in the consumption index. ζ ∈ (0, 1) is
the share of imported nonfood goods in the nonfood consumption index, and ξ ∈ (0, +∞) is
the elasticity of substitution between domestic nonfood and imported nonfood goods. θ > 1
is the elasticity of substitution between any two differentiated goods.
    Since food is a necessity, households must consume a minimum amount C ∗ of food for
survival. We assume that all households always have enough income to buy the subsistence
level of food. Even though this constraint does not bind, it alters the elasticity of substitution
between food and nonfood and the marginal utility of food and nonfood consumption. This
is one important departure from previous models that are mostly relevant for advanced
economies, where food is a modest share of overall household expenditures.

3.2     Budget Constraints and Financial Markets

    This section highlights the key difference between our model and those of previous authors
who have studied optimal inflation targets. Households in the flexible price sector (food

     This specification implies local labor markets for the sticky price and export sectors and perfect risk-
sharing among households in the nonfood sector (Ferrero et al., 2010).

sector) do not have access to financial markets and they consume their wage income in
each period.4 So these households are akin to “rule of thumb” consumers. A representative
household in the food sector maximizes its lifetime utility given by equation (1) subject to
the budget constraint:
                                       Pt Ctf + Pf,t C ∗ = Wf,t Ntf                                    (6)

    Households in the nonfood sector provide labor to firms in both the sticky price sector
and the export sector. They can buy one-period nominal bonds and foreign bonds to smooth
their consumption. A representative household in this sector maximizes lifetime utility given
by equation (1) subject to the following budget constraint

financial institutions is at least 10 percentage points lower in rural areas compared to urban areas. Basu
and Srivastava (2005) document that 80 percent of individuals in India’s agricultural sector have no access
to formal finance. To keep the model tractable, there is no storage technology.

denominated in domestic and foreign currency, respectively. The gross nominal interest
rates for those two types of bonds are denoted by Rt and Rt∗ , respectively.5 Wx,t and Ws,t
are the nominal wages in the export and sticky price sectors and Ntx and Nts are the labor
supply in these two sectors. Πst is the profit from firms in the sticky price sector.


3.3     Production

    Each household in the food sector owns one firm and produces food using a linear tech-
nology in labor yf,t = Af,t Ntf , subject to a common productivity shock Af,t . Firms in this
sector are price takers and, given a market price Pf,t , the zero profit condition determines
labor demand.
    Similarly, firms in the sticky price sector use a linear technology in labor ys,t (z) =
As,t Nts (z) and are subject to a common productivity shock As,t . Following Calvo (1983),
we assume that a fraction α ∈ (0, 1) of firms cannot change their price in each period.6
Firms that are free to change the price at time t choose a price Xt to maximize the dis-
counted profit stream given by:

                                   ∞

                                                                                 

where Qt,t+j is the stochastic discount factor, Xt is the price of the variety produced by
             s

    Firms in the export sector also use a linear technology yx,t = Ax,t Ntx and face an exoge-
nous price level every period.7 Firms in this sector are assumed to be price takers. Import

     We also include a small quadratic portfolio holding cost for foreign bond holdings, as suggested by
Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003), only to induce stationarity.

     We model the export sector in a manner similar to Mendoza (1995) and Devereux et al. (2006).

prices are exogenous and follow the law of one price. The terms of trade shock, which links
import and export prices, determines the export price. Thus, Px,t = St Pm,t , where St is the
terms of trade. Given export prices, the firms’ cost minimization problem determines wages
and, therefore, the labor demand in the sector.


3.4      Inflation and Monetary Policy Rule
                                                                     Pt
    We define gross headline inflation as πt =                      Pt−1
                                                                         ,   gross inflation in the sticky price sector as
          Ps,t                                                                                        Pm,t
πs,t =   Ps,t−1
                ,   and gross imported goods inflation is defined as πm,t =                          Pm,t−1
                                                                                                            .   The steady state
is characterized by constant prices (zero inflation) and no price stickiness in the economy.8
The central bank sets the short-term nominal interest rate (Rt ) according to the following
version of a Taylor (1993) rule:

                                                                                        πt∗
                                                                                                     
                              Rt                     Rt−1                                                   yt
                    log                = ρ log                  + (1 − ρ) φπ log                  + φy log                  (12)
                              R̄                      R̄                                π̄                  ȳ

where ȳ, π̄ and R̄ are the steady state values of output, inflation, and the nominal interest
rate, respectively. The term ρ represents the central banker’s preference for interest rate
smoothing.9 φπ and φy are the weights on inflation and output gap assigned by the policy
makers. Setting the parameter φy = 0 implies strict inflation targeting regimes. We charac-
terize core inflation as the inflation in the sticky price sector, πs,t , and headline inflation as
the overall inflation, πt , for our policy experiments. In addition, for the computation of the
optimal inflation target, we use an inflation target given by


                                        πt∗ = ρπs πs,t + ρπf πf,t + (1 − ρπs − ρπf )πm,t                                    (13)

   8
      Our model has zero trend inflation. Ascari (2004) shows that, in the absence of full indexation, the
Calvo staggered price model is not super-neutral when trend inflation is considered.
    9
      Interest rate smoothing behavior by central banks and its benefits are well documented (Clarida et al.,
1998). Mohanty and Klau (2005) find that developing countries central banks also put substantial weight on
interest rate smoothing. The formulation of the monetary policy rule with interest rate smoothing is similar
to that used by Clarida et al. (1999).

                                                                    11
3.5       Exogenous Shock Processes

   We assume that productivity shocks in the food sector follow an AR(1) process. Firms in
the sticky price sector face similar AR(1) productivity shocks but are also subject to mark-up
shocks that reflect rent-seeking behavior that is typical in developing economies. This is a
departure from models that only feature productivity shocks in the relevant sectors. Firms
in the export sector face terms of trade shocks as they are price takers and face international
market prices that are determined exogenously. This shock is similar to a productivity shock
to the production of export goods. The structure of the export sector allows us to encompass
the setup of Frankel (2008). To sum up, there are four shocks in the model, with innovations
to each of them drawn from i.i.d. normal distributions:

3.6       Welfare Evaluations

   Our objective is to determine the policy rule that yields the highest level of lifetime utility
as a weighted sum of households’ welfare, which can be written as Vtotal = λVtf + (1 − λ)Vtn .
We compute the second-order accurate consumer welfare measure under different monetary
policy regimes as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004, 2007).10 Since the prior literature
concludes that strict core inflation targeting is the welfare maximizing policy rule, we use
that as the benchmark to evaluate the welfare gains (or losses) associated with alternative
policy regimes. We define ω, the welfare gain from adopting an alternative policy rule, as
the fraction that has to be added to the strict core inflation targeting regime’s (denoted by
r) consumption process to yield a level of aggregate welfare equivalent to that under regime
  10
       For a justification of this approach and more details, see Anand and Prasad (2010).

                                               t=0

   A positive value of ω means that welfare is higher under the alternative policy rule. The
welfare gain ω is given by

percentage point of permanent consumption under the alternative policy regime.


3.7     Parameter Selection

   Parameter selection for the model is a challenging task. There is no consensus on the
values of some parameters and those used in the literature are mostly based on micro data
from advanced countries. We pick baseline parameters from the existing literature and then
do extensive sensitivity analysis with respect to the choice of key parameters.
   We choose β = 0.99, which amounts to an annual real interest rate of 4 percent. We
assume that λ = 0.4, implying that 40 percent of households in the economy are credit
constrained, consistent with the data in Table 2. We use σ = 2 as the baseline value of
the risk aversion parameter, a value most commonly used in the literature on developing
economies (Aguiar and Gopinath, 2007; Devereux et al., 2006; Garcı́a-Cicco et al., 2010).
   Following Basu and Fernald (1995) and Basu (1996), we choose θ = 11 (elasticity of
substitution between the differentiated goods), implying a markup of 10 percent in the
steady state. We set the probability that a price does not adjust in a given period (α) at
0.66 (Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997). This implies that prices remain fixed for a mean
duration of 3 quarters, consistent with the microeconomic evidence for both developing and
advanced economies.11 The appropriate value of the Frisch elasticity ( ψ1 ) is both important
  11
     Evidence from Brazil (Gouvea, 2007), Chile (Medina et al., 2007), Mexico (Gagnon, 2009), and South
Africa (Creamer and Rankin, 2008) indicates that the frequency of price adjustment is much higher for food

                                                       13
and controversial. For our benchmark case we assume it to be 0.33 (ψ = 3).12 For the
monetary policy parameters, we follow Galı́ et al. (2004) and Mohanty and Klau (2005) and
choose ρ = 0.7, φπ = 2, and φy = 0.5.
    An important feature of developing countries is the high share of food expenditure in total
household expenditures. To calibrate the subsistence level food consumption parameter C ∗
and the weight on food in the consumption index γ, we assume the average expenditure
on food is around 42 percent (consistent with household surveys in developing countries).
We further assume that on average one third of households’ steady state food consumption
is required for subsistence, enabling us to match estimates of the income elasticity of food
consumption (about two-thirds).13 As the demand for food is inelastic, we set η = 0.6 for
the baseline case. Along with the subsistence level of food consumption, this implies a price
elasticity of the demand for food of around -0.3 in the steady state, which is close to the
USDA estimate.
    The major argument in favor of excluding food from the core price index is that the shocks
to that sector are seasonal and transient. We set the value of the AR (1) coefficient of the food
sector shock at 0.25 (implying that the shock has low persistence, which seems reasonable
given the heavy dependence of agriculture on transitory weather conditions). Following the
literature, we set the value of the AR(1) coefficient of the nonfood sector shock at 0.9 (Aguiar
and Gopinath, 2007). The volatility of productivity shocks in developing countries is higher
than in advanced countries (Pallage and Robe, 2003; Garcı́a-Cicco et al., 2010). We set the
standard deviation of the food productivity shock σaf = 0.03 and the standard deviation of
the nonfood productivity shock σas = 0.02. We follow Devereux et al. (2006) in calibrating
the persistence and standard deviation of the terms of trade shock and choose ρs = 0.77


than for nonfood products and that price adjustments are less frequent during periods of low to moderate
inflation. Since our model has no trend inflation and we impose price stickiness only in the nonfood sector,
our parameter choice is consistent with the results of these studies.

4         Baseline Results

     While it is not our objective to match specific moments, the incomplete markets version
of our model more closely matches the properties of business cycle fluctuations in developing
economies relative to advanced economies.14 For instance, with the baseline parameters and
shock processes, the incomplete markets model delivers inflation (for both food and nonfood
commodities) that is higher and more volatile than in the complete markets model. This
is consistent with the empirical findings of Fraga et al. (2004), Bowdler and Malik (2005),
and Pétursson (2008) that developing economies have more volatile inflation than advanced
ones. Consumption is more volatile than output in the incomplete markets model, while
the reverse is true in the complete markets model. This matches the findings of Aguiar and
Gopinath (2007) and Kose et al. (2009) that consumption is more volatile than output in
developing economies, while the opposite holds (as anticipated based on the consumption
smoothing motive) in advanced economies.
     We now present the conditional welfare gains associated with different policy rules in our
model. We include all four shocks–productivity shocks to two sectors, mark-up shocks, and
terms of trade shocks–when we do the welfare calculations discussed below.
     Table 4 shows the welfare comparisons from targeting different price indices under com-
plete and incomplete market settings, and also the sectoral weights for constructing the
optimal price index in each case. With complete markets, the optimal price index puts the
entire weight on the sticky price sector, with zero weights on food and traded goods, making
it identical to core inflation targeting. Targeting headline inflation slightly reduces welfare.
Thus, under complete markets, the choice of targeting strict core inflation is the best policy
    14
         These results are not reported in detail here but are available from the authors.

                                                         15
and dominates targeting of broader price indexes, as in Aoki (2001) and Benigno (2004).
   However, with incomplete markets, this result no longer holds. The second column of
Table 4 shows that headline inflation targeting is now welfare improving relative to core
inflation targeting. Targeting the optimal price index yields a slightly higher welfare gain
than targeting headline inflation.15 The optimal price index assigns a weight of two-thirds
to the sticky price sector and one-third to food prices. This result is a marked departure
from the prior literature based on complete markets, wherein the optimal weight on food
prices would be zero. On the other hand, it is consistent with the Benigno (2004) result
(and, implicitly, the results of Aoki, 2001, and Mankiw and Reis, 2003) that the weight on
the traded goods sector is zero. That sector has flexible prices and agents in that sector have
access to financial markets, so the classical result is confirmed.
   To investigate these results more carefully, we analyze the responses of key variables to
a food productivity shock because shocks to that sector highlight the relevance of market
completeness. Figure 1 plots the impulse responses of various macroeconomic variables to a
one percent negative food productivity shock under complete markets. Each variable’s re-
sponse is expressed as the percentage deviation from its steady state level. Impulse responses
under a strict core inflation targeting rule are shown by the solid lines. The dashed lines
are impulse responses under a strict headline inflation targeting rule. The strict headline
inflation targeting regime results in a slightly higher volatility of consumption and output.
Also, the policy response is more aggressive under strict headline inflation targeting, which
leads to a further decline in output. These results are similar to those documented in the
existing literature on inflation targeting.
   Following an increase in inflation, the central bank raises interest rates, reducing aggre-


  15
     The welfare gains are larger than those typically reported in models calibrated to advanced economy
data. One reason is that developing economies have more volatile output and consumption than advanced
economies. Secondly, the financial frictions that we include our model imply that monetary policy can have
an even greater impact in terms of reducing the consumption volatility of different household types, which
can in some cases be higher than aggregate consumption volatility.

                                                   16
gate demand (as consumers postpone their consumption following an increase in interest
rates) and, thus, inflation. So, under complete markets, stabilizing core inflation is equiv-
alent to stabilizing the output gap (Aoki, 2001) and there are no additional welfare gains
from adopting headline inflation targeting. Thus, core inflation targeting is the welfare
maximizing policy choice for the central bank.
   However, in the presence of credit constrained consumers, headline inflation targeting ap-
pears to be a better policy choice. Figure 2 plots the impulse responses of various macroeco-
nomic variables to a one percent negative food productivity shock under incomplete markets.
Aggregate demand responds differently to monetary tightening under strict core inflation tar-
geting and headline inflation targeting. The central bank is now able to effectively control
aggregate demand by increasing interest rates only when it targets headline inflation. Ag-
gregate demand, instead of going up slightly, goes up sharply in response to the shock if
the central bank follows strict core inflation targeting. Thus, headline inflation targeting
outperforms core inflation targeting as the former is more effective at stabilizing output.
   In order to examine the mechanics behind this result, we look at the properties of ag-
gregate demand under incomplete markets. In the presence of financial frictions, the con-
sumption choices of different households vary (as opposed to complete markets, where the
consumption choice of each household is identical). While the consumption demand of un-
constrained households is responsive to interest rates (as they optimize intertemporally), the
consumption demand of credit-constrained households is independent of interest rate changes
and depends only on their current period wage income. Since only a fraction of aggregate
demand is influenced by interest rate changes, a monetary tightening does not automatically
mitigate the increase in aggregate demand. The response of aggregate demand crucially
depends on the behavior of credit-constrained households.
   Figure 2 shows that, following a negative shock to food productivity, the central bank
raises the interest rate, lowering the demand of unconstrained households (as it is optimal



                                             17
for them to postpone consumption). However, it has no bearing on the demand of credit-
constrained consumers. An increase in the relative price of food following a negative food
productivity shock increases the wage income and, therefore, consumption demand of credit-
constrained households. Thus, the demand of the two types of households moves in opposite
directions following a negative shock to food productivity.
    Which of the two demands dominates is determined by the policy regime. Under core
inflation targeting, the increase in food prices (and, therefore, the wage income of food sector
households) is higher than under headline inflation targeting. This higher wage income
translates into higher consumption demand by credit-constrained consumers (who consume
all of their current wage income), more than compensating for the lower consumption demand
of unconstrained consumers. Consequently, aggregate demand rises. By contrast, when the
central bank targets headline inflation, price increases in the food sector are lower and the
rise in income and, therefore, the increase in consumption demand in that sector is smaller.
Thus, monetary intervention is effective in achieving its objective of controlling aggregate
demand only when the central bank targets headline inflation.
    To formalize the above arguments, we examine the log-linearized aggregate demand equa-
tion, which is given by:16

                                (1 − λ)ζs
                      ĉt = −             Et (R̂t − π̂t+1 ) + Et ĉt+1 − λζf Et ∆ĉf,t+1              (16)

             C¯f                                                                                        C¯s
where ζf =    C̄
                   is the steady state share of food sector households’ consumption and ζs =             C̄

is the steady state share of nonfood sector households’ consumption.
    Furthermore, from the optimal labor supply of food sector households, we have:

                                                     a
                                               1+   ψ
                                                                   a(1 + ψ1 )
                                     ĉf,t =        aσ   x̂f,t +         aσ     Âf,t                 (17)
                                               1+   ψ
                                                                    1+   ψ


  16
     Aggregate demand is the sum of the log-linearized consumption demand of households in the two sectors.
Variables with a hat denote log deviations from corresponding steady state values.

   Equations (16) and (17) suggest that, in the presence of credit-constrained consumers,
there is a link between aggregate demand and the relative price of food (xf,t ). In this setting,
relative prices affect aggregate demand in addition to aggregate supply.17 Thus, the presence
of financial frictions implies that managing aggregate demand requires the central bank to
choose a policy regime that would limit the rise in wages of credit-constrained consumers
(and, therefore, the increase in their demand).


4.1       Alternative Monetary Policy Rules

   Next, we evaluate a broader range of monetary policy rules that are employed by de-
veloping (and advanced) economy central banks. The monetary policy rule employed even
by inflation targeting central banks typically includes the output gap, so we now consider
whether flexible inflation targeting delivers better welfare outcomes than strict inflation tar-
geting.
   The first row of Table 5 shows the baseline result–all three inflation targets (optimal,
headline and core) under strict inflation targeting, i.e., with zero weight on the output gap.
In the second row, we compare all three inflation targets (core, headline, and optimal weights)
under flexible inflation targeting, i.e., with a positive weight on the output gap. The results
show that the ordering of the different rules in terms of welfare gains relative to core inflation
targeting is preserved. Moreover, the weights on the different sectors in the optimal price
index are essentially the same.
   In the third row, we compare flexible headline and flexible optimal inflation targeting
against strict core inflation targeting. The two flexible inflation targeting regimes still out-
perform strict core inflation targeting. However, comparing the first and third rows, it is
evident that adding the output gap into the monetary policy rule leads to lower welfare gains

  17
       Under complete markets, relative prices only affect aggregate supply (Aoki, 2001).

                                                      19
than strict targeting versions of those rules. The reason is that in the sticky price sector the
output gap, defined as the level of output relative to trend, and inflation move in the same
direction. A negative productivity shock leads to a drop in output and an increase in infla-
tion in this sector. Therefore, adding the output gap into the monetary policy rule weakens
the central bank’s response to deviations of inflation from the target value. To confirm this,
we also conducted an experiment where we included the output gap coefficient in the search
for the optimal rule. Consistent with the results noted above, the optimal coefficient for the
output gap is zero.18



5        Sensitivity Analysis and Extensions

     In this section, we report results from a variety of experiments to test the robustness of
our results to changes in the values of key parameters and certain aspects of the structure
of the model. Our results held up quite well to changes in values of most parameters, so
in the discussion below we focus on the elements of our model that represent significant
deviations from the prior literature. It should be noted that, since the steady state values
of the models differ, it is only possible to make a comparison across regimes and not across
different models.


5.1      Sensitivity to Key Parameters

     One of the key parameter settings in the model is the proportion of households in the
economy that are in the food sector and face credit constraints. As the share of households
in this sector rises, welfare gains from headline inflation or optimal inflation targeting decline
relative to core inflation targeting (see Table 6, Panel A). This might seem counter-intuitive

    18
     This finding is consistent with the result of Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007). We also experimented
with including the real exchange rate directly in the optimal inflation target, and found that the coefficient
on this variable was zero (we tried including it in different ways–the current level, lagged level, and changes).
Similarly, when we added the export price to the optimal inflation target, the weight on it was zero.

                                                       20
as these households lack access to credit. The mechanism for this result is as follows. When
the share of rural households is larger, under our parameter assumptions they will be poorer
on average while the nonfood sector households will be richer. For a given drop in agricultural
output, the relative price of food goes up by less when the consumption of food (above the
subsistence level) by nonfood sector households is larger. When the share of rural households
is small, the food consumption of households in the nonfood sector is also small in the steady
state. Therefore, to accommodate a drop in food production, the relative price responds
sharply.19
    An important assumption in the model is the subsistence level of food. As noted earlier,
this constraint does not bind in equilibrium but reduces the elasticity of substitution between
food and nonfood goods. When there is no subsistence level of food consumption, the
weight of food in the optimal inflation target is small and core inflation targeting actually
delivers higher welfare than headline inflation (see Table 6, Panel B). As the subsistence level
goes up, the weight of food in the optimal inflation index rises and core inflation targeting
becomes inferior to headline inflation targeting. Note that in our model the total share of
food consumption is pinned down based on empirical estimates for developing economies.
A higher subsistence level of food therefore implies a lower level of nonsubsistence food
consumption. Therefore, for any given amount of drop in the food output, market clearing
necessitates a larger increase in the relative price of food. As a result, the higher is the
subsistence level of food, the more volatile the impulse responses will be and the larger the
welfare gain from headline inflation targeting.
    An alternative approach to including a subsistence level of food in the utility function
would be to directly pick a lower value for the elasticity of substitution between food and
nonfood goods. Dropping the assumption that there is a subsistence level of food and

  19
      Reducing the share of food sector households even further leads to implausibly large welfare gains, but
this is because we have pinned down the average share of food expenditures in total household expenditures
to be 0.42. Economies with small shares of rural households tend to be richer economies with substantially
lower food shares in total expenditure.

                                                     21
lowering the elasticity to 0.38 yielded results similar to our baseline results. However, our
approach is more realistic for developing economies. Empirical evidence shows that the
income elasticity of food consumption is smaller than one in developing economies, which
suggests it is more likely that food consumption is driven by the subsistence level.20
   Another crucial parameter in the model is the share of food in total household consump-
tion expenditures. When this share is small, the optimal inflation target puts most of the
weight on the sticky price sector. Core inflation targeting then delivers higher welfare than
headline inflation targeting, and the gains from targeting the optimal inflation index are
modest. As the food share rises, the optimal inflation index involves an increasing weight on
food prices. When food accounts for half of total consumption expenditures on average, the
gains from headline inflation targeting become large and the optimal inflation index puts
nearly the entire weight on food prices. This result appears at odds with one of the results
in Mankiw and Reis (2003). They find that “the more important a price is in the consumer
price index, the less weight that sector’s price should receive in the stability price index.”
The incomplete markets structure of our model and the low elasticity of substitution between
food and nonfood account for the difference between our result and theirs. However, our
result that the weight on food prices is zero is true when markets are complete irrespective
of the share of food in consumption expenditures, consistent with a different proposition in
their paper–that sectors with more flexible prices should get a lower weight.
   We also experimented with changing the degree of price rigidity in the sticky price sector
(see Table 6, Panel C). Consistent with Mankiw and Reis (2003) and Benigno (2004), we
find that the weight of the sticky price sector in the optimal price index increases with the
degree of price stickiness.




  20
    See Anand and Prasad (2010) for more discussion. As noted earlier, the income elasticity of food
consumption is equal to one minus the subsistence ratio so the model without subsistence level assumption
cannot match the data for developing countries.

                                                   22
5.2       Financial Frictions

   In the baseline model, we assume that food sector households face strong financial fric-
tions, turning them into hand-to-mouth consumers. We now relax this assumption by in-
troducing a portfolio holding cost for these households, enabling us to vary the extent of
(common) financial frictions they face.21 When the portfolio holding cost is zero, rural
households have the same degree of access to the bond market as nonfood sector households.
It is important to note that this is not equivalent to having complete financial markets. When
the portfolio holding cost is very high, rural households hold zero bonds and the economy
converges to the baseline case.
   In the full access (but still not complete markets) scenario, food prices do enter with a
positive weight in the optimal price index, although this weight is substantially smaller than
in the baseline incomplete markets scenario. However, the welfare gain from targeting the
optimal price index is small relative to core inflation targeting as the bonds give food sector
households the ability to smooth consumption intertemporally although they cannot fully
insure against sector-specific shocks.


5.3       Common Productivity Shocks

   Finally, we consider the case where there are only aggregate rather than sector-specific
productivity shocks. To this point, we have focused on the impact of a shock to productivity
in the flexible price sector as it most clearly illustrates the point about what monetary policy
rule is better in response to a shock to the flexible price part of the economy. Of course,
while the impulse responses that we analyzed highlight different models’ responses to only
a food productivity shock, the simulation results include all shocks.
   We recomputed the model with a productivity shock common to the food and the non-
food domestic goods sectors (and, as before, markup and terms of trade shocks as well).

  21
       The results discussed in this subsection and the next one are available from the authors.

                                                      23
Intuitively, this should increase the welfare gain from targeting inflation in the headline CPI
or the optimal price index as there are no longer any shocks specific to the rigid price sector.
This is indeed what we find, confirming our main results. The results were similar whether
the common productivity shock was transitory (food sector shock) or more persistent (sticky
price sector shock). Besides, food prices consistently have a significant weight in the optimal
inflation target.



6     Concluding Remarks

    Previous research has concluded that optimal monetary policy should focus on offsetting
nominal rigidities by stabilizing core inflation. However, those results rely on the assumption
that markets are complete and that price stickiness is the only source of distortion in the
economy. In this paper, we have developed a more realistic model for developing economies
that has the following key features–incomplete markets with credit-constrained consumers;
households requiring a minimum subsistence level of food; low price elasticity of the demand
for food; and a high share of expenditure on food in households’ total consumption expen-
diture. We nest models such as those of Aoki (2001) and Benigno (2004) as special cases of
our model.
    We show that the classical result about the optimality of core inflation targeting can
be overturned by introducing financial frictions. In the presence of credit-constrained con-
sumers, targeting core inflation no longer maximizes welfare. Moreover, stabilizing inflation
is not sufficient to stabilize output when markets are not complete. Under these conditions,
headline inflation targeting improves welfare. Our model also allows us to compute optimal
price indexes that maximize welfare. The optimal price index includes a positive weight
on food prices but, unlike headline inflation, generally assigns zero weight to import prices.
This is because agents in that sector have access to financial markets and, unlike in the case



                                              24
of food, the price elasticity of the demand for goods produced in this sector is high.22
   One possible extension of our model is to include money explicitly. While this provides
a saving mechanism for hand-to-mouth consumers, it would also strengthen the case for
headline inflation targeting to preserve the value of monetary savings. Another extension
would be to include physical capital in the model. This highlights a practical dilemma that
developing economy central banks often grapple with in pursuit of their objective of price
stability. For instance, raising policy rates to deal with surging food price inflation can hurt
industrial activity. While raising interest rates in response to a transitory negative shock to
agricultural sector productivity might seem counter-intuitive, our results suggest that such
a policy could in fact be welfare improving in an incomplete markets setting in which food
consumption accounts for a large share of household consumption expenditures.




  22
    Looking beyond the CPI, Erceg et al. (2000) find that in the presence of wage stickiness optimal
monetary policy should target the nominal wage. Reinterpreting the sectors in the Mankiw-Reis (2003)
model as including a labor sector with nominal wage rigidities yields similar results.

consumption gains relative to the respective benchmark target. Strict inflation targeting
refers to the monetary policy rule that only responds to inflation changes while flexible
inflation targeting allows for responses to output fluctuations.
