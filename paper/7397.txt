Teenage Childbearing and Its Life Cycle Consequences:
Exploiting a Natural Experiment

NBER Working Paper No. 7397
October 1999
                                         ABSTRACT

         In this paper, we exploit a “natural experiment” associated with human reproduction to
identify the effect of teen childbearing on subsequent educational attainment, family structure, labor
market outcomes and financial self-sufficiency. In particular, we exploit the fact that a substantial
fraction of women who become pregnant experience a miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) and thus
do not have a birth. If miscarriages were purely random and if miscarriages were the only way, other
than by live births, that a pregnancy ended, then women, who had a miscarriage as a teen, would
constitute an ideal control group with which to contrast teenage mothers. Exploiting this natural
experiment, we devise an Instrumental Variables (IV) estimators for the consequences of teen
mothers not delaying their childbearing, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
1979 (NLSY79). Our major finding is that many of the negative consequences of not delaying
childbearing until adulthood are much smaller than has been estimated in previous studies. While we
do find adverse consequences of teenage childbearing immediately following a teen mother’s first
birth, these negative consequences appear short-lived. By the time a teen mother reachers her late
twenties, she appears to have only slightly more children, is only slightly more likely to be single
mother, and has no lower levels of educational attainment than if she had delayed her childbearing
to adulthood. In fact, by this age teen mothers appear to be better off in some aspects of their lives.
Teenage childbearing appears to raise levels of labor supply, accumulated work experience and labor
market earnings and appears to reduce the chances of living in poverty and participating in the
associated social welfare programs. These estimated effects imply that the cost of teenage
childbearing to U.S. taxpayers is negligible. In particular, our estimates imply that the widely held
view that teenage childbearing imposes a substantial cost on government is an artifact of the failure
to appropriately account for pre-existing socioeconomic differences between teen mothers and other
women when estimating the causal effects of early childbearing. While teen mothers are very likely
to live in poverty and experience other forms of adversity, our results imply that little of this would
be changed just by getting teen mothers to delay their childbearing into adulthood.

1.   Introduction

       There is growing concern in the United States about the number of children born to teen-

age mothers and the proportion of these births that occur out of wedlock. In reaction to these

trends, a report by the National Research Council concluded, “adolescent pregnancy and child-

bearing are matters of substantial national concern” (Hayes, 1987, p. ii). Part of the concern over

teenage childbearing in the United States stems from its apparent adverse impacts on teenage

mothers. Over the past several decades, social scientists have documented a strong association

between the age at which a woman has her first child and the economic and social indicators of her

subsequent well-being. Most of these studies find that women who bear children as teenagers are

subsequently less likely to complete high school, less likely to participate in the labor force, more

likely to have low earnings, and less likely to marry than are women who do not have children as

teenagers. The apparent adverse consequences of teenage childbearing for the educational attain-

ment and skill development of the mother are particularly problematic in light of mounting evi-

dence that the earnings prospects of unskilled workers have declined substantially over the last

20 years (see Bound and Johnson 1992; Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce 1993). As a result, adolescent

mothers, and their children, are likely to spend a substantial fraction of their lifetimes in poverty

(see Upchurch and McCarthy, 1990, and Card, 1981).

       As has been highlighted in the current debate over reforming the U.S. welfare system, teen-

age mothers and their children constitute a growing proportion of those receiving various forms of

public assistance. Government programs, such as the Aid to Families with Dependent Children

(AFDC) program, have become a major source of support for the children of teenage mothers.

Thus, the apparent costs of teenage childbearing are not borne solely by the teenage mothers, but

also by U.S. taxpayers. Moreover, because teenage mothers work less over their lifetimes, these



                                                 1
women will end up contributing little to the tax revenues needed to finance the governmental as-

sistance they receive.

       Unfortunately, estimating the causal effects of teenage childbearing is not straightfor-

ward. The evidence typically cited is based on the observed statistical association between early

childbearing and the subsequent socioeconomic attainment of teenage versus non-teenage moth-

ers. This evidence may reflect a causal influence of early childbearing on the outcomes of teen-

age mothers. Alternatively, it may simply reflect differences between the type of women who

bear children as teens and those that avoid this. Presumably if the two groups of women are sub-

stantially different in other aspects that effect socioeconomic outcomes, then it is difficult to as-

sess whether the birth or these other factors are responsible for the poorer outcomes of teenage

mothers relative to other women.

       At issue is how to obtain reliable estimates of the causal effects of teenage childbearing,

i.e., the answer to the following question: What would have been the adolescent mother’s (be-

havioral) outcome if she had not had a child as a teen? For obvious reasons, the use of experi-

mental methods is simply not an option for conducting this evaluation. One cannot conduct trials

in which teenage women are assigned or denied children via a randomizing mechanism. Conse-

quently, the design for studies of the effects of teenage childbearing must be based on nonex-

perimental (or quasi-experimental) methods. Such methods are subject to the challenge of selec-

tion bias, i.e., that selective differences between women who have children as teenagers and

those who do not bias estimate of causal impacts.

       A number of econometric strategies have been used in the literature on the effects of

teenage childbearing to deal with selection bias. The most common approach used is to control

for observable characteristics (race, family structure, etc.) in order to account for the differences




                                                 2
between teen mothers and the women to which they are compared. (See Waite and Moore

(1978), Card and Wise (1978), Hofferth and Moore (1979), Upchurch and McCarthy (1990),

Marini (1984), and McElroy (1996) as examples of this strategy.) This approach requires that,

conditional on observed differences between teen mothers and the comparison groups used to

measure counterfactual outcomes, births are random. Clearly, this is a strong assumption and, as

we show below, it’s validity is dubious. A second econometric approach models the joint process

determining the woman’s decision to bear a child as a teenager as well as the maternal outcome

of interest (education, labor supply, poverty status, etc.). (See Ribar, 1992, Ribar, 1994, and

Lundberg and Plotnick, 1989, as examples of this strategy.) Such studies typically rely on a ra-

tional choice framework that suggests that it is women with lower returns to work and education

that have children as teens. Such models maintain a different, but equally strong, set of assump-

tions in order to identify the effects of early childbearing. A third approach employed in the past

uses the outcomes of an adolescent mother’s sisters who did not have a child as a teenage to con-

struct counterfactual outcomes for teen mothers. (See Geronimous and Korenman, 1992, and

Hoffman, Foster, and Furstenberg, 1993.) The validity of this method requires that, within a fam-

ily, births are random to sisters. In the presence of changing circumstances within a family, such

as the wealth of parents or what they learn about their children over time, this assumption will

not be met.1

         In an innovative paper, Grogger and Bronars (1993) make use of a “naturally-occurring”

experiment to estimate causal effects of early childbearing.2 In particular, they make use of the


1
  Hao, Hotz, and Jin (1999) develop a game-theoretic model of parental-daughter interactions over teenage child-
bearing decisions in which parents differentially treat older versus younger daughters so as to reduce the incidence
of teen births. Their empirical tests reject the results that births are random across daughters within the same family.
2
  Bronars and Grogger (1995) use this same twins strategy to identify the causal effect of women having an extra
birth out-of-wedlock on the socioeconomic attainment of such mothers.



                                                           3
fact that some teenage mothers have twins at their first birth rather than a single child. Since

twins are beyond the control of the mother, twins can be viewed as randomly assigning some

teenage mothers an “extra” child. By comparing teen mothers whose first birth is twins to those

whose first birth is a single child, Grogger and Bronars estimate the effect of an extra child on a

range of socioeconomic outcomes of teen mothers. As long as twins are random, the differences

in outcomes between teen mothers with twins and those with a single birth measure the causal ef-

fect of an extra child without the intrusion of selection bias.

       The causal effect identified in the work of Grogger and Bronars is somewhat different

than in the research of others. Typically studies have focused on the effect on maternal outcomes

of having at least one child as a teenager relative to having no children as a teenager. Grogger

and Bronars argue that if an extra child lowers the outcomes of teen mothers that the effect of

having any child as a teen is likely to be at least as large. Grogger and Bronars (1993) also make

an important contribution when they distinguish the immediate consequences of an extra birth (0

to 3 years after the birth) from the longer-term consequences (10 to 13 years after the birth). An

important finding from their work is that many of the negative consequences measured just after

the birth of the extra child diminish over time.

       In this paper, we exploit a different “natural experiment” associated with human repro-

duction to identify the causal effect of teenage mothers not delaying their childbearing on their

subsequent educational attainment, family formation, labor market success, and poverty status.

In particular, we exploit the fact that a substantial fraction of women who become pregnant expe-

rience a miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) and thus do not have a birth. If miscarriages were

purely random and if miscarriages were the only way, other than by live births, that a pregnancy

ended, then women, who had a miscarriage as a teen, would constitute an ideal control group




                                                   4
with which to contrast teenage mothers. These women would randomly end their pregnancy with

no child while women who had no miscarriage would randomly end their pregnancy with a

child.3 In reality, these ideal conditions do not hold. For example, pregnancies can be terminated

by induced abortions, a choice that is elected by as many as 25% of teenage women who become

pregnant (see Alan Guttmacher Institute, 1994). But, as argued below, we can still exploit the

occurrence of spontaneous abortions (i.e., miscarriages) as an Instrumental Variable (IV) to

identify the effect of teenage childbearing on the same socioeconomic outcomes considered by

Grogger and Bronars (1993) and the other studies in this literature. Moreover, elsewhere4 we

show that this IV estimator is robust to a range of other sources of “contamination” of the “mis-

carriage-as-a-natural-experiment” used in this paper.

        In the next section, we describe the data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,

1979 (NLSY79) that we use in this study. In Section 3, we lay out our use of miscarriages as a

natural experiment and show how it can be used to form an Instrumental Variable estimator for

the effect of teen births on maternal outcomes. Therein, we also consider the threats to our infer-

ences due to the possibility that some miscarriages are not random and that fertility events, espe-

cially miscarriages and induced abortions, are likely to be under reported in survey data. We dis-

cuss how we deal with these complications in this paper and report on findings from our previous

work.

        In Section 4, we present our basic findings of the effect of teenage childbearing on human

capital development, family structure, poverty, and self-sufficiency. Our major finding is that

3
  Notice the contrast between the miscarriage and non-miscarriage groups more closely measures the contrasts be-
tween having a birth as a teenager versus not doing so than does the contrast of an “extra” child generated by the
twins “natural experiment”. However, both our work and Grogger and Bronars measure only the effect of teenage
childbearing among women willing to give birth while the literature as a whole has concentrated on the effect in the
population of all women. In Section 6 we investigate whether our results differ from the literature as a whole be-
cause of this sample selection.




                                                         5
many of the negative consequences are smaller than estimated elsewhere in the literature and are

short lived. In fact, over the life course, teenage childbearing may actually aid human capital de-

velopment. In Section 5, we compare our IV estimates with the most common statistical method-

ology employed in previous studies, namely, regression methods that control for differences in

observable characteristics of early childbearers and women who did not become mothers as

adolescents. These comparisons strongly suggest that the negative consequences previously at-

tributed to teenage childbearing are, in fact, the result of the many unobserved disadvantages not

accounted for by observable background characteristics. Finally, in Section 6, we use our esti-

mates of the causal effects of teenage childbearing to estimate the cost to taxpayers of teenage

childbearing. In Section 7, we offer some concluding comments on our analysis.

2.     Data and Samples Used

           In this study, we use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to

estimate the causal effects of teenage childbearing in the United States. The NLSY79 is a nation-

ally representative sample of young men and women who were between the ages of 14–21 years

old in 1979. Thus, the women in our study were teenagers (i.e., from 13-17) during the years

1971 and 1982. Respondents have been interviewed each year since 1979. We make use of data

through the 1993 interview in our analysis. The female respondents were asked a range of ques-

tions about all of their pregnancies and births, as well as about their marital arrangements, edu-

cational attainment, labor force experiences, family income and participation in various welfare

programs.

           The NLSY79 contains a random sample of women in the U.S. population who were be-

tween the ages of 14-21 in 1979 along with supplemental samples of blacks, Hispanics, disad-

4
    See Hotz, Mullin and Sanders (1997).



                                                 6
vatnaged whites and women who were enlisted in the military in 1979. Some of our analysis is

based on data from the random sample and the supplemental samples for blacks and Hispanics.5

This sample—which we refer to as the All Women Sample—contains a total of 4,728 women.6

We summarize the data for the All Women Sample in Table 1. Therein, we divide the sample

into teen mothers and women who did not have births as a teenager and then compare estimates

of a number of background characteristics taken for the most part when these women were age

14.7 As is clear from this table, teen mothers come from much more disadvantaged backgrounds

than do women who delay childbearing. For example, teenage mothers grew up in homes that

were poorer. The average annual income of the households in which teenage mothers lived in

1978 was $9,512 versus $17,669 for their counterparts. Teen mothers had parents who were less

educated. The fathers of women who later became teenage mothers completed an average of

only 9 years of school versus 11 years of schooling for the fathers of other women. They were

more likely to grow up in single-parent families (41 percent versus 22 percent). In addition they

were more likely to have been in a family living on welfare when growing up (26 percent versus

15 percent) than women who did not have a child as a teen. Clearly, teenage mothers are differ-

ent than women who delay childbearing into adulthood in many ways we can observe.

         As noted in the Introduction, we exploit the random occurrence of spontaneous abortions

(miscarriages) in order to devise a natural experiment for identifying causal effects of teenage

childbearing on the subsequent socioeconomic attainment of teen mothers. To implement this

5
 Where appropriate, we use sampling weights provided with the NLSY79 to account for the use of the minority
oversamples.
6
 The random sample and black and Hispanic supplementary samples from the NLSY79 contained 3,108, 1,067, and
751 women, respectively, for a total of 4,926 women. Of this total, we excluded data on 198 women for whom there
was insufficient information to determine the timing of their pregnancies or the resolutions of their first pregnancies.
7
  The two exceptions to this in Table 1 are the annual income of the household in which a woman resided, which
was taken in 1978, and the woman’s score on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT), which was administered
to all women in the NLSY79 in 1981.



                                                           7
natural experiment, we will focus on a subset of the women in the All Women Sample who re-

ported that they experienced their first pregnancy prior to their eighteenth birthday. (We elabo-

rate on the reasons for and implications of using this subsample below.) We refer to this subsam-

ple as the Teen Pregnancy Sample. This sample contains data on 980 women, of which 727

(74.2%) had a pregnancy that ended in a birth, 185 (18.9%) that ended in an induced abortion,

and 68 (6.9%) that ended in a miscarriage. The characteristics of the latter sample are presented

in Table 2. We briefly compare the characteristics of the All Women and Teen Pregnancy Sam-

ples drawn from the NLSY79. Note that the characteristics of teen mothers from the All Women

Sample (see Table 1) are extremely similar to teenage mothers in the Teen Pregnancy Sample

(see in Table 2).8 However, the subsample of women who miscarry, which will form the basis

for a comparison group for teen mothers in our natural experiment, are quite different from the

women who are not teen mothers in our All Women Sample. (Other studies typically use the

latter women as their comparison group for teen mothers.) Clearly the socioeconomic status of

women who become pregnant as teens and miscarry (Table 2) is much lower than that of women

who are not teen mothers (Table 1). Finally, it is worth noting that women who become pregnant

as teens and who abort are very similar to women who do not become pregnant prior to age 18 in

terms of pre-pregnancy socioeconomic status (Table 2). It is equally true that they are very simi-

lar in pre-pregnancy socioeconomic status to women who do not have a birth prior to age 18

(Table 1). This similarity is important for understanding why the estimates of causal effects of

teenage childbearing derived from our natural experiment tend to differ from the previous lit-

erature. While previous studies have attempted to “adjust” for these observable differences when


8
  For teenage mothers, the difference between these two samples is only from the time dating convention used. Both
samples contain women who had a child prior to their 18th birthday. The Teen Pregnancy Sample also includes as
teenage mothers women who became pregnant just prior to their 18th birthday who carried the pregnancy to term
after their 18th birthday.



                                                        8
estimating the causal effects of teenage childbearing with regression-based methods, such meth-

ods need not account for differences in other characteristics that we cannot measure with existing

data. Therefore, we now turn to how our natural experiment based on the existence of randomly

occurring miscarriages can be used to obtain an appropriate comparison group to measure the

counterfactual outcomes for teen mothers.

3.     The Use of Miscarriages as a Natural Experiment (and as an Instrumental Variable)

          The use of experimental designs to estimate causal effect, via random assignment of

treatment status, eliminates the problem of selection bias by ensuring that treatment and com-

parison groups have, on average, the same outcomes in the absence of “treatment.” In our con-

text, a perfect control group would consist of women who are like teenage mothers in all ways

except that they do not have a child. In this section, we discuss how we can exploit a natural ex-

periment in which women who are pregnant as teenagers but experience spontaneous abortions,

or miscarriages. We outline the assumptions required for this natural experiment to identify the

causal effect of teenage childbearing and the consequences for our analysis if they are violated.

          Consider the population of women who first become pregnant as adolescents and, thus,

are at risk to become a teen mother. (We shall assume that adolescence is ages between 12 and

18.) Among this set of women, a pregnancy can be resolved in one of three ways: the occurrence

of a birth, an induced abortion or a miscarriage. Let D be the indicator of how the pregnancy is

resolved, where D = B (birth), A (abortion), or M (miscarriage). For now, assume that miscar-

riages are beyond the control of women, while the births and abortions represent choices by

those who did not experience a miscarriage.9 Among women who experience miscarriages, we

define a woman’s latent status as how a woman would choose to resolve a pregnancy if she did

9
    We note that most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy so that they almost always occur before women



                                                        9
not experience the miscarriage. Let D* = B* if a woman’s latent-status is to have a birth and D*

= A* if her latent status is to have an abortion. Finally, let Y denote outcomes women experience

as an adult age, i.e., at ages greater than 18, and Yk (k = B, A, or M) denote the outcome condi-

tional on the way in which the pregnancy was resolved, and Yk* (k* = B* or A*) denote the out-

come that would occur if a woman had a particular latent pregnancy status.10 The outcomes asso-

ciated with latent statuses are hypothetical in that the econometrician can not observe a woman’s

latent type.

           We define the causal effect of interest in this paper as the average effect of a woman

having a birth as a teen versus delaying it—either to an adult age or permanently—on adult out-

comes for the population of women whose first birth is as a teen. More precisely, we are inter-

ested in identifying (and estimating)

                                          β = E (YB − YB* D = B)                                                       (1)

Angrist and Imbens (1991) refer to this type of causal effect as the selected average treatment

effect (SATE), where “selected” refers to the fact that the causal effect applies to a selected

population.11 (In our context, the selected population is women who have their first births as a

teenager.) Because of this selectivity in the population and the fact that we do not presume that

pregnancies are random events, we can not make inferences about the causal effects of early

childbearing for a randomly chosen teenage woman in the United States.12 Nonetheless, identi-

fying the causal effect defined in (1) is of interest for at least two reasons. First, as we will argue


could choose to have an induced abortion.
10
     To simplify notation, we forego indexing outcomes by particular adult age at which they are measured.
11
   In the evaluation literature (see Heckman, 1992), this effect is also referred to as the effect of the “treatment on the
treated.”
12
  By analogy to the program evaluation literature, the causal effects we focus on are analogous to making inferences
of the effect of a program on those who choose to participate and need not apply to a randomly selected individual
being required to participate in program. See Heckman (1992) for a discussion of the distinctions between and use-



                                                           10
below, β is more readily identified from available data than the more speculative causal effect of

the consequences of a teen birth to a randomly selected woman from the population of all

women, regardless of teen childbearing status. Second, identifying β enables one to assess the

potential consequences of completely eliminating teenage childbearing in the U.S. Determining

such effects provide a benchmark against which to judge the potential benefits that could be de-

rived from any particular policy mechanism directed at reducing the incidence of teenage child-

bearing. In Section 6, we use our estimates to provide a quantitative assessment of such potential

benefits to U.S. taxpayers.

         It is apparent from (1) that the problem of estimating β centers on the identification of

E(YB*D=B), since E(YBD=B) is readily obtained from data on women who had their first births

as teenagers. Ideally, one would like to use data on Y for women who have miscarriages as teens

but for which D* = B*. Unfortunately, we cannot identify the members of this group. However,

we do observe the outcome for women who miscarry, denoted by YM, which provides some in-

formation about the YB*’s. In particular, E(YM) is equal to

                                  E (YM ) = P* E (YB* ) + (1 - P*) E (YA* ) ,                  (2)

where the weighting factor, P*, is the proportion of pregnant women who would have had a birth

if they not miscarried. Solving (2) for the average outcome for latent-birth women, E(YB*), we

obtain

                                                E (YM ) - (1 - P*) E (YA* )
                                   E (YB* ) =                               .                  (3)
                                                            P*

While E(YM) can be identified (and consistently estimated) from observable data on women who

have a miscarriage as a teen, we cannot identify (or readily estimate) either E(YA*) or P* since



fulness of various treatment effect definitions.

they, too, require knowing the latent status of women who miscarry as teens.

           However, under additional behavioral assumptions, we can achieve identification of β by

exploiting the occurrence of miscarriages as a natural experiment. In particular, suppose that the

following conditions hold:

       (i) all miscarriages are random,
      (ii) all fertility events are correctly reported,
     (iii) having a miscarriage or abortion has the same effect on Y, since neither event results in a
           birth as a teenager,

If all miscarriages are random and all fertility events are correctly reported—i.e., assumptions (i)

and (ii) hold—then the fraction of women who would have carried the pregnancy to term among

women who miscarried, P*, must equal the fraction of women who did carry the pregnancy to

term among women who do not miscarry, P. That is, P* = P.13 Furthermore, if only the existence

of a child affects outcomes—i.e., assumption (iii) holds—then, on average, the outcomes for

women who have abortions will be equal to all women in the latent-abortion group. That is,

E(YA*) = E(YA).14 Under these conditions, E(YB*) is equal to:

                                                 E (YM ) - (1 - P ) E (YA )
                                    E (YB* ) =                              .                                      (4)
                                                            P

It follows that β can be written as a function of statistics which can be identified (and, thus,

readily estimated) from observable data. In particular,




13
   This would be true if the fate of the fetus is determined at the time of conception. In reality miscarriages and
abortions occur throughout the nine months of pregnancy. We have used an adjustment to account for the longer ex-
posure time to miscarriages for fetuses being carried to term relative to aborted fetuses with little effect on the re-
sults.
14
  In the program evaluation literature this is referred to as the “No Hawthorne Effect” assumption, namely, that the
random assignment affects outcomes only through the treatment provided. In our context, this assumption implies
that only the presence (or absence) of a child affects maternal outcomes.

spectively, and 0 otherwise.15

           Given the definition in (5), it follows that a simple Instrumental Variables (IV) estimator

can be formed for β. Let Y~M denote the sample mean of Y for those observations that do not ex-

perience a miscarriage, YM denote the sample mean for those observations that do experience a

miscarriage, and P̂ denote the sample proportion of women who do not experience a miscar-

riage. Then it follows that an IV estimator for β is

timator in (6), require that conditions (i)-(iii) hold. Epidemiological evidence suggests that (i)

and (ii) do not hold and condition (iii) is a strong assumption about the influence of miscarriages

on a woman’s subsequent behavior. While the physiology of miscarriages implies that some mis-

carriages are truly random events,16 some may be induced by pre- and within-pregnancy behav-

iors of women. In particular, epidemiological studies find that smoking and drinking during

pregnancy, the use of an IUD at conception and conceiving very young, at less than 16 years of

age, all increase the likelihood that a woman miscarries.17 Such behaviors may be correlated with

subsequent outcomes, Y, thereby compromising using miscarriages as a natural experiment (or an

instrumental variable) for analyzing the causal effect of early childbearing births. Other factors,

such as a woman’s socioeconomic status, her nutrition, or her drug use, have not been shown to

increase rates of miscarriage.18

           There also is evidence that abortions and possibly miscarriages are underreported in sur-

vey data. Jones and Forrest (1992) find that induced abortions are underreported in the

NLSY79—the data source used in this study—by comparing the incidence of abortions reported

by NLSY79 respondents with data on numbers of abortions performed in the U.S. The latter data

is gathered annually by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in a survey of abortion providers in the

U.S. and is thought to provide reliable estimates of the incidence of abortions in the U.S. While

the accuracy of reporting on miscarriages in survey data is more difficult to verify, data from




16
   Some miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) are the result of the abnormal formation of the chromosomes of a hu-
man fetus and occur at random. As a result of such abnormalities, the fetus is not viable and is expelled from the
womb early in a pregnancy. See Klein, Stein and Susser (1989) for more on the physiology of spontaneous abor-
tions.
17
     See Klein, Stein and Susser (1989) for a summary of this evidence.
18
  It should be noted that the effect of these factors on birth weight is well documented. See Klein, Stein and Susser
(1989).

U.S. Vital Statistics suggests that this fertility event also is underreported in surveys.19 As dem-

onstrated in Hotz, Mullin and Sanders (1997), underreporting of such events can lead to bias

when using the IV estimator proposed in (6).

         A systematic assessment of the consequences of violations of conditions (i) through (iii)

for estimating the causal effects of teenage childbearing is undertaken in Hotz, Mullin and Sand-

ers (1997). Therein, these authors show that one cannot point identify the casual effect in (1)—

and, thus, ensure the consistency of the IV in (6)—without knowledge of the latent-statuses of

women who experience miscarriages. However, they do show that one can form non-parametric

bounds on β, even when none of these conditions hold. Furthermore, these bounds are tight as

defined by Horowitz and Manski (1995) and can be derived and non-parametrically estimated

using auxiliary information to form lower bounds on the proportion of miscarriages which are

random and upper bounds on the incidence of underreporting in surveys of abortion and miscar-

riage events. In their empirical investigation on a subset of outcomes examined here (educational

attainment, annual hours of work and labor market experience. More importantly, the estimated

bounds for the latter two outcomes turn out to be informative in that they are sufficiently tight to

enable rejection of null hypotheses on the signs of the causal effects, such as the lower bound on

the estimated effect of teenage childbearing on earnings is not less than zero. Thus, while the

conditions needed to ensure that using miscarriages as an instrumental variable for teen births

may not hold, any violations do not appear to bias the qualitative inferences drawn from esti-

mates of causal effects of teenage childbearing on the adult outcomes of teen mothers.20


19
  U.S. Vital Statistics reports suggest that approximately 45% of pregnancies of teenage women end in births and
41% end in abortions. This implies that 14% of pregnancies to women in this age group end in miscarriages. As one
can see from Table 2, the proportion of women in the NLSY79 who reported that their teenage pregnancy ended in a
miscarriage is only 6.9%.
20
   We note that it is unclear whether it is empirically important that condition (i) is violated, i.e., that some miscar-
riages are not random. If miscarriages were random then characteristics unaffected by the miscarriage (race, etc.)


                                                          15
        In the next section, we present three sets of IV estimates of the causal effects of teen

births on a woman’s adult outcomes. One set consists of the simple IV estimator defined in (6).

Note that this estimator is equivalent to estimating the following regression equation,

                                         Yia = α a + β1,a B%i + ε ia ,                                           (7)

where Yia denotes the outcome for the ith woman when she is age “a”, εia is a disturbance term

and β1,a is the age-specific causal effect defined (1). Using M% i to instrument B%i , we produce IV

estimates, βˆ1,IVa , given in (6). We also present IV estimates that control for various sets of covari-

ates, Xia, via the regression function

                                    Yia = α a + β 2, a B%i + θ ′ X ia + ε ia ,                                   (8)

and again using M% i to instrument for B%i . We report IV estimates of β2,a for two sets of covari-

ates: one that includes a set of behavioral factors known to be related to miscarriages and another

set that includes these behavioral factors plus personal and family background characteristics of

the ith women measured prior to a woman’s first teenage pregnancy. The first set includes vari-

ables, such as smoking, drinking and use of an IUD prior to the pregnancy,21 that epidemiologi-

cal studies have found to influence the incidence of miscarriages. We control for them to mini-

mize potential bias in our IV estimators of causal effects that might arise because some miscar-


should in expected value be equal between women who miscarry and women who do not. Table 3 presents the same
background characteristics as presented in Tables 1 and 2 except we now divide the Teen Pregnancy Sample into
two groups—women who miscarried their teen pregnancy and women who did not. Examining the mean of the 9
pre-pregnancy background characteristics, in no case is the mean for women who miscarry statistically different
than for women who do not miscarry.
21
  The NLSY79 records smoking and drinking behavior of teenagers. Unfortunately the data on contraceptive use is
recorded only for pregnancies that end in births. Therefore we can only condition on smoking and drinking behavior
but not on IUD use. This is unlikely to bias our results as the use of an IUD among teenagers is extremely rare. In
1988, of women less than age 18 who were sexually active on an on going basis 38% used the pill, 29% used con-
doms, 28% used no contraception and only 5% used any other form of birth control including the IUD (See AGI re-
port, 1994). Given the relative risk of pregnancy from these contraceptive practices the proportion of teenage preg-
nancies that occurred while using an IUD is very small. Further it is not clear that IUD use would be correlated with
adult outcomes such as educational attainment.



                                                            16
riages may have been behaviorally-induced. In the second set of covariates, we include the back-

ground characteristics listed in Tables 1 and 2 in order to improve the efficiency of the IV esti-

mators of causal effects.

        Because we have a small number of women who have miscarriages in our data, we also

present a third set of IV estimates in Section 5 based on the following, more parsimonious, speci-

fication of the regression function in (8)

 Yia = α + η1ai + η2 ai2 + K + ηK aiK + β 0 B%i + β1 B%i ⋅ ai + β 2 B%i ⋅ ai2 + K + β J B%i ⋅ aiJ + θ ′ X ia + ε ia ,   (9)

where ai denotes the adult age at which the outcome, Y, is measured and K and J are the orders of

the age polynomials used for this particular outcome. In this specification, M% i and its interac-

tions with age polynomials are used to instrument for B%i and its interactions with the woman’s

age. While the use of these interactions with age polynomial potentially distort the causal effect

of teenage childbearing for outcomes at particular ages, we employ them in an attempt to in-

crease the precision of our estimates of causal effects and the power of statistical tests on their

significance.

        Finally, for all of the regressions in which we pool data across different ages for the same

woman, we correct for temporal dependence in the estimated standard errors of parameter esti-

mates using the method of Huber (1967).

4.   Estimates of the Causal Effects of Delaying Childbearing on Adult Outcomes among
     Teen Mothers

        In this section we present the estimated effects of teenage childbearing on: (a) indicators

of human capital accumulation; (b) sources of financial support, (c) measures of poverty; and (d)

indicators of family structure. These are the outcomes that have been examined in previous

studies of the effects of teenage childbearing on mothers. We distinguish between two types of



                                                              17
effects of early childbearing on a teenage mother’s subsequent socioeconomic status: permanent

effects and those that represent temporary substitution of behaviors over the life course. Even if

teenage childbearing raises the cost of some activities in the short-run, there is scope for substi-

tution between activities at some point in time and over time. A key question we address is

whether teenage mothers substitute activities in order to minimize the impact of a teenage birth

on their lives.

           Table 4 presents estimates of the long-term impact of teenage childbearing. The table

presents the effect of teenage childbearing on maternal outcomes measured when the women is

28 years old, more than 10 years after the birth of her first child.22 Column 1 of Table 4 presents

the non-parametric IV estimates defined in (6). Column 2 presents estimates of effects that con-

trol for smoking prior to pregnancy, drinking prior to pregnancy and age at conception.23 Column

3 contains IV estimates that also are for a number of background characteristics that may be cor-

related with maternal outcomes.24 Finally, column 4 provides estimates based on the specifica-

tion in (9) where age is entered as a polynomial. In general, the estimates are extremely similar

across specifications.

           While previous studies have concluded that teenage childbearing has negative effects on

human capital development, we find little evidence to support this. We do find modest evidence

that having a child as a teenager lowers the rate of high school completion. Our non-parametric

IV estimate in Column 1 shows that teen childbearing lowers the probability of completing high

22
     This is the oldest age at which all cohorts of women in the NLSY79 are observed.
23
   Ideally we would like to know the number of cigarettes and the amount of alcohol consumed during pregnancy
since there is evidence that there is a dose-response in miscarriages to both factors. Unfortunately, the NLSY79 asks
these specific questions only of women whose pregnancies ended in live births. Therefore we rely on information
collected elsewhere in the survey as to whether the women smoked or drank alcohol at all as this information is col-
lected on all women.
24
  The means of background characteristics used in the regression analysis are given in Table 2. Again these are used
only to increase the precision of the estimates.



                                                          18
school by 11 percentage points, but this effect is not statistically significant. However, once we

condition on background characteristics, we find that teen childbearing lowers the probability of

completing high school by 15 or 16 percentage points, a result that is statistically significant at

the 0.10 level.25 In contrast, teenage childbearing increases the rate of completion of the General

Equivalence Diploma (GED) substantially. Our non-parametric estimate suggests that teen

childbearing raises the probability of completing a GED by 18 percentage points an effect that is

strongly significant and one that suggests that teenagers do not receive less education but instead

substitute the GED for a high school diploma. In fact, taking high school diplomas and GEDs to-

gether, we find that there is no significant causal effect of early childbearing on the probability

that teen mothers obtain a high school level education. (Our point estimate is small and positive

but statistically insignificant.) That is, teen mothers do not seem to receive less education; rather,

they appear to substitute one form of high school completion for another.26

        The differences in the estimated effects of teenage childbearing on these two alternative

forms of high school completion are somewhat surprising in light of recent findings on the ef-

fects of the GED. Cameron and Heckman (1993) find that the value of the GED in the labor

market is minimal, with its recipients earning no more than high school dropouts. But their

analysis is only for men. More recent evidence, for women, find that the labor market returns for

those with a GED are no different than those a high school diploma (see Cao, Stromsdorfer and

Weeks, 1996). What remains to be determined is whether this result also hold for the subset of

women who become teen mothers. While this paper does not address this issue, our findings for

25
  As discussed, the rate of high school completion does not change after age 20. The point estimate of the impact of
teenage childbearing on high school completion does not change after age 21 but since nearly all NLSY79 respon-
dents are observed at age 21 the precision of the estimated impacts is greater at this age than at latter ages. Since
other outcomes are likely to vary over the life cycle we estimate other outcomes at age 28.
26
  The GED is granted upon the successful completion of an examination which tests competency in a basic high
school curriculum. The GED does not require a fixed class schedule and may offer teenage mothers substantial



                                                        19
the effects of early childbearing on the labor market outcomes of teen mothers, to which we turn

below, are not inconsistent with the equivalence of GED and high school graduation effects

found in Cao, Stromsdorfer and Weeks (1996).

         Row 4 of Table 4 displays the estimated effects of early childbearing on the number of

hours worked at age 28. We estimate that teenage mothers work 369 more hours at age 28 than

they would have if they delayed childbearing. Row 5 reports that between the birth of the first

child and age 28 teen mothers accumulate more than 2,600 hours more of labor market experi-

ence than they would if they delayed childbearing until adulthood. The effect of teenage child-

bearing on both hours worked at age 28 and the cumulative number of hours-worked by that age

are statistically different than zero at the 0.05 level. Far from causing a life of idleness, teenage

mothers work much more than they otherwise would have if they delayed their childbearing into

adulthood. These estimated effects are not trivial in magnitude. On average, teenage mothers

work approximately 1,000 hours per year at age 28 and 820 hours per year over their 20s. Our

estimates suggest that delaying childbearing would lead to more than a 35% decline in hours

worked at age 28 and cumulatively would lead to almost three less typical work years of labor

market experience by age 28.27 This additional work experience appears to have payoffs in terms

of subsequent wage rates. Our non-parametric estimates indicate that teenage childbearing raises

wages (of working women) by $4.32 per hour. This result is essentially unchanged after control-

ling for a large set of background characteristics. However, the impacts estimated from our re-

gression that models the effects on wages as a polynomial in age suggests a more modest (and



flexibility in study time.
27
  The specifications with age polynomials suggest that teenage childbearing raises hours worked at age 28 by 303
hours and cumulatively raises hours worked up to age 28 by 1732 hours. These estimates are somewhat lower than
the non-parametric IV estimates but are still qualitatively large and still indicate that teenage childbearing does not
lower but raises labor supply.



                                                         20
statistically insignificant) increase in wages of $1.63 per hour. In any case, there is no evidence

that teenage childbearing harms the long-term employment or earnings potential of women al-

though there is some ambiguity of whether it helps.

        Recall that the estimated effects on these labor market outcomes are the result of com-

paring the behavior of women who have their first births as teens to those who are forced to de-

lay their childbearing because they experienced a miscarriage. Studies of women’s labor supply

patterns typically show that women work less when their children are very young and more when

the children get older. Consequently, the estimated effects of early childbearing on hours worked

at age 28 reflect, in part, differences in the timing of the childbearing between teen mothers and

the comparison group of women who had miscarriages. It is likely that women who began child-

bearing later in life will rejoin the labor force after completing their delayed childbearing and

narrow the gap in hours worked at older ages. However, it is unlikely that any advantage of teen

mothers in accumulated labor market experience will completely disappear. Many studies have

shown that the presence of young children and wages are paramount to female labor force par-

ticipation. For most women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, do not have

young children present age 30. Given that we find that the wages of teen mothers are higher at

age 28, these wage gains are likely to persist to older ages because of the additional previous la-

bor market experience teen mothers have acquired relative to what would have happened if they

had delayed their childbearing.28

        Row 7 of Table 4 provides estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing on the financial

support available to teen mothers at age 28. At that age, teen mothers earned $9,269 a year more

than they would have if they had delayed childbearing. Much of this earnings advantage is due to

28
  If the return to a high school degree is substantially higher than a GED then the wages of women who delay
childbearing may be greater than those of teen mothers. This question remains unresolved.



                                                    21
the 369 more hours they worked at age 28. But as Row 6 reports there is also a substantial gap in

the average wage paid to teen mothers. This is consistent with a human capital interpretation in

which the 2,605 more cumulative hours worked is more valuable than the amount of human

capital potentially lost by receiving a GED rather than a regular high school diploma. Estimates

of the effect of teenage childbearing on two other major sources of support for poor families,

earnings from a husband (Row 8) and public assistance (Row 9), are not sizeable or statistically

different from zero at age 28. In fact, while not statistically significant, all point estimates indi-

cate that at age 28 teenage mothers use less public aid than if they had delayed childbearing.

Since welfare participation tends to fall with the age of a woman’s children and the children of

teenage mothers are, on average, older than they would be if these mothers delayed childbearing,

it is not surprising that teenage mothers receive no more (or even less) public aid at older ages.

The fact that support from a husband is unaffected by teenage childbearing is in large part due to

the lack of an effect of teenage childbearing on the probability of being married at age 28 (Row

11).29

         While we show below that there are important effects of teenage childbearing at early

adult ages, it is unclear whether teenage childbearing has any permanent, or long run, effects on

family size or family structure. Ten years after the first child of a teen is born, our point estimate

suggests that a teen mother is likely to have 0.30 more children than if she delayed childbearing

(Row 13) and this estimate is not statistically significant.30 Our point estimates suggest that hav-

ing a child as a teenager raises the probability of having any children by age 28 by 13 percentage


29
   In general, the regressions using age polynomials show similar results. The one exception is that while all non-
parametric models indicate no effect of teenage childbearing on spousal income, the regressions using age polyno-
mials suggest that teenage childbearing raises support from a spouse. This result is difficult to reconcile with the
finding in all specifications that there is no effect of teenage childbearing on marriage at age 28.
30
  We investigate below whether this reflects that total family fertility of women who delayed childbearing is in-
complete while teenage mothers have completed their families.



                                                        22
points (Row 10) relative to avoiding childbearing as a teen, but again this is statistically insig-

nificant. In other words, our point estimate suggests only 13% of women who delayed child-

bearing would not have had at least one child by age 28 and we can not reject that the fraction of

women with children is unaffected by teenage childbearing. This limits the scope for teenage

childbearing to affect the incidence of single motherhood at age 28. In fact, while our point esti-

mate suggests that teenage childbearing raises the probability of being a single mother by 5 per-

centage points (Row 12) at age 28, this effect is statistically insignificant. We can not reject that

teenage childbearing does not effect the probability of being a single mother in the long run.

        We next examine the effects of teenage childbearing on several indicators of the financial

well-being of teen and their families. We examine three separate measures of financial well-

being: whether the family’s income falls below the federal poverty threshold (Row 14), whether

they participate in the Federal food stamps program (Row 15), and whether they participate in

the AFDC program (Row 16) when the mother is 28 years old. Based on our non-parametric es-

timator, not delaying childbearing until adulthood does not significantly affect the incidence of

poverty or of the likelihood of receiving either form of public assistance. Based on the causal ef-

fects estimates derived from the age-polynomial interaction specification in (9), we find that

teenage childbearing lowers AFDC participation by 4 percentage points, lowers food stamp par-

ticipation by 15 percentage points and lowers the poverty rate by 14 percentage points when the

mother is age 28. Since the poverty line is a function of family size and family earnings, that

teenage childbearing lowers poverty is consistent with teenage childbearing increasing family

size little while it raises earnings a great deal.

        Tables 5 through 8 explore the effects of teenage childbearing over a woman’s life

course. These tables allow us to compare the effects of teenage childbearing in the short and long




                                                     23
runs. In each table, we present our least restrictive model, the non-parametric model conditioning

on no covariates and then the most restrictive model, the model with all covariates that allows

the effect of teenage childbearing to vary as a polynomial function of age. In general, the point

estimates, at most ages, are similar for the two specifications. However, the additional restric-

tions of the latter specification tend to yield smaller standard errors on the estimated coefficients.

           Table 5 examines the effect of teenage childbearing on family structure. Columns 2 and 3

report the effect of teenage motherhood on the number of children in the women’s family and

Columns 4 and 5 contain estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing on the probability of

having any children. Since all teenage mothers have children, Columns 4 and 5 can also be inter-

preted as the fraction of latent-birth women who, at each age, have had a child. What is clear is

that the delay in fertility is quite short for the majority of latent-birth women. The non-parametric

estimates suggest that at age 18 (by her 19th birthday), typically 1 to 1.5 years after a miscarriage,

only 59% of latent-birth women remain without a child. At age 19, only 47% of latent-birth

women remain without a child. However, a small minority of women—approximately 16 per-

cent—delays childbearing more than 10 years.31 Because of the generally high fertility among

latent-birth women, the effect of teenage childbearing on the number of children in a woman’s

family is never more then 0.70 and declines to 0.30 in her late 20’s. Teenage childbearing does

seem to increase family size in the short-run, but, to a large degree, having births early in life is

offset by having fewer births later in life.

           In Table 4, we found little evidence of a long-run effect of teenage childbearing on single

motherhood. Columns 8 and 9 of Table 5 provide estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing

on single motherhood at all ages between 18 and 28. Our non-parametric results suggest that at


31
     This implies a lower bound of 4.4 years for the average delay in childbearing.



                                                           24
ages 18 and 19 being a teenage mother increases the chances of being a single mother by 32 per-

centage points and 30 percentage points respectively. However, there is no evidence that teenage

motherhood effects the rate of marriage at any age (Columns 6 and 7). The higher rate of single

motherhood among teen mothers is caused simply by their higher rate of motherhood. As latent-

birth women who delayed childbearing begin having their children, they are as likely to have

children outside of marriage as teen mothers are to be raising their children outside of marriage.

The effect on single motherhood is strong in the late teen years but quickly dissipates. Further, it

is entirely driven by the effect of teenage childbearing on the timing of fertility and not at all by

the timing of marriage.

       Table 6 presents estimates of the effect of teenage childbearing on hours worked. We ar-

gued earlier that, by age 28, teenage mothers are working substantially more hours than if they

had delayed childbearing. In fact this pattern is detected much earlier in the life course. By their

mid 20s, teenage mothers are working substantially more hours than their counterparts who de-

layed childbearing and the additional number of hours they work grows over their twenties and

into their thirties. Our non-parametric (parametric) estimates suggest that at age 22 teenage

mothers work 284 (175) more hours than women who delay childbearing. In their thirties, teen-

age mothers work closer to 400 (300) hours more per year than women who delay childbearing.

By age 30 teenage mothers have accumulated nearly 3,000 (1,900) more hours of work experi-

ence. This is the result of teen mothers consistently working several hundred more hours per year

than they would have if they had delayed their childbearing. There is little evidence that teenage

childbearing ever lowers a teen mother’s wages. In the short run, there is no significant effect of

teenage childbearing on wages and in the long run there is some weak evidence that teenage

childbearing raises wages. The non-parametric estimates (Column 6) suggest that by her late 20’s




                                                 25
teenage childbearing raises a teenage mother’s wages by $3 to $5 per hour while the parametric

estimates (Column 7) suggest a more modest rise of $1 to $2 per hour. The non-parametric esti-

mates are usually statistically significant for ages between 26 and 30.

        Teenage childbearing appears to lead to an increase in labor supply and labor market ex-

perience, which leads to a modest increase in wages. Together these factors raise the earnings of

a teenage mother a great deal. Table 7 presents estimates of how teenage childbearing changes

the sources of support for these mothers at different ages. At ages older than 19, both our non-

parametric (Column 2) and parametric (Column 3) point estimates suggest that teen mothers earn

substantially more than they would have if they had delayed childbearing. After age 24, our non-

parametric (parametric) estimates suggest that teen mothers typically earn $6,000 to $9,000

($5,000 to $7,000) more annually than if they had delayed childbearing. Usually these estimated

effects are statistically significant.

        There is no evidence that teenage mothers draw substantially less support from spouses.

As discussed earlier, the chance of being married at any age is unaffected by teenage childbear-

ing. Hence the husbands of teenage mothers would have to earn less than the husbands of women

who delay childbearing if teenage childbearing is to lower the financial support from a husband.

In fact, at older ages there is some evidence that teenage mothers derive substantially more sup-

port from their husbands than if they had delayed childbearing. We have no ready explanation

for this finding, but it is consistent with teenage mothers being more attractive mates because of

their apparently higher levels of human capital acquired through work experience.

        Finally, it is worth noting that there is little support, at any age, that teenage childbearing

increases the amount of financial support received in the form of public assistance. Our point es-

timates suggest that in their late teens and early twenties teenage mothers receive somewhat




                                                  26
more public assistance than they would have if they delayed childbearing. However, in their late

twenties and early thirties they receive substantially less public support than they otherwise

would have if they had delayed childbearing.32 In particular, the parametric estimates recorded in

Column 7 indicate that, on average, teen mothers receive $800 to $1,000 more per year when

they are ages 18 to 21 but then years later, at ages 28 to 30, receive $1,000 to $2,000 less per

year than comparable women who delay childbearing to adulthood.

        Finally, in Table 8, we present estimates of the effects of teenage childbearing on three

measures of the poverty status of teen mothers, namely, the incidence of family earnings below

the federal poverty threshold (Columns 2 and 3), participation in AFDC (Columns 4 and 5) and

participation in Food Stamps (Columns 6 and 7). Given very small changes in family structure

and positive changes in earnings it is not surprising that teenage childbearing does not seem to be

associated with increases in poverty in either the short-run or long-run. In fact, in general our

point estimates suggest that teenage childbearing somewhat reduces poverty and the use of pub-

lic assistance at older ages. In interpreting these findings it is important to realize that at age 18,

45 percent of women who are not teenage mothers (latent-birth women) live in poverty and by

age 20 over sixty percent of these women live in poverty. The poverty rate among these women

are astoundingly high even in the absence of a teenage birth. Since many women who delay

childbearing do so for only a few years, it is very likely that when these women have children

they will be in circumstances very similar to those of the teenage mothers.

        Our results for the effects of early childbearing on the use of public aid are similar to

those on the incidence of family poverty. The parametric estimates on Food Stamp use (Column

32
  When we restrict the age-polynomial teen-birth interaction in (9) to be cubic in age when estimating the effects of
teenage childbearing on AFDC and food stamp payments, each term in the age polynomial is statistically significant.
This suggests that public assistance payments to teenage mothers are larger than women who delay when teenage
mothers are in their early 20’s but become smaller than women who delay when teenage mothers are in their late



                                                        27
7) suggest that while teenage childbearing may raise the use of Food Stamps at age 18 by 8 per-

centage points, the increased use of Food Stamps dissipates quickly. Ten years after the birth of

her first child a teen mother’s rate of Food Stamp use is actually 15 percentage points lower than

comparable women who delay childbearing until adulthood. Interestingly, there does not seem to

be an effect on AFDC participation (Column 5) at any age. This suggests that lower reliance on

public aid for teen mothers later in life is largely a result of less Food Stamp use not more use of

AFDC, the program targeted to single mothers. An Examination of Estimated Effects from IV

Estimation and OLS Estimation

        In this section we explore the differences between the empirical strategy we have em-

ployed to generate the above results with those used in previous analyses. One way of character-

izing the differences across the methods is in how each forms a comparison group with which to

compare the outcomes of teen mothers. The natural experiment we have exploited above makes

use of data on women who became pregnant as a teen and uses those who had a miscarriage to

compare with women who had a teen birth. The most prevalent strategy used in previous studies

is to “regression adjust” for differences between teen and non-teen mothers so that the adjusted

latter group is more comparable to the former, net of teenage childbearing for teen mothers. In

this section, we analyze how these two groups differ and the consequences of these differences

for estimates of the impact of teenage childbearing on the adult outcomes of mothers.33

        Using data on women who experienced a miscarriage as a teen to estimate the causal ef-

fects of teenage childbearing differs from previous studies that employ the “control for observ-

able differences” strategy differ in two important ways: the samples used and the instrumenting


20’s.
33
   In analyses not reported here, we have also compared our natural experiment results using sister-pairs data in
which sisters who did not have a teen birth are used as a comparison group for the outcomes of sisters that did have
a teen birth. Such results are available from the authors upon request.



                                                        28
of teen births. With respect to samples, our natural experiment restricts the analysis to data on

women who become pregnant as teens; studies that rely on the regression-adjustment approach

typically use for all women, including both those who do and do not become pregnant as teens.

Note that it is possible that a comparison group consisting of women who became pregnant as

teens but did not have a teen birth is more comparable to teen mothers than all women, even

without using miscarriages to instrument for births.34 In Table 9, we present estimates of the ef-

fects of teenage childbearing for the same set of outcomes and the same age (28) as was pre-

sented in Table 4. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 give estimates of the teen birth effect based on or-

dinary least squares (OLS) estimation of the specification in (8). Recall that this specification in-

cludes a set of pre-pregnancy characteristics to control for pre-existing differences across the

samples used in the estimation. The estimates in Column 1 are for the All Women Sample, i.e.,

they include teen mothers and women who did not have a birth (and possibly a pregnancy) as a

teen. Column 2 displays the corresponding OLS estimates based on using the Teen Pregnancy

Sample, i.e., women who did become pregnant as teens. Finally, Column 3 of Table 9 reproduces

the IV estimates that controlled for the same set of covariates as the OLS regressions. (This third

column is reproduced from Column 3 of Table 4.)

         Comparing Columns 1 and 3, we see that restricting the sample to women who became

pregnant prior to age 18, even without using an instrument for teen births, does result in esti-

mates of the effects of teenage childbearing that are closer to the corresponding IV estimates.

34
  While not discussed in the text, we also examined whether the estimates and inferences about the effects of teen-
age childbearing were sensitive to the particular age criteria for inclusion in our sample of women who became
pregnant as a teen. Recall that women were included in our analysis sample if they became pregnant prior to her 18th
birthday. However, some women who first became pregnant prior to their eighteenth birthday gave birth just after
their eighteenth birthday (within nine months). One small difference between our sample of teenage mothers and
that in other studies is that we include these women as teenage mothers while other studies include only women
whose birth occurred prior to their 18th birthday. We experimented with using different ages for this criteria, such as
including women whose first pregnancy occurred before they reached their 19th birthday. With the exception of our
estimates for receipt of a high school diploma, varying this age criteria had a negligible effect on our IV estimates or



                                                          29
That is, eliminating women who were never pregnant as teens appears to yield a comparison

group that is more comparable to teenage mothers than can be obtained by using all women and

trying to use regression adjustments to eliminate all of the pre-existing differences between the

latter group of women and teen mothers. However, this sample restriction alone is not enough to

make the OLS and IV estimates comparable.35 For example, the OLS estimates (on a sample re-

stricted to women who became pregnant prior to age 18) still imply that teenage childbearing

lowers hours worked by 102 hours, lowers accumulated hours worked by 2,379 hours, lowers

earnings by $6,441 dollars, lowers wages by $2.28 per hour and raises the poverty rate by 13

percent. For these particular outcomes, our IV estimates in Column 3 imply conclusions about

the effects of teenage childbearing that are dramatically different. The IV estimates imply that, at

age 28, teenage childbearing raises hours worked by 333 hours, raises accumulated hours

worked by 2,029 hours, raises earnings by $8,488 dollars and lowers the poverty rate by 12 per-

cent.36 For many of the other outcomes, the IV estimates imply that that teenage childbearing has

either a much smaller negative impact or even a positive impact of teenage childbearing relative

to the OLS estimates when the samples used are the same (i.e., consist of women who became

pregnant prior to age 18).

        To illustrate the differences between the IV and OLS estimates over the life cycle, we

present, in Figures 1 through 5, predicted values for various outcomes of teen mothers implied

by these two alternative estimation strategies. The predicted values denoted by diamonds trace


the inferences derived form them.
35
   One exception is that the effect of teenage childbearing on the rate of high school completion is similar for the
OLS and IV models on the sample of women who become pregnant prior to age 18 (-0.16) but the effect in the sam-
ple of all women is far more negative (-0.41). This occurs largely because the high school completion rate among
teen mothers in the sample of women who were pregnant prior to their eighteenth birthday is higher than the rate
among teen mothers in the all women sample.
36
  Regressions in which age is restricted to enter the model as a polynomial (columns 5 and 6) suggest the same dif-
ference between the OLS and IV estimates



                                                        30
out the actual outcomes for teenage mothers. The predicted counterfactual outcomes, based on

OLS estimates derived from the All Women sample, are denoted triangles and the counterfactual

predicted outcomes, based on IV estimates, are depicted with squares in the various figures.37

Looking across these figures, one sees the dramatic differences in the inferences one would draw

about the consequences of teenage childbearing, depending on the method used. While these dif-

ferences, by themselves, do not definitely prove that using miscarriages to instrument for teen

births is preferred to the methodology most commonly used in previous studies, such differences

do prove two things: the method one uses matters greatly and that selection bias is a real issue

when estimating the causal effects of teenage childbearing. Based on what we consider to be the

compelling rationale for our miscarriages-as-a-natural-experiment provided in Section 3 above,

we think there is a strong case for concluding that much of the previous literature has drawn se-

riously flawed inferences about the consequences of teenage childbearing in the U.S.

5.     The Cost to Government of Teenage Childbearing

           One of the concerns that has been expressed about the teenage childbearing “problem” in

the U.S. is the cost it imposes on society through the heightened use of public assistance by teen

mothers. Given the estimates of the effects of teen childbearing, and the fact that they are quali-

tatively different than those found in most previous studies, we re-examine, in this Section, these

costs. Regardless of what method is used for estimating the effects of teenage childbearing, it is

important to distinguish between what society spends on teen mothers in the form of public as-

sistance, and the portion of these expenditures that can be attributed to the failure of these

women to delay their childbearing. To make this distinction clear, we use our estimates of causal

effects to estimate what the government spends each year on public assistance for women who

37
     The counterfactual outcomes are constructed by adding the treatment effect at each age implied by the OLS and



                                                        31
became mothers as teens and what they would save if these women delayed childbearing. We

estimate both the direct costs that government incurs for teen mothers on public assistance pro-

grams as well as these costs net of the taxes that women who were teen mothers will pay at vari-

ous stages of their lifetimes. Obviously, the taxes paid by teen mothers must finance more than

just what they incur in expenditures on public assistance programs. But given our finding that the

effect of early childbearing is to raise the labor market earnings of teen mothers at older ages, it

is worthwhile to determine the extent to which the taxes these women pay “cover” the cost to

government in public assistance over their lifetimes.

         We attempt to calculate as comprehensive an estimate of the public assistance costs that

are incurred by teen mothers as possible. From the NLSY79, we have data on annual benefits re-

ceived from AFDC and Food Stamps, as well as the benefits from other social programs, in-

cluding the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and General Assistance (GA) programs. An-

other important form of public assistance for teen mothers is the medical care they and their chil-

dren often receive under the Medicaid program.38 While information is not available in the

NLSY79, we also attempted to estimate the dollar value of the public assistance teen mothers re-

ceive in the form of medical care through this program.39 We added these derived estimates for


IV models in which age is entered as a polynomial.
38
   While the NLSY79 contains information on whether its respondents receive rental subsidies or subsidized hous-
ing, it does not contain information on the dollar value of these forms of assistance. Because we were unable to ob-
tain reliable data with which to estimate the costs of housing subsidies, they are not included in our cost calculations.
39
   Using state aggregate data on the maximum monthly AFDC and food stamp benefits for a family of four (con-
sisting of one adult and three children) and average monthly Medicaid expenditures for a family of this size in the
years between 1984 and 1989, we regressed the Medicaid benefits against the sum of food stamp and AFDC bene-
fits, controlling for a linear time trend to account for the rising level of expenditures on Medicaid relative to those
for the other programs over this period. The results produce an estimate that in each month a typical family on pub-
lic assistance receives $250 plus 0.193 times the benefits received (in 1993 dollars) from the AFDC and food stamp
programs combined. Based on this formula, the average monthly Medicaid expenditure on a family of four, receiv-
ing the maximum allowable AFDC and food stamp benefits, would be $404. In 1993, the median state’s maximum
monthly AFDC benefit for a family of four was $435 and the maximum monthly food stamp allotment for such a
family was $375 (see U.S. House of Representatives, 1994). Since the average monthly expenditure in 1993 for a
family of four receiving assistance under the Medicaid program was $386 (U.S. House of Representatives, 1994),


                                                          32
Medicaid received to those for the other benefits teen mothers received at various ages and used

this measure to estimate the causal effects of early childbearing for this measure of public assis-

tance, using the instrumental variables regression methods described earlier.40

        While not directly measured from NLSY79 data, we used the following strategy to esti-

mate what teen mothers pay in federal, state and local sales and income taxes at each age of their

early adulthood. We assumed that the average teenage mother faces a federal marginal tax rate of

15 percent and that she would pay an additional 8 percent of her income in state and local in-

come and sales taxes. Using the resulting tax rate of 23 percent, we multiplied the annual earn-

ings of teen mothers, as well as our estimates of the causal effects of early childbearing on an-

nual earnings, to produce annual estimates of taxes paid by teen mothers and the additional taxes

they would pay if they had delayed their childbearing.

        To obtain estimates of the total annual costs and savings to government associated with

teen motherhood, we also must estimate the total number of women in the U.S. population in

1996 who first became mothers as teens (i.e., had their first birth prior to age 18). We assumed

that the number of early childbearers at each age, from 17 through 34, was equal to the number

of women who became teen mothers for the first time in 1993. Based on the Current Population

Survey, there were 175,259 new teen mothers in 1993.

        Using these estimates, we simulated the total amount that all levels of government would

have spent in 1996 on public assistance for women who became mothers as teens, what these

costs would be net of the taxes government collects from these women, and what the gross and

net savings would be in these costs if all of these women had delayed their childbearing. Our es-

timates are presented in Figure 6. We estimate that each year government spends $11.3 billion


the above estimation procedure appears to yield reasonable estimates.




                                                        33
(in 1996 dollars) on AFDC, Food Stamps, Medicaid and other forms of public assistance for

women, ages 17 through 34, who began motherhood as teens. To put this in perspective, this ex-

penditure represents 6 percent of total expenditures on the AFDC, Food Stamps and Medicaid

programs in the U.S. in 199341 and amounts to an annual expenditure of $3,596 per woman.

While these costs to government are substantial, we find that they are offset, in part, by the taxes

that women who bore their first child as a teenager would be expected to pay. In fact, the total

annual public assistance costs of early childbearers, net of the taxes they pay, is $2.1 billion,

which amounts to a net cost, per woman, of $665. Nonetheless, this is a substantial net govern-

mental outlay to women who chose not to delay their childbearing.

           While substantial, most of these costs that U.S. taxpayers incur for women who began

motherhood at early ages is not attributable to the failure to delay their childbearing. Taxpayers

would save virtually nothing if these women had delayed their first births by 4 years on average.

In fact, we estimate that the total annual expenditures on public assistance would increase

slightly, rising by $1.3 billion, if all of these women had delayed their childbearing. Moreover,

the net (of taxes) annual outlays by government for cash-assistance and in-kind transfers to these

women would actually increase by 35 percent, or $3.9 billion. This increase in annual net expen-

ditures associated with delaying childbearing would amount to over $1,250 per teen mother (a

$400 annual increase in public aid and the remainder from forgone tax revenue). The fact that

getting teen mothers to delay their childbearing results in additional costs to government, rather

than savings, is a direct consequence of the finding that teenage childbearing raises rather than

lowers labor market earnings in the long-run. We found that teen mothers would earn less over

     The estimates for this regression are available from the authors.
41
  In 1993, the total expenditures, in terms of 1996 dollars, for the AFDC, Food Stamp and Medicaid programs were
$27.3 billion, $28.4 billion and $197.1 billion, respectively (U.S. House of Representatives, 1994).

their lifetimes if they were forced to delay their first births. This loss in earnings translates to a

reduction in taxes paid by these women and an increase, rather than decrease, in the net costs to

government associated with the postponement of motherhood.42

6.   Conclusion

        In this study, we have used an alternative strategy to estimate the causal effects associ-

ated with teenage childbearing in the U.S. In particular, we have employed a natural experiment

to obtain a more comparable, and plausible, comparison group with which to derive estimates of

counterfactual outcomes for teen mothers, i.e., what would have happened to these women if

they had postponed their childbearing. Our results suggest that much of the “concern” that has

been registered concerning teenage childbearing, at least based on its consequences for the sub-

sequent attainment of teen mothers, is misplaced. In particular, our estimates imply that the

“poor” outcomes attained by such women cannot be attributed, in a causal sense, primarily to

their decision to begin their childbearing at an early age. Rather, it appears that these outcomes

are more the result of the poor circumstances than the early childbearing of these women. Fur-

thermore, our estimates suggest that simply delaying their childbearing would not greatly en-

hance their educational attainment, subsequent earnings, or family structure.

        Our estimates suggest that teenage mothers are much more adaptable over their life cycle

than previous discussions of the consequences of teenage childbearing have suggested. For ex-

ample, teen mothers do appear to be less likely to receive a high school diploma than if they had

   To assess the robustness of our findings concerning the various cost estimates displayed in Figure 6, we recalcu-
lated all of our cost estimates, varying both the ranges of ages of teen mothers used to calculate these costs (esti-
mates also were derived using women, aged 17 through 40 and aged 17 through 30) and the tax rate used to derive
tax revenue estimates (we also used a rate of 15 percent). While the magnitudes of the various costs vary across
these alternative assumptions, the general conclusions did not. Government spending on public assistance would not
have declined and net spending would have increased, even if society had been able to get all the women who had
teen births to postpone their childbearing until they were adults.

delayed their childbearing. But, they appear to offset this shortcoming by being more likely to

obtain a GED and, more importantly, by working much more over their early adulthood than if

they had delayed childbearing. Moreover, we find that teen mothers may actually achieve higher

levels of earnings over their adult lives than if they had postponed motherhood. Finally, we find

evidence that while teenage childbearing does seem to increase public aid expenditures immedi-

ately after the birth of their first child, this “negative” consequence of teenage childbearing is not

a permanent one, in that teen mothers use less public aid in their late 20’s as their earnings rise

and their children age.

       Taken together, the results presented in this paper call into question the view that teenage

childbearing is one of the nation’s most serious social problems, at least when one measures its

severity in terms of the potential financial gains to these women and to taxpayers of having all

teen mothers delay their childbearing until they are older. At the same time, we caution the

reader not to generalize from the findings. We have considered only a limited range of potential

consequences, and costs, of teenage childbearing. Furthermore, the findings from one study can-

not be considered as conclusive. However, we note that our findings, at least for many of the so-

cioeconomic outcomes considered in this paper, are consistent with the estimated effects of teen-

age childbearing found in the work of Geronimus and Korenman (1992) and Grogger and Bro-

nars (1933). Taken together with our work, this evidence raises serious doubts about the extent

and nature of teenage childbearing as a “social problem” in the U.S. and, more importantly, on

the view that getting these women to postpone their childbearing will improve the socioeco-

nomic attainment of teen mothers in any substantial way.

            1. All estimates control for covariates. For the OLS estimates these include dummy
               variables for ethnicity (black and Hispanic), living in a female headed family at
               age 14, living in an intact family at age 14, and controls for missing values. The
               woman’s family income in 1978, her mother’s education and her fathers education
               were entered linearly. In addition dummy variables for smoked prior to pregnancy,
               drank prior to pregnancy and pregnancy prior to age 16 are included for the IV es-
               timates.
