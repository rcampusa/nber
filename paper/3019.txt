            STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN A DEBT BARGAINING FRAMEWORX


                                  ABSTRACT



     This paper analyzes the strategic role of investment from a debtor

country's perspective.   The framework is one in which, if the debtor

country is unable to meet debt obligations, a bargaining regime determines

the amount of debt repayment.    In the context of a two-country real trade

model, debt repayment is equal to the trade surplus of the debtor.       The

outcome of the bargaining game will therefore be dependent (among other

things) on the level of production in the debtor country.    In this

framework, the paper shows that productive investment may increase or

decrease the bargaining power of the debtor country.    This ambiguity

appears to be fairly robust.

                       I.   Introduction

    The purpose of this paper is to analyze the strategic role of

investment in a debt situation that includes the possiblity of default

and establishnent of a bargaining regime in which debtor and creditor

negotiate the anount of repayment.    The recent literature has

developed the notion of the debt overhang, which argues that old debt

works as a tax on new investment.    This effect follows from the

assumption that creditors obtain a share in the proceeds from new

investment, and this acts as an effective tax on new investment.     This

paper describes an environment in which, due to strategic

considerations, the debt overhang generates ambiguous incentives over

investment.   In particular, we identify a case in which investnient

helps the debtor country to obtain a better outcome in the bargaining

process.   In this case, the debt overhang acts as a subsidy to

investment.


    The possibility of default by the debtor country introduces two

separate effects.   The first is the standard credit rationing effect.

This means that the debtor country faces an upward—sloping credit

supply and an overall ceiling on foreign debt, with the consequent

increase in the domestic real interest rate and decrease in productive

investment.   Note that this effect is independent from and additional

to the "debt tax" argument suggested by the debt overhang literature.

The second is the strategic effect of partial defaults: the effect of

an increase in investment on the outcome of the bargaining game for

the debtor.   The sign and magnitude of this effect depends on the
characteristics of the bargaining game.


    This paper shows that productive investment may either improve or

worsen the bargaining outcome for the debtor, which implies that the

debt overhang does not necessarily act as a tax on investment in this

sense.    To analyze the role of strategic investment, we start by

describing the supply of credit facing the debtor in this context.

The credit supply schedule incorporates the possibility of a
bargaining regime, either as a random future event or as the current

regime.    Because the outcome of the bargaining process is detennined

(aniong other factors) by the capital stock of the debtor economy the

supply schedule shifts with changes in investment in the debtor

economy. j/

    When choosing its optimal capital accumulation, the debtor

country considers the effects on the foreign debt situation.           The

debtor must weigh two effects: a direct effect on the amount of

repayment (the outcome of the bargaining game), and an indirect effect

on the cost of borrowing (the response of the credit supply function).

 The paper shows that the direct repayment effect always dominates.

The reason is that a reduction in the cost of credit benefits the

country only in the good states of nature, when the country chooses

not to default, while a better bargaining outcome benefits the country

in the bad states of nature, when it prefers to default on foreign

debt payments.   Because the niarginal utility of consumption and the

marginal value of traded inputs are both higher in the bad states of

nature, gains obtained in the bargaining regime are more valuable than

gains obtained in the nondefault regime.


    The change in the bargaining outcome as a response to investment

in the debtor country is not uniquely determined and depends on the

particular structure of international trade.     Our basic framework is

one in which trade takes place on primary productive inputs, while the

final good (used for both consumption and investment) is non—tradable.

International trade benefits are thus obtained from input

diversification.    In this context, the effect of investment depends on

the substitutability between capital and traded inputs in the

production function of the debtor country.      If the elasticity of

substitution of capital with traded inputs exceeds (falls short of)

unity, an increase in investment increases (reduces) the repayntent to

the creditor.    We confirm the robustness of this general result by

analyzing an alternative international trade framework, which is a

simplified two-country two—good trade model.      In this case, the effect

of investment on debt repayments depends on the specification of the

utility functions and it may also be either positive or negative.




                   II.   The Supply of Credit



    We will initially assume that in the first period a free—trade

regime exists because debt is not large enough for the debtors to

                                  3
default in its service and enter the bargaining situation.     However,

there is uncertainty concerning the second period, and there is some

probability of default.     If the debtor country can expect a better

outcome by entering the bargaining game than by fully servicing its

debt, it will default on its debt.     For simplicity, we will assume

that the only source of uncertainty is a random shock to the supply of

the debtor country's primary input.     There are two possible states of

nature: a high-output state (positive supply shock) and a low-output

state (negative supply shock).     These states are indexed by (H,L).

Therefore, the supply of the debtor's primary product can take two

values:            and


        Let R denote the total payoff on foreign debt obtained by the

creditor country in the second period.     In this two—country world, R

is equal to the trade deficit run by the creditor country when trade

flows are valuated at the free—trade prices.     In the bargaining

regime, two payoffs are possible according to the prevailing state of

nature, which verify:



  (1)     RH   >




because some of the extra output available in the high—output state
will be received as debt repayment by the creditor.     Though plausible,

the above statement is not self—evident; however, it can be easily

proved for the bargaining model described in the next section, which

is done in the Appendix.



                                   4
        We will assume that the creditor country behaves according to a

naxinnnn expected value rule.       This inplies that the creditor's supply

curve will satisfy the following condition:



  (2)     (1+r)B        E(R)



where r is the risk—free interest rate.         Note that R depends on the

regine prevailing in the second period, that is, on whether there will

be full repayment of debt or a bargaining outcone.         Moreover, if the

bargaining regine prevails, R will be dependent on the state of

nature.     Therefore, R can take three values: (1+r)B, RH, and RL,

according to the regine at the tine of repayment and to the state of

nature, where r represents the contractual interest rate charged on

loans.


        For given values of the state variables (the capital stocks in

the debtor and creditor countries), the debt level niay fall in three

different regions giving rise to three different segments in the

credit supply function:        a horizontal segment, an upward—sloping

segnent, and a vertical segment.         For very low values of debt, the

debtor will prefer full payment to entering a bargaining situation.

Let B denote the naximum debt level for which the debtor will choose

not to bargain (in either state of nature) and will repay debts in
full.     That is, B will be given by:



  (3)     (1+r)B   =   RL




                                     5
    This means that at some low levels of debt it is cheaper for the

debtor to meet its obligation in full than to enter the bargaining

process, irrespective of the state of nature.        Because the debtor

would never choose to default, the risk—free interest rate r will be

charged for any debt level lower than or equal to B.


    In this framework, there is always a maximum amount of debt that

creditors are willing to hold.         The existence of this upper bound

follows from the fact that there is a maximum payoff that can be

obtained in the bargaining process (RH) and a larger loan will not

increase that maximum payoff, irrespective of the contractual interest

rate being charged.      Assuming the high-output state and the low-output

state both have the same probability of occurence, the maximum value

of debt, which we denote B, is obtained from:



  (4)     B(1+r)   =   .S(RL   + RH)



    Any increase in B beyond B does not increase the expected payoff;

moreover, for any value of B higher than B the creditors will obtain

an expected return lower than the risk—free interest rate,

independently of the contractual interest rate.


        For loans larger than B but smaller than B, we are in a situation

in which the debtor would default and enter the bargaining equilibrium

if the bad state occurs, but would repay in full in the good state.         In

this range, the supply curve will satisfy:




                                       6
         B(1+r)                =     .5(B(1+r) +RL),                  or

  (5)     1+r          =       2(1+r)          —       RL/B,      B C B   C   B




        It is apparent that in this region r is a positive function of B.

Therefore, the shape of the supply curve will be as shown in Figure 1.

We can also obtain the maximum contractual interest rate, r that will

be charged on loans just equal to the maximum feasible, B.



 1+r      =    2(1+r)               —     RL/B



which implies:



 1+r      =    2(1+r f          )
                                     (1    —
                                                   R       +



        Note that the position of the supply curve is a function of the

second-period output in the debtor country, that is, of its capital

stock and endowment shock.                                     Being aware of that fact, the debtor

country will adjust its investment strategy to take account of the

repercussions on the credit supply function.                                      Before turning to the

debtor's decision, let us examine the changes in the supply function

induced by investment in the debtor country.                                      A change in the capital

stock will affect all B, B, and r(B) as follows:

                 dI<           B given             B      dI<




        It   is apparent that the direction of the shift in the supply

curve is determined by the signs of how the payoffs are affected for

creditors and debtors.                             As we showed in the bargaining equilibriunt,

two cases are possible. In the first, an increase in the capital stock

of the debtor country increases the payoff for the creditor in both

states of nature, which shifts the supply curve outwards.                                        In the

second case, an increase in the capital stock of the debtor country

reduces the payoff for the creditor in both states of nature, which

shifts the supply curve inwards.


        Notice that so far we have assunted that there is no outstanding

debt at the beginning of the first period.                                        However, this is a

generalization that can be niade without much effort.                                       Let B0 be the

previous outstanding debt and R0 be the repayment in the first period,

itself the outcome of bargaining between debtor and creditor.                                          Then

the new debt level that the creditor will be willing to hold must

satisfy:



  (9)        B         R0—      B0 +
                                                    1+r


        The supply schedule for this case is obtained simply by

substituting B + B0                         - R0    in equation (5) for B.            The financial

                                                                 8
operation in this case involves rolling over debt for an amount equal

to         and issuing new loans for an amount equal to B.   The

situation is depicted in Figure 2.    We basically have the same supply

curve as in Figure 1, but with a rightward shift in the origin of B0 -

R0.   The effect of the debt overhang is that the country starts with a

new debt of B -       and consequently the supply of new credit B is

reduced from SS to S0S.   But all the previous qualitative results are

still valid.   In particular, investment in the debtor country will

still shift the supply curve in the ways described above.




               III.   The Bargaining Equilibrium



      If the debtor country decides to completely default on its debts,

it will suffer economic sanctions that would involve some disruption

of its international trade.     An extreme case is when trade is made

completely impossible, and the debtor country niust live under autarky

conditions.    This situation would clearly be an inferior one: debtors

lose all gains from international trade, and creditors can collect

none of the outstanding debt.     Therefore, there exists a possibility

of engaging in some form of international trade which would be

niutually advantageous.   Such arrangement would be one in which

creditors receive some debt repayittent, and the debtor country is

allowed to enter international trade under some conditions.        The

bargaining equilibrium developed in this section describes the outconie
of negotiations between the debtor and creditor under these

circumstances.


    The trade model that we use essentially follows Ethier's (1982)
framework.           The two countries have an endowment of a primary product,

which is internationally tradable, and which, together with capital

(we exclude labor for simplicity), is used to produce the final,

nontradable product.                       The primary product of the debtor country is

denoted as X, and the primary product of the creditor country is

denoted as Y.                 The quantitites of the two primary products used in

production will be denoted as X and                                 for the debtor country and as

X and Y for the creditor country.                               Thus, we have:


             *            *            —
  (10)   X       +    Y        =       X

  (11)   X       +    Y       =    Y




    For the purposes of this section we will assume a unit

(exogenous) supply of each primary good: X =                                Y    =   1.   The

quantities of the final good produced in each country will be denoted

by Z and Z.           These are given by the following production functions:



  (12)   Z
             *
                 =        K        +
                                           i(X,+Yla/fl 1/a
                                                       J




                                                 1/a
  (13)   Z            [K       +       (X+Y)a]



where — < a,fl < 1.


                                                           10
    In this context, gains from trade are derived from increasing

returns in production generated by input diversity.iJ           To gain in

clarity, we are assuming that only the debtor country obtains gains

from trade.    Therefore, although a purely free trade equilibrium will

not generate any productivity benefit for the creditor country, the

bargaining equilibrium brings about some debt repayment and is

therefore beneficial for the creditor economy.          Note that, in a

free—trade regime, the creditor country may obtain intertemporal gains

from trade, derived from the ability to lend to or to carry out direct

investment in the developing country.


     In the present context, both countries can abandon all

negotiations and produce and consume at their autarky levels.             These

are the "threat points" of debtor and creditor;         therefore, any

bargaining equilibrium must satisfy the constraint of being preferred

to the autarky position by both parties.        We will apply the syuinetric

Nash bargaining equilibrium framework (see Roth (1979), Binmore (1987,

etc).   This bargaining equilibrium can be obtained by finding the

Pareto—optimal allocation that maximizes the product of gains from

trade, that is, of moving from autarky to a Nash bargaining

equilibrium.    Letting ZN denote the level of production under the Nash

equilibrium, and ZA denote the level of production under autarky, the

bargaining equilibrium is the solution to the following problem.




1/ In the case of several productive sectors, the value of , which
represents the elasticity of substitution between the different productive
inputs plays a key role to distinguish opposing effects of investment on
the bargaining outcome.

     (14)   Max (Z —      Z)     (ZN — ZA)



       This framework assumes perfect contemporaneous information for

both parties. / Another full information framework that has been
applied to the debt problem is one in which the two parties make a

sequence of offers and counteroffers, while time spent in the process

is costly because of time discounting and depreciation of the

underlying product, such as in O'Connell (1987) and Bulow and Rogoff

(1988).       The existence of a "perfect equilibrium" in the latter type

of game has been shown by Rubinstein (1979).                            Although the Nash

equilibrium is a static game, in which the demands from both parties

are made simultaneously, Binmore (1987) has showed that the perfect

equilibria approximate the Nash bargaining solution when the interval

between demands is short.               If the time discount rates of the two

parties differ, the perfect equilibria approximate an asymmetric Nash

bargaining equilibrium.

       The symmetry in the production function implies that both inputs

will always be used in equal quantities for the debtor country in both

the free—trade and the bargaining regimes.                             In a free trade regime the

relative price of the two inputs will be unity, because they are



/   See Rotemberg (1988) for a foreign debt bargaining model with imperfect
information.

21    The asymmetric Nash bargaining problem ts solved by maximizing:
                                                                 1-a
                                  (z   - z) a    (ZN   -   ZA)

where a indicates the bargaining power.   The objective function (14) is
equivalent to the above one with a — 1/2.

perfect substitutes in the creditor country production function, and

this ensures that they are demanded in equal amounts by the debtor

country.          In the bargaining regime, because the equilibrium satisfies

Pareto optimality two primary inputs must also be used in equal

amounts by the debtor country.                                       This implies f =                        Also, because
we assume unit supplies, X + Y =                                         2(l_X*).        This implies that:



   *
                                   a/fla          1/a

  ZN     =    1K      +        2      X


         =
              I

  ZT     =    1K      +


  ZT     =    lKx+lJ

       Therefore,              the global resource allocation is entirely determined

by X, and we can treat the bargaining process as simply the selection

of the value of                      in order to:

       We are interested in the sign of dX*/dK*, because that derivative

will deterittine investment decisions prior to the negotiation process.

If dX*/dK* is negative, investment has the negative (for the debtor)

side effect of increasing debt repayments, which reduces incentives to

invest.       We can identify this situation with the 'debt overhang"

prob1em./ By contra*st,*if dX /dK                              is positive, investment helps the

debtor country to obtain a more favorable outcome from the bargaining,

and the existence of large or nonserviceable debt has in fact a

positive incentive effect for investment and production.                             In the

Appendix, we show that the sign of dX*/dK* is equal to minus the sign

Of a.       Note that the elasticity of substitution between capital and

primary inputs is equal to i/(1—a).                             Therefore, dX*/dK* is positive

when the elasticity of substitution is less than one, zero when the

elasticity of substitution is equal to one, and negative when the

elasticity of substitution is greater than one.


        To gain further insight into this result let us denote by TG(X*)

and TG*(X*)        the gains from trade relative to autarky (in percentage

terms) for the creditor and the debtor (for a given X*).                             That is, TG

and TG*are given by:


               *     *                 *1/a
     (17)    TG (X       )

    Therefore, we can represent the condition defining the bargaining

outcome (16) by the requirement that:



  (19)   TG*I(X*)/TG*(X*)   =   —   TG,(X*)/TG(X*)


    The right—hand side measures the percentage decrease in the

creditor's gains from trade that is associated with a marginal

increase of X, and is described by schedule CC in Figure 3.       The

left-hand side measures the percentage gain in the debtor's gains from

trade associated with a marginal increase in X, and is described by

schedule DD.   The intersection of both schedules gives the bargaining
                                                        *
outcome.   At this allocation a marginal change of X will cause

percentage losses of the gains from trade to one party that equal the

percentage gains to the other party.       Note that investment by the

debtor will affect the DD schedule, and the resultant bargaining

equilibrium.


    To trace the consequences of the investment on the DD schedule

one should evaluate both the change in the marginal and the average

gains from trade i.e., the TG*F (X*) and the TG*(X*), respectively.
Direct derivation reveals that investment will reduce (increase) the

marginal gains from trade (TG*, (X*)) if the elasticity of substitution

between capital and the aggregate inputs exceeds (falls short of)

unity, and will stay intact if the elasticity equals unity.       It turns

out that these factors dominate the behavior of the DD curve, which

will shift downward (upward) for the elastic (inelastic) case.       The

unitary elasticity case is the borderline case, where the (percentage)

                                    15
gains from trade are independent from the aggregate capital stock, due

to the multiplicative nature in which capital enters the production

process.


    Figure 3 is also useful to highlight the role of stochastic

endowments.   Note that a rise in the total endowment of the debtor

will have the consequence of widening the bargaining region, and

shifting curve CC horizontally by the increase in endowment to C'C'.

The bargaining outcome will increase by less than the endowment

increase, making both the debtor and the creditors better of f.




                  IV.   The Debtor's Problem



    The debtor country faces the problem of choosing consumption and

investment in a forward-looking way.   In addition to standard

optimality considerations, the debtor country will choose the level of

investment that positions it advantageously for the bargaining game

(if it were to take place.)   Recall that we work with a two—period

framework, where in the first period a free—trade regime prevails, but

in the second either the free—trade or the bargaining regime may

prevail.


    As discussed in the bargaining section, in equilibrium the debtor

uses the two intermediate goods in equal amounts.       Let V indicate the

composite of the intermediate goods X and Y    used   by the debtor

country.   Let   denote the supply of primary input X in state S, for


                                16
S =   H,L.       The world supply of intermediate goods is then given by

(1,1) in the first period, and by (XS1) in the second.                                       Then, it can

be seen that in a free trade regine, V will be given by:



     (20)                X    —       (1+r)B


       In the bargaining regime, V will be given by:



     (21)    V
                 B
                     =
                         —
                         X    —       R       =
                                                      —
                                                      X    —   (X-2X)*
                                                               —
                                                                           =   2X
                                                                                    *



where X' is the amount of input X obtained by the debtor in the

bargaining equilibrium.                               The repayment to the creditor is defined (in

terms of the primary good composite) as the difference between the

debtor's endowment                            and what it keeps when the bargaining equilibrium

is reached (2X*).


       Using the composite V together with capital K* to produce output

Z, the debtor deterniines its consumption and investment decisions on

the basis of the solution to the following problem:



     (22)    Max u(C1) + Eu(C2)
                 s.t.    C1 +             I       =       Z(K,V0    + B)

                         c2       =       max{z(K*,_                B(1+r));   Z(K*,_ RS)]

                                  —       I   +




j/  Recall that at the free-trade price of the two Inputs is unity and the
debtor country always uses the two inputs in equal quantities.
                                                               17
where C stands for consumption, I for investment and Z for production

of the final good.                   and V0 are the exogenously given initial stocks

of capital and of the intermediate good composite, B is the level of

borrowing carried out in the first period, R is the repayment obtained

by the creditor country in the bargaining regime.                          International debt

B is denominated in units of the traded goods (that is, inputs).                           In

the more general case of a starting debt overhang, B — (B0                        —   R0) takes

the place of B in the above system.                   In this two—period framework, we

abstract from time preference in the utility function without loss of

generality.


      Given the shape of the credit supply function, there are three

different situations that may arise.                    In the first case, B C B, and

the country can borrow as much as it wants at the fixed risk—free

interest rate.            In this situation, we can rewrite the problem as:



max    u[z(K;v0÷B)          —   I)   +    .5u[Z(K*, H_B(l+rf))J        +




      In this situation, standard intertemporal conditions for debt and

investment will hold:


              E(uF(c2)ZK*)
  (23)
              ——--————                =

                                 Zv(K,Vo + B)                 —



where    A2    =    u'   (c1), and A2     = E(u'   (c2)).

                                              18
      The first—order necessary conditions are the standard ones in

stochastic nodels of intertenporal consunption.                                   They equalize the

covariances with the narginal utility of consunption of the returns on

the   different assets.                  Equation (23) applies this condition to

donestic capital and the equation (24) applies it to foreign debt.

Note that debt is denondnated in traded input units and therefore the

rate of change in its inplicit relative price with consunption good is

part of its return.


      In the second regime, the upward—sloping section of the supply

curve, the country will default in the bad state and repay in the good

state.    We can rewrite the problen as:



nax   u[z(K,v0+B)           —   I)       +       .5u[Z(K',   H_B[1+r(B,K*)JJ           +    .5u[Z(K*,X1_R1))



which yields the first order conditions:

    Condition (27) equates the expected marginal product of capital
(measured in utility terns) with the sum of the benchnark donestic
interest rate (A1/A2) and the expected strategic effect of investnent.
    The strategic effect of investhent is given by the change in

repayment in the bargaining regine (dR7dK*) weighted by the tenti A,

which iieasures the loss derived front a marginal increase in repayment

in the bad state, and is defined by the difference between two terns.

The first tern is the effect of the change in the availability of

traded inputs in the bargaining regine (neasured in utility units),

and the second is the change in the availability of traded inputs in

the free-trade regime as a consequence of the shift in the supply

curve.       Notice that A is always positive because both the marginal

utility of consunption and the marginal product of inputs are higher

in the lower output state.        Therefore, the effect of investnent on the

repayment in the bargaining regine is always the doninant one.


         Conparing (27) to (23) it is easy to see that strategic

considerations affect the optinal value of the expected narginal

product of capital in two ways: the change in bargaining repayment and

the credit supply response.           These two effects are always of opposite

sign because if the change in repayment favors the debtor it must hurt

                                         20
the creditor, which prompts a credit supply response that increases

the cost of borrowing.     But, as we have shown A to be positive, the

direct repayment effect always dominates the indirect credit supply

response.


     Therefore, the strategic effect of investment depends on the

change induced in bargaining power.          If investment decreases the

bargaining power of the debtor by increasing the debt repayment

(dR7dK*>O), the strategic effect will reduce investnient (because it

implies that a higher marginal product of capital is optimal.)            This

is true despite the fact that the debtor country could improve its

borrowing conditions by increasing investment spending because the

repayment effect is more powerful.          This situation matches the

description of debt overhang niodels, in which past accumulated debts

act as a tax on new investment.          By contrast, when investment

increases the bargaining power of the debtor (dR/dK*<O), new

investments generate a positive externality on the debt situation of

the country, and the strategic incentives will work toward an increase

in investment spending.      In this case, paradoxically, an increase in

investment spending by the debtor makes creditors less willing to lend

by increasing the risk of default. /


     One should be cautious, however, in deriving conclusions from the

strategic positive incentive case.          In particular, it does not ixnply

that investment will be higher than in a case of absence of foreign

affect negatively the amount of foreign debt the country would like to have
(see equation (26).)
                                    21
debt (or more precisely of absence of constraints on foreign

borrowing).   This is because the fact that the debtor country faces an

upward-sloping credit supply function implies that the benchmark

domestic interest rate (1/A2)             will   be higher than in the case of no

constraints on foreign borrowing, and investment is correspondingly

lower.   In our framework the absence of constraints on foreign debt

exist at low levels of indebtedness, when there is no immediate risk

of default (B <       B.)

      In the third possible case, the country has run up against the

maximun amount of borrowing it can get, B.                 At that point, a

bargaining regime will take place for sure in the second period.                    The

problem can then be formulated as:



max   u{Z(K,V0+B)       —   I)   +   .5u{Z(K,    XH_R1))   +    .5u[Z(K*,X_R1)J



      The first order condition for investment is:


          E(u' (c2)ZK*)                        i     (          * —s
                                                                s        dRS
  (28)   ————————                =         + —i— E1A2 ZV(K ,X —R )
                  2                   2          2   '                   ——;
                                                                         dK


      Again, strategic considerations affect the investment decision.
The bargaining regime implies that investment is "taxed" if the
repayment increases with the stock of capital in the debtor country,

but it is "subsidizedt' in the opposite case.                  Note that, in this

second case, the existence of a large stock of previous debt implies

that the country will be credit rationed, and the benchmark domestic

                                          22
interest rate (A1/A2)       will be   much higher, which by itself depresses

investment.




             V.   An Alternative Bargaining Equilibrium



      In the bargaining model of Section II, the effect of a larger

capital stock on the payoff for the debtor depended on the elasticity

of substitution in production, in the context of a diversified input

trade model. However, the indeterminacy of the effect of higher

capital (or output) on the bargaining payoff appears to be fairly

robust. In this section we provide another example in which trade

takes place in final goods (there are no primary inputs) and the sane

indeterminacy holds.


      We assume that there are two final goods in the world economy:

good D produced by the debtor country, and good F, produced by the

creditor country. The two goods are perfect substitutes for the

creditor country, while the debtor country has a preference for good

F. More precisely, the utility function of the debtor country is

given by:



  (29)   u    =   u(D+aF)



where a>1, and the utility function of the creditor country is given

by:

                                            23
  (30)   V    = v(D+F)


    The above utility functions imply that in a free-trade regime the

relative price of the two goods is unity and the debtor country

exports all of its output (we will assume throughout that F >                  D)    The

asynmetric framework implies that only the debtor country obtains

gains from trade.            But the creditor country needs to engage in

international trade in order to extract any debt payments from the

debtor country.             The only way for the debtor country to make debt

repayments is to run a trade surplus. jJ


     By definition, debt repayments are equal to the trade surplus of

the debtor economy.               Denoting debt repayments by R:



  (31)   R =       D    —    FE




where FE represents exports of the good F.               Equivalently, we can

assume that in the bargaining regime the two sides negotiate over

terTns of trade x, such that:



  (32)   xD    =       FE




where one unit of the D good is exchanged for x units of the F good.

A value of x less than one implies that positive debt repayments are


J   Note that although the creditor country does not obtain static gains
from trade, it may obtain intertemporal gains from trade by being able to
decouple domestic savings and investment.         But we abstract from this latter
effect in this analysis.
                                            24
taking place.     The bargaining equilibrium will consist in obtaining

the value of x that represents the outcome of the symmetric power

negotiations between debtors and creditors.


    The equilibrium value of x has to satisfy two restrictions.

First, x must be less than one, because the creditor will never accept

an offer that involves a value of x       1, since such a value of x

implies a net transfer to the debtor and the creditor would be better

off simply by breaking off negotiations.       That is, x = 1 is the

creditor's "threat point".     And second, x must be larger than 1/

because otherwise the debtor country would be better of f by breaking

of f negotiations and consuniing its own output in autarky.         Therefore,

the debtor's threat point is x = 1/a.


    With x lying in the above range, creditors buy as much of the D

good as they can get, and debtors buy as much F good as they can

afford.     Therefore, since we assume that F >   D   >   xD, in the bargaining

equilibrium, the creditor country consumes all the output of good D

and part of the output of good F.      Thus, the consumption bundle (D,F)

obtained by the debtor country is given by (O,xD), and the consumption

bundle obtained by the creditor country is given by (D,F—xD).


    The Nash bargaining equilibrium for this game can be obtained by

solving the following maxiniization problem:



 Max      [u(D,F) _uA(D,F))[v(D,F) _vA(D,F))

       s.t. 1/c<X<1

                                  25
where uA(.,.) and vA(.,.) indicate the utility functions at the
autarky consumption bundles.            The first—order necessary condition is:



  (33)    u(v -    VA)       -V(U - uA)


for x in the specified range.            In light of the above description of

the trades that take place in the bargaining regime and of (29) and

(30), we can be more specific about the utility functions:



 U   =    u(axD)    ;
                         u    u(D)

 v   =    v((1-x)D+F);       vA   =   v(F)


     We are interested in examining how the bargaining outcome is

affected by a change in the endownient of the debtor country, that is,

in the sign of dx/dD.         This is the relevant relation for investment

incentives.        If dx/dD is negative, a larger output in the debtor

country increases the share of it going to the creditor in the

bargaining outcome.          In this case, we are in the presence of a "debt

overhang" situation in which incentives to investment by the debtor

country are reduced because of the larger transfer of resources to

creditors in the event that a bargaining situation should arise in the

future.     By contrast, if dx/dD is positive, the total return to

investment for the debtor increases because of the positive effect of

larger output on the payoff obtained by the debtor in case of

bargaining.


                                         26
          The sign of dx/dD cannot be determined a priori.                                      Two

contradictory forces are present.                                    One the one hand, a larger value of

D increases the threat point of the debtor, which is the minimum

payoff it could obtain, thus contributing to a more favorable outcome

for the debtor country.                              But on the other hand, if the increase in 0

implies that the marginal gain from a change in payoffs increases more

for the debtor than the creditor, the final outcome will be more

favorable to the creditors.



          The precise expression for dx/dD is the following:


                                        u        (v.vA) + u v        + u V   +V        (u_uA)   —      uA
                                                                                                    v xD
                   dx                       xD                  xD      Dx        xD
                   dD                                uxx(v_vA) + 2uxv        +   Vxx(u_uA)


where the following relations hold:



  u
      x
           =       aDu C    >       0

  u
      xx
               =    (aD)2u CC               <    0

  U        =       aXU      >       0

                   a(uC                     uCC)        0

           =
  v:x               D2vCC       <       0

  vD       =       (l_x)vc          >       0


  VxD          =    _(v     + (l_x)DVCC)                    0




                                                                27
      By using the abova relationships, it can be seen that the

denominator of (34) is always negative.                    The numerator of (34) is, in

principle, indeterminate, and it can be shown that it is equal to the

following expression:



  (35)     aDuvc[1   -   2x +              (7f- p            -   p)   +



where p represents the elasticity of marginal utility of the
corresponding function, i.e.:


               uC                          vC
 Pu    =   —              pv       =   —




      The sign of (35) depends on the specific form of the utility

function of the debtor and creditors.                    If both parties have

logarithmic utility functions, it can be shown that (35) is positive.

By contrast, when both parties have exponential utility functions,

nunerical sinulation suggests that the sign is always negative.                    For
exanple, using u = v =             —e,     nunerical solutions to the problen
generate the following results:



           a                   D                   x              dx/dD
           2                   1                  0.74            —0.01
           5                   1                  0.49            —0.07
           2                   3                  0.74                —0.007
           5                   3                  0.49                —0.02


                                             28
      It is important to notice that, even when dx/dD is negative, the

debtor country is never worse off by having a larger supply of its

output.    In other words, du/dD is always positive.j/          Therefore, even

in   the case    that an increase in the debtor country's output generates

an   increase    in debt repayment, the latter increase is never large

enough to leave the debtor country in a less favorable position.            This

fact is reassuring, because otherwise the debtor country could make

itself better off by destroying part of its output, and the bargaining

equilibrium would not be well characterized.




                           VI.   Conclusions



      Our examples lead us to conclude that the strategic consequences

of investment are rather involved and cannot be determined without

detailed knowledge of the economy.         The possibility that an actual or

potential movement into a bargaining regime can either encourage or

discourage investment for strategic reasons appears to be quite

general.    This result qualifies the arguments for a debt overhang

disincentive effect on investment.         But, once again, it should be

stressed that the strategic effects are additional to the disincentive

to investment caused by an upward—sloping credit supply curve and

credit rationing.




j/   Note that       uax(1+x)    and from (34) we get that   1+x>O.

                                     29
    Another important aspect of the problem, which we did not touch

in this paper, is the effect of the sectoral composition of

investment.     In this case, investment has a predictable effect:

investirient that increases the weight of the sector that is more (less)

trade dependent will generate the strategic tax (subsidy) effect (see

Aizenman (1988)).    This suggests that greater attention should be

given to the sectoral composition of investment in any attempt to link

the availability of new credit and investment.


    An important policy implication of this paper is that one cannot

count on initiatives that reduce the burden of past debts to

automatically improve incentives for investment in indebted countries.

This may be the case for certain countries but does not necessarily

hold for all.    More generally, one would expect that, for strategic

reasons, the debt overhang depresses certain types of investment and

encourages others.    Although this situation would not be an optimal

resource allocation in a free trade, no risk of default regime, it may

still be the case that, for some countries, the depression of

investment is more closely related to a shortage of savings generated

by international credit constraints and low domestic savings.        In this

case, for example, policies that encourage domestic savings would have

a much larger impact on domestic investment than a change in the

incentive structure arising from the debt overhang.


    Our analysis suggests that the consequences of the debt overhang

for aggregate investment may be ambiguous in value.    For example, a

rise in investment triggered by strategic considerations may in fact


                                 30
reflect an attempt by the debtor country to increase its future

bargaining power, and will result in lower repayments.   A related

example would be an increase in international reserve holdings by the

debtor country.   Therefore, factors such as the composition of

investment may provide a better signal about prospects for future

repayment.

1.     The Effect of the Capital Stock on the Bargaining Outcome



       In order to determine the change in the bargaining outcome, we

can assume K parametrically fixed and express equation (16) as:


                           *
     (al)        f(K ,X
                       *
                               )
                                       = g(X *

so that:


                  dX*                      f*

                  dK                    g* — fx*


        It   can be shown that g* >                       0    and fx* < 0,   so that the sign of
            is    the same as the sign of fK*.                      And the sign of fK* is the

negative of the sign of a. We will prove each one of these

statements now.

     H*       = 1   +—----—
                       *a
                            K +1

          Using         the above relationship:



     fK*       =    _C aK*a         1H* 1'a [H*1/a            — 1
                                                                      —




                                                               33
        We will show that the term in brackets is positive, so that the

sign of a      deternines      the sign of the derivative.                    Call the term in

brackets c2.       We have that:



U   =            -1   -
                                         1)


        For the production function to have the standard properties, the

parameter         must be constrained to be less than or equal to 1.                           Note

that for an interior solution to the bargaining problem to exist

is constrained to be .5                        <   5l/       because both countries must be

in a position superior to their threat points.                               Therefore, when        = 1,

    =   .5,    and U = 0.    Because dc2/d < 0, as will be shown below, it

follows that for            < 1    c2   is    positive, and fK* has the opposite sign to




           =    ____L_JL_                     IH*a       1
    d                        + 1)


                                                                1—a
                                                                 a
        The negative sign of follows from                             > 1.    To show this,

notice that                > 1 because the debtor has some gains from trade.

Thus, when 0 <        a < 1,      H > 1, and the inequality holds.                  When a   < 0,
    < 1   and         <   0, so that the inequality also holds.

2.     The Effect of a Change in Endowment on the Creditor's Payoff



       For the repayment to the creditor to be higher in the

high-endowment state, we need to show that dX*/d    <   1, that is, that
the payoff to the debtor country increases less than one for one.

Again, we can express the first order condition as:



     (a3)       f(X*)    =   g(X*,)

       Inspection of (16) reveals that:



     g *
      x
            =    - g-x

which       implies:


                 dX*
     (a4)                               <    1.
                 dx          g* - fx*
