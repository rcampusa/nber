                                                ABSTRACT
Social experiments are powerful sources of information about the effectiveness of interventions. In
practice, initial randomization plans are almost always compromised. Multiple hypotheses are frequently
tested. "Significant" effects are often reported with p-values that do not account for preliminary screening
from a large candidate pool of possible effects. This paper develops tools for analyzing data from
experiments as they are actually implemented.
We apply these tools to analyze the influential HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The Perry program
was a social experiment that provided preschool education and home visits to disadvantaged children
during their preschool years. It was evaluated by the method of random assignment. Both treatments
and controls have been followed from age 3 through age 40.
Previous analyses of the Perry data assume that the planned randomization protocol was implemented.
In fact, as in many social experiments, the intended randomization protocol was compromised. Accounting
for compromised randomization, multiple-hypothesis testing, and small sample sizes, we find statistically
significant and economically important program effects for both males and females. We also examine
the representativeness of the Perry study.

1         Introduction

Social experiments can produce valuable information about the effectiveness of interventions.
However, many social experiments are compromised by departures from initial randomization
plans.1 Many have small sample sizes. Applications of large sample statistical procedures
may produce misleading inferences. In addition, most social experiments have multiple
outcomes. This creates the danger of selective reporting of “significant” effects from a large
pool of possible effects, biasing downward reported p-values. This paper develops tools for
analyzing the evidence from experiments with multiple outcomes as they are implemented
rather than as they are planned. We apply these tools to reanalyze an influential social
experiment.
        The HighScope Perry Preschool program, conducted in the 1960s, was an early childhood
intervention that provided preschool education to low-IQ, disadvantaged African-American
children living in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The study was evaluated by the method of random
assignment. Participants were followed through age 40 and plans are under way for an age-
50 followup. The beneficial long-term effects reported for the Perry program constitute a
cornerstone of the argument for early childhood intervention efforts throughout the world.
        Many analysts discount the reliability of the Perry study. For example, Hanushek and
Lindseth (2009), among others, claim that the sample size of the study is too small to make
valid inferences about the program. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) claim that estimated
effects of the program are small and that many are not statistically significant. Others ex-
press the concern that previous analyses selectively report statistically significant estimates,
biasing the inference about the program (Anderson, 2008).
        There is a potentially more devastating critique. As happens in many social experi-
ments, the proposed randomization protocol for the Perry study was compromised. This
compromise casts doubt on the validity of evaluation methods that do not account for the
compromised randomization and calls into question the validity of the simple statistical

procedures previously applied to analyze the Perry study.2
       In addition, there is the question of how representative the Perry population is of the
general African-American population. Those who advocate access to universal early child-
hood programs often appeal to the evidence from the Perry study, even though the project
only targeted a disadvantaged segment of the population.3
       This paper develops and applies small-sample permutation procedures that are tailored
to test hypotheses on samples generated from the less-than-ideal randomizations conducted
in many social experiments. We apply these tools to the data from the Perry experiment.
We correct estimated treatment effects for imbalances that arose in implementing the ran-
domization protocol and from post-randomization reassignment. We address the potential
problem that arises from arbitrarily selecting “significant” hypotheses from a set of possible
hypotheses using recently developed stepdown multiple-hypothesis testing procedures. The
procedures we use minimize the probability of falsely rejecting any true null hypotheses.
       Using these tools, this paper demonstrates the following points: (a) Statistically signifi-
cant Perry treatment effects survive analyses that account for the small sample size of the
study. (b) Correcting for the effect of selectively reporting statistically significant responses,
there are substantial impacts of the program on males and females. Results are stronger
for females at younger adult ages and for males at older adult ages. (c) Accounting for the
compromised randomization of the program strengthens the evidence for important program
effects compared to the evidence reported in the previous literature that neglects the imbal-
ances created by compromised randomization. (d) Perry participants are representative of a
low-ability, disadvantaged African-American population.
       This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the Perry experiment. Section 3

     This problem is pervasive in the literature. For example, in the Abecedarian program, randomization
was also compromised as some initially enrolled in the experiment were later dropped (Campbell and Ramey,
1994). In the SIME-DIME experiment, the randomization protocol was never clearly described. See Kurz
and Spiegelman (1972). Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999) chronicle the variety of “threats to validity”
encountered in many social experiments.

2       Perry: Experimental Design and Background

The HighScope Perry Program was conducted during the early- to mid-1960s in the district
of the Perry Elementary School, a public school in Ypsilanti, Michigan, a town near Detroit.
The sample size was small: 123 children allocated over five entry cohorts. Data were collected
at age 3, the entry age, and through annual surveys until age 15, with additional follow-ups
conducted at ages 19, 27, and 40. Program attrition remained low through age 40, with over
91% of the original subjects interviewed. Two-thirds of the attrited were dead. The rest
were missing.5 Numerous measures were collected on economic, criminal, and educational
outcomes over this span as well as on cognition and personality. Program intensity was low
compared to that in many subsequent early childhood development programs.6 Beginning at
age 3, and lasting 2 years, treatment consisted of a 2.5-hour educational preschool on week-
days during the school year, supplemented by weekly home visits by teachers.7 HighScope’s
innovative curriculum, developed over the course of the Perry experiment, was based on the
principle of active learning, guiding students through the formation of key developmental
factors using intensive child-teacher interactions (Schweinhart et al. 1993, pp. 34–36; Weikart
et al. 1978, pp. 5–6, 21–23). A more complete description of the Perry program curriculum
is given in Web Appendix A.8
    4
     http://jenni.uchicago.edu/Perry/
    5
     There are two missing controls and two missing treatments. Five controls and two treatments are dead.
   6
     The Abecedarian program is an example (see, e.g., Campbell et al., 2002). Cunha, Heckman, Lochner,
and Masterov (2006) and Reynolds and Temple (2008) discuss a variety of these programs and compare their
intensity.
   7
     An exception is that the first entry cohort received only 1 year of treatment, beginning at age 4.

Eligibility Criteria The program admitted five entry cohorts in the early 1960s, drawn
from the population surrounding the Perry Elementary school. Candidate families for the
study were identified from a survey of the families of the students attending the elementary
school, by neighborhood group referrals, and through door-to-door canvassing. The eligibility
rules for participation were that the participants should (i) be African-American; (ii) have
a low IQ (between 70 and 85) at study entry,9 and (iii) be disadvantaged as measured by
parental employment level, parental education, and housing density (persons per room).
The Perry study targeted families who were more disadvantaged than most other African-
American families in the United States. but were representative of a large segment of the
disadvantaged African-American population. We discuss the issue of the representativeness
of the program compared to the general African-American population in Section 6.
      Among children in the Perry Elementary School neighborhood, Perry study families were
particularly disadvantaged. Table 1 shows that compared to other families with children
in the Perry School catchment area, Perry study families were younger, had lower levels of
parental education, and had fewer working mothers. Further, Perry program families had
fewer educational resources, larger families, and greater participation in welfare, compared
to the families with children in another neighborhood elementary school in Ypsilanti, the
Erickson school, situated in a predominantly middle-class white neighborhood.
      We do not know whether, among eligible families in the Perry catchment, those who
volunteered to participate in the program were more motivated than other families, and
whether this greater motivation would have translated into better child outcomes. However,
according to Weikart, Bond, and McNeil (1978, p. 16), “virtually all eligible children were
enrolled in the project,” so this potential concern appears to be unimportant.


Randomization Protocol The randomization protocol used in the Perry study was com-
plex. According to Weikart et al. (1978, p. 16), for each designated eligible entry cohort,
  9
    Measured by the Stanford-Binet IQ test (1960s norming). The average IQ in the general population is
100 by construction. IQ range for Perry participants is 1–2 standard deviations below the average.

children were assigned to treatment and control groups in the following way, which is graph-
ically illustrated in Figure 1:

   1. In any entering cohort, younger siblings of previously enrolled families were assigned
         the same treatment status as their older siblings.10

   2. Those remaining were ranked by their entry IQ scores.11 Odd- and even-ranked subjects
         were assigned to two separate unlabeled groups.

       Balancing on IQ produced an imbalance on family background measures. This was
corrected in a second, “balancing”, stage of the protocol.


   3. Some individuals initially assigned to one group were swapped between the unlabeled
         groups to balance gender and mean socio-economic (SES) status, “with Stanford-Binet
         scores held more or less constant.”

   4. A flip of a coin (a single toss) labeled one group as “treatment” and the other as
         “control.”

   5. Some individuals provisionally assigned to treatment, whose mothers were employed
         at the time of the assignment, were swapped with control individuals whose mothers
         were not employed. The rationale for these swaps was that it was difficult for working
         mothers to participate in home visits assigned to the treatment group and because
         of transportation difficulties.12 A total of five children of working mothers initially
         assigned to treatment were reassigned to control.
  10
     The rationale for excluding younger siblings from the randomization process was that enrolling children
in the same family in different treatment groups would weaken the observed treatment effect due to within-
family spillovers.
  11
     Ties were broken by a toss of a coin.
  12
     The following quotation from an early monograph on Perry summarizes the logic of the study planners:
“Occasional exchanges of children between groups also had to be made because of the inconvenience of half-day
preschool for working mothers and the transportation difficulties of some families. No funds were available
for transportation or full-day care, and special arrangements could not always be made.” (Weikart, Bond,
and McNeil, 1978, p. 17)




                                                     6
Even after the swaps at stage 3 were made, pre-program measures were still somewhat

3       Statistical Challenges in Analyzing the Perry Pro-

        gram

Drawing valid inference from the Perry study requires meeting three statistical challenges: (i)
small sample size; (ii) compromise in the randomization protocol; and (iii) the large number
of outcomes and associated hypotheses, which creates the danger of selectively reporting
“significant” estimates out of a large candidate pool of estimates, thereby biasing downward
reported p-values.


Small Sample Size The small sample size of the Perry study and the non-normality of
many outcome measures call into question the validity of classical tests, such as those based
on the t-, F -, and χ2 -statistics.13 Classical statistical tests rely on central limit theorems
and produce inferences based on p-values that are only asymptotically valid.
      A substantial literature demonstrates that classical testing procedures can be unreliable
when sample sizes are small and the data are non-normal.14 Both features characterize
the Perry study. There are approximately 25 observations per gender in each treatment
assignment group and the distribution of observed measures is often highly skewed.15 Our
paper addresses the problem of small sample size by using permutation-based inference
procedures that are valid in small samples.


The Treatment Assignment Protocol The randomization protocol implemented in
the Perry study diverged from the original design. Treatment and control statuses were

reassigned for a subset of persons after an initial random assignment. This creates two
potential problems.
      First, such reassignments can induce correlation between treatment assignment and base-
line characteristics of participants. If the baseline measures affect outcomes, treatment as-
signment can become correlated with outcomes through an induced common dependence.
Such a relationship between outcomes and treatment assignment violates the assumption
of independence between treatment assignment and outcomes in the absence of treatment
effects. Moreover, reassignment produces an imbalance in the covariates between the treated
and the controlled, as documented in Figures 2 and 3. For example, the working status of
the mother was one basis for reassignment to the control group. Weikart, Bond, and McNeil
(1978, p. 18) note that at baseline, children of working mothers had higher test scores. Not
controlling for mother’s working status would bias downward estimated treatment effects for
schooling and other ability-dependent outcomes. We control for imbalances by conditioning
on such covariates.

Notes: The socio-economic status (SES) index is a weighted linear combination of three variables:
(a) average highest grade completed by whichever parent(s) was present, with a coefficient 0.5; (b)
father’s employment status (or mother’s, if the father was absent): 3 for skilled, 2 for semi-skilled,
and 1 for unskilled or none, all with a coefficient 2; (c) number of rooms in the house divided by
number of people living in the household, with a coefficient 2. The skill level of the parent’s job
is rated by the study coordinators and is not clearly defined. An SES index of 11 or lower was
the intended requirement for entry into the study (Weikart, Bond, and McNeil, 1978, p. 14). This
criterion was not always adhered to: out of the full sample, 7 individuals had an SES index above
the cutoff (6 out of 7 were in the treatment group, and 6 out of 7 were in the last two waves).

   Second, even if treatment assignment is statistically independent of the baseline variables,
compromised randomization can still produce biased inference. A compromised randomiza-
tion protocol can generate treatment assignment distributions that differ from those that
would result from implementation of the intended randomization protocol. As a conse-
quence, incorrect inference can occur if the data are analyzed under the assumption that no
compromise in randomization has occurred.
   More specifically, analyzing the Perry study under the assumption that a fair coin decides
the treatment assignment of each participant — as if an idealized, non-compromised random-
ization had occurred — mischaracterizes the actual treatment assignment mechanism and
hence the probability of assignment to treatment. This can produce incorrect critical values
and improper control of Type-I error. Section 4.5 presents a procedure that accounts for
the compromised randomization using permutation-based inference conditioned on baseline
background measures.


Multiple Hypotheses There are numerous outcomes reported in the Perry experiment.
One has to be careful in conducting analyses to avoid selective reporting of statistically
significant outcomes, as determined by single-hypothesis tests, without correcting for the
effects of such preliminary screening on actual p-values. This practice is sometimes termed
cherry picking.
   Multiple-hypothesis testing procedures avoid bias in inference arising from selectively
reporting statistically significant results by adjusting inference to take into account the overall
set of outcomes from which the “significant” results are drawn.
   The traditional approach to testing based on overall F -statistics involves testing the null
hypothesis that any element of a block of hypotheses is rejected. We test that hypothesis as
part of a general stepdown procedure, which also tests which hypotheses within the block of
hypotheses are rejected.
   Simple calculations suggest that concerns about the overall statistical significance of

 Based on 715 outcomes in the Perry study. (See Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfield, and Nores,
2005, for a description of the data.) 269 outcomes are from the period before the age-19 interview; 269
are from the age-19 interview; 95 are outcomes from the age-27 interview; 55 are outcomes from the age-40
interview.


treatment effects for the Perry study may have been overstated. Table 2 summarizes the
inference for 715 Perry study outcomes by reporting the percentage of hypotheses rejected
at various significance levels.16 If outcomes were statistically independent and there was no
experimental treatment effect, we would expect only 1% of the hypotheses to be rejected
at the 1% level, but instead 7% are rejected overall (3% for males and 7% for females). At
the 5% significance level, we obtain a 23% overall rejection rate (13% for males and 22% for
females). Far more than 10% of the hypotheses are statistically significant when the 10%
level is used. These results suggest that treatment effects are present for each gender and
for the full sample.
         However, the assumption of independence among the outcomes used to make these cal-
culations is quite strong. In our analysis, we use modern methods for testing multiple
hypotheses that account for possible dependencies among outcomes. We use a stepdown
multiple-hypothesis testing procedure that controls for the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)
— the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis among a set of hypotheses
we seek to test jointly. This procedure is discussed below in Section 4.6.
    16
    Inference is based on a permutation testing method where the t-statistic of the difference in means
between treatment and control groups is used as the test statistic.

4        Methods

This section presents a framework for inference that addresses the problems raised in Sec-
tion 3, namely, small samples, compromised randomization, and cherry picking. We first
establish notation, discuss the benefits of a valid randomization, and consider the conse-
quences of compromised randomization. We then introduce a general framework for repre-
senting randomized experiments. Using this framework, we develop a statistical framework
for characterizing the conditions under which permutation-based inference produces valid
small-sample inference when there is corruption of the intended randomization protocol.
Finally, we discuss the multiple-hypothesis testing procedure used in this paper.


4.1        Randomized Experiments

The standard model of program evaluation describes the observed outcome for participant
i, Yi , by Yi = Di Yi,1 + (1 − Di )Yi,0 , where (Yi,0 , Yi,1 ) are potential outcomes corresponding
to control and treatment status for participant i, respectively, and Di is the assignment
indicator: Di = 1 if treatment occurs, Di = 0 otherwise.
       An evaluation problem arises because either Yi,0 or Yi,1 is observed, but not both. Se-
lection bias can arise from participant self-selection into treatment and control groups so
that sampled distributions of Yi,0 and Yi,1 are biased estimators of the population distri-
butions. Properly implemented randomized experiments eliminate selection bias because
they produce independence between (Yi,0 , Yi,1 ) and Di .17 Notationally, (Y0 , Y1 ) ⊥⊥ D, where
Y0 , Y1 , and D are vectors of variables across participants, and ⊥⊥ denotes independence.
       Selection bias can arise when experimenters fail to generate treatment groups that are
comparable on unobserved background variables that affect outcomes. A properly conducted
randomization avoids the problem of selection bias by inducing independence between un-
observed variables and treatment assignments.
       Compromised randomization can invalidate the assumption that (Y0 , Y1 ) ⊥⊥ D. The
  17
       Web Appendix B discusses this point in greater detail.


                                                      13
treatments and controls can have imbalanced covariate distributions.18 The following nota-
tional framework helps to clarify the basis for inference under compromised randomization
that characterizes the Perry study.


4.2       Setup and Notation

Denote the set of participants by I = {1, . . . , I}, where I = 123 is the total number of Perry
study participants. We denote the random vector representing treatment assignments by
D = (Di ; i ∈ I). The set D is the support of the vector of random assignments, namely
D = [0, 1] × · · · × [0, 1], 123 times, so D = [0, 1]123 . Define the pre-program variables used
in the randomization protocol by X = (Xi ; i ∈ I). For the Perry study, baseline variables
X consist of data on the following measures: IQ, enrollment cohort, socio-economic status
(SES) index, family structure, gender, and maternal employment status, all measured at
study entry.
       Assignment to treatment is characterized by a function M . The arguments of M are
variables that affect treatment assignment. Define R as a random vector that describes the
outcome of a randomization device (e.g., a flip of a coin to assign treatment status). Prior
to determining the realization of R, two groups are formed on the basis of pre-program
variables X. Then R is realized and its value is used to assign treatment status. R does
not depend on the composition of the two groups. After the initial treatment assignment,
individuals are swapped across assigned treatment groups based on some observed back-
ground characteristics X (e.g., mother’s working status). M captures all three aspects of
the treatment assignment mechanism. The following assumptions formalize the treatment
  18
    Heckman and Smith (1995), Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith (1999), and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007)
discuss randomization bias and substitution bias. The Perry study does not appear to be subject to these
biases. Randomization bias occurs when random assignment causes the type of person participating in
a program to differ from the type that would participate in the program as it normally operates based
on participant decisions. The description of Weikart, Bond, and McNeil (1978) suggests that because of
universal participation of eligibles, this is not an issue for Perry. Substitution bias arises when members
of an experimental control group gain access to close substitutes for the experimental treatment. During
the pre-Head Start era of the early 1960s, there were few alternative programs to Perry, so the problem of
substitution bias is unimportant for the analysis of the Perry study.

assignment protocol:

Assumption A-1. D ∼ M (R, X) : supp(R)×supp(X) → D; R ⊥⊥ X, where supp(D) = D,
and supp denotes support.

   Let Vi represent the unobserved variables that affect outcomes for participant i. The
vector of unobserved variables is V = (Vi ; i ∈ I). The assumption that unobserved variables
are independent of the randomization device R is critical for guaranteeing that randomization
produces independence between unobserved variables and treatment assignments, and can
be stated as follows:

Assumption A-2. R ⊥⊥ V .

Remark 4.1 . The random variables R used to generate the randomization and the unobserved
variables V are assumed to be independent. However, if initial randomization is compromised
by reassignment based on X, the assignment mechanism depends on X. Thus, substantial
correlation between final treatment assignments D and unobserved variables V can exist
through the common dependence between X and V .
   As noted in Section 2, some participants whose mothers were employed had their initial
treatment status reassigned in an effort to lower program costs. One way to interpret the
protocol as implemented is that the selection of reassigned participants occurred at random
given working status. In this case, the assignment mechanism is based on observed variables
and can be represented by M as defined in assumption A-1. In particular, conditioning on
maternal working status (and other variables used to assign persons to treatment) provides a
valid representation of the treatment assignment mechanism and avoids selection bias. This
is the working hypothesis of our paper.
   Given that many of the outcomes we study are measured some 30 years after random
assignment, and a variety of post-randomization period shocks generate these outcomes, the
correlation between V and the outcomes may be weak. For example, there is evidence that
earnings are generated in part by a random walk with drift (see, e.g., Meghir and Pistaferri,

                                             15
2004). If this is so, the correlation between the errors in the earnings equation and the errors
in the assignment to treatment equation may be weak. By the proximity theorem (Fisher,
1966), the bias arising from V correlated with outcomes may be negligible.19

       Each element i in the outcome vector Y takes value Yi,0 or Yi,1 . The vectors of counterfac-
tual outcomes are defined by Yd = (Yi,d ; i ∈ I); d ∈ {0, 1}, i ∈ I. Without loss of generality,
assumption A-3 postulates that outcomes Yi,d , where d ∈ {0, 1}, i ∈ I, are generated by a
function f :

Assumption A-3. Yi,d ≡ f (d, Xi , Vi ); d ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ i ∈ I.20

Assumptions A-1, A-2, and A-3 formally characterize the Perry randomization protocol.


The Benefits of Randomization The major benefit of randomization comes from avoid-
ing the problem of selection bias. This benefit is a direct consequence of assumptions A-1,
A-2, and A-3, and can be stated as a lemma:

Lemma L-1. Under assumptions A-1, A-2, and A-3, (Y1 , Y0 ) ⊥⊥ D | X.
  19
     However, if reassignment of initial treatment status was not random within the group of working mothers
(say favoring those who had children with less favorable outcomes), conditioning on working status may not
be sufficient to eliminate selection bias. In a companion paper, Heckman, Pinto, Shaikh, and Yavitz (2009)
develop and apply a more conservative approach to bounding inference about the null hypothesis of no
treatment effect where selection into treatment is based on unobserved variables correlated with outcomes,
so that the assignment mechanism is described by D ∼ M (R, X, V ). Bounding is the best that they can do
because the exact rules of reassignment are unknown, and they cannot condition on V . From documentation
on the Perry randomization protocol, they have a set of restrictions used to make reassignments that produce
informative bounds.
  20
     At the cost of adding new notation, we could distinguish a subset of X, Z, which does not determine
M but does determine Y . In this case, we write an amended assumption:

Assumption A-30 . Yi,d = f (d, Xi , Zi , Vi ); d ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ i ∈ I.

In addition, assumption A-2 is strengthened to the following statement:

Assumption A-20 . R ⊥⊥ (V, Z).

In practice, conditioning on Z can be important for controlling imbalances in variables that are not used
to assign treatment but that affect outcomes. For example, birth weight (a variable not used in the Perry
randomization protocol) may, on average, be lower in the control group and higher in the treatment group,
and birth weight may affect outcomes. In this case, a spurious treatment effect could arise in any sample
due to this imbalance, and not because of the treatment itself. Such imbalance may arise from compromises
in the randomization protocol. To economize on notation, we do not explicitly distinguish Z, but instead
treat it as a subset of X.


                                                        16
Proof. Conditional on X, the argument that determines Yi,d for d ∈ {0, 1} is V , which is
independent of R by assumption A-2. Thus, R is independent of (Y0 , Y1 ). Therefore, any
function of R and X is also independent of (Y0 , Y1 ) conditional on X. In particular, as-
sumption A-1 states that conditional on X, treatment assignments depend only on R, so
(Y0 , Y1 ) ⊥⊥ D | X.

Remark 4.2 . Regardless of the particular type of compromise to the initial randomization
protocol, Lemma L-1 is valid whenever the randomization protocol is based on observed
variables X, but not on V . Assumption A-2 is a consequence of randomization. Under it,
randomization provides a solution to the problem of biased selection.21

Remark 4.3 . Lemma L-1 justifies matching as a method to correct for irregularities in the
randomization protocol.

       The method of matching is often criticized because the appropriate conditioning set that
guarantees conditional independence is generally not known, and there is no algorithm for
choosing the conditioning variables without invoking additional assumptions (e.g., exogene-
ity).22 For the Perry experiment, the conditioning variables X that determine the assignment
to treatment are documented, even though the exact treatment assignment rule is unknown
(see Weikart, Bond, and McNeil, 1978).
       When samples are small and the dimensionality of covariates is large, it becomes imprac-
tical to match on all covariates. This is the “curse of dimensionality” in matching (Westat,
1981). To overcome this problem, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) propose propensity score
matching, in which matches are made based on a propensity score, that is, the probability
of being treated conditional on observed covariates. This is a one-dimensional object that
  21
    Biased selection can occur in the context of a randomized experiment if treatment assignment uses infor-
mation that is not available to the program evaluator and is statistically related to the potential outcomes.
For example, suppose that the protocol M is based in part on an unobserved (by the economist) variable V
that impacts Y through the f (·) in assumption A-3:

Assumption A-10 . M (R, X, V ) : supp(R) × supp(X) × supp(V ) → D.

                                                     17
reduces the dimensionality of the matching problem at the cost of having to estimate the
propensity score, which creates problems of its own.23 Zhao (2004) shows that when sample
sizes are small, as they are in the Perry data, propensity score matching performs poorly
when compared with other matching estimators. Instead of matching on the propensity
score, we directly condition on the matching variables using a partially linear model. A fully
nonparametric approach to modeling the conditioning set is impractical in the Perry sample.


4.3       Testing the Null Hypothesis of No Treatment Effect

Our aim is to test the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. This hypothesis is equivalent
to the statement that the control and treated outcome vectors share the same distribution:

                           d
Hypothesis H-1. Y1 = Y0 | X,

         d
where = denotes equality in distribution.
      The hypothesis of no treatment effect can be restated in an equivalent form. Under
Lemma L-1, hypothesis H-1 is equivalent to the following statement:

Hypothesis H-10 . Y ⊥⊥ D | X.

The equivalence is demonstrated by the following argument. Let AJ denote a set in the
support of a random variable J. Then




 23
      See Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998).


                                                  18
Pr((D, Y ) ∈ (AD , AY )|X) = E(1[D ∈ AD ]         1[Y ∈ AY ]|X)

                                  (where     denotes a Hadamard product.24 )

                              = E(1[Y ∈ AY ]|D ∈ AD , X) Pr(D ∈ AD |X)

                              = E(1[(Y1      D + Y0    (1 − D)) ∈ AY ]|D ∈ AD , X) Pr(D ∈ AD |X)

                              = E(1[Y0 ∈ AY ]|D ∈ AD , X) Pr(D ∈ AD |X) by hypothesis H-1

                              = E(1[Y0 ∈ AY ]|X) Pr(D ∈ AD |X) by Lemma L-1

                              = Pr(Y ∈ AY |X) Pr(D ∈ AD |X),




      We refer to hypotheses H-1 and H-10 interchangeably throughout this paper. If the
randomization protocol is fully known, then the randomization method implies a known
distribution for the treatment assignments. In this case, we can proceed in the following
manner:

  1. From knowledge of the treatment assignment rules, one can generate the distribution
        of D|X;

  2. Select a statistic T (Y, D, X) with the property that larger values of the statistic provide
        evidence against the null hypothesis, hypothesis H-1 (e.g., t-statistics, χ2 , etc.);

  3. Create confidence intervals for the random variable T (Y, D, X) | X at significance level
        α based on the known distribution of D|X;

  4. Reject the null hypothesis if the value of T (Y, D, X) calculated from the data does not
        belong to the confidence interval.

      Implementing these procedures requires solving certain problems. To produce the distri-

                                                  19
bution of D|X requires precise knowledge of the ingredients of the assignment rules, which
are only partially known. Alternatively, the analyst could use the asymptotic distribution of
the chosen test statistic. However, given the size of the Perry sample, it seems unlikely that
the distribution of T (Y, D, X) is accurately characterized by large sample distribution theory.
We address these problems by using permutation-based inference that addresses the prob-
lem of small sample size in a way that allows us to simultaneously account for compromised
randomization when assumptions A-1–A-3 and hypothesis H-1 are valid. Our inference is
based on an exchangeability property that remains valid under compromised randomization.


4.4    Exchangeability and the Permutation-Based Tests

The main result of this subsection is that, under the null hypothesis, the joint distribution
of outcome and treatment assignments is invariant for certain classes of permutations. We
rely on this property to construct a permutation test that remains valid under compromised
randomization. Permutation-based inference is often termed data-dependent because the
computed p-values are conditional on the observed data. These tests are also distribution-
free because they do not rely on assumptions about the parametric distribution from which
the data are sampled. Because permutation tests give accurate p-values even when the
sampling distribution is skewed, they are often used when sample sizes are small and sample
statistics are unlikely to be normal. Hayes (1996) shows the advantage of permutation tests
over the classical approaches for the analysis of small samples and non-normal data.
   Permutation-based tests make inferences about hypothesis H-1 by exploring the invari-
ance of the joint distribution of (Y, D) under permutations that swap the elements of the
vector of treatment indicators D. We use g to index a permutation function π, where the
permutation of elements of D according to πg is represented by gD. Notationally, gD is




                                              20
defined as


gD =
                            
   e i; i ∈ I | D
   D            e i = Dπg (i) , where πg is a permutation function (i.e., πg : I → I is a bijection).


Lemma L-2. Let the permutation function πg : I → I within each stratum of X, such that
                                                                   d
Xi = Xπg (i) , ∀ i ∈ I. Then, under assumption A-1, gD = D.

Proof. gD ∼ M (R, gX) by construction, but gX = X by definition, so gD ∼ M (R, X).

Remark 4.4 . An important feature of the exchangeability property used in Lemma L-2
is that it relies on limited information on the randomization protocol. It is valid under
compromised randomization and there is no need for a full specification of the distribution
D or the assignment mechanism M .

      Let GX be the set of all permutations that permute elements only within each stratum
of X.25 Formally,


                  GX = g; πg : I → I is a bijection and Xi = Xπg (i) , ∀ i ∈ I .
                      



A corollary of Lemma L-2 is
                                             d
                                          D = gD      ∀ g ∈ GX .                             (1)

We now state and prove the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. Let treatment assignment be characterized by assumptions A-1–A-3. Under
hypothesis H-1, the joint distribution of outcomes Y and treatment assignments D is invari-
ant under permutations g ∈ GX of treatment assignments within strata formed by values of
                                   d
covariates X, that is, (Y, D) = (Y, gD) ∀ g ∈ GX .
 25
      See Web Appendix C.3 for a formal description of restricted permutation groups.




                                                    21
                                d
Proof. By Lemma L-2, D = gD ∀ g ∈ GX . But Y ⊥⊥ D | X by hypothesis H-1. Thus
          d
(Y, D) = (Y, gD) ∀ g ∈ GX .

       Theorem 4.1 is called the randomization hypothesis.26 We use it to test whether Y ⊥⊥
D | X. Intuitively, Theorem 4.1 states that if the randomization protocol is such that (Y, D)
is invariant over the strata of X, then the absence of a treatment effect implies that the joint
distribution of (Y, D) is invariant with respect to permutations of D that are restricted within
strata of X.27 Theorem 4.1 is a useful tool for inference about treatment effects. For example,
suppose that, conditional on X (which we keep implicit), we have a test statistic T (Y, D)
with the property that larger values of the statistic provide evidence against hypothesis H-
1 and an associated critical value c, such that whenever T (Y, D) > c, we reject the null
hypothesis. The goal of our test is to control for a Type-I error at significance level α, that
is,


              Pr(reject hypothesis H-1 | hypothesis H-1 is true)

                                        = Pr(T (Y, D) > c| hypothesis H-1 is true) ≤ α.


A critical value can be computed by using the fact that as g varies in GX under the null
hypothesis of no treatment effect, conditional on the sample, T (Y, gD) is uniformly dis-
tributed.28 Thus, under the null, a critical value can be computed by taking the α quantile
of the set {T (Y, gD) : g ∈ GX }. In practice, permutation tests compare a test statistic
computed on the original (unpermuted) data with a distribution of test statistics computed
on resamplings of that data. The measure of evidence against the randomization hypothe-
sis, the p-value, is computed as the fraction of resampled data which yields a test statistic
greater than that yielded by the original data. In the case of the Perry study, these re-
sampled data sets consist of the original data with treatment and control labels permuted

across observations. As discussed below in Section 4.5, we use permutations that account for
the compromised randomization, and our test statistic is the coefficient on treatment status
estimated using a regression procedure due to Freedman and Lane (1983), which controls
for covariate imbalances and is designed for application to permutation inference.
       We use this procedure and report one-sided mid-p-values, which are averages between the
one-sided p-values defined using strict and non-strict inequalities. As a concrete example of
this procedure, suppose that we use a permutation test with J + 1 permutations gj , where
the first J are drawn at random from the permutation group GX and gJ+1 is the identity
permutation (corresponding to using the original sample).
       Our source statistic ∆ is a function of an outcome Y and permuted treatment labels gj D.
For each permutation, we compute a set of source statistics ∆j = ∆(Y, gj D). From these,
we compute the rank statistic T j associated with each source statistic ∆j :29

                                                       J+1
                                                  1 X
                                        Tj ≡              1[∆j > ∆l ].                                          (2)
                                                J + 1 l=1

Without loss of generality, we assume that higher values of the source statistics are evidence
against the null hypothesis. Working with ranks of the source statistic effectively standarizes
the scale of the statistic and is an alternative to studentization (i.e., standardizing by the
standard error). This procedure is called prepivoting in the literature.30 The mid-p-value is
  29
     Although this step can be skipped without affecting any results for single-hypothesis testing (i.e., ∆j
may be used directly in calculating p-value), the use of rank statistics T j is recommended by Romano and
Wolf (2005) for the comparison of statistics in multiple-hypothesis testing.
  30
     See Beran (1988a,b). Prepivoting is defined by the transformation of a test statistic into its cumulative
distribution function (cdf). The distribution is summarized by the relative ranking of the source statistics.
Therefore, it is invariant to any monotonic transformation of the source statistic. Romano and Wolf (2005)
note that prepivoting is useful in constructing multiple-hypothesis tests. The procedure generates a distri-
bution of test statistics that is balanced in the sense that each prepivoting statistic has roughly the same
power against alternatives. More specifically, suppose that there are no ties. After prepivoting, the marginal
distribution of each rank statistic in this vector is a discrete distribution that is uniform [0, 1]. The power
of the joint test of hypotheses depends only on the correlation among the prepivoting statistics, and not on
their original scale (i.e., the scale of the source). The question of optimality in the choice of test statistics is
only relevant to the extent that different choices change the relative ranking of the statistics. An example
relevant to this paper is that the choice between tests based on difference in means across control and treat-
ment groups or the t-statistic associated with the difference in means is irrelevant for permutation tests in
randomized trials as both statistics produce the same rank statistics across permutations. (See Good, 2000,
for a discussion.)

4.5       Accounting for Compromised Randomization

This paper solves the problem of compromised randomization under the assumption of con-
ditional exchangeability of assignments given X. A by-product of this approach is that we
correct for imbalance in covariates between treatments and controls.
       Conditional inference is implemented using a permutation-based test that relies on re-
stricted classes of permutations, denoted by GX . We partition the sample into subsets, where
each subset consists of participants with common background measures. Such subsets are
termed orbits or blocks. Under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, treatment and
control outcomes have the same distributions within an orbit.32 Equivalently, treatment
assignments D are exchangeable (therefore permutable) with respect to the outcome Y for
participants who share common pre-program values X. Thus, the valid permutations g ∈ GX
swap labels within conditioning orbits.
       We modify standard permutation methods to account for the explicit Perry randomiza-
tion protocol. Features of the randomization protocol, such as identical treatment assign-
ments for siblings, generate a distribution of treatment assignments that cannot be described
(or replicated) by simple random assignment.33
  31
     Mid-p-values recognize the discrete nature of the test statistics.
  32
     The baseline variables can affect outcomes, but may (or may not) affect the distribution of assignments
produced by the compromised randomization.
  33
     Web Appendix C provides relevant theoretical background, as well as operational details, about imple-
menting the permutation framework.




                                                     24
Conditional Inference in Small Samples Invoking conditional exchangeability de-
creases the number of valid permutations within X strata. The small Perry sample size
prohibits very fine partitions of the available conditioning variables. In general, nonpara-
metric conditioning in small samples introduces the serious practical problem of small or
even empty permutation orbits. To circumvent this problem and obtain restricted permuta-
tion orbits of reasonable size, we assume a linear relationship between some of the baseline
measures in X and the outcomes Y . We partition the data into orbits on the basis of
variables that are not assumed to have a linear relationship with outcome measures. Remov-
ing the effects of some conditioning variables, we are left with larger subsets within which
permutation-based inference is feasible.
       More precisely, we divide the vector X into two parts: those variables X [L] which are
assumed to have a linear relationship with Y , and variables X [N ] , whose relationship with Y
is allowed to be nonparametric, X = [X [L] , X [N ] ].34 Linearity enters into our framework by
replacing assumption A-3 with the following assumption:

                                     [L]           [N ]
Assumption A-4. Yi,d ≡ δd Xi + f (d, Xi , Vi ); d ∈ {0, 1}, i ∈ I.

       Under hypothesis H-1, δ1 = δ0 = δ and Ỹ ≡ Y − δX [L] = f (X [N ] , V ). Using assump-
tion A-4, we can rework the arguments of Section 4.4 to prove that, under the null,
Ỹ ⊥⊥ D | X [N ] . Under hypothesis A-4 and the knowledge of δ, our randomization hypothesis
                    d
becomes (Ỹ , D) = (Ỹ , gD) such that g ∈ GX [N ] , where GX [N ] is the set of permutations that
swap the participants who share the same values of covariates X [N ] . We purge the influence
of X [L] on Y by subtracting δX [L] and can construct valid permutation tests of the null
hypothesis of no treatment effect by conditioning on X [N ] . Conditioning nonparametrically
on X [N ] , a smaller set of variables than X, we are able to create restricted permutation or-
bits that contain substantially larger numbers of observations than when we condition more
finely on all of the X. In an extreme case, one could assume that all conditioning variables
  34
   Linearity is not strictly required, but we use it in our empirical work. In place of linearity, we could use
a more general parametric functional form.


                                                      25
enter linearly, eliminate their effect on the outcome, and conduct permutations using the
resulting residuals without any need to form orbits based on X.
       If δ were known, we could control for the effect of X [L] by permuting Ỹ = Y − δX [L]
within the groups of participants that share the same pre-program variables X [N ] . However,
δ is rarely known. We address this problem by using a regression procedure due to Freed-
man and Lane (1983). Under the null hypothesis, D is not an argument in the function
determining Y . Our permutation approach addresses the problem raised by estimating δ by
permuting the residuals from a regression of Y on X [L] in orbits that share the same values
of X [N ] , leaving D fixed. The method regresses Y on X [L] , then permutes the residuals from
this regression according to GX [N ] . D is adjusted to remove the influence of X [L] . The method
then regresses the permuted residuals on adjusted D.
       More precisely, define Bg as a permutation matrix associated with the permutation g ∈
GX [N ] .35 The Freedman and Lane regression coefficient for permutation g is


                            ∆gk ≡ (D0 QX D)−1 D0 QX Bg0 QX Y k ; g ∈ GX [N ] ,                            (4)


where k is the outcome index, the matrix QX is defined as QX ≡ (I − PX ), I is the identity
matrix, and
                                   PX ≡ X [L] ((X [L] )0 X [L] )−1 (X [L] )0 .

PX is a linear projection in the space generated by the columns of X [L] , and QX is the
projection into the orthogonal space generated by X [L] . We use this regression coefficient
as the input source statistic (∆j ) to form the rank statistic (2) and to compute p-values via
(3).
       Expression (4) corrects for the effect of X [L] on both D and Y . (For notational simplicity,
we henceforth suppress the k superscript.) The term QX Y estimates Ỹ . If δ were known, Ỹ
  35
    A permutation matrix B of dimension L is a square matrix B = (bi,j ) : i, j = 1, . . . , L, where each row
and each column
           PL has a single
                        PL element equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0 within the same row or
column, so i=1 bi,j = 1, j=1 bi,j = 1 for all i, j.



                                                      26
could be computed exactly. The term D0 QX corrects for the imbalance of X [L] across treat-
ment and control groups. Without loss of generality, we can arrange the rows of (Y, D, X)
so that participants that share the same values of covariates X [N ] are adjacent. Writing
the data in this fashion, Bg is a block-diagonal matrix, whose elements are themselves per-
mutation matrices that swap elements within each stratum defined by values of X [N ] . For
notational clarity, suppose that there are S of these strata indexed by s ∈ S ≡ {1, . . . S}.
Let the participant index set I be partitioned according to these strata into S disjoint set
{I s ; s ∈ S} so that each participant in I s has the same value of pre-program variables X [N ] .
Permutations are applied within each stratum s associated with a value of X [N ] . The per-
mutations within each stratum are conducted independently of the permutations for other
strata. All within-strata permutations are generated by Bg to form Equation (4). That
equation aggregates data across the strata to form ∆gk . The same permutation structure is
applied to all outcomes in order to construct valid joint tests of multiple hypotheses. ∆gk
plays the role of ∆j in (2) to create our test statistic.
   In a series of Monte Carlo studies, Anderson and Legendre (1999) show that the Freedman-
Lane procedure generally gives the best results in terms of Type-I error and power among
a number of similar permutation-based approximation methods. In another paper, Ander-
son and Robinson (2001) compare an exact permutation method (where δ is known) with
a variety of permutation-based methods. They find that in samples of the size of Perry,
the Freedman-Lane procedure generates test statistics that are distributed most like those
generated by the exact method, and are in close agreement with the p-values from the true
distribution when regression coefficients are known. Thus, for the Freedman-Lane approach,
estimation error appears to create negligible problems for inference.


Interpreting Our Test Statistic To recapitulate, permutations are conducted within
each stratum defined by X [N ] for the S strata indexed by s ∈ S ≡ {1, . . . , S}. Let D(s)
be the treatment assignment vector for the subset I s defined by D(s) ≡ (Di ; i ∈ I s ). Let



                                               27
Ỹ (s) ≡ (Ỹi ; i ∈ I s ) be the adjusted outcome vector for the subset I s . Finally, let GXs [N ] be
the collection of all permutations that act on the |I s | elements of the set I s of stratum s.
                                                                                             d
       Note that one consequence of the conditional exchangeability property (Ỹ , D) = (Ỹ , gD)
for g ∈ GX [N ] is that the distribution of a statistic within each stratum, T (s) : (supp(Ỹ (s)) ×
supp(D(s))) → R, is the same under permutations g ∈ GXs [N ] of the treatment assignment
D(s). Formally, within each stratum s ∈ S,


                                              d
                            T (Ỹ (s), D(s)) = T (Ỹ (s), gD(s)) ∀g ∈ GXs [N ] .                     (5)


The distribution of any statistic T (s) = T (Ỹ (s), D(s)) (conditional on the sample) is uniform
across all the values T g (s) = T (Ỹ (s), gD(s)), where g varies in GXs [N ] .36
       The Freedman-Lane statistic aggregates tests across the strata. To understand how it
does this, consider an approach that combines the independent statistics across strata to
form an aggregate statistic,
                                                  S
                                                  X
                                           T =          T (s)w(s),                                   (6)
                                                  s=1

where the weight w(s) could be, for example, (1/σ(s)) where σ(s) is the standard error of
T (s). Tests of the null hypothesis could be based on T .
       To relate this statistic to the one based on Equation (4), consider the special case where
there are no X [L] variables besides the constant term so there is no need to estimate δ. Define
Di (s) as the value of D for person i in stratum s, i = 1, . . . , |I s |. Likewise, Ỹi (s) is the value
of Ỹ for person i in stratum s. Define

                                P                      P
                                  i∈I s Ỹi (s)Di (s)       s Ỹi (s)(1 − Di (s))
                         T (s) = P                    − i∈I
                                                         P                        .
                                     i∈I s Di (s)           i∈I s (1 − Di (s))



We can define corresponding statistics for the permuted data.
       In this special case where, in addition, the variance of Ỹ (s) is the same within each
  36
       See Lehmann and Romano (2005, Chapter 15) for a formal proof.




                                                        28
stratum (σ(s) = σ) and w(s) = |I s | /σ |I| (i.e., w(s) is the proportion of sample observations
in stratum s), test statistic (6) generates the same inference as the Freedman-Lane regression
coefficient (4) used as the source statistic for our testing procedure.
       In the more general case analyzed in this paper, the Freedman-Lane procedure (4) adjusts
the Y and D to remove the influence of X [L] . Test statistic (6) would be invalid, even if we use
Ỹ instead of Y because it does not control for the effect of X [L] on D.37 The Freedman-Lane
procedure adjusts for the effect of the X [L] , which may differ across strata.38


4.6       Multiple-Hypothesis Testing: The Stepdown Algorithm

Thus far, we have considered testing a single null hypothesis. Yet there are more than 715
outcomes measured in the Perry data. We now consider the null hypothesis of no treatment
effect for a set of K outcomes jointly. The complement of the joint null hypothesis is the
hypothesis that there exists at least one hypothesis out of K that we reject.
       Formally, let P be the distribution of the observed data, (Y, D)|X ∼ P . We test the |K|
set of single null hypotheses indexed by K = {1, . . . , K} and defined by the rule


                                       P ∈ Pk ⇐⇒ Y k ⊥⊥ D|X.


The hypothesis we test is defined as follows:

                                  T
Hypothesis H-2. HK : P ∈             k∈K   Pk .
  37
      Anderson and Robinson (2001) discuss the poor performance of permutation tests that do not control
for the influence of X [L] .
   38
      The Freedman-Lane statistic is based on an OLS estimator. In the case of heteroscedasticity arising
from differences in the variances of Y (s) across strata, OLS is unbiased and consistent for the treatment
effect, but the conventional standard errors for OLS are biased. Asymptotic p-values generated using normal
approximations may be misleading. Our permutation test generates valid inference by permuting data within
strata and pooling the permuted data across strata via (4). Under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect
we obtain the exact distribution of the OLS parameter conditional on the data. Thus we compute tests with
the correct size. If we permuted across strata, we would lose this property. Whether other statistics, such
as a GLS version of the Freedman-Lane statistic, would improve statistical power is still an open question.
The Freedman-Lane Equation (4) is an example of a combining function in permutation statistics (Pesarin
and Salmaso, 2010) applied to combine tests across strata.



                                                    29
   The alternative hypothesis is the complement of hypothesis H-2. Let the unknown subset
of true null hypotheses be denoted by KP ⊂ K, such that k ∈ KP ⇐⇒ P ∈ Pk . Likewise we
                  T
define HKP : P ∈ k∈KP Pk . Our goal is to test the family of null hypotheses H-2 in a way
that controls the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) at level α. FWER is the probability of
rejecting any true null hypothesis contained in HKP out of the set of hypotheses HK . FWER
at level α is


                         Pr(reject Hk : k ∈ KP |HKP is true) ≤ α .                         (7)


A multiple-hypothesis testing method is said to have strong control for FWER when Equa-
tion (7) holds for any configuration of the set of true null hypotheses KP .
   To generate inference using evidence from the Perry study in a robust and defensible
way, we use a stepdown algorithm for multiple-hypothesis testing. The procedure begins
with the null hypothesis associated with the most statistically significant statistic and then
“steps down” to the null hypotheses associated with less significant statistics. The validity
of this procedure follows from the analysis of Romano and Wolf (2005), who provide general
results on the use of stepdown multiple-hypothesis testing procedures.


The Stepdown Algorithm Stepdown begins by considering a set of K null hypotheses,
where K ≡ {1, . . . , K}. Each hypothesis postulates no treatment effect of a specific outcome,
that is, Hk : Y k ⊥⊥ D|X ; k ∈ K. The set K of null hypotheses is associated with a block of
outcomes. We adopt the mid-p-value pk as the test statistic associated with each hypothesis
Hk . Smaller values of the test statistic provide evidence against each null hypothesis. The
first step of the stepdown procedure is a joint test of all null hypotheses in K. To this end,
the method uses the maximum of the set of statistics associated with hypotheses Hk , k ∈ K.
   The next step of the stepdown procedure compares the computed test statistic with the
α-quantile of its distribution and determines whether the joint hypothesis is rejected or not.
If we fail to reject the joint null hypothesis, then the algorithm stops. If we reject the null

                                              30
hypothesis, then we iterate and consider the joint null hypothesis that excludes the most
individually statistically significant outcome — the one that is most likely to contribute
to rejection of the joint null. The method steps down and is applied to a set of K − 1
null hypotheses that excludes the set of hypotheses previously rejected. In each successive
step, the most individually significant hypothesis — the one most likely to contribute to the
significance of the joint null hypothesis — is dropped from the joint hull hypothesis, and the
joint test is performed on the reduced set of hypotheses. The process iterates until only one
hypothesis remains.39
   Summarizing, we first construct single-hypothesis p-values for each outcome in each block.
We then jointly test the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for all K outcomes. After
testing for this joint hypothesis, a stepdown algorithm is performed for a smaller set of
K − 1 hypotheses, which excludes the most significant hypothesis among the K outcomes.
The process continues for K steps. The stepdown method provides K adjusted p-values that
correct each single-hypothesis p-value for the effect of multiple-hypothesis testing.


Benefits of the Stepdown Procedure Similar to traditional multiple-hypothesis testing
procedures, such as the Bonferroni or Holm procedures (see, e.g., Lehmann and Romano,
2005, for a discussion of these procedures), the stepdown algorithm of Romano and Wolf
(2005) exhibits strong FWER control, in contrast with the classical tests like the F or χ2 .40
The procedure generates as many p-values as there are hypotheses. Thus it provides a way
to determine which hypotheses are rejected. In contrast with traditional multiple-hypothesis
testing procedures, the stepdown procedure is less conservative. The gain in power comes
from accounting for statistical dependencies among the test statistics associated with each
individual hypothesis. Lehmann and Romano (2005) and Romano and Wolf (2005) discuss
the stepdown procedure in depth. Web Appendix D summarizes the literature on multiple-
  39

description of the procedure.

Yekutieli (2006).

hypothesis testing and provides a detailed description of the stepdown procedure.


4.7     The Selection of the Set of Joint Hypotheses

There is some arbitrariness in defining the blocks of hypotheses that are jointly tested in
a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. The Perry study collects information on a variety
of diverse outcomes. Associated with each outcome is a single null hypothesis. A potential
weakness of the multiple-hypothesis testing approach is that certain blocks of outcomes may
lack interpretability. For example, one could test all hypotheses in the Perry program in
a single block.41 However, it is not clear if the hypothesis “did the experiment affect any
outcome, no matter how minor” is interesting. To avoid arbitrariness in selecting blocks of
hypotheses, we group hypotheses into economically and substantively meaningful categories
by age of participants. Income by age, education by age, health by age, test scores by age,
and behavioral indices by age are treated as separate blocks. Each block is of independent
interest and would be selected by economists on a priori grounds, drawing on information
from previous studies on the aspect of participant behavior represented by that block. We
test outcomes by age and detect pronounced life cycle effects by gender.42



5      Empirical Results

We now apply our machinery to analyze the Perry data. We find large gender differences
in treatment effects for different outcomes at different ages (Heckman, 2005; Schweinhart
et al., 2005). We find statistically significant treatment effects for both males and females
on many outcomes. These effects persist after controlling for compromised randomization
and multiple-hypothesis testing.
   41
      In addition, using large categories of closely related variables, which are statistically insignificant, in-
creases the probability of not rejecting the null.
   42
      An alternative to multiple-hypothesis testing is to assign a monetary metric to gauge the success or
failure of the program. This is done in the rate of return analysis of Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and
Yavitz (2010).



                                                       32
       Tables 3–6 summarize the estimated effects of the Perry program on outcomes grouped
by type and age of measurement.43 Tables 3 and 4 report results for females, while Tables 5
and 6 are for males. The third column of each table shows the control group means for the in-
dicated outcomes. The next three columns are the treatment effect sizes. The unconditional
effect (“uncond.”) is the difference in means between the treatment group and the control
group. The conditional (full) effect is the coefficient on the treatment assignment variable
in linear regressions. Specifically, we regress outcomes on a treatment assignment indicator
and four other covariates: maternal employment, paternal presence, socio-economic status
(SES) index, and Stanford-Binet IQ, all measured at the age of study entry. The conditional
(partial) effect is the estimated treatment effect from a procedure using nonparametric con-
ditioning on a variable indicating whether SES is above or below the sample median and
linear conditioning for the other three covariates. This specification is used to generate the
stepdown p-values reported in this paper. The next four columns are p-values, based on dif-
ferent procedures explained below, for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect for
the indicated outcome. The second-to-last column, “Gender Difference-in-Difference”, tests
the null hypothesis of no difference in mean treatment effects between males and females.
The final column gives the available observations for the indicated outcome. Small p-values
associated with rejections of the null are bolded.
       Outcomes in each block are placed in ascending order of the partially linear Freedman-
Lane p-value, which is described below. This is the order in which the outcomes would be
discarded from the joint null hypothesis in the stepdown multiple-hypothesis testing algo-
rithm.44 The ordering of outcomes differs in the tables for males and females. Additionally,
some outcomes are reported for only one gender when insufficient observations were available
for reliable testing of the hypothesis for the other gender.
  43
     Perry follow-ups were conducted at ages 19, 27, and 40. We group the outcomes by age whenever they
have strong age patterns, for example, in the case of employment or income.

     Notes: Monetary values adjusted to thousands of year-2006 dollars using annual national CPI. p-values below 0.1 are in bold. (a) Unconditional difference in means between
     the treatment and control groups; (b) Conditional treatment effect with linear covariates Stanford-Binet IQ, socio-economic status index (SES), maternal employment, father’s
     presence at study entry — this is also the effect for the Freedman-Lane procedure under a full linearity assumption, whose respective p-value is computed in column “Full Lin.”;
     (c) Conditional treatment effect as in the previous column except that SES is replaced with an indicator for SES above/below the median, so that the corresponding p-value
     is computed in the column “Partial Lin.” This specification generates p-values used in the stepdown procedure; (d) One-sided p-values for the hypothesis of no treatment
     effect based on conditional permutation inference, without orbit restrictions or linear covariates — estimated effect size in the “Uncond.” column; (e) One-sided p-values
     for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, without restricting permutation orbits and assuming linearity in all covariates (maternal
     employment, paternal presence, socio-economic status index (SES), and Stanford-Binet IQ) — estimated effect size in the “Conditional Effect” column; (f) One-sided p-values
     for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, using the linear covariates maternal employment, paternal presence, and Stanford-Binet IQ,
     and restricting permutation orbits within strata formed by Socio-economic Status index (SES) being above or below the sample median and permuting siblings as a block; (g)
     p-values from the previous column, adjusted for multiple inference using the stepdown procedure; (h) Two-sided p-value for the null hypothesis of no gender difference in mean
     treatment effects, tested using mean differences between treatments and controls using the conditioning and orbit restriction setup described in footnote (e); (i) Total crime
     costs include victimization, police, justice, and incarceration costs, where victimizations are estimated from arrest records for each type of crime using data from urban areas
     of the Midwest, police and court costs are based on historical Michigan unit costs, and the victimization cost of fatal crime takes into account the statistical value of life (see
     Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz, 2010, for details).

     covariates (maternal employment, paternal presence, socio-economic status index (SES), and Stanford-Binet IQ) — estimated effect size in the “Conditional Effect” column; (f) One-sided p-values for
     the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, using the linear covariates maternal employment, paternal presence, and Stanford-Binet IQ, and restricting permutation
     orbits within strata formed by Socio-economic Status index (SES) being above or below the sample median and permuting siblings as a block; (g) p-values from the previous column, adjusted for multiple

     Notes: Monetary values adjusted to thousands of year-2006 dollars using annual national CPI. p-values below 0.1 are in bold. (a) Unconditional difference in means between
     the treatment and control groups; (b) Conditional treatment effect with linear covariates Stanford-Binet IQ, socio-economic status index (SES), maternal employment, father’s
     presence at study entry — this is also the effect for the Freedman-Lane procedure under a full linearity assumption, whose respective p-value is computed in column “Full Lin.”;
     (c) Conditional treatment effect as in the previous column except that SES is replaced with an indicator for SES above/below the median, so that the corresponding p-value
     is computed in the column “Partial Lin.” This specification generates p-values used in the stepdown procedure; (d) One-sided p-values for the hypothesis of no treatment
     effect based on conditional permutation inference, without orbit restrictions or linear covariates — estimated effect size in the “Uncond.” column; (e) One-sided p-values
     for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, without restricting permutation orbits and assuming linearity in all covariates (maternal
     employment, paternal presence, socio-economic status index (SES), and Stanford-Binet IQ) — estimated effect size in the “Conditional Effect” column; (f) One-sided p-values
     for the hypothesis of no treatment effect based on the Freedman-Lane procedure, using the linear covariates maternal employment, paternal presence, and Stanford-Binet IQ,
     and restricting permutation orbits within strata formed by Socio-economic Status index (SES) being above or below the sample median and permuting siblings as a block; (g)
     p-values from the previous column, adjusted for multiple inference using the stepdown procedure; (h) Two-sided p-value for the null hypothesis of no gender difference in mean
     treatment effects, tested using mean differences between treatments and controls using the conditioning and orbit restriction setup described in footnote (e); (i) Non-victimless
     crimes are those associated with victimization costs: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft (see Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz,
     2010, for details); (j) Total crime costs include victimization, police, justice, and incarceration costs, where victimizations are estimated from arrest records for each type of
     crime using data from urban areas of the Midwest, police and court costs are based on historical Michigan unit costs, and the victimization cost of fatal crime takes into account
     the statistical value of life (see Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz, 2010, for details).

Single p-values Tables 3–6 show four varieties of p-values for testing the null hypothesis of
no treatment effect. The first such value, labeled “Naı̈ve”, is based on a simple permutation
test of the hypothesis of no difference in means between treatment and control groups. This
test uses no conditioning, imposes no restrictions on the permutation group, and does not
account for imbalances or the compromised Perry randomization. These naı̈ve p-values are
very close to their asymptotic versions. For evidence on this point, see Web Appendix E.
       The next three p-values are based on variants of a procedure due to Freedman and
Lane (1983) for combining regression with permutation testing for admissible permutation
groups. The first Freedman-Lane p-value, labeled “Full Linearity”, tests the significance of
the treatment effect, adjusting outcomes using linear regression with four covariates: ma-
ternal employment, paternal presence, SES, and Stanford-Binet IQ, all measured at study
entry.45 The second Freedman-Lane p-value, labeled “Partial Linearity”, allows for a non-
parametric relationship between the SES index and outcomes while continuing to assume a
linear relationship for the other three covariates. This nonparametric conditioning on SES
is achieved by restricting the orbits of the permutations used in the test. Exchangeability of
treatment assignments between observations is assumed only on subsamples with similar val-
ues of the SES index (specifically, whether subjects fall above or below the sample median).
In addition, the permutation distribution for the partially linear p-values permute siblings
as a block. Admissible permutations do not assign different siblings to different treatment
and control statuses. These two modifications account for the compromised randomization
of the Perry study.46 The third p-value for the Freedman-Lane procedure incorporates an
adjustment for multiple-hypothesis testing using the stepdown algorithm described below.


Stepdown p-values and Multiple-Hypothesis Testing We divide outcomes into blocks
for multiple-hypothesis testing by type of outcome, similarities on the type of measure, and
  45
    Note that these are the same four used to produce the conditional effect size previously described.
  46
    Partial linearity is a valid assumption if full linearity is a valid assumption, although the converse need
not necessarily hold since a nonparametric approach is less restrictive than a linear parametric approach.

age if there is an obvious age pattern.47 In Tables 3–6, these blocks are delineated by horizon-
tal lines. Within each block, the “Partially Linear (Adjusted)” p-value is the set of p-values
obtained from the partially linear model adjusted for multiple-hypothesis testing using the
stepdown algorithm. The adjusted p-value in each row corresponds to a joint hypothesis test
of the indicated outcome and the outcomes within each block.
       The first row of each block constitutes a joint test of the null hypothesis of no treatment
effect for any of the outcomes in that block. Each successive row eliminates one outcome
from the joint null hypothesis. This stepwise ordering is the reason why we report outcomes
placed in ascending order of their p-values. The stepdown-adjusted p-values are based on
these values, and the most individually significant remaining outcome is removed from the
joint null hypothesis at each successive step.


Statistics We use the mid-p-value statistics based on the Freedman-Lane coefficient ∆gk
for treatment status D. All p-values are computed using 30,000 draws under the relevant
permutation procedure. All inference is based on one-sided p-values under the assumption
that treatment is not harmful. An exception is the test for differences in treatment effects
by gender, which are based on two-sided p-values.


Main Results Tables 3–6 show many statistically significant treatment effects and gender
differences that survive multiple-hypothesis testing. In summary, females show strong effects
for educational outcomes, early employment, and other early economic outcomes, as well as
reduced numbers of arrests. Males show strong effects on a number of outcomes, demon-
strating a substantially reduced number of arrests and lower probability of imprisonment,
as well as strong effects on earnings at age 27, employment at age 40, and other economic
outcomes recorded at age 40.
       A principal contribution of this paper is to simultaneously tackle the statistical challenges
  47
    Education, health, family composition, criminal behavior, employment status, earnings, and general
economic activities are the categories of variables on which blocks are selected on a priori grounds.



                                                  39
posed by the problems of small sample size, imbalance in the covariates, and compromised
randomization. In doing so, we find substantial differences in inference between the testing
procedures that use naı̈ve p-values versus the Freedman-Lane p-values which correct for the
compromised nature of the randomization protocol. The rejection rate when correcting for
these problems is often higher compared with what is obtained from procedures that do not
make such corrections, sharpening the evidence for treatment effects from the Perry program.
This pattern is largely found in the p-values for males. This is evidenced by increasing
statistical significance of treatment effects moving from “Naı̈ve” to “Full Linearity” and
from “Full Linearity” to “Partial Linearity”. In several cases, outcomes that are statistically
insignificant at a 10% level using naı̈ve p-values are shown to be statistically significant using
p-values derived from the partially linear Freedman-Lane model. For example, consider the
p-values for “Current Employment” at age 40 for males or “Non-juvenile Arrests” at age 27
for females.


Schooling Within the group of hypotheses for education, the only statistically significant
treatment effect for males is the effect associated with being classified as mentally impaired
through age 19 (Table 5). We fail to reject the overall joint null hypotheses for both school
achievement and for lifetime educational outcomes. However, as Table 3 shows, there are
strong treatment effects for females on high school GPA, graduation, highest grade com-
pleted, mental impairment, learning disabilities, and so on. The hypothesis of no difference
between sexes in schooling outcomes is rejected for the outcomes of highest grade completed,
GPA, high school graduation, and the presence of a learning disability. The unimpressive
education results for males, however, do not necessarily mean that the pattern would be
reproduced if the program were replicated today. We discuss this point in Section 6.48 We
discuss the effects of the intervention on cognitive test scores in Web Appendix G. Heckman,
Malofeeva, Pinto, and Savelyev (2010) discuss the impact of the Perry program on noncogni-
tive skills. They decompose treatments effects into effects due to cognitive and noncognitive
 48
      We present a more extensive discussion of this point in Web Appendix I.

enhancements of the program.


Employment and Earnings Results for employment and earnings are displayed in Ta-
ble 4 for females and Table 6 for males. The treatment effects in these outcomes exhibit
gender differences and a distinctive age pattern. For females, we observe statistically sig-
nificant employment effects in the overall joint null hypotheses at ages 19 and 27. Only
one outcome does not survive stepdown adjustment: “Jobless Months in Past 2 Years” at
age 27. At age 40, however, there are no statistically significant earnings effects for females
considered as individual outcomes or in sets of joint null hypotheses by age. For males,
we observe no significant employment effects at age 19. We reject the overall joint null hy-
potheses of no difference in employment outcomes at ages 27 and 40. We also reject the null
hypotheses of no treatment effect on age-40 employment outcomes individually. When male
earnings outcomes alone are considered, we reject only the overall joint null hypothesis at
age 27. However, when earnings are considered together with employment, we reject both
the overall age-27 and age-40 joint null hypotheses.


Economic Activity Tests for other economic outcomes, shown in Tables 4 and 6, reinforce
the conclusions drawn from the analysis of employment outcomes above. Both treated males
and females are generally more likely to have savings accounts and own cars at the same
ages that they are more likely to be employed. The effects on welfare dependence are strong
for males when considered through age 40, but weak when considered only through age 27;
the converse is true for females.


Criminal Activity Tables 3 and 5 show strong treatment effects on criminal activities for
both genders. Males are arrested far more frequently than females, and, on average, male
crimes tend to be more serious. There are no statistically significant gender differences in
treatment effects for comparable crime outcomes. By age 27, control females were arrested
1.88 times on average during adulthood, including 0.27 felony arrests, while the correspond-


                                              41
ing figures for control males are 5.36 and 2.33.49 In addition, treated males are significantly
less likely to be in prison at age 40 than their control counterparts.50 Figure 4 shows cu-
mulative distribution functions for charges cited at all arrests through age 40 for the male
subsample. Figure 4a includes all types of charges, while Figure 4b includes only charges
with nonzero victim costs. The latter category of charges is relevant because the costs of
criminal victimization resulting from crimes committed by the Perry subjects play a key
role in determining the economic return to the Perry Preschool Program. This is reflected
in the statistical significance of estimated differences in total crime costs between treated
and untreated groups at the 10% level based on the Freedman-Lane procedure using the
partially linear model for both males and females. Total crime costs include victimization,
police, justice, and incarceration costs. Victimizations are estimated from arrest records for
each type of crime using data from urban areas of the Midwest. Police and court costs are
based on historical Michigan unit costs, and the victimization cost of fatal crime takes into
account the statistical value of life.51 We reject the overall joint null hypotheses for the
number of arrests for both males and females at age 27 and 40.


Sensitivity Analysis Our calculations, which are based on the Freedman-Lane procedure
under the assumption of partial linearity, rely on linear parametric approximations and on a
particular choice of SES quantiles to define permutation orbits. Other choices are possible.
Any or all of the four covariates that we use in the Freedman-Lane procedure under full lin-
earity could have been used as conditioning variables to define restricted permutation orbits
under a partial linearity assumption. We choose the SES index for nonparametric condition-
ing, since family background is known to be a powerful determinant of adult outcomes (see
Cunha, Heckman, Lochner, and Masterov, 2006). Specifically, we use a dummy variable for

      Statistics for female felony arrests are not shown in the table due to their low reliability: the small
sample size and the low incidence of felony arrests.
   50
      The set of crime hypotheses is different for males and females due to small sample sizes: we cannot
reliably measure the probability of incarceration for females for Perry sample.

its contributions to the economic return to the Perry program.

whether the SES index is above or below the sample median.
   It is informative to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the effects of the choice of condi-
tioning strata, which correspond to the covariates whose relationship with the outcome is
assumed to be nonlinear rather than linear. To test the sensitivity of our results to the
choice of stratum, we run a series of partially linear Freedman-Lane procedures with varying
assumptions regarding the set of which covariates enter linearly.
   The four pre-program covariates in question can be used either as Freedman-Lane re-
gressors, which assume a linear relationship with outcomes, or as conditioning variables that
limit the orbits of permutations to their selected quantiles, which allows for a nonlinear rela-
tionship. In Web Appendix F, we perform two types of sensitivity analyses. The first shows
that the results reported in Tables 3–6 are robust to variations in the choice of SES index
quantiles used to generate the strata on which permutations are restricted: median, tercile,
or quartile. The second shows that our results are robust to the choice of which covariates
enter the outcome model linearly.


Additional Evidence on the Effectiveness of the Perry Program In related work
(Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz, 2010), we calculate rates of return to deter-
mine the private and public returns to the Perry Preschool Program. We avoid the multiple
hypothesis-testing problem by focusing on a single economically significant summary of the
program. We use the conditioning approach adopted in this paper to control for compromised
randomization. We find statistically significant rates of return for both males and females in
the range of 6–10% per annum. This supports the evidence of substantial treatment effects
presented in the current paper.


Understanding Treatment Effects While this paper tests for the existence of treatment
effects due to the Perry Preschool Program, other recent work examines channels through
which these beneficial effects are produced. Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto, and Savelyev (2010)
estimate a model of latent cognitive and noncognitive traits. In the early years during and

                                              44
after the program, the IQ scores of treatment group participants surged, but by almost age
8, the treatment effect on IQ becomes nonexistent for males and relatively small for females.
Their research shows that the effects of the Perry program arise primarily from boosts in
noncognitive traits.



6     The Representativeness of the Perry Study

We next examine the representativeness of the Perry sample and characterize the target pop-
ulation within the overall African-American population. We construct a comparison group
using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), a widely used, nationally
representative longitudinal data set. The NLSY79 has panel data on wages, schooling, and
employment for a cohort of young adults who were 14-22 at their first interview in 1979.
This cohort has been followed ever since. For our purposes, an important feature is that the
NLSY79 contains information on cognitive test scores as well as on noncognitive measures.
It also contains rich information on family background. This survey is a particularly good
choice for such a comparison as the birth years of its subjects (1957–1964) include those of
the Perry sample (1957–1962). The NLSY79 also oversamples African Americans.


The Matching Procedure We use a matching procedure to create NLSY79 comparison
groups for Perry control groups by simulating the application of the Perry eligibility criteria
to the full NLSY79 sample. Specifically, we use the Perry eligibility criteria to construct
samples in the NLSY79. Thus, the comparison group corresponds to the subset of NLSY79
participants who would likely be eligible for the Perry program if it were a nationwide
intervention.
    We do not have identical information on the NLSY79 respondents and the Perry entry
cohorts, so we approximate a Perry-eligible NLSY79 comparison sample. In the absence
of IQ scores in the NLSY79, we use Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores as a
proxy for IQ. We also construct a pseudo-SES index for each NLSY79 respondent using the

                                              45
available information.52
       We use two different subsets of the NLSY79 sample to draw inferences about the repre-
sentativeness of the Perry sample. For an initial comparison group, we use the full African-
American subsample in NLSY79. We then apply the approximate Perry eligibility criteria
to create a second comparison group based on a restricted sub-sample of the NLSY79 data.
       The U.S. population in 1960 was 180 million people, of which 10.6% (19 million) were
African-American.53 According to the NLSY79, the black cohort born in 1957–1964 is com-
posed of 2.2 million males and 2.3 million females. We estimate that 17% of the male cohort
and 15% of the female cohort would be eligible for the Perry program if it were applied
nationwide. This translates into a population estimate of 712,000 persons out of the 4.5
million black cohort, who resemble the Perry population in terms of our measures of dis-
advantage.54 For further information on the comparison groups and their construction, see
Web Appendix H and Tables H.1 and H.2 for details.


How Representative is the Perry Sample of the Overall African-American Popu-
lation of the United States? Compared to the unrestricted African-American NLSY79
subsample, Perry program participants are more disadvantaged in their family backgrounds.
This is not surprising, given that the Perry program targeted disadvantaged children. Fur-
ther, Perry participants experience less favorable outcomes later in life, including lower high
school graduation rates, employment rates, and earnings. However, if we impose restrictions
on the NLSY79 subsample that mimic the sample selection criteria of the Perry program, we
obtain a roughly comparable group. Figure 5 demonstrates this comparability for parental
highest grade completed at the time children are enrolled in the program. Web Appendix

  54
     When a subsample of the NLSY79 is formed using three criteria that characterize the Perry sample
— low values of a proxy for the Perry socio-economic status (SES) index, low achievement test (AFQT)
score, and non-firstborn status — this subsample represents 713,725 people in the United States. See Web
Appendix H and Tables H.1 and H.2 for details.


                                                  46
earnings at age 27, and earnings at 40.55 Tables H.1 and H.2 present additional details. The
Perry sample is representative of disadvantaged African-American populations.
       In Web Appendix I, we consider another aspect of the representativeness of the Perry
experiment. Perry participants were caught up in the boom and bust of the Michigan auto
industry and its effects on related industries. In the 1970s, as Perry participants entered the
workforce, the male-friendly manufacturing sector was booming. Employees did not need
high school diplomas to get good entry-level jobs in manufacturing, and men were much
more likely to be employed in the manufacturing sector than women. The industry began
to decline as Perry participants entered their late 20s.
       This pattern may explain the gender patterns for treatment effects found in the Perry
experiment. Neither treatments nor controls needed high school diplomas to get good jobs.
As the manufacturing sector collapsed, neither group fared well. However, as noted in Web
Appendix I, male treatment group members were somewhat more likely to adjust to economic
adversity by migrating than were male controls, which may account for their greater economic
success at age 40. The history of the Michigan economy helps to explain the age pattern of
observed treatment effects for males, thereby diminishing the external validity of the study.



7        Relationship of This Study to Previous Research

Schweinhart et al. (2005) analyze the Perry data through age 40 using large sample statistical
tests. They show substantial effects of the program for both males and females. They do
not account for the compromised randomization of the experiment or the multiplicity of
hypotheses tested. Heckman (2005) discusses the problems of the small sample size, the
need to use small sample inference to analyze the Perry data, and the appropriate way to
combine inference across hypotheses.
       Anderson (2008) addresses the problem of multiple-hypothesis testing in the Perry data.
  55
   One exception to this pattern is that Perry treatment and control earnings are worse off than their
matched sample counterparts.

difference in means between the two populations.

He reanalyzes the Perry data (and data on other early childhood programs) using a stepdown
multiple-hypothesis testing procedure due to Westfall and Young (1993). That procedure
requires “subset pivotality,” that is, that the multivariate distribution of any subvector of
p-values is unaffected by the truth or falsity of hypotheses corresponding to p-values not
included in the subvector. This is a strong condition.56 Our method for testing multiple
hypotheses is based on the stepdown procedure of Romano and Wolf (2005), which uses an
assumption about monotonicity of the test statistics. Romano and Wolf (2005) show that
their monotonicity assumption is weaker than the subset pivotality assumption.
       Anderson applies permutation inference to avoid relying on asymptotically justified test
statistics. We confirm his finding that even in the small Perry sample, asymptotic statistics
are valid, so concerns about the use of large-sample inference to analyze the Perry sam-
ples are misplaced. However, in constructing his tests, Anderson assumes that a simple
randomization was conducted in the Perry experiment. He does not address the problem
of compromised randomization, neither does he correct for covariate imbalances between
treatments and controls.
       Anderson reports no statistically significant effects of the Perry program for males. We
find that the Perry program improved the status of both genders on a variety of measures.
One explanation for the difference between Anderson’s conclusions and ours about the effec-
tiveness of the program for males is that we adjust for covariate imbalances and compromised
randomization while Anderson does not. As displayed in Tables 5 and 6, these adjustments
sharpen the inference for males and lead to more rejections of the null hypothesis.
       Another explanation for the contrast between our conclusions is differences in the blocks
of variables used as the basis for the stepdown multiple-hypothesis testing procedures. To
reduce the dimensionality of the testing problem, Anderson creates linear indices of outcomes
at three stages of the life cycle. The outcomes used to create each index are quite diverse
  56
    In Web Appendix D.3, we present an example, due to Westfall and Young (1993), where the subset
pivotality condition is satisfied for testing hypotheses about means of a normal model but not for testing
hypotheses about correlations.

and group a variety of very different outcomes (e.g., crime, employment, education). It is
difficult to interpret his indices. Moreover, the components of his indices change with age.
We conduct inference for interpretable blocks of hypotheses defined at different stages of
the life cycle that are based on comparable outcomes (crime as one block, employment as
another block, etc.).



8     Summary and Conclusions

Most social experiments are compromised by practical difficulties in implementing the in-
tended randomization protocol. They also have a variety of outcome measures. This paper
develops and applies a methodology for analyzing experiments as implemented and for gen-
erating valid tests of multiple hypotheses.
    We apply our methods to analyze data from the Perry Preschool experiment. Evidence
from the HighScope Perry Preschool Program is widely cited to support early childhood
interventions. The consequences of imperfect randomization for inference are neglected by
previous analysts of these data. This paper shows how to account for compromised random-
ization to produce valid test statistics.
    Proper analysis of the Perry experiment also requires application of methods for small-
sample inference and accounting for the large numbers of outcomes of the study. It is
important to avoid the danger of artificially lowering p-values by selecting statistically sig-
nificant outcomes that are “cherry picked” from a larger set of unreported hypothesis tests
that do not reject the null.
    We propose and implement a combination of methods to simultaneously address these
problems. We account for compromises in the randomization protocol by conditioning on
background variables to control for the violations of the initial randomization protocol and
imbalanced background variables. We use small-sample permutation methods and estimate
family-wise error rates that account for the multiplicity of experimental outcomes. The



                                              50
methods developed and applied here have applications to social experiments with small
samples when there is imbalance in covariates between treatments and controls, reassignment
after randomization, and multiple hypotheses.
    The pattern of treatment response by gender varies with age. Males exhibit statistically
significant treatment effects for criminal activity, later life income, and employment (ages 27
and 40), whereas female treatment effects are strongest for education and early employment
(ages 19 and 27). There is, however, a strong effect of the program on female crime at age
40. The general pattern is one of strong early results for females, with males catching up
later in life.
    Our analysis of the representativeness of this program shows that Perry study families are
disadvantaged compared to the general African-American population. However, application
of the Perry eligibility rules to the NLSY79 yields a substantial population of comparable
individuals. Based on the NLSY79 data, we estimate that the program targetted about 16%
of the African-American population born during 1957–1964, which includes the birth years
of the Perry participants.
    We present some suggestive evidence that the limited effect of the Perry program on the
education of males was due to the peculiarities of the Michigan economy. High school degrees
were not required to work in well-paying manufacturing jobs. Perry treatment males appear
to have adjusted to the decline in manufacturing that occurred in Michigan better than the
controls. This accounts for the statistically significant treatment effects in employment and
earnings found for males at age 40.
    Few social experiments perfectly implement planned treatment assignment protocols. A
proper analysis of such experiments requires recognizing the sampling plan as implemented.
Our analysis shows that properly accounting for experiments as implemented can produce




                                              51
sharper results than analyses that proceed as if an ideal experiment was implemented.57

     In related work, Heckman, Pinto, Shaikh, and Yavitz (2009) take a more conservative approach to the
problem of compromised randomization using weaker assumptions. Their inference is based on a partially
identified model in which the distribution of D conditional on X is not fully known because the rules assigning
persons to treatment are not fully determined. Unmeasured variables that determine assignment are also
assumed to affect outcomes. They estimate conservative bounds for inference on treatment effects that are
consistent with the verbal descriptions of the criteria used for reassignment.
  This paper is less conservative than theirs because it adopts stronger assumptions: conditional exchange-
ability of treatment assignments within coarse strata of pre-program observables. As expected, this less
conservative approach produces sharper inferences, although the inferences from the two approaches are in
surprisingly broad agreement.
