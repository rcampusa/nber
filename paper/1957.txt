                Industrial Organization and International Trade




                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper reviews recent work on the relationship between indus-

trial organization and international trade. Five strands in the theore-

tical literature are discussed. First is the role of economies of scale

as a cause of intra—industry trade, modelled using monopolistic competi-

tion. Second is the effect of tariffs and quotas on domestic market

power. Third is the analysis of dumping as international price discrimi-

nation. Fourth is the potential strategy role of government policy as an

aid to domestic firms in oligopolistic competition. Finally, the paper

discusses recent work that may provide a new argument for protectionism.

A concluding section discusses recent efforts at quantification of new

trade theory.

        In retrospect,it seems obvious that the theory of international

trade should draw heavily on models of industrial organization. Most

of world trade is in the products of industries that we have no

hesitation in classifying as oligopolies when we see them in their

domestic aspect. Yet until quite recently only a handful of papers

had attempted to apply models of imperfect competition to

international trade issues. Indeed, in 1974 Richard Caves still felt

that a lecture on the relationship between trade and industrial

organization needed to begin with an apology for the novelty of the

idea.

        Only in the last decade have we seen the emergence of a sizeable

literature that links trade theory and industrial organization. This

new literature has two main strands. One is fundamentally concerned

with modelling the role of economies of scale as a cause of trade. To

introduce economies of scale into the model requires that the impact

of increasing returns on market structure be somehow taken into

account, but in this literature the main concern is usually to get the

issue of market structure out of the way as simply as possible — which

turns out to be most easily done by assuming that markets are

characterized by Chamberlinian monopolistic competition. The first

section of this paper summarizes the main insights from this approach.

    Since this paper is aimed primarily at an audience of 1—0

researchers rather than trade theorists, however, most of it will be

devoted to the second strand in recent literature, which views

imperfect competition as the core of the story rather than an
                                       2



unavoidable nuisance issue raised by the attempt to discuss increasing

returns. Here there are four main themes, each represented by a

section of the paper. First is the relation between trade policy and

the market power of domestic firms. Second is the role of price

discrimination and "dumping" in international markets. Third is the

possibility that government action can serve a "strategic" role in

giving domestic firms an advantage in oligopolistic competition.

Fourth, there is the question of whether industrial organization gives

us new arguments in favor of protectionism. A final section of the

paper will review some recent attempts at quantifying these

theoretical models.

     Generality in models of imperfect competition is never easy to

come by, and usually turns out to be illusory in any case.    In this

survey I will not even make the attempt. Whatever is necessary for

easy exposition will be assumed: specific functional forms, constant

marginal cost, specific parameters where that helps. And at least one

part of the tradition of international trade theory will be retained:

much of the exposition will be diagrammatic rather than algebraic.




    THE MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION TRADE MODEL



    Origins of the model
                                          3



        The monopolistic competition model of trade began with an

empirical observation: neither the pattern of trade nor its results

seem to accord very well with what traditional trade models would lead

us to expect. The most influential of trade models is the Heckscher—

Oh].in—Samuelson model, which tells us that trade reflects an

interaction between the characteristics of countries and the

characteristics of the production technology of different goods.

Specifically, countries will export goods whose production is

intensive in the factors with which they are abundantly endowed —

e.g.,    countries with a high capital—labor ratio will export capital—

intensive goods. This model leads us to expect three things. First,

trade should typically be between complementary countries —   capital—
abundant countries should trade with labor-abundant. Second, the

composition of trade should reflect the sources of comparative

advantage. Third, since trade is in effect an indirect way for

countries to trade factors of production, it should have strong

effects on income distribution — when a country trades capital—

intensive exports for labor—intensive imports, its workers should end

up worse of f.

        What empirical workers noticed in the 1960s was that trends in

world trade did not seem to accord with these expectations. The

largest and rapidly growing part of world trade was trade among the

industrial countries, which seemed fairly similar in their factor

endowments and   were clearly becoming more similar over time. The
                                        4


trade between industrial countries was largely composed of two way

exchanges of fairly similar goods — so—called "intra-industry' trade.

Finally, in several important episodes of rapid growth in trade -

notably   formation of the European Economic Community and the Canadian—

US auto pact -   the distributional effects turned out to be much less
noticeable than had been feared.

      From the mid—60s on, a number of researchers proposed a simple

explanation of these observations. Trade among the industrial

countries, they argued, was due not to comparative advantage but to

economies of scale. Because of the scale economies, there was an

essentially arbitrary specialization by similar countries in the

production of different goods, often of goods produced with the same

factor intensities. This explained both why similar countries traded

with each other and why they exchanged similar products. At the same

time, trade based on increasing returns rather than indirect exchange

of factors need not have large income distribution effects. Thus

introducing economies of scale as a determinant of trade seemed to

resolve the puzzles uncovered by empirical work.

    The problem, of course, was that at the time there was no good

way to introduce economies of scale into a general equilibrium trade

model. Without being embedded in a formal model, the theory of intra—

industry trade could not become part of mainstream international

economies. The crucial theoretical development thus came in the late

1970s, when new models of monopolistic competition were seen to allow
                                       5


a remarkably simple and elegant theory of trade in the presence of

increasing returns. This marriage of indusrial organization and trade

was first proposed independently in papers by Dixit and Norman (1980),

Krugman (1979), and Lancaster (1980). It was further extended by

Helpman (1981), Krugman (1980, 1981), Ethier (1982), and others. Now

that a number of years have gone into distilling the essentials of

this approach, it is possible to describe in very compact form a basic

monopolistic competition model of trade.



     The basic model



     Consider first a single economy without any foreign trade. We

will suppose that this economy has two factors of production, capital

and labor. These factors are employed in two sectors, Manufactures

and Food.

        Food we will take to be a homogeneous product, with a constant

returns technology and thus a perfectly competitive market structure.

Manufactures, however, we assume to consist of many differentiated

products, subject to product—specific economies of scale. There is

assumed to be a suitable choice of units such that all of the

potential products can be made to look symmetric, with identical cost

and demand functions. Further, the set of potential products is

assumed to be sufficiently large, and the individual products

sufficiently small, that there exists a free—entry noncooperative

equilibrium with zero profits.
                                          6



     Much effect has gone into the precise formulation of product

differentiation. Some authors, including Dixit and Norman (1980),

Krugman (1979, 1980, 1981), and Ethier (1982) follow the Spence (1976)

and Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) assumption that all products are demanded by

each individual, and thus build product differentiation into the

utility function. Others including Lancaster (1980) and Helpman

(1981), follow Lancaster's approach in which the demand for variety

arises from diversity of tastes. It turns out that for the purposes

of describing trade it does not matter at all which approach we take.

All we need is the result that equilibrium in the Manufactures sector

involves the production of a large number of differentiated products,

and that all profits are competed away.

     Figure 1 represents the endowment of the economy as the sides of

a box. With full employment this endowment will be exhausted by the

resources used in the two sectors. We let OQ be the resources used in

Manfuactures, and QQ* be the resources used in Food. Thus

Manufactures is assumed to be capital—intensive.

     Next we want to introduce international trade. As Dixit and

Norman (1980) have shown, this is most simply done not by adding a

second economy, but instead by breaking our first economy up. Let us

imagine that the resources of our original economy are now split

between two countries, Home and Foreign. If we measure Home's

endowment using 0 as origin and Foreign's with 0* as origin, we can

represent the division of the world's resources by a single point such
                                         7



as E. By putting E above the diagonal we have assumed that Home is

capital—abundant, Foreign labor—abundant.

     What can we now say about the world's production? The answer is

that as long as the resources are not divided too unequally —

specifically,   as long as E lies inside the parallelogram OQO*Q* -

aggregate world production will not change. We can determine the
allocation of that production between the countries by completing

parallelograms. Thus Home will devote resources °M to Manufactures,

    to Food; Foreign will devote O*P and O*PZ to Manufactures and

Food respectively.

     Now it is immediately apparent that a redistribution of resources

from one country to another will have a strongly biased effect on the

distribution of world production. Suppose, for example, that Home

were to have more capital and Foreign loss. Then it is clear that

Home would produce more Manufactures and less Food —   a familiar result
for trade theorists. It follows, given identical demand patterns,

that capital—abundant Home will be a net exporter of Manufactures and

a net importer of Food. Thus at the level of interindustry trade

flows conventional comparative advantage continues to apply.

     Where economies of scale and monopolistic competition enter the

story is in intra—industry specialization. When production of

Manufactures is split between Home and Foreign, economies of scale

will imply that output of each individual differentiated product is

concentrated in one country or the other. Which country produces
                                      8



which products is indeterminate, but the important point is that

within the Manufactures sector each country will be producing a

different set of goods. Since each country is assumed to have diverse

demand, the result will be that even a country that is a net exporter

of Manufactures will still demand some imports of the manufactures

produced abroad.

     The resulting pattern of trade is illustrated in Figure 2. There

will be two—way intraindustry" trade within the manufacturing sector,

as well as conventional interindustry trade. The former will in

effect reflect scale economies and product differentiation, while the

latter reflects comparative advantage. We can notice two points about

this pattern of trade. First, even if the countries had identical

resource mixes (i.e., if point E in Figure 1 were on the diagonal)

there will still be trade in Manufactures, because of intra—industry

specialization. Second, the more similar the countries are in their

factor endowments, the more they will engage in intra- as opposed to

inter— industry trade.



     Extensions of the model



     A number of authors have applied the monopolistic competition

approach to models that attempt to capture more complex insights than

the one we have just described. Many of these extensions are treated

in Helpman and Krugman (1985); here I describe a few of the extensions

briefly.
                                       9


     Intermediate goods: Ethier (1982) has emphasized that much

intraindustry trade is in reality in intermediate goods. Models that

reflect this are Ethier (1982), Helpman (1984) and Helpman and Krugman

(1985, ch. 11). As it turns out, this extension makes little

difference.

     Nontraded goods: Helpman and Razin (1984) and Helpman and

Krugman (1985, ch. 10) introduce nontraded goods into the model.

Again, this doesn't make much difference. The major new implication

is that differences in the size of national markets can give rise to

new incentives for factor mobility.

     Market size effects: Krugman (1980), Helpman and Krugman (1985),

and Venables (1985b) develop models in which transport costs make the

size of the domestic market an important determinant of trade.

Specifically, countries tend other things equal to export the products

of industries for which they have large domestic markets.

     Multinational firms: Helpman (1985) and Helpman and Krugman

(1985) develop models in which it is assumed that economies of scope

and/or vertical integration lead to the emergence of multi—activity

firms. Within the monopolistic competition framework it is then

possible to let comparative advantage determine the location of

activities, allowing models that describe both trade and the extent of

multinational enterprise. Horstmann and Markusen (    ) have further
extended the analysis with a model that describes the dynamics by

which firms may move from an initial strategy of exporting to a later

stage of direct foreign investment.
                                        10



     Alternative market structures: Helpman and Krugman contains some

efforts to extend the insights of the monopolistic competition model

beyond the highly special Chamberlinian large—group market structure.

The insights survive essentially intact when the structure is instead

assumed to be one of contestable markets" in the manner of Baumol,

Panzar, and Willig (1982). (Helpman and Krugman ch. 4). A much more

qualified set of results occurs when the structure is instead assumed

to be one of small—group oligopoly.   (Chs. 5 and 7).



     Evaluation



     The monopolistic competition model has had a major impact on

research into international trade. By showing that increasing returns

and imperfect competition can make a fundamental difference to the way

we think about trade, this approach was crucial in making work that

applies industrial organization concepts to trade respectable. In

effect, the monopolistic competition model was the thin end of the 1—0

/trade wedge.

    From the point of view of I—C theorists, however, the

monopolistic competition trade model may be the least interesting part

of the new trade theory. In essence, theorists in this area have

viewed imperfect competition as a nuisance variable in a story that is

fundamentally about increasing returns. Thus the theory has little to

teach us about industrial organization itself. By contrast, the other
                                           11


 strand of the new trade theory is interested in increasing returns

primarily as a cause of imperfect competition, and it is this

 imperfect competition that is the main story. Thus it is this second

strand which will occupy the rest of this survey.




       PROTECTION AND DOMESTIC MARKET POWER



       Many economists have noted that international trade reduces the

market power of domestic firms, and argued that conversely protection

increases domestic market power. The interest of trade theorists has

been centered on two extensions of this argument. First is the

proposition that the effects of protection depend on the form it takes
—   specifically,   that quantitative restrictions such as import quotas

create more domestic market power than tariffs. This proposition was

first demonstrated by Bhagwati (1967) in a model in which a domestic

monopolist faces competitive foreign suppliers; only with recent work

by Krishna (1984) has the analysis been extended to the case where

both domestic and foreign firms are large agents. More recently

still., Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) have argued that when collusive

behavior is backed by the threat of a breakdown of that collusion,

import quotas may actually perversely increase competition.

      The second proposition is that protection, by initially

generating monopoly rents, generates excessive entry and thus leads to
                                       12



inefficiently small scale production. This proposition, originally

proposed by Eastman and Stykolt (1960), is backed by substantial

evidence, and has been modelled by Dixit and Norman (1980).



     Bhagwatis model



     Consider an industry in which one firm has a monopoly on domestic

production, but is subject to competition from price-taking foreign

suppliers. Why the domestic market structure should differ from that

in the rest of the world is left unexplained; presumably there are

unspecified economies of scale that are large relative to the domestic

market but not relative to the world market. Although economies of

scale may explain the existence of the monopoly, however, the marginal

cost curve is assumed to slope upward. Foreign supply is assumed for

simplicity to be perfectly elastic (this differs slightly from

Bhagwati, who allowed for upward—sloping foreign supply; nothing

crucial hinges on the difference. Also, Corden (1967) analyzed the

case when domestic marginal cost is downward sloping. In this case any

tariff sufficient to establish the domestic firm also eliminates

imports).

     Figure 3 can be used to analyze the effects of tariffs in this

model. In the figure, D is the domestic demand curve facing the

monopolist, MC the monopolist's marginal cost curve. w is the world

price, i.e., the price at which imports are supplied to the domestic
                                           13


market.     is the price that would obtain if all domestic demand were

supplied by the monopolist but the monopolist were to behave as a

price taker. m is the price the monopolist would charge if there

were no import competition.

     Consider first the case of free trade. The domestic firm cannot

raise the price above     so the profit—maximizing strategy is to set

marginal cost equal to P, producing Q0.         In this case the monopolist

has no monopoly power.

     Now suppose the government imposes a tariff. The effect is to

raise the price at which imports will come into the market. As long

as the tariff—inclusive import price lies between         and     however,

it remains true that the domestic firm acts like a price—taker,

setting output where price equals marginal cost.

     In a competitive industry, a tariff that raised the import price

to    would be prohibitive, and any increase in the tariff beyond that

level would have no effect —   there   would be "water in the tariff."

Here the monopoly position of the domestic firm matters. A tariff

that raises the price above     allows the firm to raise its own price

to the same level, something that will be profitable as long as the

tariff price is below P. That is, even when no imports actually

occur, the threat of imports keeps the monopolist from exercising its

monopoly power fully, and raising an already prohibitive tariff

therefore leads to domestic price increases. It also follows that

such tariff increases actually reduce domestic output.
                                         14



     Now consider the effects of an import quota. In perfectly

competitive models a quota is equivalent in its effects to a tariff

that limits imports to the same level. Once we have domestic market

power, however, an important difference emerges. A monopolist

protected by a tariff cannot raise its price above the tariff -

inclusive   import price without losing the domestic market to imports.

By contrast, a firm sheltered by quantitative restrictions need not

fear increased imports, and is free to exercise its market power. The

result is that an import quota will lead to a higher domestic price

and lower domestic output than an "equivalent" tariff, defined as a

tariff that leads to the same level of imports.

     Figure 4 illustrates the non—equivalence of tariffs and quotas.

As before, D is the domestic demand curve, MC marginal cost, P the

world price. We compare a tariff t that reduces imports to I, and

an import quota that restricts imports to the same level.

     With a tariff, the domestic firm simply sets marginal cost equal

to          With the equivalent quota, however, the firm now face the

demand curve D1, derived by subtracting T from the domestic demand

curve D. Corresponding to       is a marginal revenue curve MR1. The

profit—maximizing price with the quota is therefore PQ; the quota

leads to a higher price and lower output than the tariff.

     Bhagwati's model produces a clear and compelling result. Better

still, it yields a clear policy message: if you must protect, use a

tariff rather than a quota. There are, however, two troubling
                                        15


 features of the model. One is the asymmetry between domestic and

foreign firms; we would like foreigners also to be modelled as

imperfectly competitive. The other is the lack of any model of the

process of entry that leads to imperfect Competition. Both features

have been the subject of recent research, the first most notably by

Krishna (1984), the second by Dixit and Norman (1980).



     Krishna's model



     To get away from an arbitrary asymmetry between a domestic

monopolist and price—taking foreign firms, it seems natural to examine

a duopoly. We can let there be a single domestic firm that supplies

the market with local production, and a single foreign firm that

exports to the market. Collusion is of course possible, but as a

modelling device we would prefer to assume noncomparative behavior.

(For some possible implications of collusion, however, see below).

     In modelling noncooperative oligopolies, the choice of strategy

variables is crucial. The two main alternatives are of course the

Cournot approach, in which firms take each others' outputs as given,

and the Bertrand approach, in which prices are taken as given. In

analyzing the effects of protection, both approaches turn out to be

problematic. The Cournot assumption fails to capture Bhagwati's

insight regarding the difference between quotas and tariffs; the

Bertrand assumption fails to yield a pure strategy equilibrium.
                                         16



     The problem with the Cournot approach may be simply stated.

Bhagwatis model argued that a quota creates more market power than a

tariff because the domestic firm knows that an increase in its price

will lead to an increase in imports. In the Cournot approach,

however, the domestic firm is assumed to take the level of imports as

given in any case; so a quota and a tariff that leads to the same

level of imports once again have equivalent effects on the domestic

firms behavior.

     If Bhagwati's argument for a lack of equivalence between tariffs

and quotas is right, however — and most international economists feel

that it is —   then this approach is missing an important insight. The
alternative is a Rsrtrand approach. What Krishna shows is that this

leads to unexpected complexities.

     Krishna considers a market in which a domestic and foreign firm

produce imperfect substitutes (an assumption that is necessary if

Bertrand competition is not to collapse to marginal cost pricing). In

the absence of quantitative trade restrictions, that is, either under

free trade or with a tariff, Bertrand competition can be treated in a

straightforward fashion. Each firm determines a profit—maximizing

price given the other firms price; given reasonable restrictions, we

can draw two upward—sloping reaction functions whose intersection

determines equilibrium.

    But suppose that an import quota is imposed. This creates an

immediate conceptual problem, which in turn leads to a problem in the

understanding of equilibrium.
                                       17



     The conceptual problem is how to handle the possibility of excess

demand. Suppose that at the prices set by the domestic and foreign

firms, domestic consumers demand more foreign goods than the import

quota allows. What happens? Krishna assumes, plausibly, that an

unspecified group of middlemen collects the difference between the

price charged by the foreign firm and the market—clearing consumer

price. That is, incipient excess demand is reflected in an increased

"dealer markup' rather than in rationing.

     This now raises the next question, which is how to interpret

Bertrand competition in this case. Which price does the domestic firm

take as given, the foreign factory price or the dealer price? Here

Krishna assumes, again sensibly, that the domestic firm takes the

foreign factory price rather than the dealer price as given. This

means that the domestic firm recognizes its ability to affect the

consumer price of foreign substitutes when the import quota is

binding.

     But this seemingly innocuous assumption turns out to imply a

basic discontinuity in the domestic firms response function. The

domestic firm in effect has two discrete pricing options: an

"aggressive" option of charging a low price that limits imports to

less than the quota, or a "timid" option of retreating behind the

quota and charging a high price. A small rise in the foreign firm's

price can shift the domestic firm's optimal response from "timid" to

"aggressive.".
                                        18


      Figure 5 illustrates the point.   It shows the demand curve and

the associated marginal revenue curve facing the domestic firm for a

given foreign firm factory price. The price p is the price at which

the quota becomes binding. That is, at domestic firm price above

there is an incipient excess demand for imports, which is reflected in

dealer markups that the domestic firm knows it can affect. By

Contrast, at prices below p the dealer price of imports is taken as

given. That is, at prices below     the domestic firm takes the

prices of the imported substitute as given, while at prices above

it believes that increases in its own price will increase the prices

of the substitutes as well. The result is a discontinuity in the

slope of the perceived demand curve, which is steeper just above

than it is just below; and hence a discontinuity in the level of the

marginal revenue curve, which jumps up at the quantity corresponding

to.
      What is clear from the figure is that there are two locally

profit—maximizing domestic prices: the 'timid" maximum T' and the

"aggressive" maximum      Which maximum is global depends on the price

charged by the foreign firm. The profitability of the timid option

is unaffected by what the foreign firm does, but the higher the

foreign price, the more profitable the aggressive option.

      The result is a home reaction function looking like HH in Figure

6. At low levels of the foreign price p, the domestic firm retreats

behind the quota and therefore chooses a price locally independent of
                                           19



p* At a sufficiently high p*, however, the domestic firm abruptly

sallies out from behind the quota with a cut in its price.

     The foreign best response function FF has no such discontinuity.

However, if the quota matters at all, FF must, as shown, pass right

through the hole in HH! Thus no pure strategy equilibrium exists.

     A mixed strategy equilibrium does exist.      If the foreign firm

charges p, the home firm is indifferent between T and           by

randomizing its choice of A and T with the right probabilities, the

home firm can induce its competitor to choose p.

     In this mixed strategy equilibrium, we notice that the foreign

firm, despite its monopoly power, does not always raise its price

enough to capture all of the quota rents, a result in contrast to

conventional wisdom. We can also note that with some probability the

quota will fail to be binding, in the sense that imports are strictly

less than the quota --   yet   both domestic and foreign prices are

unambiguously higher even in this case than under free trade.

     A point stressed by Krishna is that in this duopoly case a quota

can easily raise the profits of both firms. Consider for example a

quota that only restricts imports not to exceed their free trade

level. Clearly if the domestic firm charges T' it is because this is

more profitable than the free trade price, while the foreign firm will

sell the same output as under free trade, yet at a higher price. On

the other hand, if the domestic firm charges A' this aggressive"

price is still above the free trade price, so the foreign firm must be
                                       20


earning higher profits. (The domestic firm of course earns the same in

both states). So profitability of both firms increases unambiguously.



     Protection vs. collusion



     Almost all theoretical work on industrial organization/trade

issues assumes that firms act noncooperatively. In industrial

organization theory itself, however, there has recently been a drift

toward taking the possibility of collusive behavior more seriously.

Key to this drift has been the recognition that collusive behavior may

be individually rational in an indefinitely repeated game, where each

player believes that his failure to play cooperatively today will lead

to noncooperative behavior by others tomorrow. The influential

experimental work of Axelrod (1983) suggests that reasonable

strategies by individuals will indeed lead to cooperative outcomes in

a variety of circumstances.

     Recently Davidson (1984) and Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) have

proposed analyses of the effects of protection on collusion that seem

to stand Bhagwati on his head. They argue that precisely because

protection tends to raise profitability in the absence of collusion,

it reduces the penalty for cheating on a collusive agreement. By thus

reducing the prospects for collusion, the protection actually

increases competition.
                                       21


     The case is clearest for an import quota, analyzed by Rotemberg

and Saloner. To understand their argument, consider Krishna's model

again, but now suppose that the two firms attempt to agree on prices

higher than the noncooperative level. Suppose also that the only

enforcement mechanism for their agreement is the belief of each firm

that if it cheats this period, the other firm will thenceforth play

noncooperatively. Then collusion will succeed only if the extra

profits gained by cheating now are more than offset by the present

discounted value of the profits that will subsequently be lost by the

collapse of collusion. A viable price—fixing agreement must therefore

set prices low enough to make cheating unappealing.

     But as we saw in our discussion of Krishna's model, a quota can

actually raise the profitability of both firms in noncooperative

equilibrium. This paradoxically makes collusion more difficult to

sustain, by reducing the penalty for cheating. If the firms manage to

collude nonetheless, they may be forced to agree on lower prices in

order to make their collusion sustainable. So in this case an import

quota actually leads to more competition and lower prices than free

trade!

     Davidson considers the case of a tariff, which raises the

noncooperative profits of the domestic firm but lowers that of the

foreign competitor. If the result is to encourage the domestic firm to

cheat, the tariff will likewise increase competition.
                                          22



      It remains to be seen whether this argument will shake the

orthodox presumption that protection is bad for competition. The

modelling of collusive behavior is still in its infancy. To me, at

least, the approach taken in this new line of work seems an odd mix of

ad—hoc assumptions about retaliation with hyper-rational calculations

by firms about the consequences of such retaliation. Yet the argument

is profoundly unsetttling, which means that it must be valuable

 (though not that it must be right!).



     Protection and excessive entry



     In the 1950s, during the honeymoon period of import—substituting

industrialization strategies, it was often argued that economies of

scale in production provided an argument for protection —— a view with

a lineage going back to Frank Graham. At first, the point seems

obvious: protection raises the sales of domestic firms, and thus

allows them to slide down their average cost curves. In an influential

paper, however, Eastman and Stykolt (1960) argued that often the

reverse is true. In their view, bolstered by an appeal to Canadian

experience, protection typically leads to a smaller scale of

production and thus reduced efficiency.

     The Eastman—Stykolt view was not couched in terms of an explicit

model. Basically, however, they considered the typical case to be that

where the number of firms permitted by economies of scale is more than
                                        23


 one but small enough to allow effective collusion. Such a collusive

 industry will seek to raise its price to monopoly levels unless

constrained by foreign competition. A tariff or quota will thus lead

initially to higher prices and profits. The long run result, however,

will be entry of new firms into the industry. If integer constraints

do not bind too much, this entry will eliminate profits by driving

scale down and average cost up. Thus the effect of protection is to

create a proliferation of inefficiently small producers. Such

proliferation is indeed one of the favorite horror stories of Critics

of protection in less—developed countries, with the history of the

Latin American auto industry the classic case.

     This original version of the inefficient entry problem depended

on the assumption of collusion among domestic producers. The problem

could however arise even with noncooperative behavior, as is clear

from a model offered by Dixit and Norman (1980). They show that in a

Cournot market with free entry, expanding the size of the market leads

to a less than proportional increase in the number of firms, and to a

fall in average cost. Since international trade in effect links

together national markets into a larger world market, it would

presumably have the same result. Protection, on the other hand,

fragments the world market and hence leads to a proliferation of firms

and a rise in Costs.

    We will return to the inefficient entry problem below. It plays a

key role in the debate over "strategic" trade policy, and is also

central to some attempts to quantify the effects of trade policy.
                                       24




     Evaluation



     The basic Bhagwati model of protection and market power is

admirably clear and simple, and has been in circulation for long

enough to have percolated into practical policy analysis. Market power

analysis along Bhagwatis lines has become part of the book of

analytical recipes used by the International Trade Commission

(Rousslang and Suomela 1985). Market power considerations have now and

then helped dictate the form taken by protection; for example, the

trigger price mechanism on steel during the Carter administration was

deliberately designed to minimize the effect of protection on the

monopoly power of both domestic and foreign firms. And perceptions of

the impact of trade policy on market power seem to be playing a role

in antitrust decisions: in the steel industry, for example, it appears

that the Justice Department appreciates that foreign competition is

less effective a discipline than import penetration would suggest

thanks to import quotas and voluntary export restraints.

     More sophisticated models have yet to find application. It is at

this point hard to see how Krishnas model might be made operational,

let alone the inverted logic of the collusion models. The one

exception is the excess entry story, which as we will see is the

central element in Harris and Cox's (198?) effort to quantify the

effect of protection on Canadas economy.

     PRICE DISCRIMINATION AND DUMPING



     The phenomenon of "dumping" —   selling   exports at less than the

domestic price — has long been a major concern of trade legislation.

It is also self-evidently an imperfect competition issue. It is

therefore not surprising that the new literature on trade and 1—0

sheds some further light on dumping as a particular case of price

discrimination. More surprising, perhaps, is the fact that the new

literature on dumping actually identifies a new explanation of

international trade, distinct from both comparative advantage and

economies of scale.

     Much as in the case of protection and market power, the initial

insight here comes from an asymmetric model in which a domestic

monopolist confronts price—taking foreign firms. This insight becomes

both enlarged and transformed when rival oligopolists are introduced.

Finally, the welfare effects of trade based on dumping are of some

interest.



     An asymmetric model



     An extremely simple model of dumping is presented by Caves and

Jones (1985) and illustrated in Figure 7. As in the case of
                                           26



protection and market power, a single domestic monopolist is assumed

to face a given world price P. We now, however, reverse the

assumptions about the possibilities for trade. Before, we let the

firm face import competition while disregarding the possibility of

exports. Now we assume that the domestic market is somehow closed to

imports, while allowing the domestic firm to export.

     In the figure I have drawn a particular case, where with a price—

taking domestic firm there would be neither imports nor exports. If

the domestic firm acts as a monopolist, however, it will want to set

marginal revenue equal to marginal cost in both the domestic and the

foreign markets. Marginal revenue on the foreign market is however

just p, so the profit—maximizing solution is the one illustrated.

The firm sets a domestic price above         yet it exports, "dumping" on

the world market where additional sales do not depress the price

received on inframarginal units.

     Three points should be noted about this example. The first is

that while for simplicity it has been assumed that p is given, this

is not essential. What is important is that the firm perceives itself

as facing a higher elasticity of demand on exports than on domestic

sales. That is, dumping is simply international price discrimination.

     Second, the figure illustrates a case in which a price—taking

domestic firm would not export -   in   the usual sense of the term, the

domestic industry has neither a comparative advantage nor a

comparative disadvantage. Yet the firm does in fact export. Clearly
                                       27


we could have an industry which has at least some comparative

disadvantage, and yet dumps in the export market. In other words,

dumping can make trade run "uphill" against conventional determinants

of its direction.

     Third, the difference between the domestic and foreign markets

remains unexplained. Why should the domestic firm be a price—setter

at home, a price—taker abroad (or more generally, face more elastic

demand for exports)? We would like to have a model in which this

asymmetry is derived, rather than built in by assumption. In the new

1—0 trade literature, such models have finaly emerged.



     Brander's model



     A duopoly model of dumping was developed by Brander (1981) and

elaborated on by Brander and Krugman (1983). This model goes to the

opposite extreme from the asymmetrical model we just described, by

postulating instead a perfectly symmetrical situation. We assume that

some good is consumed in two countries, each of which has the same

demand; and we assume that there is a single firm in each country, and

that the two firms have identical costs. There is some positive cost

of transporting the good internationally, so that in a perfect

competition setting there would be no trade.

     If the transport costs are not too large, however, and if the

firms behave in a Cournot fashion, trade will nevertheless result. To
                                       28



see why, consider Figure 8, which illustrates what would happen in the

absence of trade. We see each firm acting as a monopolist, and thus

each country having a price that exceeds marginal costs. The firms do

not expand their output, however, because this would depress the price

on iriframarginal units.

     But suppose that the markup over marginal cost exceeds the

transport cost between the markets. In this case each firm will have

an incentive to absorb the transport cost so as to export to the

other's home market. The reason is that an extra unit sold abroad,

even though it yields a price net of transportation less than a unit

sold domestically, does not depress the price of inframarginal sales

(it depresses the price the other firm receives instead). So as long

as price less transportation exceeds marginal cost, it is worth

exporting.

     The result is a mutual interpenetration of markets, described by

Brander and Krugman as "reciprocal dumping." With Cournot behavior,

equilibrium will take the following form: each firm will have a

larger share of its home market than the foreign market, and will thus

perceive itself as facing a higher elasticity of demand abroad than at

home. The difference in perceived elasticity of demand will be just

enough to induce firms to absorb transport costs. The result will

therefore be a determinate volume of "cross—hauling": two—way trade

in the same product. In the symmetric example considered, this

pointless trade will be balanced.
                                       29


     From a trade theorist's point of view, this result is startling:

here we have international trade occurring despite a complete absence

of comparative advantage and without even any direct role for

economies of scale (although an indirect role can be introduced if we

suppose that increasing returns is the explanation of oligopoly).

From an industrial organization point of view, the result may not seem

quite so outlandish, since it bears a family resemblance to the theory

of basing—point pricing (Smithies 1942). Nonetheless, the trade—

theorist's approach offers the new possibility of an explicit welfare

analysis.



     Reciprocal dumping and welfare



     Reciprocal dumping is a totally pointless form of trade —   the
same good is shipped in both directions, and real resources are wasted

in its transportation. Nonetheless, the trade is not necessarily

harmful. International competition reduces the monopoly distortion in

each market, and the pro—competitive effect can outweigh the resource

waste.

     The welfare effects of reciprocal dumping are illustrated in

Figure 9. Since the countries are assumed to be symmetric, looking at

only one market will do. We note two effects. First, some of the

exports that are dumped in each country are a net addition to

consumption. In the figure this is represented as an increase of
                                         30


total deliveries from an initial level z to the level x+y. Since the

initial price A exceeds marginal cost c plus transportation cost t,

this represents a net gain, and can be equated with the pro—

competitive effect. On the other side, some of the imports displace

domestic production for the domestic market. This is represented as a

fall of deliveries from the domestic firm to its own market from z to

x, with the quantity y both imported and exported. Since this involves

a waste of resources on transportation, this constitutes a loss. From

the diagram it seems impossible to tell whether the net effect is a

gain or a loss.

     We know, however, that in one case at least there must be a gain.

If transport costs are zero, cross—hauling may be pointless but it is

also costless,and the pro—competitive effect yields gains. Presumably

this remains true for transport costs sufficiently low.

     This suggests that we examine how welfare changes as we vary

transport costs. Consider the effects of a small reduction in

transport costs, illustrated in Figure 10. There will be three

effects. First, there will be a direct reduction in the cost of

transporting the initial level of shipments — a clear gain. Second,

there will be an increase in consumption, which will be a gain to the

extent that the initial price exceeds marginal cost plus

transportation cost. Third, there will be a displacement of local

production by imports, which will be a loss by the change times the

initial transport cost.
                                        31



     Can we sign the total effect? We can do so in two cases. First,

suppose that transport costs are near zero. Then the last effect is

negligible, and a reduction in transport is clearly beneficial.

     More interestingly, suppose that initially transport costs are

almost large enough to prohibit trade. Recalling our discussion

above, this will be a situation where price is only slightly above

marginal cost plus transport, and where the volume of trade is very

small. This means that when transport costs are near the prohibitive

level, the two sources of gain from a small decline in these costs

become negligible, and a decline in transport costs thus reduces

welfare.

     Putting these results together, what we see is the relationship

illustrated in Figure 11.   If transport costs are high, but not high

enough to prevent trade, trade based solely on dumping leads to

losses. If they are low, trade is beneficial.



    Evaluation



    The new literature on dumping has so far been resolutely non-

policy and non—empirical. Still, nothing that suggests a previously

unsuspected explanation of international trade can be dismissed as

without importance. Furthermore, the modelling techniques developed in

the dumping literature are beginning to find at least some

application. As we will see, attempts to calibrate models to actual
                                         32


data have so far relied on assumptions that bear a clear family

resemblance   to those introduced by Brander and Brander and Krugman.




     STRATEGIC TRADE POLICY



     One of the most controversial ideas of the new 1—0/trade

literature has been the suggestion that government intervention can

raise national welfare by shifting oligopoly rents from foreign to

domestic firms. The starting point of this debate was several papers

by Brander and Spencer (1983,1985), who showed that in principle

government policies such as export subsidies can serve the same

purpose as, for example, investment in excess capacity in the 1—0

literature on entry deterrence. That is, government policies can serve

the "strategic" purpose of altering the subsequent incentives of

firms, acting as a deterrent to foreign competitors. The "strategic"

analysis seems to offer a possible rationale for trade policies, such

as export subsidies, that have been almost universally condemned by

international economists in the past.

     The Brander-Spencer analysis, coming at a time of heated debate

over US international competitiveness, appears dangerously topical,

and other economists have been quick to challenge the robustness of

their results. The critiques are themselves of considerable analytic

interest. In this survey I consider four important lines of research
                                           33


suggested by the critique of Brander—Spencer strategic trade policy.

First is the dependence of trade policy recommendations on the nature

of competition between firms, analyzed by Eaton and Grossman (1984).

Second is the general equilibrium issue raised by the fact that

industries must compete for resources within a country, analyzed by

Dixit and Grossman (1984). Third is the question of entry, studied by

Horstmann and Markusen (1986) and Dixit (1986). Finally is the

question of who is behaving strategically with respect to whom,

analyzed by Dixit and Kyle (1985).




     The Brander—Spencer analysis



     As is often the case in the 10/trade literature, the initial

insight in strategic trade policy was obtained by subtraction rather

than addition; by simplifying a trade issue to a form where a familiar

model of imperfect competition can be easily applied.

     Consider an industry in which there are only two firms, each in

one country. The clever simplification that Spencer and Brander

suggest is to assume that neither country has any domestic demand for

the industry's products. Instead, both countries export to a third

market. Also, distortions other than the presence of monopoly power in

this industry are ruled out ——   i.e.,   the marginal cost of each firm is

also the social cost of the resources it uses. The result is that for
                                       34



each country national welfare can be identified with the profits

earned by its firm.

      Since the firms are themselves attempting to maximize profits,

one might imagine that there is no case for government intervention.

However, this is not necessarily the case. To see why, we assume for

now that the two firms compete in Cournot fashion, and illustrate

their competition with Figure 12.

     Each firm's reaction function will, for reasonable restrictions

on cost and demand, slope down, and the Home firm's reaction function

will be steeper than its competitor's. Point N is the Nash

equilibrium. Drawn through point N is one of the Home firm's iso—

prof it curves. Given that the reaction function is constructed by

maximizing Home's profits at each level of Foreign output, the iso—

profit curve is flat at point N.

     Now it is apparent that the Home firm could do better than at

point N if it could only somehow commit itself to produce more than

its Cournot output. Indeed, if the Home firm could pre—commit itself

to any level of output, while knowing that the Foreign firm would

revise its own plans optimally, the Outcome could be driven to the

Stackleberg point S. The problem is that there is no good reason to

assign the leadership role to either firm. If no way   to   establish a

commitment exists, the Nash outcome is what will emerge.

    What Spencer and Brander pointed out was that a government policy

could serve the purpose of making a commitment credible. Suppose that
                                        35


the Home government establishes an export subsidy for this industry.

This subsidy will shift the Home reaction function to the right, and

thus the outcome will shift southeast along the Foreign reaction

function. Because the subsidy has the deterrent effect of reducing

Foreign exports, the profits of the Home firm will rise by more than

the amount of the subsidy. Thus Home national income will rise. The

optimal export subsidy is of course one that shifts the reaction

function out just enough to achieve the Stackleberg point S.

     It is possible to elaborate considerably on this basic model.

Most notably, we can imagine a multi-stage competitive process, in

which firms themselves attempt to establish commitments through

investment in capital or R&D. In these models, considered in Brander

and Spencer (1983), optimal policies typically involve subsidies to

investment as well as exports. The basic point remains the same,

however. Government policy "works" in these models for the same reason

that investing in excess capacity works in entry deterrence models,

because it alters the subsequent game in a way that benefits the

domestic firm.



     The nature of competition



     Eaton and Grossman (1984) have argued forcefully that the

argument f or strategic trade policy is of limited use, because the

particular policy recommendation depends critically on details of the
                                       36


model. In particular, they show that the Brander—Spencer case for

export subsidies depends on the assumption of Cournot competition.

With other assumptions, the result may go away or even be reversed.

      To see this, suppose instead that we have Bertrand competition,

with firms taking each others' prices as given. (As in our discussion

of import quotas above, we must assume the the two firms are producing

differentiated products if the model is not to collapse to perfect

competition). Then the reaction function diagram must be drawn in

price space.

     Figure 13 shows the essentials. Each firm's best responses

describe a reaction function that is upward—sloping. With reasonable

restrictions, Home's curve is steeper than Foreign's. The Nash

equilibrium is at N, and the Home iso—profit curve passing through N

is flat at that point.

     The crucial point is that now Home can increase its profits only

by moving northeast along the Foreign reaction function. That is, it

must persuade Foreign to charge a higher price than at the Nash

equilibrium. To do this, it must commit to a higher price than will ex

post be optimal. To achieve this, what the government must do is

impose, not an export subsidy, but an export tax!

     So what Eaton and Grossman show is that replacing the Cournot

with a Bertrand assumption reverses the policy recommendation. Given

the shakiness of any characterization of oligopoly behavior, this is

not reassuring.
                                       37


      Eaton and Grossman go further by embedding both Cournot and

Bertrand in a general conjectural variations formulation. The result

is of course that anything can happen. One case that these authors

emphasize is that of 'rational" conjectures, where the conjectures

actually match the slope of the reaction functions (a case that I do

not find particularly interesting, given the problems of the

conjectural variation approach in general). In this case, not too

surprisingly, free trade turns out to be the optimal policy.



     Competition for resources



     Dixit and Grossman (1984) offer a further critique of the case

for strategic trade policy based on the partial equilibrium character

of the models. Their point may be made as follows: an export subsidy

works in the Brander — Spencer model essentially by lowering the

marginal cost faced by the domestic exporter. Foreign firms, seeing

this reduced marginal cost, are deterred from exporting as much as

they otherwise would have, and this is what leads to a shifting of

profits. But in general equilibrium, an export industry can expand

only by bidding resources away from other domestic industries. An

export subsidy, while it lowers marginal cost in the targeted

industry, will therefore raise marginal cost in other sectors. Thus in

industries that are not targeted the effect will be the reverse of

deterrence.
                                       38



     Dixit arid Grossman construct a particular tractable example where

a group of industries must compete for a single common factor,

"scientists'. An export subsidy to one of these sectors necessarily

forces a contraction in all the others. As we might expect, such a

subsidy raises national income only if the deterrent effect on foreign

competition is higher in the subsidized sector than in the sectors

that are crowded out. As the authors show, to evaluate the

desirability of a subsidy now requires detailed knowledge not only of

the industry in question but of all the industries with which it

competes for resources. Their conclusion is that the likelihood that

sufficient information will be available is small.



     Entry



     The strategic trade policy argument hinges on the presence of

supernormal profits over which countries can compete. Yet one might

expect that the possibility of entry will limit and perhaps eliminate

these profits. If so, then even in oligopolistic industries the bone

of Contention may be too small to matter.

    Horstmann and Markusen (1986) have analyzed the Brander-Spencer

argument when there is free entry by firms. The number of firms in

equilibrium is limited by fixed costs, but they abstract from the

integer problem. The result of allowing entry is to restore the

orthodox argument against export subsidy, in a strong form: all of a
                                           39



subsidy is absorbed either by reduced scale or worsened terms of

trade, and thus constitutes a loss from the point of view of the

subsidizing country.

     Dixit (1986) is concerned with a more dynamic version of the same

problem. He notes that in industries characterized by technological

uncertainty, there will be winners and losers. The winners —- who will

actually make up the industry ——   will   appear to earn supernormal

profits, but this will not really indicate the presence of excess

returns. Ex ante, an investment, say in R&D, may be either a winner or

a loser, so that the costs of those who did not make it should also be

counted. Dixit develops a technology race model of international

competition in a single industry, and shows that in such an industry

high profits among the winners of the race do not offer the

possibility of successful strategic trade policy.



     A larger game?



     The Brander-Spencer analysis assumes that the government in

effect can commit itself to a trade policy before firms make their

decisions. They also leave aside the possible reactions of foreign

governments. Yet a realistic analysis would surely recognize that

firms also make strategic moves designed to affect government

decisions, and that governments must contend with the possibility of

foreign reactions. Many of the ramifications of these larger games

have been explored by Dixit and Kyle (1985).
                                       40


     To see what difference this extension makes, consider two cases.

First, suppose that there is a firm that faces the following

situation: it can commit itself to produce by making an irreversible

investment. Once this cost is sunk, it will be socially optimal to

provide the Brander—Spencer export subsidy, and with this subsidy the

firm will find that its entry was justified. From a social point of

view, however, it would have been preferable for the firm not to have

entered at all.

     In this case, what is clear is that if the firm can move first,

the government will find itself obliged to provide the subsidy. Yet it

would have been better off if it could have committed itself not to

provide the subsidy, and thus deterred the undesirable entry. The

possibility of an export subsidy, though it raises welfare given

entry, in the end is counterproductive. The government would have been

better off if it had never heard of Brander and Spencer, or had a

constitutional prohibition against listening to them.

     Alternatively, consider the case of two countries, both able to

pursue Brander—Spencer policies. It is certainly possible that both

countries may be worse off as the result of a subsidy war, yet they

will find themselves trapped in a prisoner's dilemma.

     The point of the extended game analysis, then, is that even

though interventionist policies may be shown to be locally desirable,

it may still be in the country's interest that the use of such

policies be ruled out.

     Evaluation



     Strategic trade policy is without doubt a clever insight. From

the beginning, however, it has been clear that the attention received

by that insight has been driven by forces beyond the idea's

intellectual importance. The simple fact is that there is a huge

external market for challenges to the orthodoxy of free trade. Any

intellectually respectable case for interventionist trade policies,

however honestly proposed —— and the honesty of Brander and Spencer is

not in question ——   will   quickly find support for the wrong reasons. At

the same time, the profession of international economics has a well

developed immune system designed precisely to cope with these outside

pressures. This immune system takes the form of an immediate intensely

critical scrutiny of any idea that seems to favor protectionism. So

Brander—Spencer attracted both more attention and more critical review

than would normally have been the case.

    That said, does the marriage of trade and 1—0 offer an important

new case for protectionism? To answer this we must go beyond the

Brander—Spencer analysis of export competition to consider a wider

range of models.



    A NEW CASE FOR PROTECTION?
                                        42


      To the extent that the 1-0/trade linkage offers any new comfort

to protectionists, it takes the form of four not wholly distinct

arguments. First is the possibility that trade policy can be used to

extract rent from foreign monopolists. Second is the potential for

shifting rent from foreign to domestic firms. Third is the possible

use of protectionist policies as a way to get firms further down their

average cost curves. Last is the use of protection to promote

additional entry, where this is desirable.



     Extracting rent from foreigners



     The possibility of using a tariff to extract gains from a foreign

monopolist has been emphasized in two papers by Brander and Spencer

(1981,1984). In its simplest version, their analysis considers a

foreign monopolist selling to the domestic market without any domestic

competition. They point out that under a variety of circumstances a

tariff will be partly absorbed by the foreign firm rather than passed

on to domestic consumers. For example, suppose that demand is linear

and that a specific tariff is imposed: then only half of the tariff

will be passed on in prices, with the rest coming out of the firm's

markup.

     This observation suggests a terms—of—trade justification for

tariffs similar to the traditional optimum tariff argument. The

difference is that there is no requirement that the tariff—imposing
                                       43


country be large relative to world markets. As long as the foreign

seller is charging a price above marginal cost, and as long as it is

able to discriminate between the domestic market and other markets, it

will be possible for a tariff to lower prices.

     In one extension of their analysis, Brander and Spencer go on to

consider the case where the foreign firm is attempting to deter entry

by a potential domestic competitor. They follow an early Dixit model

in which the incumbent firm does this by setting a limit output high

enough that if it were to be maintained post—entry this entry would be

unprofitable (this was before Dixit acquired enlightenment and became

perfect). The result in this case is that any tariff low enough that

the limit pricing strategy is maintained will be wholly absorbed by

the foreign firm.



     Rent—shifting



     Clearly a tariff can give domestic firms a strategic advantage in

the domestic market, in the same way that export subsidies can give

them an- advantage in foreign markets. Welfare assessment of strategic

tariff policy is however complicated by the need to worry about

domestic consumers. What Brander and Spencer (1984) point out,

however, is that rent shifting will generally reinforce rent

extraction. That is, if in the absence of domestic competitors a

tariff would be partly absorbed by foreign firms, the presence of

domestic competitors will reinforce the case for a tariff.
                                           44




     Reducing marginal cost



     In Krugman (1984a) it is pointed out that protection of the

domestic market can serve as a form of export promotion. The model is

a variant of Brander and Krugman (1983), where two firms

interpenetrate each others' home markets through reciprocal dumping.

Instead of constant marginal cost, however, each firm has downward—

sloping marginal cost. Suppose now that one firm receives protection

in its home market. The immediate result will be that it sells more

and the other firm less. This will reduce the home firm's marginal

cost, while raising its competitor's cost; this will in turn have the

indirect effect of increasing the Home firm's sales in the unprotected

foreign market. In the end, "import protection is export promotion":

protection of the home market actually leads to a rise in exports. The

same results obtain when the economies of scale are dynamic rather

than static, arising for example from R&D or a learning curve.

     Is this policy desirable from the point of view of the protecting

country? We can surmise that it might be, because it is in effect a

strategic export policy of the kind with which we are now familiar. A

numerical example in Krugman (1984b) shows at least that such a policy

could be worth carrying out ——   if   there is no retaliation.



     Promoting entry
                                          45




     Venables (1985a) considers another variant of the Brarider—Krugman

model in which marginal cost is constant, but there are fixed costs.

This time, however, he allows free entry and waives integer

constraints on the number of firms. He now asks what the effects of a

small tariff imposed by one country would be.

     It is immediately apparent that such a tariff would raise the

profitability of domestic firms and lower the profitability of

foreign, leading to entry on one side and exit on the other. This

makes the home market more competitive, and the foreign market less

competitive. What Venables is able to show, surprisingly, is that for

a small tariff this indirect effect on competition has a stronger

effect on prices than the direct effect of the tariff itself. The

price of the protected good will fall in the country that imposes the

tariff, while rising in the rest of the world!.

     To understand this result, first note the first—order condition

for a firm's deliveries to each market:



p   x(dp/dx)   =



where x is the firm's deliveries to the market and c is marginal cost.

In a Cournot model dp/dx as perceived by the firm will be the slope of

the market demand curve, and thus will itself be a function of the

market price p. Thus x will be a function of p, as will the revenues

earned by the firm in that market.
                                          46


        Since everything is a function of p, we can write the zero—profit

condition that must hold with free entry as a function of p and of p*,

the price in the foreign market. In Figure 14, the schedule HH

represents the combinations of p and p' consistent with zero profits

for a representative firm producing in Home, FF the zero-profit locus

for a firm producing in Foreign. In the presence of transport costs it

will ordinarily be true that HH is steeper than FF, i.e., Home firms

are relatively more affected by the Home price than Foreign firms, A

free entry equilibrium will occur when both zero—profit conditions are

satisfied.

        Now suppose that a tariff is imposed by Home. The zero—profit

locus for Home firms will not be affected, but Foreign firms will face

increased costs on shipment to Home. They will have to receive a

higher price in at least one market to make up for this, so FF shifts

out. We now see Venables' result: the price in Home must actually

fall, while that in Foreign rises.

        The welfare calculation is now straightforward. Profits are not

an issue, because of free entry. Consumers are better off in the

protecting country. And there is additional government revenue as

well.

    The new literature on 1-0 and trade certainly calls into question

the traditional presumption that free trade is optimal. Whether it is

a practical guide to productive protectionism is another matter. The

models described here are all quite special cases; small variations in

assumptions can no doubt reverse the conclusions, as was the case in

the Brander—Spencer mode1 of export competition.

     It may be questioned whether our understanding of how imperfectly

competitive industries actually behave will ever be good enough for us

to make policy prescriptions with confidence. What is certain is that

purely theoretical analyses will not be enough. Until very recently,

there was essentially no quantification of the new ideas in trade

theory. In the last two years, however, there have been a handful of

preliminary attempts to put numbers into the models. I conclude the

paper with a discussion of these efforts.




     QUANTIFICATION



     Efforts to quantify the new theoretical models have been of three

kinds. First have been econometric studies of some of the aggregate

predictions of the intra—industry trade model described in the first

section of this paper. Second, and most recent, have been efforts to

"calibrate" theoretical models to fit the facts of particular

industries. Finally, and most ambitiously, Harris and Cox have
                                       48


attempted to introduce industrial organization considerations into

general equilibrium model of the Canadian economy.



     Testing the intraindustry trade model



     The empirical analysis of intra—industry trade, in such studies

as that by Grubel and Lloyd (1975), long predates the monopolistic

competition theory described in this survey. Without a theoretical

base, however, discussion of intraindustry trade often seemed

confused. Only once formal models became available was it possible for

empirical workers to concentrate on propositions derived from these

models.

     Two studies focus on the most direct proposition, that the

proportion of intra—-industry as opposed to inter—industry trade should

be positively correlated with the degree of similarity between

countries' capital-labor ratios. Loertscher and Wolter (1980) use

differences in per capita income as a proxy for differences in

resource endowments, and confirm the correlation using a cross section

for a single year. Helpman (1984) uses a more extended data set to

confirm the proposition over a number of years; he also shows that as

the industrial countries became more similar over time the relative

importance of intra—industry trade grew, just as the model would

suggest.
                                           49


     Havrylyshyn and Civan (1984) study a proposition that is less

clearly implied by the model, but in the same spirit: namely, that

intraindustry trade is likely to be more prevalent in the trade

between advanced countries than in trade among LDCs, on the

presumption that advanced Countries produce more differentiated

products. They find that this is, indeed, the case.

     These regression studies suffer from a common problem of lack of

congruence between the data and the concepts in the theoretical model.

In the theory, an "industry" is a group of products produced with

similar factor intensities, so that trade within an industry cannot be

explained by conventional comparative advantage. Whether this concept

of an industry has anything to do with a three—digit Standard

International Trade Classification category —-     the   unit to which the

analysis is in each case applied ——   is   anybody's guess. What is clear

is that the data does not provide a very good correspondence to the

theorectical concept.



     Calibrated models



     The newest development in the 1—0/trade field is the attempt to

quantify models by calibrating them to data from actual industries.

This style of analysis seems likely to grow, and needs a name; f or now

we may call these studies Industrial Policy Exercises Calibrated to

Actual Cases (IPECACs).
                                        50


      The pioneering work here is DIxit's (1985) model of the auto

 industry. The US auto market is represented as a noncooperative

 oligopoly, with foreign autos differentiated from domestic. Demand

 functions are derived from other published studies; constant terms and

 cost parameters are derived from actual industry data. In order to

make the model fit, Dixit is also obliged to adopt a conjectural

variations approach, with the conjectures derived in the process of

calibrating the model.

     Once the model is calibrated, it is possible to perform policy

experiments on it. In particular, Dixit calculates the optimal trade

policy when a tariff is the only available instrument, and the optimal

trade—cum--industrial policy when a production subsidy is also

available. He finds that a modest tariff is in fact justified, for the

reaons we described above. The gains from this optimal tariff are

however fairly small. When a production subsidy is allowed, the

additional role for a tariff is greatly reduced, with the gains from

adding tariffs as an instrument extremely small.

     A model similar in spirit but quite different in detail is

Baldwin and Krugman (1986), which studies the competition in 16K

Random Access Memories. The model is a variant of Krugman (1984a),

with strong learning-by—doing providing the increasing returns. As in

the Dixit analysis, the modelts parameters are partly drawn from other

published studies, partly estimated by calibrating the model to actual

data. Also as in Dixit's study, it proves necessary to adopt a
                                       51


conjectural variations approach in order to match the observed

industry structure.

     In the Baldwin—Krugman analysis, the policy experiment is a

historical counterfactual. How would the competition in 16K RAMs have

been different if the Japanese market, which appears to have been de

facto closed to imports, had been open? The model yields a striking

result: instead of being substantial net exporters, the Japanese firms

would not even have been able to compete in their own home market.

Thus import protection was export promotion with a vengeance.

     The welfare implications of this counterfactual can also be

computed. According to the model, Japanese market closure, although it

succesfully promoted exports, did not benefit Japan. Because Japanese

firms appear to have had inherently higher costs than their US rivals,

market closure was a costly policy that hurt both the US and Japan.

     At the time of writing, the only other IPECAC is a study by

Venables and Smith (1986). They apply methods that combine those of

the Dixit and Baldwin—Krugman papers, as well as an interesting

formulation of multiniodel competition, to study the UK refrigerator

and footwear industries. The results are also reminiscent to some

degree of both other studies: modest tariffs are welfare—improving,

and protection has strong export—promoting effects.

    The calibrated trade models are all at this point rather awkward

constructs. They rely on ad—hoc assumptions to close gaps in the data,

and they rely to an uncomfortable degree on conjectural variations ——
                                        52



 an approach that each of the papers denounces even as it is adopted.

 To some extent the results of this literature so far might best be

 regarded as numerical examples informed by the data rather than as

 studies that are seriously meant to Capture the behavior of particular

 industries. Nonetheless, the Confrontation with data does lend a new

sense of realism and empirical discipline to the 1—0/trade literature.



     General equilibrium



     The most ambitious attempt to apply industrial organization to

trade policy analysis is the attempt by Harris and Cox to develop a

general equilibrium model of Canada with increasing returns and

imperfect competition built in. This effort, reported in Harris (1984)

and Harris and Cox (1984), stands somewhat apart from much of the

other literature reviewed here. Although some elements of the

monopolistic Competition model are present, the key to the results is

the adoption of the Eastman—Stykolt pricing assumption, that firms are

able to collude well enough to raise the domestic price to the foreign

price plus tariff.

     Given this assumption, it is naturally true that Canadian import—

competing industries are found to have excessive entry and

inefficiently small scale. The authors also offer a fairly complex

analysis of pricing and entry in export markets, which leads them to

believe that inefficient scale in Canadian export industries results
                                       53


from US protection. Combining these effects, the authors find that the

costs to Canada from its partial isolation from the US market are

several times higher than those estimated using conventional

computable general equilibrium models. Thus the Harris—Cox analysis

makes a strong case for free trade between the US and Canada.

     The Harris—Cox study has not yet been followed by a body of work

that would enable us to evaluate the robustness of its conclusion. It

is unclear, in particular, how much the assumption of collusion—cum--

free entry is driving the results; would a noncooperative market

structure still imply comparably large costs from protection? It is a

fairly safe bet, however, that over the next few years workers in this

area will attempt to fill in the space between Harris—Cox and the

calibrated models, building more or less general equilibrium models

that also have some detailing of the process of competition in

individual industries.



     Evaluation



     The attempts at quantification described here are obviously

primitive and preliminary. However, the same could be said of attempts

to apply industrial organization theory to purely domestic issues. The

problem is that the sophistication of our models in general seems to

have outrun our ability to match them up with data or evidence. The

first efforts in this direction in international 10 are therefore
                                        54


 welcome. One might hope that this effort will be aided by an

 interchange with conventional 10 research that poses similar issues,

 such as the analysis of the effects of mergers.




      CONCLUDING COMMENTS



     The rapid growth in the application of industrial organization

concepts to international trade seems to be remaking trade theory in

10's image. Traditional trade theory was, by the late 1970s, a

powerful monolithic structure in which all issues were analyzed using

variants of a single model. The new literature has successfully broken

the grip of that single approach. Increasingly international

economics, like industrial organization, is becoming a field where

many models are taught and research is an eclectic mix of approaches.

     This transformation of the subject has been extremely valuable in

several ways. First of all, the fundamental insight is right ——

markets are often not perfectly competitive, and returns to scale are

often not constant. Beyond this, the new approaches have brought

excitement and creativity to an area that had begun to lose some of

its intellectual drive.

     At this point, however, the central problem of international

trade is how to go beyond the proliferation of models to some kind of

new synthesis. Probably trade theory will never be as unified as it
                                       55


was a decade ago, but it would be desirable to see empirical work

begin to narrow the range of things that we regard as plausible

outcomes.
