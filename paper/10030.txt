                                            ABSTRACT

A structural dynamic model of retirement and saving is used to simulate the retirement effects of
proposals made by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security. Provisions reducing
the growth in real benefits and increasing actuarial incentives to work reduce retirements. They more
than offset increases in retirements caused by individual accounts, increased benefits for low wage
workers and survivors, and reductions in the top AIME bracket. By 2075, the Commission's
proposals would reduce retirements at age 62 by roughly 4 percentage points, mitigating an 8.7
percentage point trend to earlier retirement projected to reassert itself after its recent interruption.

                                         I. Introduction

       In December 2001, the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS)

issued its final report. Rather than a single reform model to modify social security, the

Commission explored three different reform models, all of which include the introduction of

voluntary personal accounts. In addition, the proposals would reduce the rate of growth of real

benefits, introduce actuarial incentives to encourage later retirements, increase benefits for low

wage workers and survivors, and reduce the top AIME bracket.

       The specific elements of social security that the Commission would change would also be

changed by other proposals to reform social security so as to rebalance its finances. Thus an

analysis of the retirement effects of the elements comprising the Commission’s proposal are of

more general interest than the specific models the Commission proposed. The effects we

estimate here for each specific change can be used to estimate the likely effects on retirement of

other proposals that would weight these changes differently than the President’s Commission did

in structuring its various reform proposals.

       The first reform model introduced by the Commission does nothing to address the long-

term funding imbalances in the social security system. The second and third proposals do

include elements to strengthen the system, and as a result these are the proposals that are being

given the most consideration.

       In many ways the Commission reform models are constrained by the specific principles

given to the Commission by the President. Most importantly, the reform models are required to

include personal retirement accounts, and these must be voluntary. To make the personal

accounts attractive to the entire range of covered workers, including those who are effectively


                                                 1
receiving transfers under the current system, the Commission devised an offset system. For

every dollar of payroll taxes diverted to the personal account, future traditional benefits will be

reduced by a specified present value amount. To mitigate the solvency problem, traditional

benefits are prescribed to grow more slowly than would be the case under the current formula.

Since the current formula maintains a roughly constant replacement rate as overall earnings

increase over time, this method implies that social security will become a less important element

in the retirement resources equation.

       In these proposals, the Commission also included several elements in addition to the

personal accounts. Some of these proposals would increase the relative benefits paid to low-

wage workers and their widows, and others would reduce the relative benefits of higher income

workers. In one reform model, the Commission also included changes to try to induce

individuals to retire later, further reducing early retirement benefits and raising the delayed

retirement credit.

       The Actuaries’ Supplement appended to the Commission report traces the effects of the

reform models on the financial health of the system and on the income levels of various groups

of individuals who would be affected by the changes. However, several of the elements of these

reform models can be expected to have non-trivial effects on retirement. These retirement

effects are not considered in the Actuaries’ Supplement or, as far as we are aware, in any other

analysis of the Commission proposals.

       To simulate the retirement effects of the various elements of the Commission proposals,

we use a structural dynamic model of retirement and saving that we have developed for previous

work. This model posits lifetime expected utility that is constrained by an asset accumulation


                                                  2
equation and an uncertain lifetime. Retirement preferences and time preferences are both

allowed to be heterogeneous among workers. Workers are allowed to partially retire, usually in

a different job at a lower wage rate. Social security enters as income in the asset accumulation

equation in the years that benefits are received. The current utility value of the future benefits is,

of course, heavily dependent on the worker’s time preference rate. We apply the model to

simulate the retirement effects of the Commission proposals on a sample of married men.

        In the next section, we detail more fully the aspects of the Commission proposals that we

intend to evaluate. The following section contains a brief discussion of prior efforts to model

savings and retirement. Section IV explains the model we use in the analysis and the method we

use to estimate it. A description of the simulation methodology appears in the following section.

In Section VI, we present the results of the simulations of the effects of elements of the

Commission’s proposals on retirement. A final section offers concluding remarks.

                                      II. The CSSS Proposals

        Personal accounts are the most prominent element of the Commission proposals. The

accounts themselves are fairly standard, but the offset to traditional benefits is not. For each

dollar that the individual diverts into the personal account, a dollar is placed into a fictitious

“offset” account.1 The balance in this notional offset account is compounded at a fixed real

interest rate until the individual is ready to collect benefits. At that time, the balance in the offset

account is annuitized, and the resulting amount is subtracted from the annual benefits that the


        1
         Gustman and Steinmeier (2002a) show that in computing the eventual retirement benefit,
the proposal both adds and subtracts the principal in the account. As a result the individual’s
benefit under the proposal is equal to the basic benefit under the relevant social security benefit
formula plus the annuitized value of any differential interest rate earnings or losses on the
personal account.

                                                   3
individual would receive under the traditional social security system. In the second Commission

reform model, the real interest rate used in the offset account is 2.0%, while in the third reform

model it is 2.5%. Both are lower than the 3.0% long-term projected real rate for treasury bonds.

If the assets in the personal accounts grow by more than the assumed offset rate, the individual

increases wealth by participation in the personal account; if not he or she loses. Since the offset

rate is lower than the rate for relatively safe treasury bonds, and since on average the varying

market rates will have decades to even themselves out, and will likely exceed the offset rates, the

expectation is that in most cases the individual would be ahead to participate in the personal

accounts.

       The retirement effects of the personal accounts depend to some degree on how the payout

of the accounts is arranged. The commission’s report suggests that the withdrawals from the

accounts should begin after an individual retires, but “retirement” is a somewhat ambiguous

term. Does it mean when the individual ceases working, or when he earns less than some

minimal amount? Or does it mean when the individual works less than some number of hours in

a year? The retirement effects of the personal accounts also depend on the realizations of the

returns to those accounts. If the returns to the accounts substantially exceed expectations,

individuals might want to retire earlier, while if the accounts perform poorly individuals might

want to delay retirement. In this regard the retirement effects of the personal accounts are very

similar to the effects of holding risky assets in non-social security retirement accounts, an issue

we examined very recently in the context of the 1995-2002 stock market bubble (Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2002c). Given the findings of that study, in conjunction with the relatively small

size of the personal social security accounts, it would appear that even a major swing in stock


                                                 4
prices would probably cause no more than a percent or so change in the percentage of retired

individuals because of the personal accounts.

       In this paper, we will consider the retirement effects of the personal accounts as well as

the remainder of the measures in the Commission’s reform models. Table 1 summarizes these

measures for the second and third of the Commission’s reform models. As is evident from the

table, the two reform models share some common features in addition to the personal accounts,

but there are also some important differences. In addition, the third reform model contains a

couple of features that are absent from the second reform model.

       In terms of restoring the financial balance to social security, the second element listed in

the table is by far the most important. In reform model 2, the percentages in the PIA formula

would be adjusted downward every year so that the average benefit would remain roughly

constant in real terms. In reform model 3, the adjustments would hold the growth in the average

benefits to the growth in earnings less the growth in average life expectancy. In practical terms,

this means that the average real benefits in reform model 3 would grow at about 0.5 percent per

year, as opposed to a projected real earnings growth of 1 percent per year. In either case, the

replacement rate of social security benefits to earnings would be gradually reduced below levels

called for in the current formula, and the influences of social security on retirement would be

gradually reduced. The effect should be about twice as great with reform model 2 as with reform

model 3. In reform model 2, the size of traditional social security benefits, relative to wages,

would be less than half as much at the end of the 75 year planning period as they are today.

       Both reform models also have provisions to maintain the benefits of long-term low-wage

workers at or above the poverty level, although the details differ. Reform model 2 would boost


                                                 5
the basic benefit of a 30 year minimum wage worker by about 40%, which is enough to provide

benefits at roughly 120 percent of the poverty level. This boost would be proportionately

reduced toward zero for workers with less than 20 years of experience and for workers with

lifetime earnings exceeding the earnings of a 35 year worker with twice the minimum wage.

Reform model 3 would give the 30 year minimum wage worker a smaller boost of 12 percent,

but the boost would extend all the way up to the average wage level before it is phased out. It

would also be phased out for individuals with less than 20 years of covered earnings, but

additional years of earnings beyond 30 would result in an even higher boost, which contrasts

with the case of reform model 2. Overall, one would expect that the boosts for low wage

workers in reform model 2 would be greater, but would cover a smaller percent of the work

force.

         Reform model 3 contains a proposal to impose a larger reduction in benefits for retiring

early and to raise benefits more when retirement is delayed, so as to improve incentives to work

longer. It is the only part of any of the proposals whose primary purpose is explicitly to increase

the age at which people retire. Under current law, when the normal retirement age increases to

age 67, retirees at age 62 will receive 70 percent of full benefits, while delaying retirement past

age 67 will increase benefits by 8 percent per year. Under the proposal, age 62 retirees would

receive only 63 percent of full benefits, while delaying retirement past age 67 would increase

benefits by 10 percent per year of delay. Similar changes for spouse benefits would make the

benefits payable at age 62 only 58 percent of full benefits as opposed to 65 percent under the

current law.

         A fourth element of the Commission proposals, which is essentially the same for both


                                                 6
reform models, is to increase the surviving spouse benefit of low-wage couples to 75% of the

benefit that would have been received if both spouses were still living. This provision applies if

the surviving spouse benefit is less than the average benefit for retired workers.2 Currently the

surviving spouse benefit is between 50% and 67% of the couple’s combined benefit, so the

change would raise the benefits of eligible surviving spouses by between 13 and 50 percent,

which is a nontrivial magnitude. On the other hand, at the time retirement decisions are made,

the applicability of surviving spouse benefits is probably a couple of decades away, and this

extended length of time will tend to dull the effect of this provision on retirement.

       The last element listed in the table, which again applies only to reform model 3, is a

proposal to drop the percentage rate in the highest PIA bracket from 15 percent to 10 percent.

The reduction in benefits for high wage workers is much less than the one third decline in this

percentage would suggest. Even for individuals with relatively high average earnings, most of

the social security benefit comes from the first two brackets of the PIA formula, which replace

90 percent and 32 percent of average earnings, respectively. The clear intent of this proposal is

to generate some of the funds necessary to finance some of the additional subsidy given to low-

wage workers, thus offsetting the negative effects of some of the other proposed changes on the

bottom part of the distribution.

       The reform models have some other elements related more to the financing issue rather

than to the retirement issue. Notably, both reform models 2 and 3 call for the infusion of funds



       2
        In addition to its effect on the primary earner, this provision will reduce work incentives
for low wage spouses. We do not model the work behavior of spouses in this paper. For an
analysis that takes into account interdependence in the retirement decision making of husbands
and wives using the HRS, see Gustman and Steinmeier (forthcoming).

                                                 7
from the general treasury for at least some periods. It would be necessary to consider these

elements if the purpose of the paper were to examine the relative effectiveness of the reform

models to solve the solvency issue, but it is probably less critical to examine them in an analysis

of the effects of these reform models on retirement. As a result, we will limit the analyses in this

paper to the proposals listed in Table 1, which are the main proposals that can be expected to

have a significant impact on retirement.

    III. Issues in Modeling the Retirement Effects of Changing Social Security Policies

       There is a long tradition in modeling the effects of social security policies on retirement.

Many studies use panel data to estimate models based on a life cycle approach.3 Most of these

models can explain behavioral responses to sharp changes in the present value of rewards with

continued work. They do a poorer job of explaining responses to provisions such as the social

security early retirement age. Since benefits are reduced on an actuarially fair basis between

early and normal retirement age, there is no spike in the benefit accrual profile, and no decline in

benefit accruals to explain the sharp spike at age 62 in retirements. Thus to explain the peak in

retirements at age 62, Coile and Gruber (2002) and Panis et al. (2002) have had to include age

dummies, and the coefficient on the dummy for age 62 is strong and significant. Without

explaining this important feature of the retirement hazard, one does not have a reliable baseline




       3
         Much of the early literature is based on the 1969-79 Retirement History Study. See, for
example, Gordon and Blinder (1980), Burtless and Moffitt (1984), Fields and Mitchell (1984),
Gustman and Steinmeier (1985, 1986, 1991) and Rust and Phelan (1997) for contributions to this
literature based on the Retirement History Study. For a survey of the retirement literature, see
Lumsdaine and Mitchell (1999).

                                                 8
from which to judge how changes in social security rules will affect retirement outcomes.4

         Gustman and Steinmeier (2002b) suggest that to explain retirement at age 62, two things

are required. First, it is necessary to relax the assumption of a perfectly operating capital market,

which characterizes all but a few structural retirement models.5 Second, it is necessary to allow

for the sharp heterogeneity in time preference which underlies the saving data, where many have

either a very low or a very high time preference rate. Without allowing for this distinction in

time preference, which our model estimates from saving data, it is not possible to explain both

the peaks in retirements, at ages 62 and 65. Nor can one explain the failure of some to respond

to the enhancements of actuarial incentives in social security such as those we analyze in this

paper.

                       IV. A Structural Model of Retirement and Saving

         The model that we will use to simulate the effects of the Commission plans on retirement

and saving has been previously used in Gustman and Steinmeier (2002b) to estimate the effects

of raising the social security early entitlement age. Here we will sketch the nature of the model

so that readers can gain some idea of the framework of the analysis, but we refer readers back to

the earlier paper for a more detailed discussion of the model and its estimation.

         The individual is assumed to maximize a utility function of consumption and leisure over


         4
         One can use a simple reduced form retirement model to explain the retirement peak at
age 62. All one must do is to choose a high discount rate. However, it then is not possible to
explain the peak in retirements at age 65. More generally, Gustman and Steinmeier (2000/2001)
find that the restrictions implied by a simple life cycle model with single peaked distributions of
time and leisure preferences are violated in reduced form estimates of retirement and wealth
equations. A more complex version of the life cycle model is required to jointly explain
retirement and saving behavior.
         5
          For exceptions, see Rust and Phalen (1997) and French (2002).

In this expression, C is consumption and L is the utility value of leisure. t indexes time over

the individual’s adult life, and D is the time preference rate. m indexes three survival states for

a married individual: both spouses are alive; only the respondent is alive; or only the spouse is

alive. sm,t is the probability that the couple is in the survival state denoted by m at time t.

        The term ht, which is the relative value of leisure at time t, is given by the expression

h t = e X t β + ε . In this version of the model, Xt contains a constant, an age variable, an


indicator of poor health, and the birth year. The age variable presumably has a small positive

coefficient which gradually increases the value of leisure over time and reflects the gradual wear

and tear which makes the rigors of work relatively less attractive with age. As the value of

leisure increases, at some point it surpasses the utility of the consumption that continued work

makes possible, and the individual retires. It is important to note that the effects of age are

gradual, and that unlike many models of retirement, in this model there are no terms in the

preference function which would make retirement suddenly more desirable at specific ages such

as 62 or 65. The parameter , in the expression for ht varies among individuals and reflects the

fact that some individuals give leisure more weight than others. It is presumed to come from a

normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation F,.

        Individuals working more than 30 hours per week and more than 1560 hours per year are



                                                       10
classified as full-time. Those working more than 100 hours per year but less than 25 hours per

week are classified as part-time. Individuals who fall between full-time and part-time or

between part-time and retired are classified on the basis of self reports.

       Leisure takes on a value of 0 for full-time work, 1 for full retirement, and ½ for

partial retirement. The utility value of leisure VL = γ Lγ
                                                      1
                                                               thus takes on a value of 0 for full-


time work, 1 for full retirement and, for partial retirement, Vp (which should take on a value Lp

between 0.5 and 1 for permissible values of (). We assume that each individual gets a random

                                                                             δ Vp
draw of Vp from the relevant part of the exponential distribution k e               .   k is a constant


necessary to normalize the distribution to integrate to unity between 0.5 and 1.6 In order to

reflect that partial retirement becomes relative more common at older ages, we allow this

distribution to shift as the individual ages by specifying that * = *o + *a Age. Thus the entire

distribution of the preferences for partial retirement increases over time, although everyone

maintains their relative position in the distribution.

       These preferences allow for three types of heterogeneity. The time preference parameter

D is treated as a fixed effect whose value makes the wealth implied by the model consistent with

the observable wealth in 1992 for each individual. The other two types of heterogeneity are ,,

the general preference for leisure, and Vp, the relative attractiveness of partial retirement. They

are treated as random unobserved effects within the model, coming from distributions

characterized by F,, *o and *a.


       6
         We initially tried a truncated normal distribution, but the relevant part of the distribution
always was estimated to be in the tail. As a result, we changed to the exponential distribution in
order to minimize the number of parameters being estimated.

                                                  11
        This utility function is maximized subject to the asset constraint

                         At = (1 + r) At-1 + Wt (1 - Lt) + Et + Bt - Ct .



In this equation, At is the level of assets at time t, and r is the real interest rate.

The next term Wt (1 - Lt) is earnings, with the wage rate being either the full-time wage or the

partial retirement real wage rate depending on the choice of Lt. Et is the earnings of the

spouse, including any pension benefits. Bt is the sum of the individual’s own pension benefits

and family social security benefits, both of which may be influenced by the individual’s previous

and current work decisions. Ct is consumption at time t. Note that the pension and social

security amounts are actual benefits, not accruals. This means that social security and pension

wealth are not explicitly calculated but rather are implicitly determined by the fact that the

benefits enter the asset constraint in future periods.

        At starts at zero in the first period, which corresponds to the year the respondent turns

age 25, and is restricted to be non-negative thereafter. Non-negativity of assets prevents

individuals with high time preference rates from borrowing against future wages, pensions, and

social security and consuming a majority of lifetime resources early in life. Rather, such

individuals will in most periods simply consume their available resources and will build up very

few assets with which to finance retirement. Individuals with lower time preferences, on the

other hand, will soon begin saving and will build up a much greater level of assets by the time

they retire.

        The model is estimated for a sample of 2305 married men from the Health and

Retirement Study using observations for the first five waves of the survey, every other year from


                                                  12
1992 through 2000.7 Potential earnings profiles are taken from social security records or, if these

are not available, from the retrospective information in the respondent surveys. Future potential

earnings are projected on the basis of tenure and experience coefficients of earnings regressions.

Pension benefits, conditional on tenure in the job providing the pension, are based on

information in the summary pension descriptions, provided by the employers. Social security

benefits are based on the earnings histories and figured according to the social security rules.

         The sample is limited to married men for two reasons. First, the Health and Retirement

study does not collect much information on former spouses, so it is difficult to estimate the

model for divorced or widowed men, who make up the majority of non-married men in the

sample. Secondly, it seems risky to group men and women together in the same analysis, given

the differences other researchers have found in their retirement behavior. The sample is further

reduced for several data problems. The two most important reasons for deletion, in terms of the

number of observations dropped, are for men who did not seem to be working regularly in the

pre-retirement years and men for whom the survey was not able to collect employer pension

information in the last full-time job. For the former individuals, the concept of retirement is

ambiguous if the individual does not seem to be regularly in the labor force. For the individuals

without pension information, we are potentially lacking some very important information about

retirement incentives, since pensions frequently provide strong inducements to retire at specific

dates.

         The model has 8 parameters to be estimated. These include the consumption parameter

         The Health and Retirement Study is supported principally by a grant from the National
Institute on Aging to the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Additional
support is provided by the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies.

", four elements of $ including the constant and coefficients for age, poor health, and birth

year, two elements of * including a constant and a coefficient of age, and the standard deviation

of retirement preferences given by F,. The model is estimated using the generalized method of

simulated moments.8 This method essentially chooses the parameters so as to minimize the

differences between a set of observed statistics (moments) in the sample and the values of those

statistics that would be implied by the model. In the minimization, the moments are weighted so

as to provide the most precise estimates possible with the data.

       The estimation uses 46 moments, including the fraction of the sample working full time

and the fraction fully retired at various ages. Additional moments are calculated at various ages

for specific groups in the sample, including early and late birth cohorts, high and low lifetime

earners, and those with poor health. Only the retirement and work decisions as of the survey

dates are used in the estimates, thus avoiding the issue of having to interpolate and extrapolate

the exact ages of retirement changes between the surveys.

       The results of the estimation are given in Table 2. All of the estimated parameters are

significant with the exception of the coefficient of the birth cohort variable. Perhaps the most

important parameter in these estimates is $a, the coefficient of the age variable. If this

parameter is relatively high, the value of leisure is increasing rapidly as individuals grow older,

and there is only a limited ability for economic incentives to have much of an effect on the

retirement age. If, on the other hand, the parameter is relatively low, as it is here, economic

incentives such as those contained in social security and pension rules have a much greater scope

to change retirement behavior. Another important statistic in the estimation is the q-statistic. If


       8
        For a description, See Greene (2000).

                                                 14
the model is correct, the q-statistic comes from a P2 distribution with the degrees of freedom

given by the number of moments minus the number of parameters. In the present model, this

translates into a P2 distribution with 38 degrees of freedom (46 moments less 8 parameters),

which has a 95% confidence bound of approximately 53.4. The estimated q-statistic of 46.9 is

well below this bound, indicating that there is nothing in the data that is inconsistent with the

model, at least using these moments.

       The estimation also calculates a value of Di, the time preference rate, for each individual

in the sample. The values of Di are calculated so that for the parameter values given in Table 2,

the assets that are calculated from the model for each individual are equal to the assets (including

financial, real estate, and business assets) actually observed in 1992. The resulting distribution

of D implies a wide variation in the rates of time preference for different individuals. For about

40 percent of the individuals, the time preference rate lies in the range 0-5%, which is roughly

equal to the real interest rate. These individuals tend to have high assets relative to their income

in order to finance their retirement. At the other end of the spectrum, 27 percent have implied

time preference rates of over 50% per year, which usually means that they have accumulated

almost no assets with which to finance retirement. When they retire, their consumption will

effectively be limited to their social security and pension benefits.

                   V. The Simulation Procedure and the Base Simulations

       The simulation procedure is straightforward. For each individual in the sample, 10,000

sets of values for the leisure preference , and the partial retirement utility Vp are drawn. Both

of these values are treated as random effects whose values are drawn from the distributions

characterized by F,, *o and *a. For each combination of the random effects, the utility value of


                                                 15
the model is evaluated for each possible age of leaving the full-time job and each possible age of

retiring fully. The individual is presumed, given the value of , and Vp, to chose the two

retirement dates so as to maximize utility.

       During these evaluations, the actual potential earnings stream for the individual is used,

along with the actual pensions, health status, and other explanatory variables for the individual.

The time preference rate used in the simulations is assumed to be the rate calculated during the

estimation. In other words, the time preference rate is taken as a fixed effect. The fraction of

times that the individual retires at various ages is calculated over the 10,000 simulations for the

individual, and the results for all the individuals in the sample are aggregated to produce sample

frequencies for retirement at various ages. It should be noted that this is also the same procedure

that is used during the estimation to give the simulated moments implied by the model. For this

reason, the estimation procedure may be called the generalized method of simulated moments.

       Figure 1 shows how the retirements simulated for the model compare to the actual

retirements for the sample. More properly, the retirements for the sample should probably be

called pseudo-retirements, since they are the differences between the percent retired from full-

time work at one age and the percent retired from full-time work the year before. Note that the

solid line, which represents the actual retirements from the sample, has a main peak at 62 and a

secondary peak at age 65. These two ages are, coincidentally, the early entitlement age and the

age of normal retirement in the social security system.

       The simulated retirement ages, shown by the dashed line in Figure 1, reproduce these

peaks of retirement activity reasonably well. It is important to emphasize that the model

generates these peaks without introducing age dummies or splines into the utility function which


                                                 16
would induce a peak in retirement activity at these ages. This is in marked contrast to other

models, which generally have had trouble generating both peaks without using age dummies in

the utility function. The peak at age 65 is in response to the reduced actuarial adjustments as

individuals reach the normal retirement age and become subject to the delayed retirement credit

rather than the more actuarially generous early retirement penalty. For the peak at age 62, the

first thing that is likely to come to mind is that individuals with high time preference rates and no

savings need to wait until this age in order to have enough resources to support retirement, and to

some extent this is true. However, this argument is somewhat muted by the fact that many such

individuals have working spouses and/or pensions that could provide some support even if the

individual retires before 62. A perhaps more universal explanation is that for individuals with a

high discount rate, the fact that benefits must be given up in order to continue working looks like

a tax on earnings, and retirement may occur disproportionately after a reduction in net

compensation.

       Figure 2 indicates the percent who are retired from full-time work and the percent who

are completely retired by age. This figure provides a reference point for interpreting the results

in the next section. For instance, suppose that a particular policy were to increase the percent

retired from full-time jobs at age 64 by 3 percentage points. The percent still working at full-

time jobs at age 64 is only about 35 percent, so such a policy would reduce the number of

individuals working at age 64 by almost 10 percent (3 percentage points vs. 35 percentage

points). One point from this diagram is that half of retirements from full-time work occur

between ages 58 and 65, so this is the age range whose retirement is most likely to be affected by

any changes in social security. A second point is that partial retirement steadily increases with


                                                 17
age, especially when compared to full-time workers. At age 58, the group of partially retired

workers is only about 10 percent as large as the pool of full-time workers, but by age 67 it

exceeds the number of full-time workers by 40 percent.

       Since many of the most significant aspects of the Commission’s proposals will take effect

many years in the future, we would like to examine the effects of these changes, holding other

factors constant. To do this, we in effect move the Health and Retirement Study cohorts into the

future and do the simulations on these transplanted cohorts. For instance, consider the situation

in the years around 2050. Compared to the median cohort in the HRS, which turned 62 in 1998,

the cohort that turns 62 in 2050 would have an additional 52 years of real wage growth.

Therefore, our procedure is to take all the real earnings and pension amounts of the individuals

in the HRS and to increase them by 52 years’ worth of real wage growth, assumed to be 1

percent per year.9 Dates such as the year of birth are also set ahead by 52 years.10

       Figure 3 indicates the results of these simulations. As a result of rising real wages, at age

62 retirement from full-time work would grow by over 2 percentage points by 2025, about 5

percentage points by 2050, and by over 8 percentage points by 2075, which is near the last year

of the current social security projections. This means that the fraction of individuals working

       10
          Note that we do not model other demographic changes that would characterize future
compared to current cohorts. Nor are other economic changes modeled. This implicitly assumes
that the structure of pensions relative to wages would remain the same, and similarly for the
distribution of jobs and distribution of spouse employment. By holding these other factors
constant, we isolate the effects only of changes in the level of benefits, or of other features of the
benefit structure proposed by the President’s Commission. We do, however, assume that future
cohorts will have lower mortality, consistent with the actuarial assumptions used by the Social
Security Administration.

                                                 18
full-time at age 62 would shrink by almost 15 percent by the end of this period. Note that this

increase in retirement is not coming from the cohort coefficient in the estimated utility function.

In fact the estimated coefficient is negative, which would go in the wrong direction, although the

magnitude of this coefficient is very small. Rather, the increase in retirement appears to be due

to the rising real incomes, which by 2075 would have more than doubled. Though substantial,

this increase in retirement does not seem to be unreasonably large. As a comparison, Costa

(1998; Appendix Table 2A) finds that the labor force participation rate of men age 55 to 64 fell

from 91.1 percent in 1910 to 67.0 percent in 1990.

       The same pattern, though on a slightly reduced scale, appears for retirement at age 60.

At ages 65 and 67, however, the pattern is considerably different, thanks in large part to changes

in the social security rules that have already been legislated and are included in the simulations.

At age 65, the cohorts in the HRS are generally subject to the delayed retirement credit, which

for them is actuarially unfair and discourages work. By 2025, the normal retirement age will

have increased to age 67, so that individuals at age 65 will be subject to the early retirement

reduction, which is actuarially more fair and would encourage more work. This means that in

2025, full time work at age 65 should increase despite the higher lifetime incomes. After 2025,

however, retirement gradually increases by about 5 percentage points between 2025 and 2075,

which is about the same amount as at age 62. For individuals at age 67, a similar pattern

emerges. This age group is always after the normal retirement age, even in 2025. However, the

abolition of the earnings test after normal retirement age means that at that time the current

disincentives to work will be gone. The simulations suggest that the resulting increase in work

should approximately offset the increases in retirement arising from the higher lifetime income


                                                 19
levels. Again, after 2025 the increasing incomes result in a gradual increase in retirement from

full time work.

                        VI. Simulations of the Commission’s Proposals

       In this section we will look at the retirement effects on married males of the various

elements in the two major proposals of the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social

Security. The elements we will look at are those listed in Table 1, including the personal

accounts, changes in the overall level of benefits, changes in the actuarial adjustments, special

adjustments for low wage workers, changes in the calculations of survivor benefits, and

reductions in the marginal replacement rate for those in the highest income bracket of the

primary insurance amount formula.

       The most visible aspect of the proposals is to establish the personal accounts. The

contributions to the accounts are relatively clear. Under model 2, individuals would contribute

4% of covered earnings up to $1,000, while under model 3, they would contribute 2.5%. These

amounts would be carved out of the existing social security taxes. Model 3 would require an

additional 1% contribution, without any dollar limits, beyond existing taxes. Under these rules,

contributions would stop at earnings of $20,000 because of the cap, and beyond about $28,000

contributions to model 3 would be higher. Overall, total contributions to model 3 would be

expected to be higher, primarily because the additional 1% contributions do not have a cap. The

fact that model 3 has a higher interest rate on the offset account, 2.5% vs. 2%, to some extent

offsets the higher overall contribution rate in model 3.

       The procedure to withdraw funds from the personal accounts, however, is not very clear.

The actuary assumes that withdrawals are converted to a joint and two-thirds variable annuity


                                                 20
when the individual retires. The problem, however, is retirement is not a very well defined

concept. It is elusive enough, in fact, that the current (or traditional) system does not use the

concept. Instead it relies on the earnings test. If an individual eligible for benefits is found

working and earning more than a certain amount, the benefits are reduced $1 for every $2 in

benefits beyond the earnings test amount, until benefits are exhausted. The lost benefits are later

restored in a more or less actuarially fair manner, but this may be overlooked by an individual

with a relatively high time preference rate. Given the elusiveness of the concept of retirement, it

is not completely clear exactly how the withdrawal of funds from the personal accounts will be

implemented.

       In this paper, we will look at two possibilities. One possibility essentially mimics the

earnings test. It assumes that once an individual reaches age 62, the account is converted to a

joint and two thirds variable annuity. This annuity amount is added to the traditional benefit, and

the combined benefit is subjected to the earnings test. For every $2 that the benefits are above

the earnings test amount, $1 in benefits is lost. The lost benefits are allocated to traditional

benefits and the annuity proportional to the full amount of each type of benefit. For the part of

the traditional benefits that are lost, the usual rules for early reduction factors apply. For the part

of the annuity that is lost, that amount is converted to an annuity the next year and added to the

original annuity. For example, suppose that the annuity at age 62 is $5,000, and half of it is lost.

The lost 2,500 is converted to an annuity at age 63, with an annual amount of perhaps $125.

This would mean that the total annuity at age 63 would be the original $5,000 plus $125, or

$5,125. The other possibility we will look at in terms of the withdrawals from the personal

accounts is that individuals can convert the balances to a joint and two-thirds variable annuity,


                                                  21
and the earnings test does not apply.

          In both cases, we assume that the personal accounts grow at a 4.6% real return, which the

social security actuaries calculate is the average return of a portfolio of 50% stock and 50%

bonds. Figure 4 indicates the effects of the personal annuities on retirement at age 62. In each

case, it is assumed that personal annuities are available for the entire working lives of

individuals, which is a slight overstatement for individuals reaching age 62 in 2025. In each

group, the first two bars reflect the retirement effects of the models 2 and 3, assuming that the

joint benefits will be subject to the earnings test. The last two bars in each group assume that

only the traditional benefits are subject to the earnings test. In both cases, the personal benefits

have a somewhat greater effect in model 3, probably because the amounts are higher. Also, the

effects are slightly higher when the earnings test is applied only to the traditional benefits.

Overall, it appears that the personal accounts of the size that the Commission contemplates

would raise the percentage of 62-year olds who are retired by between 1.5 and 2.5 percentage

points.

          Other than the personal accounts, one of the strongest changes in the proposals is to

reduce the overall level of traditional benefits relative to the benefits provided under the current

formula. Figure 5 provides the results of simulations examining the effects of this change. In

addition to the changes in the two proposals, the figure also simulates changes to the legislated

benefits which would occur were there no other changes in the current system, so that benefits

would be lowered to match revenues when the trust fund is exhausted. These are labeled as

feasible benefits.

          For each year in the figure, the left bar analyzes the effect that would occur if benefits are


                                                   22
limited to the feasible amount under current law. Benefits would hardly be affected in 2025,

since under current projections the system would still be solvent and able to pay benefits under

the current formula. Between 2025 and 2050, however, the trust fund would be exhausted, and

only about three-quarters of the currently legislated benefits could be paid. By 2075, the

percentage of benefits that could be paid is expected to drop further to about two-thirds. The

reductions in benefits make retirement less attractive, particularly for individuals with high time

preference rates. The effective reduction in compensation at age 62 from reducing benefits is

decreased for these individuals, reducing incentives to retire. By 2075 the effect of benefit level

changes on the percent retired amounts to over 4 percentage points at age 62, which means the

full-time work by 62 year-olds would increase almost 10 percent relative to what it would

otherwise be.

       The second bar in each group of figures looks at the effect of holding the overall level of

benefits constant in real terms, which is the proposal in the Commission’s reform model 2. Note

that although benefits are constant in real terms, they are a shrinking fraction of real wages. As a

result, by 2075 the replacement rate of traditional social security benefits would be less than half

of the current levels. The retirement effect would grow steadily over time until, by 2075, it

would reduce retirement from full-time jobs by around 7 percentage points, which amounts to an

increase in full-time workers of around 19 percent compared to current law, or about 2.5

percentage points compared to the feasible alternative. The third bar in each group examines

indexing benefits to life expectancy, which is projected to allow real benefits to grow by about

half the rate that would occur under the current formula. This is the proposal in the

Commission’s reform model 3. Not surprisingly, the effects are roughly half of the effects of the


                                                 23
proposal to hold real benefits constant. Perhaps more surprisingly, the effects are roughly

comparable to allowing social security to run its course and, when the trust fund runs out, to pay

benefits proportional to the revenues of the system year-by-year.

       The information in Figure 5 pertains to retirement from full-time work at age 62. The

effects at other ages are much as would be expected. Below age 62, before social security

benefits are available, the effects of these changes are much reduced, though not completely

trivial. After 62, the effects continue at very gradually diminishing levels as a percentage of

individuals at those ages. The diminution of the effects for older workers is undoubtedly due to

the fact that more and more of them are already retired and beyond the margin of considering

whether to delay retirement. Relative to the number of individuals still in full-time jobs,

however, the effects at age 65 are greater than those at age 62. For instance, for those age 62, the

inflation indexing proposal would increase full time work in 2075 from 37.1 percent of the

cohort to 44.1 percent, an increase of 7.0 percentage points, or 19 percent of the individuals still

working. At age 65, the corresponding percentages are 22.5 percent and 27.9 percent, which is

an increase of 5.4 percentage points but 24 percent of those still working in full-time jobs. The

net implication of these results is that these changes in the overall benefit levels would be

expected to have a substantial effect at all ages after social security benefits are available.

       Similar results are obtained when we examine the effects of the various indexing schemes

on full retirement at age 62 (not shown). The magnitudes and patterns evident in Figure 5 are

reproduced with only small variation. This means that the changes in the overall level of

benefits is not merely shifting individuals from partial retirement to full-time work. Rather, they

are having the similar effects on both full-time work and work of any kind, with the implication


                                                  24
that the number of individuals in part-time work is not tremendously affected.

       Figure 6 looks at the proposal to increase the penalties for early retirement. By reducing

the benefit at the early retirement age and increasing the reward to continued work through

normal retirement, incentives to work increase from the early retirement age until the normal

retirement age. The retirement effects after normal retirement age are more complex. The

model is designed so that the increase the financial rewards for continued work past the normal

retirement age depends on benefit claiming, a financial decision, but not on labor market

activity. Because the earnings test has been abolished for those over the normal retirement age,

those with a high time preference rate will no longer face an opportunity cost of not claiming

benefits when deciding how long to work past normal retirement age. They simply can claim

benefits as soon as they reach normal retirement age, and make their employment decision

independently.11 These proposals are part of the Commission’s reform model 3, but are not part

of reform model 2. They were included explicitly to provide incentives for individuals to work

longer, which presumably helps the financial situation of the trust fund. The figure considers the

effects of these provisions for various ages at various points in time. Although the changes do

not apply to the cohorts of the Health and Retirement Study, who would have by and large

already retired by the time these proposals would take effect, the first bar of each group indicates

what would have happened had they been subject to these adjustments.

       Figure 6 shows substantial effects for these changes, particularly for those 65 years old.

The changes are measured as percentage points of the number of individuals at the given age.



       11
         The model assumes that anyone who is retired, or that those who are beyond the normal
retirement age, will claim their benefits immediately.

                                                25
The percentage changes in those working full-time is considerably larger than the percentage

point changes. For instance, the 3.4 percentage point increase in full-time work for 65 year olds

in 2075 represents a 15 percent increase in the number of 65 year olds working full-time in that

year. The changes are in the desired direction and not inconsequential. The change for the

current cohorts at age 65 is the largest in magnitude, probably because 65 was the normal

retirement age for those cohorts, and delayed retirement credits averaging around 6 percent was

relatively low. A similar situation obtains for the current cohorts at age 67. Future cohorts

would just have reached the normal retirement age at 67, so the effects at that age for those

cohorts would be much lower.

       Just focusing on future cohorts, however, the effects at age 62 and 65 are still

considerable. Between three and four percentage points of the entire cohort would be added to

the full-time employment rolls at these two ages, and at the ages in between as well. There is

some tendency for the effect to decline for the later cohorts, particularly at age 65. This is

probably due to the fact that the number of individuals in full-time work at that age will be

gradually diminishing, as indicated in Figure 3.

       Figure 7 turns attention to the Commission’s proposals to offset the effects of the

proposed changes on the lowest earners. The Commission’s proposals in their reform model 2

differ somewhat from the proposals in reform model 3. Both reform models focus on longer-

term workers and do not propose any changes for workers with less than 20 years of coverage.

The changes for workers with between 20 and 30 years of coverage are phased in. The provision

would boost benefits by 40 percent for minimum wage workers with 30 years of coverage under

reform model 2, and by 12 percent under reform model 3. For workers with more than 30 years


                                                   26
experience and/or less than the minimum wage, the percentage could be higher than 12 percent

in reform model 3, but not above 40 percent in reform model 2. In these calculations, the

minimum wage is presumed to grow at roughly the same rate as overall wages.

       Figure 7 suggests that the effects of either of these provisions on overall full-time work

effort would be considerably lower than for either of the other two changes that have been

considered. The proposals would increase retirement, presumably because they would make

retirement more affordable for low wage workers, and the higher benefits would also increase

the penalty for continued work for those with high time preference rates. Nevertheless, neither

of these proposals would change retirement at age 62 by more than a percentage point of the

cohort size, considerably less than the several percentage point change for the previous

proposals. The effect of the proposal in reform model 2 is somewhat greater than that for reform

model 3, reflective of the fact that the benefit increases are larger in reform model 2.

       Figure 8 looks at the effects of the low wage provisions on the group of respondents who

would be affected by the provisions. Among this group, the retirement effects are considerably

larger for reform model 2, reaching an increase of almost 3 percentage points in the number of

such individuals retired from full-time work. A primary reason for the larger increase in the

effect among the affected workers in reform model 2 is that the percentage of affected workers is

considerably less under reform model 2 than under reform model 3. The increased benefits for

low wage workers under reform model 2 phase out at twice the minimum wage, and only about

18.8 percent of the sample is under this limit in the HRS. The increased benefits under reform

model 3 phase out at the average earnings amount, which means that a considerably larger

percentage (38.4 percent) of the sample is affected. The smaller percentage under reform model


                                                 27
2 means that the dilution of the effect in the overall sample averages is greater than for reform

model 3.

       The next figure looks at the retirement effect of increasing the survivor benefit to 75

percent of the amount that the couple would have received had both spouses survived. This

benefit increase is limited to the average primary insurance amount of all worker beneficiaries in

the previous year, reduced appropriately if the worker started taking any benefits before the

normal retirement age. Possibly because its effects are not felt until around 20 years after

retirement, the changes in the retirement probabilities are much smaller for this element of the

proposals than they have been for the previous elements. For the overall population, the

increases in retirement from full-time work at age 62 would be less than 0.3 percent for the

current generation, and around 0.1 percent for the generations approaching retirement around

2025 and afterward. Since around a third of the respondents are eligible for this benefit, the

increases for those affected are roughly three times as large. The larger effect for the current

generation relative to future generations appears connected to the fact that the future generations

will be subject to a later normal retirement age than was the case for the original HRS

generation. In any case, retirement effect of increasing survivor benefits appears to be quite

modest, especially when compared to the other changes being considered.

       The final figure examines the effects of lowering the top bracket in the PIA formula to 10

percent from its current level of 15 percent. The effects of this proposal are again fairly modest,

although the effects in this case are roughly the same regardless of which generation is

considered. For all generations, the proposal would increase retirement from full-time work at

age 62 by about a quarter of a percentage point. Since not quite two-fifths of the sample would


                                                 28
be affected by this change, the effects on the part of the sample affected by the change are about

two and a half times the effect on the entire sample.

       The relatively small size of changing the upper range of the PIA formula probably results

from the relatively small size of the benefit changes which would occur as a consequence. In

2000, the upper bend of the PIA formula occurred at $1,332. Looking at men who started

claiming benefits in that year, approximately 38 percent of them had PIA’s above this amount.12

The median PIA of those whose AIME was over the upper bend point appears to be between

$1,450 and $1,500 per month. Reducing the percentage applicable above the upper bend point

from 15 percent to 10 percent would lower benefits by around $50, or about 3 percent. Thus,

benefits calculated for earnings above the upper bend point constitute only a small fraction of

total benefits even for individuals above the upper bend point. As a result, it is not surprising

that this change would have only a relatively small effect on retirement.

       In all of these exercises, we have not considered the retirement impact of the changes in

taxes that would necessary to finance them. According to the Actuaries’ Supplement, these costs

would range from 2.07 percent of the long-term taxable payroll for the proposal to index benefits

to inflation to 0.08 percent of the long-term taxable payroll for the proposals to increase benefits

for lower-income surviving spouses. From the participants’ point of view, the tax changes

would mainly be a wealth effect, much like the general increase in earnings over time. From the

base simulations, we saw that increasing general incomes by over 100 percent would affect

retirement at age 62 by only about 7 percentage points. Thus, the retirement effects of the taxes

          Annual Statistical Supplement, 2001, Table 6.B4. This figure approximately agrees
with the percentage calculated from the HRS.

                                                 29
necessary to finance these changes would be tiny, implying that the changes we are finding arise

from the changes in retirement incentives. As an example, it is clear that the present system is

largely responsible for the retirement peaks at ages 62 and 65. If a proposal such as inflation

indexing benefits were to cut traditional benefits by a half over 75 years, the incentives to retire

at these ages would also be reduced by a corresponding amount.

       In summary, some of the elements of the Commission’s proposals would have large

consequences for retirement, and others would have only minor consequences. Table 3 indicates

the effects of the various elements of the proposals for the retirement from full-time work for a

62 year old individual around 2075. The first line corresponds to the trend toward earlier

retirement that would occur if no changes were made. The remaining lines summarize the

effects of the various elements of the proposals, some positive and some negative. The first

column corresponds to Model 2 of the commission, and the second column corresponds to

Model 3.

       In both sets of proposals, the net effect of the proposals is to reduce retirement at age 62

by about 4 percentage points. Thus, these proposals will offset about half of the trend toward

earlier retirement that overall rising incomes is likely to engender over the next 75 years. In

Model 2, the most powerful effect by far is the change to inflation indexing of benefits. This

effect alone would reduce retirement by 7 percentage points. In Model 3, an effect of the same

magnitude is split between the more moderate longevity indexing (4 percentage points) and the

increases in the actuarial rewards to continued work (3.2 percentage points). Note that Model 2

does not include the changes in the actuarial rewards. The personal accounts offset these effects

to a limited extent, about 1.5 to 2.5 percentage points. The other elements of the proposals,


                                                 30
including increasing benefits for low-wage workers, reducing benefits to high-wage workers,

and increasing survivor benefits for workers below the median wage, would produce only very

modest changes in retirement behavior.

                                         VII. Conclusions

       The model used in this paper has proven adept at explaining current patterns of

retirement behavior. By including heterogeneous time preferences and heterogenous retirement

preferences, the model is able to capture the peaks in retirement behavior at age 62 and age 65

without incorporating discontinuities in preferences which would make individuals want to retire

preferentially at those ages. The model is also able to approximate the rest of the retirement

distribution fairly accurately, and to include the non-trivial number of individuals who go

through a phase of partial retirement as well. In short, the model contains the essential elements

that permit it to analyze the effects on retirement of various potential changes which would alter

individuals’ incentives to retire, including potential changes in the social security system.

       Changes in social security are very nearly a certainty, given the approaching retirement

of the baby boom. The proposals of the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security

are a prominent example of the potential changes that can be considered. The effects of these

proposals on the benefits of various groups and on the financial solvency of the system have

been carefully examined by the actuarial office of the system, but the potential retirement effects

of these proposals have been less well examined. The analysis presented in this paper suggests

that these effects may be substantial. Over the next 75 years, the trend toward less work and

earlier retirement, which has recently been interrupted, should continue as rising incomes induce

individuals to take a larger percentage of their potential wages as leisure. A couple of the


                                                 31
Commission’s proposals contain features which would work the other way, and would provide

individuals with incentives to delay their retirement substantially. The overall effect could offset

almost half the trend toward earlier retirement that would otherwise occur.
