            Profitability, Employment and Structural Adjustment in France


                                      ABSTRACT


     In this paper, we present a dynamic model which explains output, enployment

and energy consumption in the French manufacturing sector in terms of the expected

and actual path of wage rates and energy prices in units of output. The model

has two distinguishing features: First, the rate of capacity utilization is

determined explicitly from profit—maximizing behavior and it is viewed as the

crucial adjusting variable in the short run. Second, we assume complete lack of

substitutability between capital, labor and energy inputs ex post.

     The model is motivated by a brief discussion of French growth, focusing on

the decline of profitability and employment in manufacturing, and simulated using

annual data from 1950 to 1979. The wage explosion and the energy shock of the

early seventies are interpreted (in a model allowing for overhead labor) in terms

of changes in expected real factor prices,and their effects on the utilization

and the profitability of each vintage are quantified. Aggregating over vintages,

the model generates the observed decline in profitability and utilization of

existing capacity.

     The results of the simulation are very encouraging, and a simultaneous

estimation of the model under static expectations is rejected by the data. There

are two limitations of the analysis which will be relaxed in further work. Invest-

ment is exogenous and open—economy aspects only appear indirectly, say via

constraints on the energy price and the price of output.

INTRODUCT ION

     In this paper, we present a dynamic model which explains output, employment

and energy consumption in the French manufacturing sector in terms of the expected

and actual path of wage rates and energy prices in units of output. The model

has two distinguishing features: First, the rate of capacity utilization is

determined explicitly from profit—maximizing behavior and it is viewed as the

crucial adjusting variable in the short run. Second, we assume complete lack of

substitutability between capital, labor and energy inputs ex post.

    Accordingly, adjustment to changes in relative factor prices occurs only

slowly over time, as the existing capital stock is replaced by new capital and

by production techniques consistent with the new pattern of relative factor prices.

The putty—clay structure of production implies that profitability of new capital,

as measured, for example, by Tobin's q, can behave quite differently from the

profitability of old capital, a point often emphasized in recent discussions

about investment behavior. A further important implication of the putty-clay

assumption is that an abrupt increase in production costs may cause a discrete

reduction in the productive capacity, because old capacity can no longer be

profitably operated.

    The paper is organized as follows. Section I motivates the model by a brief

discussion of French growth, focusing on the decline of profitability and

employment in manufacturing. The basic model is developed in Section II and

compared with the standard putty—putty model. We show that only in the stationary

equilibrium can we represent the relationship between output and factor inputs

in terms of a standard production function. We contrast this solution with the

one obtained when relative factor prices are not expected to change as well as

with the general case where factor prices are expected to change at different

rates.

    Assuming a fixed planned lifetime of each vintage, industry — wide output,

employment and energy demand are derived. The model, modified to allow for

overhead labor, is estimated and simulated using data on French manufac-

turing from 1950 to 1979 in Section III. The effects of changes in expected

real factor prices on the factor proportions of new plants are quantified as

well as the optimal rate of utilization and the profitability of each vintage.

When utilization and profitability are aggregated across vintages, their recent

decline is consistent with the decline in profitability and employment emphasized

in Section I. Extensions of the analysis are pointed out in the conclusion.


I   STYLIZED FACTS

    The International Scene


    The decade of the 1970's was a watershed in the economic development of the

old industrial countries. The erosion of monetary stability from the late 1960's,

the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, the first oil

shock, and the unprecedented increase in the prices of other raw materials in

1973/74 brought an end to a quarter of a century of high and stable growth at

full employment. The past ten years have been characterized by slow growth, high

unemployment, monetary instability, and inflation that is only now showing signs

of deceleration. Most importantly, the past decade has also brought to the surface

underlying long term tendencies of structural change in the world economy, caused

by demographic and technological changes, the competitive challenge of Japan and

of the newly industrialized countries, and the increase in the real cost of energy.

    These developments in the global economy have affected Europe with particular

severity.   Indeed, it had not really recovered from the global recession of 1974/

75 when the second oil shock and the 'dollar shock' of 1981/82 brought about the

recession in the midst of which we still are. The average rate of growth of the

European countries from 1973 to 1980 was only 1.6 per cent in comparison with an

average growth rate of 4.6 per cent in the previous decade. The performance of

the European countries after the 1974/75 recession contrasts with that of the
                                         3

 United States. The 1974/75 recession was more severe in the United States than it

 was in Europe, but from the second half of 1975 the United States experienced a

 strong and sustained boom supported by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.

 Although Europe, too, recovered from the recession in 1976 supported by fiscal

 stimulus and inventory build—up, the recovery was halted and growth remained slow

 through the 1970's, as macroeconomic policies, particularly in Germany and France,

 continued to emphasize disinflation.

    The differences in strategies of economic policy adopted by the United States

on the one hand and Germany on the other, contributed to the depreciation of the

US dollar, culminating in the 'dollar crisis' of October 1978. The depreciation

of the dollar, viewed with alarm by the European goverments,helped the slowing down

of inflation in Europe while it also led to a deterioration in the price and cost

competitiveness and a decline in the profitability of European manufacturing.

    As the boom of 1975/78 came to an end in the United States and macroeconomic

policies became more concerned with inflation, the dollar stabilized and in 1979

Europe showed clear signs of recovery while inflation was still decelerating.i/

The incipient recovery was, however, soon brought to an end first by the second

oil shock and then by the impact of the restrictive monetary policy adopted by the

United States. As a result of slow growth and structural changes, unemployment has

become a serious problem in all European countries. Indeed, the average unemployment

rate of the EEC countries has increased every year since 1973, from 3 per cent in

1973 to 8 per cent in 1981, and it is still increasing.

    A further important aspect of the experience of the European economies in the

past ten years is the increase in government expenditure relative to GNP. The

average share of total government outlays in GNP in the European countries increased

from 36.5 per cent in 1970 to 45 per cent in 1978 —   the   last year for which we have

data available. Although the tax burden increased in all countries, the increase

in tax revenue has been insufficient to keep up with the growth of government

expenditure. As a result, a structural deficit has emerged in the government

budget in most European countries.

    The French Experience

    Until the Mitterand government, whose policies we do not plan to discuss in

this paper, the performance of the French economy has followed the general pattern

of the European countries, particularly that of Germany. From 1973 to 1981, the

rate of growth of GDP was only 2.6 per cent, whereas it had been 5.4 per cent in the

period 1949-73 2/. Like Germany and other European countries, France experienced

an aborted recovery in 1976. Decline of growth in manufacturing has been even

more abrupt: from 5.8 per cent in the post war period to only 1.7 per cent from

1973 to 1981. Behind this average decline are significant changes in the compo-

sition of industrial production. Thus, from, 1975 to 1980, the motor vehicle

and transportation industry increased at an annual rate close to 19% p.a. and

machinery and equipment goods increased at 14% p.a. while consumer goods, inter-

mediate goods and consumer durables increased only at about 10% p.a. at current

prices. 3/

    Our focus is on the role of factor prices in explaining the aggregate decline

in manufacturing, but it should be mentioned that this structural change was in

large part engineered by the State. Briefly, industrial policy measures under

the so—called Barre Plan consisted of sustaining heavy manufacturing (nuclear

power, telecommunications and steel), encouraging high technology exports

(armament, aerospace, heavy engineering and food processing) 4/ and managing an

orderly contraction in traditional exports (textiles, shoes, handbags, clothing

and watches). 5/

    Because of slow growth and demographic developments that caused a substantial

increase in labour supply, especially of women and young people, unemployment

became a particularly serious problem in France in the 1970's. The rate of

unemployment increased from 2.6 per cent in 1973 to close to 8 per cent in 1981.

   High and increasing unemployment has however contributed little to the

moderation of inflation. In terms of consumer prices, inflation has remained

stubbornly above 9 per cent, averaging 10 per cent for the 1973—81 period.
                                        5




Unlike in many other countries during this period, consumer prices rose faster

than wholesale prices, which averaged 7.9 per cent for the same period.

    Although French inflation has been higher than that of her major trading

partners, 6/ there has been little change in the price and cost competitiveness

of French industry from the early 1970's to l98l because of the depreciation of

the French franc, and higher than average productivity increase. 7/

    As in all European countries, there has however been a substantial erosion

of profitability in the manufacturing sector. According to Table 1, the share

of the operating surplus in total manufacting output declined from an average

of 13 per cent in period 1963—73 to an average of 9 per cent in the period

1974—79. This decline was largely the result of an increase in the share of

total labour compensation from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. Despite the sharp

increase in the cost of energy, its share in gross output remained around

6 per cent because of a substantial reduction in the energy intensity of manu-

facturing production. The same occured with other intermediate inputs, whose

price did not however change substantially relative to the price of gross output.

Figure 1 further illustrates the erosion of profitability in the manufacturing

sector and suggests that this development started already before the first oil

shock. A similar pattern can be found for other European countries,

and it reflects the much discussed wage explosion of the late 1960's and the

early 1970's.B/

    Table 2 summarizes the evolution of the basic prices and quantities relevant

to the manufacturing sector. Panel A, column (3) shows that the average rate

of increase of the product wage was close to 6% throughout the period, while

the real price of energy, which was constant from 1959 to 1973, increased

to about 6% in the following period. This was substantially in excess of the

"warranted" rates of increase implied by measured factor productivity growth,

obtained from Panel B as 4% p.a. and 2% p.a. respectively. 9/ The coverse

was true —   particularly   for energy —   in   the period 1959—73. Column (1) of

Panel B shows that the rate of growth of output declined from 6.6% to 2.5%,

while labor input, which had been constant in the period 1959—73, declined at

a rate of 1.6% p.a. in 1974-79. While this is one of the crucial facts behind

the French unemployment problem, it was in part due to the reduction in the

length of the work week 10/. As mentioned, the increase in the real price of

energy kept its use by the manufacturing sector constant in 1974—79, after an

increase of over 3% p.a. in 1959—73 (column 2 of Panel B).

    Using consistent figures on gross (net) capital stock and gross investment in

manufacturing from SLN, 11/ we obtain annual growth rates of 5.5% (6.6%) and 8% per

annum respectively over 1959—73 and a drop to 4.7 (3.9) and —2.2% in 1974—79.

Similarily, survey data on capacity utilization show a drop from 84.3% for 1959—73 to

83% in 1974—79. Using variables constructed in Section III below, and reported

in column (4) and (5), we see that corresponding to a drop in the rate of growth of

net capital from 7% to 4%, our measure of average optimal capital utiliza-

tion would have dropped from 74% to             72%. This is consistent with the

excess of observed over warranted factor price growth and is, of course, the

counterpart of the decline in profitability discussed above.

II THE MODEL

    We view the manufacturing sector as a collection of plants of differing

characteristics in terms of their production capacity, and labor and energy

requirements. These three crucial features are chosen at the time a plant is

built and define its vintage. We do not allow any flexibility in the choice of

the production technique pç nor do we allow any retrofitting of old plants,

although such possibilities are obviously a relevant consideration. A crucial

aspect of the actual behavior of firms is, in our view, the adjusting role of the

utilization of capacity. In other putty—clay models, changes in utilization

are, if anything, an afterthought. 12/

    Our emphasis in this section is on the specification of a plant of a given

vintage. Unlike standard vintage models of growth, this turns out to be the

crucial building block of the model. 13/                   Because we take investment as

exogenous and focus on the utilization of different vintages, the analysis of

aggregation over plants is left until we deal with the problem of estimating an

industry—wide model in the next section.

The Basic Setup

    When a plant is built, say in period t =                i,   the firm decides on initial invest-

ment, L, on the capacity of the plant and on the (effective) labor and energy

requirements per unit of capacity, which remain fixed for the lifetime of the

plant. A plant is closed down when the present discounted value of profits is

equal to zero.

    The capacity of the plant declines over its lifetime because of physical depre-

ciation, which we assume for convenience to take place at a constant rate, .

Then, in period t,       the   maximum capacity of a plant built in period i, Z, is

given by:
            —i       —                   t—i =    —    I
    (1) Z y1 u I (1 —               S)           yu
   Where y. and U     are      defined subsequently.
                                                      11




Note that the maximum capacity of the plant is determined at the time it is constructed

and cannot be changed thereafter. However, in each period, maximum capacity can

be utilized more or less intensively, so that utilized capacity is given by:


      (2) Z=y.uK
      Where u/u =
                                Z/Z    is the rate of utilization of capacity of plant i on

      period t, relative to maximum capacity.

      We assume that labor and energy inputs vary with the rate of capacity utili-

zation:


      (3) N = a.

      (4)          =       b. u K

      The output of the plant, X, increases with capacity utilization, but at

a diminishing rate. This reflects the fact that, as we approach maximum capacity

utilization, input productivity declines. Capturing this feature by a very simple

parametrization, , we write our output function as:


      (5)          =       y.    (u) K
                       i         i— — 1 i
      Where        (ut) =       ut(u    - u)
Note that maximum output is defined by u = u.

      When the plant is constructed, the firm has to decide on how to allocate its

investment between capacity creation, labor saving and energy saving. For a given

level of investment, the firm can increase labor or energy productivity but at

the cost of a lower level of capacity. This fundamental trade—off is parametrized

as:


      (6)     y.



      Where a+<cl.
                                                  12



    Substituting from (1) through (5) into (6) we can write output as a function

of factor inputs and the utilization rate:


    (7)


    Where c = 1 — a —
                I         il+c —       1   i
    and
           1p(ut) =u
                                (u -
                                       - ut)
Note that, although (6) appears to be very similar to the standard production

function specification, our model impose strong restrictions on the choice of

N, E and u, which eliminate the apparent substitutability between labor, energy and

capital inputs ex post. Note further that it is the variation of capacity utili-

zation which allows one to discriminate between our specification and standard putty—

clay models. The difference between our specification and the standard putty—clay

models, where variable inputs are proportional to output, is also apparent from

equation (7).

    The Maximization Problem

    Given total investment, I., the technology of the plant is chosen so as to

maximize the present discounted value of expected profits. The time horizon of

this optimization problem, T., is endogenously determined. We assume that the firm is

competitive and takes both input and output prices as exogenously given. We measure

factor prices in units of output and denote the product wage prevailing at time

t by w and its expectation by                  where it is understood that expectations are

formed at t =       i,   when the investment decision is made. Similarily, we denote

the actual and expected real price of energy by s and                respectively. A

further simplification is that expected profits are discounted at a constant

rate, r.

    We now maximize the present discounted value of profits per initial investment,

denoted by , subject to the technology constraint in (5).

                              i+l


The optimal rate of utilization is chosen each period according to realized real

factor prices, given a., b., y. and ii.                     Thus, in any period ;, we have:



                      y. '(u) — a.w                          = 0
    (9) —                                        —
                                                     b.st
            ut

    According to (9), the marginal benefit in increased output from an increase is

utilization equals unit variable costs. Solving for the rate of utilization, we

obtain:


    (10) u =           (1 —             -



   Where       =     a./y.u
            b. =
             1       b./y.u
                      1 1

   Thus, given the labor and energy output ratios, . and ., u varies with con-

temporaneous (realized) real factor prices since a•, b. and y. are chosen at the

time the plant is built and remain fixed as long as the plant operates. Given the

lifetime of the plant, they are determined from the following first—order conditions:

   Where g = 1             —       cS/i   +r
    From (11) we see that the shadow cost of capital productivity is always
equal    to the present discounted value of additional output. Substituting from (11)

into (12) and (13), we get:

                             I   t—i =                  I              i'.'    t—i

    Equations (14) and (15) define two hyperbolas in .w., .s.. 14/ There will always

be one intersection in the positive quadrant associated with the optimum solution.

There is, however, no analytical solution in general. In some special cases,

an explicit solution can be obtained. One such case is when the relative

price of the two factors is not expected to change. Then we can aggregate labor
                                                                 = 1 and p =
and energy inputs into a single factor. In (14) and (15),p2 = "2

so that by adding we obtain:


     (16) (.w. +          .s.)2 (l+o) —             2       (.w.   + '.s.) + p (1—cr) = 0


    The negative root of (16) gives minimum variable costs: 15/

    The expression on the right—hand side of (1 ) captures the effect of factor

price variablity on the choice of technology. Using (17) to substitut for

      in (14) and for                  in (15) and solving for                and   ,   we get:

When factor prices are expected to remain constant, p1pl, the square root term

reduces to a, and H=1, so that variable costs are fixed:

                                                          utilization is also constant, and
   In this case, the planned rate of capacity

independent of factor prices. In fact, using (20) in (10), we obtain:


    (21) u =            2o


    Recalling equation (7) above, we see that in this special case the standard

                                                             specification. We can then
production function representation applies to our

interpret a,    and a as the shares of labor, energy and capital costs in output.

   When factor prices vary over the lifetime of the plant, the rate of utiliza—

tion also varies. When the relative price of the two factors is constant, we

can use (18) and (19) to substitute for         .   and      in (10) and we obtain the planned

rate of utilization in period t      as:

    (22) u(1+cY}1f1)

    In   this case, there is no production function representation of technology

which is independent of factor prices. The term in utilization in (7) now

becomes:


                        2+o (l+a — H.v)1            + 0(1+ + H.v1)

    The Life Span of the Plant

    As we have noted, the planned lifetime of the plant depends on the expected

time path of factor prices. The actual lifetime of the plant may of course

be different to the extent that there are expectatiOnal errors In general,
                                            17




the lifetime of a plant is a decreasing function of the rate of increase of

factor prices. This can be seen clearly in the spread case when both factor

prices increase at a constant rate, say p.       In this case, the planned shut—off

date of the plant is given by setting u equal to zero in equation (22) above:


                              =   i+o
    (24) H.(l +

    Where H. depends on p as shown in equation (19) above.

In general, the cut—off point is determined jointly with the technology coeffi-

cients from (8'), (14) and (15).

    Solution for the Plant

    Our model of the plant is completely specified by equations (3), (4), (5),

(6), (8'), (14) and (15). When relative factor prices are not expected to change,

we can use (18) and (19) in (5) to obtain:


    (25)     y.   =   (mi.)       o) (a/w.) (6/s)°
    Where U =     —U
                  1+o

Substituting      for y. in (18) and (19), we have:


    (26) a.           (mj.)h/0    (/w.)° (/s.)°
    (27) b. = (Jfl)1/0 (/w.)0 (/)(la)/o
     Note from (26) and (27) that the choice of technology at time i depends

not only on factor prices prevailing at time i but also on the time profile of

factor prices relative to their initial level. This latter effect, captured by

H., is symmetric because relative factor prices are expected to remain constant.

When factor prices are expected to be constant, the first effect is ruled out

and factor proportions are determined by a weighted average of prices prevailing

at time i.
                                        18


       When a constant (common) growth rate for factor prices, i, is expected,

then an increase in p lowers H1 and therefore increases labor and energy

productivity.

      We now write the solution under static expectations (H. = 1) by substituting

a., b, and y. in (3), (4) and (6), to yield:


      (28)   X=      U
                         °°   (a/w.) (/s.)° [(1 + a)2 -       v2] K

                          1


      In   general, equation (7) above holds and it indicates the relationship between

our model and the standard production function for a plant. Before proceeding with

with the estimations, we discuss the aggregation of plants.



      Aggregation
                                                     consists of a collection of plants
      In any given period the manufacturing sector

with   different labor and energy requirements. Those differences exist because
the   plants have been built in different periods, with old technologies influenced

by past as well as expected current and future factor prices. It is important
                                               different vintages would embody different
to note that, even with perfect foresight,

technologies except in the special case when factor prices are constant. Errors

in expectations add another consideration. If variable costs turn out to be

higher than anticipated, labor and energy productivities of older vintages are
                                                                  and old plants will
smaller than would have been optimal with perfect foresight,

be shut—off sooner than anticipated. This is obviously an important considera-

tion in view of the unanticipated increase in energy cost in the 1970's.
                                         19



    Because of differences between vintages, there is no aggregate production

function in our model. An aggregate production function exists only in the

stationary case of constant expected and actual factor prices.

     A further important cause of differences between vintages is embodied tech—

noligical progress. We can easily capture it by adding shift parameters A. and

B. in equations (3) and (4). We also assume a fixed planned lifetime of T years

for all vintages, after which the plant is scrapped. 16/ We can then write the

aggregate functions as:


                   t
     (31)   X =     Y
                  i=t-T

III SIMULATION
     To implement empirically the aggregate system in (31) through (33), we

make the following simplifying assumptions. We neglect embodied technological

progress (i.e. set A.=B11 above) but allow for labor—augumenting technological

progress. We assume that the manufacturing sector faces the same product

wage and real prices of energy, the same                   and    coefficients and the same maximum

utilization rate u. In fact, we have no way of identifying u, so that it would

be appropriate to interpret the parameter U defined in (28) through (30) as a

scale parameter. But U involves u raised to (i+o)/ and therefore, when esti-

mating c and t3, we have to set u =          1.        Since actual real factor prices are not

subject to choice and affect all vintages indentically, we also treat them as

scale parameters and reinterpret (26) and (27) in terms of a measure of expec—

tational errors defined as the ratio of actual to expected real factor prices, to

yield, under stationary expectations:

                                                                 I°
     (34)     a. =    (l+o)    l/O(awl) (1-)/c
                                                                      w                      s

                      (l+o)   —l/c      I c/o (r i)         (l-c)/o w         -a/a   S
                                                                                         t
     (35)     b. =
               1
                                     (aw )
                                        t        t                        t

     Where         = w Lw.
               t      t  1

              Tit =   st/si

Note that (34) and (35) are applicable when real factor prices are expected to

change at the same rate because H does not depend on                           or 1T. Then, according

to (18) and (19), w. and s. would have to be divided by H..
                                                        1   When relative
                   1      1

factor prices are expected to vary, however, we have to solve (14) and (15),

given a and        and then simulate the model.

     In this Section, we introduce a feature excluded from the model In

Section II for expositional convenience. This is the existence of overhead

labor, which we assume to be proportional to capacity.
                                       21




    To equate the variables in (31) through (33) with observed gross output 17/,

employment and energy demand, we define a scale parameter C. for each of the

three equations,which (since u = 1) reflects the particular units in which the

observed variables are measured as well as embodied technical progress. In

the employment equation, another scale parameter is implicity included in the

coefficient for overhead labor, n:


    (36) x=Cxxt+c;

    (37) N=CNN+nK+c;

    (38) ECEEt+c
                   1
    WhereK =
           t   '
               r

               1   t
    To determine a, f, n and the C's in the system (36) through (38) we use a

full—information maximum likelihood procedure based on K, w and     for each

vintage, then we aggregate over vintages. The estimation is carried out subject

to the inequality constraints:


    (i)    O<cz<l
    (ii)   0 < <1
    (iii) 0 <o<l

     The model is estimated over the period 1950 through 1979 with annual data.
We use a reported (net) capital stock estimate for K, i = 1950, assume that

all vintages prior to 1950 are identical and form K using gross investment in

year t>i, under the assumptions that   = .10 and T = 30 years. 18/ Expectations

are discounted at a rate of 10% p.a., so that g =   .82.
                                       22



    The model is estimated under static expectations, that is to say the case

when a. and b. are related by linear equations (18) and (19) rather than by the

quadratic equation (14) and (15). The model is also simulated for the general

case of equations (14) and (15) but conditional on postulated values for a and

which we take to be close to the ones reported in Table 1 above.19/ The latter

simulation also includes the assumption of a constant growth of the product wage

of 3% p.a. over the whole period, reflecting in part labor—augumenting technical

change, and a constant expected real price of energy. 20! The shocks of the

seventies are then simulated on variants of the dynamic base case.

    Estimation results for the two cases are reported in Table 3. Because of the

different values of a and 13, the estimates are not directly comparable. Also, for

the period 1950—58 the results are less reliabe because of the greater weight of

the arbitrary base value of the capital stock and of changes in the system of national

accounts, which implied a different definition of the manufacturing sector. 21!

As shown in the third panel, the first—order serial correlation of the residuals

is generally very high. Nevertheless, the likely misspecification of the

process of capital accumulation, due to the effect of variations in depre-

ciation rates and in scrappage as a function of changes in expected profita-

bility, might well introduce higher—order auto—regressive errors, which are

not corrected for.        The existence of inequality constraints precludes

explicit significance tests on the parameters a and 13 reported in the first panel

of Table 3. Because of the constraints, there is no guarantee that the error terms

to be orthogonal to the dependent variable. Therefore, the summary statistic

R2 reported in Table 3, second panel, is actually the square of the correla-

tion coefficient between fitted and actual values. This is a good indicator

of the explanatory capabilities of the model.

The scale parameters (and the coefficients of auto-correlation) have an

asymptotically normal distribution: significance tests based thereon are

reported in parentheses below the coefficients in the first panel of Table

3 which, again, are not directly comparable. The overall significance test

of the regression has a 2distribut1on, whose value is reported in the second

panel.
     In the case of static expectations, reported in the first column, the

coefficient on overhead labor has the wrong sign. To interpret the result

that large expectational errors cause     and     to vary considerably. If a and

13 were large, large variations in v would result, the utilization rate will be

driven toward zero and could become negative. Since negative utilization leads

to scrappage of the plant, the maximum likelihood values of a and 13 are likely

to be small when the environment is characterized by large expectational errors.

On the other hand, under static expectations, the standard production function

representation applies so that we expect a and 13 to be close to the shares of

labor and energy in gross output shown in Table 1.     Since the values of a and 13

reported in Table 3 are implausibly low, even taking into account technological

change, (which would justify the assumption of a constant effective wage)

we conclude that static expectations do not capture the behavior of French

manufacturing sector firms during the sample period.

     The second column reports maximum—likelihood estimates of the scale para-

meters conditional upon the choice of a and 13.   Figures 2 through 4 plot the

actual and fitted values for the three equations over the whole sample period

and it is clear that the model can explain a substantial portion of the varia-

tion in output, employment and energy consumption in changes in utilization

rates across vintages and suggests the usefulness of this approach.     The fit is

worse in the fifties, no doubt due to the greater weight of the base period

capital stock. Accordingly, Figure 5 plots index values of a and b1 from 1959 to

1979, with base 1973=100. There is a continuous decline in a. whereas b is almost

flat until the late sixties. Conversely, during most of the 1974—1979 period, b.

declines more than a.. A similar pattern would obtain under static expectations,

in part because we took a fairly high rate of depreciation and discount. Neverthe-

less, because of the expectation of a 3% increase in wages in the dynamic simula-

tion, the values of a. and b. are uniformly lower than under static expectations.


     Changes in Factor Price Expectations

    In general, when there are changes in expected factor prices, there will be

3r:setting changes in the factor proportions of new vintages and in the utili-

zation rate of old vintages. Specifically, differences in a., b. and u. across

vintages derive from differences in c, 3 and , as well as in      and     To reflect

the shocks of the seventies documented in tables 1 and 2, suppose that in 197L

expectations of factor prices change. If product wages are expected to grow at

5 rather than 3% p.a., there will be a decline of 12.5% in a. and a decline of

% in b. relative to the base dynamic case we have been discussing. Conversely

if the real price of energy is expected to increase at 3% p.a., so that the two

rates are the same, there will be animmediate decline of 14% in b. and a decline

of 1% in a.. Suppose now that both factor price expectations change, so that wages

are expected to grow at 5% and energy prices are expected to grow at 3% p.a. Then

the decline for a. is 13% and for b. it is 17%. In all these examples, we observe

negative cross—effects.

     The implications of changes in factor price expectations on the utilization

of the various vintages suggest that newer vintages will be more utilized than
                                          30




old vintages. Indeed, under static expectations (but with the assumed values of

a and ),    in   1979 we would find negative utilization rates of the 1950 and 1951

vintages. Utilization rates taking 1979 as the base period are shown in Figure 6.

Neglecting again the observations for the early fifties, we see that the utili-

zation of the 1959 vintage in 1979 is 58% and that an increase in expectational

errors brought about by a 10% increase in the 1979 product wage leads to a

drop in utilization of the 1959 vintage to 51%. For comparison, the utilization

rate would have been 44% under static expectations.


     The Average Utilization Rate

     A measure of average utilization of the capital stock in each year can be

obtained by aggregating the utilization rate of each vintage in operation in

that year. This measure, denoted by u*, is reported in Figure 7 for the base

dynamic case. It shows a decline, from 76% in 1959 to 71% in 1979. The evolu-

tion mirrors the one of measures based on the output gap or survey data from the

later sixties but the increase in the early sixties is not reflected in our

measure, possibly because of the weight of the base period capital stock.

     In Table 4, we simulate again the shocks of the seventies by showing the
                                                               /
effects   of changes in expected factor prices on u as a proportion of the dynamic

base case of column 2 of Table 3. As before, we have set the expected rate

of growth of wages at 5% in column 1, the expected rate of growth of energy

prices at 3% in column 2 and combine both shocks in column 3. While the year—

to—year changes in a. and b. were negligible relative to the change in the year

of the shock, the opposite holds for u*, where the impact effect is very small

compared to the effect in 1979. Comparing the effect of the wage and oil

shocks in Table 4, we see that the response of average utilization is much

more significant in columns 1 and 3 than it is in column 2, as suggested above

in the discussion of Tables 1 and 2.

    Prof itabil)r

     Finally, to present data on the profitability of manufacturing, we have to

correct our measure of output for non—energy raw materials. Taking their share

in output as constant over the period (as suggested by Table 1), we can compute

profits for each vintage as a percentage of net output.   In the dynamic base case,

we see that, if the share is one half of gross output, then profitability declined

from about 24% in 1953 to 14.5% in 1958, increased to 19.3% in 1961 and slowly

declined to about 14% in the mid sixties. After a drop to 10% in 1969—70,

this measure falls rapidly to 2.3% in 1975 and zero thereafter. Since the

share of raw—materials also changes, we show in Table 5 the rate of profit for

the share of 50% and 40%. In the latter case, profitability does decline sub-

stantially in the seventies, as suggested by Figure 1 above, but the rate of

profit in 1979 is still about 5%. Note further that, measuring profits by

vintage, we see that in 1979 no vintage before 1956 would be in operation and

similarily that 1950 vintages would have been scrapped after 1975.

    CON CLUS TON

    The results reported in Section III have to be regarded as indicative of

the usefulness of the approach defended in this paper rather than precise

estimates. Our interpretation of the decline of profitability in Section I

emphasized the importance of the wage explosion of the late sixties, continued

into the seventies, as well as the effect of the oil shock. Since our model

recognizes that it takes time to adjust factor proportions to factor price

shocks and that it takes longer the lower the rate of capital formation, we

were able to compare the effects of a sudden change in the price of energy to

the effects of an increase in the expected rate of growth of real wages. We

found that, as suggested by Figure 1, the decline in profitability started

before the oil crisis, but that the energy shock was responsible for making older

vintages unprofitable sooner than anticipated. The greater share of the wage

bill in gross output was one reason for the stronger effect of wage growth in

factor   proportions but the effect of expectational errors was also found to be
important in   contrasting   results under static expectations to the dynamic simu—
lation of the model.
     This   being said, the limitations of the analysis should be borne in mind.

The most serious ones are certainly the omission of investment and of the

international aspects, which only appear here indirectly through the energy

shock or some constraint on the price of output. These items as well as a

refinement of the estimation procedure in the present set—up are in the authors'

research agenda.

                                   NOTES


1/   A "European perspective" on this period can be found in Giersch (1981).


2/   On secular French growth, see Carrd, Dubois and Malinvaud (1972). The

     comparative perspective emerging from Maddison (1977) also suggests that

     France was a late starter in the process of modern economic growth. The rate

     of output in the later 19th century (1870—1913), 1.6% p.a., was substan-

     tially below the average of sixteen industrial countries, 2.8% p.a.. The

     same is true of the first half of the 20th century (1913—1949), where the

     French growth rate was 1.4% p.a. and the average 1.9%. After the Second

     World War, however, France caught up (5.3% vs. 4.8% in 1949—72) and con-

     tinued above average in the seventies. In terms of manufacturing, there

     was a narrowing of the differential in the postwar "belle epoque" and a

     relative French decline in the seventies, as documented in Giersch (1981,

     chap 4).


3/   A detailed study of the changing structure of output in France during the

     fifties and sixties, as well as of the changes within manufacturing can

     be found in Dubois (1974). More recent accounts are in De1estr (1979)

     and Collet et al. (1980)


4/   There were "six sectors of the future'1 selected by the Committee for the

     Orientation and Development of Strategic Industry (CODIS): bioengineering,

     marine industries, robots, electronic office equipment, consumer electronics

     and alternative energy technologies. See Joint Economic Committee (1981,

     chap 2) for an insightful description of industrial and credit policy in

     France. Using principal components analysis, Rigal (1982) identifies three

     turning points during the period 1965—79. In 1969, investment was higher

     in food products, some equipment (mechanical, household appliances, automobile),

     construction and services to firms and lower in agriculture, energy (coal
                                       38



     electricity, natural gas and water), consumption goods (leather—shoes and

     textile—clothing), home equipment (naval, aircraft, weapons) and transportation.

     In 1972, agriculture and energy continue to decline but are now joined by

     food products and construction; equipment and services accelerate while

     consumption goods pick up thanks to drugs and wood furniture. In 1978, energy

     and services have the higer investment ratio, while manufacturing declines,

     with the exceptions noted in the text.


5/   The present stance on this aspect is less sanguine but the emphasis on the

     high technology has, if anything, increased. According to the 1982—83 interim

     development plan, spending on research and development is to rise from 1.8%

     of GDP in 1980 to 2.5% by 1985 and in the 1982 budget, aid to industry by the

     Economic and Social Development Fund (FDES) is to increase by 52.4%. To what

     extent the managers of the newly nationalized firms will be able to find the

     incentives to pursue this goal remains, of course, to be seen.


6/   Historically, the single exception is the deflation of 1873—96 which was

     smaller in Germany (—.1% p.a.) and Italy (—.3%). In the 1920—34 period,

     for example, consumer price deflation (excluding Germany) was —2.2% p.a.

     on average when in France there was 2.1% inflation.   See Schwartz (1973)

     and Giersch (1981, chap. 4).


7/   Griliches and Mairesse (1982, p. 6) mention a "push" type explanation for

     the faster productivity growth in France relative to the U.S. They present

     evidence against explanations of the productivity slowdown, based on the invest-

     ment shortfall and on the increase in the price of raw materials, as hypo—

     thesised by Bruno (1981). They also find some effect of R & D on productivity

     at the firm level but not at the industry level.


8/   Comparative perspectives are provided by Nordhaus (1972), Gordon (1977) and

     Sachs (1979). Due to data availability, we could not present figures before
                                       39




     1963 in Table 1. The ratios usually reported refer to all non—financial

     enterprises, of which only half are manufacturing firms. There are also

     no series on the price of non—energy intermediate inputs and the series

     on the wholesale price of energy is an index (used below).


9/   A brief reference to developments since 1979 may   be   appropriate here. As

                                                         further in 1980 but
     shown in Figure 1, the operating surplus declined

     relative shares remained in line with the average for the period since 1974,

     so that there was a swifter adaptation to the second oil shock than to the

     first. This is in large part due to a greater control over labor costs,

     even taking the minimum wage increase of June 1981 into account. In fact,

     using quarterly data on the ratio of unit labor costs to value added deflators

     in manufacturing relative to major trading partners, from IFS (base 1975=100)

     we see a decline from 104 in the first quarter to 98 in the fourth, and an

     increase to 99 in the first quarter of 1982. Now the labor share in French

     manufacturing alone declined from 102.2 to 98.6 from the first to the fourth

     quarter of 1981, and is provisionally put at 99.1 and 98.7 in the first two

     quarters of 1982.


10/ Legislation enacted in January 1982 implied a reduction of 4.5% in the legal

     number of hours worked per year, due to a reduction of the work week and

     an increase in the length of paid vacation. Note that taking into effect the

     length of paid vacation and the incidence of strikes on the annual average as

     hours worked as in Mairesse and Saglio (1971, p. 114) would lower the estimate

     of N in Table 2 in 1956, 1963 and above all, 1968 and 1969.

12/ While this is true of the exhaustive work on putty—clay of Johansen (1972,

     esp. p. 35), mention should be made of a sizable literature on capital

     utilization which concentrates on shift—work and "rhythmic input prices" e.g.

     Winston (1974) and (1977) and Betancourt and Clague (1981). Also, a model

     of utilization, focusing on investment demand is in Abel (1981).

     and Stiglitz (1970). Empirical implementations in a growth context are in

     Bliss (1965) for England, Benassy et al. (1975), Fouquet et al. (1978) and

14/ The equation for these hyperbolas can be derived by rotating the axes by

     one half of an angle whose contangent is given by (2—a)2+8aii2/2(l—a) for

     (14) and minus (2—6)v2+p2/2(1—) for (15) and defining a new origin.

     Details are available upon request.


15/ The positive root is .w. +          = 1 for both equations. It implies from

     (10) that u. = 0 and is associated with an indefinite form for H.


16/ A justification of the fixed life assumption in French manufacturing appears

     in Atkinson and Mairesse (1978).

 17/ Strictly speaking, we should have netted out non—energy intermediate inputs,

      and thus adjust a and   measured relative to gross output as in Table 1.

      Because of the nearly fixed relative price, however, this adjustment would

      only affect the scale parameter. Also a only reflects the share of produc-

      tion labor.


18/ See Carr, Dubois and Malinvaud (1972) and Mairesse (1972) for a detailed

     studies of the French capital stock. See also Delestr (l979b) and SLM.

     Note that a lifetime of 30 years is substantially higher than the one chosen

     in other estimates — see Mairesse (1972 p. 59) — even without allowing for

     the distinction between equipment and buildings. The present combination

     probably allows for too little disembodied capital augmenting technical

     progress, which was found by Mairesse (1977) and (1978) to be important in

     the French case. A 5% rate of depreciation would come closer to the mark but

     then the series on net capital would be almost double of the corresponding

     series reported in SLM, whereas with a 10% depreciation, the two series are

     very close.


19/ Expected computing costs prevented a simultaneous estimation of a, ,   n    and

     the C's in the dynamic case but we obviously intend to perform it. The

     details of the estimation procedure are available upon request.


20/ See Table 2. Alternative estimates of disembodied technical progress are

    4.3% in Mairesse and Saglio (1971, p. 107), 2.6% for labor and —.9% for capital

    in Benassy, Fouquet and Malgrange (1975, p. 35) and 2% in Mairesse (1978).


21/ From 1959 to 1979, data is based on the 1971 "enlarged system of national

    accounts" (SECN) and includes investment by private firms in three subsectors

    or "branches", intermediate goods (code U04), machines (U05) and consumption
                                  42




goods (U06). From 1950 to 1959, however, it is based on the 1962 system,

which divides manufacturing into seven branches (denoted U06 to U12) and

some national firms such as the Commissariat d'Energie Atornique are

included (in U1OB). To the difference in firm coverage (CEA in, some

aeronautics firms out) we ahve to add the difference due to the exclusion

of the deductible portion of the value-added tax. To give an example, the

new investment series (without VAT was 16.3% below the old one in 1971, but,

after accounting for the differences in definition, etc. the divergence

was reduced to — 3.4%.   The other series which are affected are employment

(56 classification over 1971 classification is 1.042 in 1959) and production

(similar ratio is .903 in 1959). Further details in INSEE (1978).
