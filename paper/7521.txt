Choice, Chance, and Wealth Dispersion at Retirement
Steven F. Venti and David A. Wise
NBER Working Paper No. 7521
February 2000

                                               ABSTRACT

        “People earn just enough to get by” is a phrase often used to explain the low personal saving rate
in the United States. The implicit presumption is that households simply do not earn enough to pay for
current “needs” and to save. We show in this paper that at all levels of lifetime earnings there is an
enormous dispersion in the accumulated wealth of families approaching retirement. It is not only households
with low incomes that save little; a significant proportion of high income households also saves little. And,
a substantial proportion of low income households save a great deal. We then consider the extent to which
differences in household lifetime financial resources explain the wide dispersion in wealth, given lifetime
earnings. We find that very little of this dispersion can be explained by chance differences in individual
circumstances – “largely outside the control of individuals” – that might limit the resources from which
saving might plausibly be made. We also consider how much of the dispersion in wealth might be
accounted for by different investment choices of savers – some more risky, some less risky – given lifetime
earnings. We find that investment choice is not a major determinant of the dispersion in asset accumulation.
It matters about as much as chance events that limit the available resources of households with the same
lifetime earnings. We conclude that the bulk of the dispersion must be attributed to differences to in the
amount that households choose to save. The differences in saving choices among households with similar
lifetime earnings lead to vastly different levels of asset accumulation by the time retirement age approaches.
