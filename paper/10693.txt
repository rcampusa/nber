                                        ABSTRACT
This paper uses Generational Accounting to assess the fiscal impacts of Korean reunification. Our

findings suggest that early reunification will result in a large increase in the fiscal burden for most

current and future generations of South Koreans. The Korean reunification's fiscal impact appears

much larger than that of German reunification, due to a wider gap in productivity between the two

Koreas and North Korea's much larger share of the unified country's population. The projected large-

scale fiscal burden on South Korea is attributable primarily to the rapid increase in social welfare

expenditure for North Korean residents, rather than to the direct reconstruction cost of the North

Korean economic system after the disintegration of its old economic regime.

1. Introduction

         The relationship between South and North Korea in many fields, including politics,

economics, and social affairs, has substantially improved over the past decade. Even though

recent international developments surrounding North Korea do not presage a closer relationship

between the two Koreas in the near future, a great many South Koreans view these developments

as transitory and expect that the two Koreas will be reunified eventually.

         A key issue of Korean reunification will be its cost. The reunification cost will depend

on the political process of reunification, the political, economic, and social structure of North

Korea after reunification, the productivity gap between the two Korean regions, and the fiscal

policies that will be implemented in a reunified Korea. As to the first two aspects, there is little

one can say at present, so we will work with simple assumptions and focus on the last two

aspects. We consider a hypothetical situation where the economic system of North Korea will

make the transition from central planning and the current fiscal policies of South Korea will be

implanted in the North Korean region of the newly unified country. We assess the cost of

reconstruction of the North Korean economic system after the disintegration of its old regime,

and estimate the taxes and transfers for North Korean residents and the cost of additional

government provision of public goods to the North Korean region.

         Previous research on the subject has focused mainly on reconstruction cost, producing a

wide range estimates, from 6 percent (Lee 1993) to 25 percent (Park 1997) of South Korea’s

GDP for 10 years after reunification.1 This past research, though, did not attempt a thorough

investigation of the costs associated with other fiscal policy changes, even though the


1
  Other previous research focusing on reconstruction cost includes An (1997) and Bae (1996). Differences among
the estimates are due primarily to differences in the assumed speed of convergence of North Korean productivity to
that of South Korea.

productivity gap between South and North Korea will inevitably increase expenditures on public

goods and social welfare and limit the collection of taxes from the North Korean region for a

considerable period after reunification.

        The purpose of this paper is to assess the fiscal impact of the reunification of South and

North Korea, by taking explicit account of projected changes in social welfare expenditures,

government consumption, and the North Korean region’s tax bases, as well as direct

reconstruction costs. We use Generational Accounting (GA) to do so, as GA is a natural tool for

investigating how the costs of fiscal changes are distributed among different population cohorts.

GA covers all relevant government fiscal policies, and its forward-looking properties allow us to

explore how Korea’s public finances will be affected by future reunification.

        Our findings suggest that early reunification will result in a large increase in fiscal

burden for most current and future generations of South Koreans. The overall magnitude of this

added fiscal burden is much larger than that of German reunification, because (i) the productivity

gap between South and North Korea is much larger than that between East and West Germany

before reunification and (ii) North Korea’s population is much larger, relative to the South, than

was the case for East Germany relative to West Germany. The findings also suggest that

increased spending on social welfare is much more important than direct reconstruction costs as

a determinant of the added fiscal burden.

        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the basic concept

of GA and the GA calculation methods. Section 3 explains the GA calculation procedure and data

used to measure the fiscal impacts of reunification. Section 4 presents the accounts and discusses

their implications. Section 5 summarizes findings and draws conclusions.

2. GA Calculation Method

2.1. Basic Framework2

            Generational Accounting is based on the government’s intertemporal budget constraint.

This constraint, written as equation (1), requires that the future net tax payments of current and

future generations be sufficient, in present value, to cover the present value of future government

consumption as well as service the government’s initial net debt.


              D             ∞              ∞
(1)         ∑ N t ,t − s + ∑ N t ,t + s = ∑ G s (1 + r ) −( s −t ) − Wt g
             s =0          s =1           s =t




            The first summation on the left-hand side of (1) adds together the generational accounts

(the present value of the remaining lifetime net payments) of existing generations. The term Nt,t-s

stands for the account of the generation born in year t-s. The index s in this summation runs from

age 0 to age D, the maximum length of life. The second summation on the left-hand side of (1)

adds together the present value of remaining net payments of future generations, with s

representing the number of years after year t that each future generation is born. The first term on

the right-hand side of (1) is the present value of government consumption. In this summation the

values of government consumption, Gs in year s, are discounted by the pre-tax real interest rate, r.

The remaining term on the right-hand side, Wt g , denotes the government’s net wealth in year t −

its assets minus its explicit debt.

            Equation (1) indicates the zero sum nature of intergenerational fiscal policy. Holding the

present value of government consumption fixed, a reduction in the present value of net taxes

                                                                 3
extracted from current generations (a decline in the first summation on the left side of (1))

necessitates an increase in the present value of net tax payment of future generations.

          The term Nt,k in (1) is defined by:


                                    k +D
(2)                  N t ,k =       ∑T         s,k
                                s = max( t , k )
                                                     Ps , k (1 + r ) −( s −t )



In expression (2), Ts,k stands for the projected average net tax payments to the government made

in year s by the generation born in year k. The term Ps,k stands for the number of surviving

members of the cohort in year s who were born in year k. For the generations who are born in

year k, where k>t, the summation begins in year k. Regardless of the generation’s year of birth,

the discounting is always back to year t. A set of generational accounts is simply a set of values

of Nt,k, one for each existing and future generation, with the property that the combined present

value adds up to the right-hand side of equation (1).

          Note that generational accounts reflect only taxes and social insurance contributions

(taxes henceforth) paid less transfers received. The accounts do not impute to particular

generations the value of government’s purchases of goods and services because it is difficult to

attribute the benefits of such purchases.3 Therefore, the accounts do not show the full net benefit

or burden that any generation receives from government policy as whole, although they can

show a generation’s net benefit or burden from a particular policy change that affects only taxes

and transfers. Thus, generational accounting tells us which generations will pay for government

spending, rather than telling us which generations will benefit from that spending. Another


3
 Bovenberg and ter Rele (2000) tried to incorporate the incidence of government consumption into generational
accounts, assuming that all current generations enjoy the same (per capita) benefits from both government
consumption and the public capital stock, with the latter benefits set at the imputed rent on the public capital stock.
However, their approach does not attempt to deal with the “public” nature of government-provided goods.



                                                                                 4
characteristic of generational accounting that should be understood at the outset is that, as its

name suggests, it is an accounting exercise that, like deficit accounting, does not incorporate

induced behavioral effects or macroeconomics responses of policy changes. As a corollary, it

does not incorporate the deadweight loss of taxation in its measure of fiscal burden, again

following the tradition of budget incidence analysis.


2.2. The Standard Method

        The traditional Generational Accounts are calculated in two steps. The first step involves

calculation of the net tax payments of current generations (the first term on the left-hand-side of

equation (1)). This is done on the basis of current fiscal rules without being constrained by the

intertemporal budget constraint of the government. In the second step, given the right-hand-side

of equation (1) and the first term on the left-hand-side of equation (1), we determine, as a

residual, the value of the second term on the left-hand side of equation (1), which is the

collective payment, measured as a time-t present value, required of future generations.

Accordingly, whereas the fiscal burdens for current generations are based entirely on current

fiscal rules, the government budget constraint fully determines the fiscal burdens for future

generations. Future generations are thus assumed to absorb the entire adjustment that is required

to make the claims of various generations consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint.

        Based on the collective amount required of future generations, we determine the average

present value of lifetime net tax payments for each member of each future generation under the

assumption that the average lifetime tax payments of successive generations rise at the

economy’s rate of productivity growth. Leaving out this growth adjustment, the lifetime net tax

payments of future generations are directly comparable with those of current newborns, since the

generational accounts of both newborns and future generations take into account net tax


                                                5
payments over these generations’ entire lifetimes. Measuring the generational imbalance as the

difference between two lifetime tax burdens provides a measure for the sustainability of the

public finances. If future generations bear a heavier tax burden than the newly born do, current

fiscal rules will have to be adjusted in the future to meet the budget constraint.

        The computation of the total net payment across generations requires information about

average tax burdens and transfer payments by age and sex. The standard calculation method used

to project the average values of particular taxes and transfer payments by age and sex starts with

government forecasts of the aggregate amounts of each type of tax and transfer payment in future

years. These aggregate amounts are then distributed by age and sex based on cross-sectional

relative age-sex-tax and age-sex-transfer profiles derived from cross-sectional micro-data sets.

For years beyond those for which government forecasts are available, age- and sex-specific

average tax and transfer amounts are set equal to those for the latest year for which forecasts are

available, with an adjustment for growth.

        This procedure is based on the assumption that the age-sex-profiles of transfer payments

and tax burdens do not change over time. The standard procedure also assumes that government

purchases, transfer payments and tax revenues grow at the same rate as GDP, although in some

cases they are broken down into age-specific components, with the assumption that each

component remains constant per member of the relevant population, adjusted for the overall

growth of GDP per capita.


2.3. Extending the Standard Method

        To reflect important characteristics of the Korean fiscal situation, we modify the

approach just described, by incorporating prospective changes in the age profiles of transfer

payments and tax burdens. There are two sets of factors underlying these prospective changes.


                                                  6
The first set would be present in South Korea even without reunification, while the other relates

to changes associated with reunification.

         First, the maturation of the National Pension system (NPS) will change the age profiles

and aggregate levels of benefits and contributions in South Korea. The average National Pension

benefit per member of cohorts aged 70 and older is low compared with that for those between 55

and 70 at present, since a large proportion of the older age groups are not covered at all by the

NPS. Aggregate benefit amounts among older age groups are also restricted by the program’s

short history, which limits the number entitled to full benefits. However, maturation of the

system will increase the average benefit payments to old-age groups, which will flatten the age

profile of benefits and increase the number of pension recipients and the aggregate pension

benefit amount. We expect to observe a similar trend of maturation of the National Pension

system for North Korean residents after reunification.

         Also, one can reasonably anticipate changes in social welfare expenditures, even if

South Korea remains separate. Though limited in the past, aggregate transfer payments in South

Korea by Medical Insurance and social welfare services and public assistance have increased

rapidly over the past decade due to recent structural changes in social welfare policies. Even the

current level of social welfare expenditure in South Korea, though, remains well below the

OECD average. Therefore, we project that social welfare expenditure will increase more rapidly

than other components of government expenditure for a considerable period. In particular, we

assume that the per capita amount of social welfare expenditure will increase more rapidly than

per capita GDP until it reaches the OECD average.4

 The income elasticity of government expenditure on health care is based on estimates by Newhouse (1997), Leu
(1983, 1986), Gertham et al. (1998, 1992) and the OECD (1993), whose values range between 1.2 and 1.4.
Exceptionally low or high estimates are produced by Gerdtham (1991, 1992) (0.74), Moon (2000) (1.75) and the
OECD (1993) (1.6). In the case of government expenditure on social security and welfare services, Moon (2000)


                                                     7
         Turning to factors associated with reunification, the National Pension benefit levels of

South Korean participants will be affected, since pension benefits consist of two parts, an

income-related part and flat part. The latter is computed based on the average income of all NPS

participants. The participation of North Korean residents, whose average income is currently less

than 10 percent of that of South Koreans, will lower the flat part of the NPS benefit substantially.

Analyzing reunification also requires another extension of the standard methodology, to account

for the heterogeneity of the two populations. Rather than just separating each age cohort by sex,

we also separate it by region, specifying different profiles for North and South Koreans. This will

have important effects, not only on the tax side, but also on the expenditure side. For example,

the Minimum Living Standard Security (MLSS) benefit, a social transfer program to aid low-

income households, will initially apply to many more North Korean residents under current rules.

Thus, we require not only distinct profiles for North and South Koreans, but also changing

profiles over time for North Koreans, as they make the assumed transition over time to income

parity with South Koreans.

         Finally, we also modify the presentation of generational accounts. The standard

approach estimates the fiscal gap between current and future generations, assuming existing

policy for current generations.         It is also customary to express this fiscal gap using other

measures, such as the required changes in taxes and or transfer payments for current and future

generations together. Because it is likely that some of the burden will be placed on current

generations, we take this latter approach one step further and actually present alternative

estimates of the accounts for current generations, taking such projected increases in their fiscal

estimated a high income elasticity (1.54). We make a very conservative assumption about the income elasticity (1.2)
in order to avoid over-projection of government expenditure in these sectors. The upper bounds for expenditures on
social security and welfare and health care are assumed to be 4.12 percent and 5.94 percent, respectively, of GDP,
based on the OECD averages as of 1995. For detailed information about the future path of social welfare
expenditure, see Auerbach and Chun (2003).

burden into account. We denote as GA1 the accounts as conventionally presented, and refer to

the accounts incorporating the added taxes to restore fiscal balance as GA2.5


3. Calculation Procedure and Underlying Assumptions6

         To produce generational accounts for North Korea, we require projections of population,

taxes, transfers, government expenditures, initial government debt, and a discount rate. We also

need to project the age-sex profiles of average income of North Koreans, since taxes and transfer

payments of individuals are dependent upon their income level. We ignore the current fiscal

policies of North Korea, based on the assumption that North Korean policies will be repealed.

Therefore, we consider a hypothetical situation where the current fiscal policies in South Korea

are implanted in North Korea after reunification.

         The current fiscal policies in South Korea are classified into the following groups: social

welfare policies, tax system, seigniorage, and government consumption. The social welfare

policies are composed of public pensions, Medical Insurance (MI), Employment Insurance (EI),

Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance (IACI), and social welfare services and public

assistance (Minimum Living Standards Security System, MLSS, and other social transfer

programs, OSTP). Taxes are classified as labor income taxes, capital income taxes, consumption

taxes, taxes on asset holdings, taxes on asset transactions, and other taxes. Government

consumption is broken down into expenditure on education and other government consumption.

Except for public pensions (NPS), MLSS, and EI7, we follow standard procedure to compute the

age-sex distribution of the components of fiscal policies: we start by projecting the aggregate of

each component, and then distribute the aggregate by age and sex based on cross-sectional

relative age-sex-tax and age-sex-transfer profiles derived from cross-sectional micro-data sets.


3.1. Population Projection (North Korea)

         We employ the 2001 population projection model of the National Statistics Office

(NSO) for South Korea’s population projections. We project current and future populations of

North Korea using information about base-year age-sex distributions, death rates, and fertility

rates, since neither the South Korean nor the North Korean government has published projections

of the future North Korean population. The baseline year for our projection is 1993, the most

recent year for which a North Korean government report is available. We convert the population

distribution of 5-year-age intervals into one with 1-year-age intervals by assuming that, within

each 5-year-age interval, the population is evenly distributed across ages.

         We impute the age-sex-year profile of death rates based on the NSO projections of life

expectancy in South Korea, since the age-sex profiles have not been published. For the

imputation of age-sex profiles of North Korean death rates in a given year, we search for the

‘equivalent year’ when the life expectancy of South Korea is the closest to that of North Korea,

and then assume that the profiles for North Korea are the same as those in South Korea’s

equivalent year.

         The total fertility rate in North Korea as of 1993 is 2.16, much higher than that in South

Korea (1.67 in 1993, 1.47 in 2000). We assume that the fertility rates as of 1993 are maintained

until reunification and that after reunification they will approach those of South Korea. Since the

total fertility rate of North Korea in 1993 is quite close to that of South Korea in 1983 (2.08), we

7
 In the case of NPS contributions and benefits and MLSS benefits, the age-sex profiles as well as the growth rates
of the aggregate amounts are assumed to change over time while, in the case of EI, only the growth rate of the
aggregate benefit amount is assumed to change over time, with the age-sex profiles fixed.



                                                       10
assume that the fertility rates of North Korea after reunification follow the same path for South

Korea since 1983. The assumed sex ratio of newborns is 106, which is standard in population

projections.


3.2. Projection of Average Income Profile (North Korea)

          We impute the age-sex-year profiles of average income of North Koreans based on the

information about the difference in per capita GDP between South and North Korea. We assume

that the average labor productivity of North Korea is about 11 percent of that of South Korea in

1993 based on the projection of Bank of Korea. To impute the productivity growth path, we

divide the period after 1993 into 5 sub-periods: (i) 1994-2001; (ii) 2002-the year of reunification;

(iii) stagnation period (for 5 years after reunification); (iv) a period of rapid growth (for 45 years

after the stagnation period); and (v) a period of balanced growth. For period (i) we use historical

data on the productivity growth reported by the NSO.8 The labor productivity growth in period

(ii) is assumed 1 percent per annum, which is slightly lower than that of South Korea (1.5

percent). For period (iii), we assume that the labor productivity will not grow, since in the

process of disintegration of the old North Korean economic system stagnation will be inevitable.

After the stagnation period, we expect a period of rapid growth, so that after the 45 years of

period (iv) the labor productivity of North Korea converges to that of South Korea, i.e., the

productivity of North Korean residents will catch up with that of South Koreans 50 years after

reunification.9 For period (v), we assume that labor productivity grows at the same rate as in


8
 The labor productivity growth rates for the period 1993-2001 are –5.2 percent (‘93), -3.1 percent (‘94), -5.1 percent
(‘95), -4.6 percent (‘96), -7.3 percent (‘97), -2.1 percent (‘98), 5.2 percent (‘99), 0.3 percent (2000), and 2.7 percent
(2001).
9
 The period assumed necessary for full integration of the two Koreas is much longer than that assumed by
Raffelhüschen and Walliser (1999) for the German unification (20 years), based on the much larger productivity gap
between the two Koreas (North Korea’s level is 8 percent of South Korea’s as of 2000, whereas East Germany’s was
37 percent of West Germany’s) and the fact that the ratio of North Korea’s population to South Korea’s (47 percent


                                                           11
South Korea. Given the path of labor productivity, we impute the age-sex profile of labor income

under the assumption that the profiles are the same as that of South Korea, except for the gap in

the absolute level of labor income.

            Beginning with reunification, we require estimates of North Korea’s unemployment

rates to project expenditures on EI benefits. In period (iii), we assume that the unemployment

rate is 20 percent, since the skills of many North Korean residents will become obsolete

immediately after reunification. 10 During period (iv) the unemployment rate is assumed to

decrease gradually to reach the current unemployment rate of South Korea (3 percent), and this

level is assumed to be maintained in period (v).

            The age-sex profile of capital income is the same as for South Korea, except for the gap

in the absolute level between the two Koreas. The gap is assumed the same as that in labor

productivity. The resulting path of the capital income share in the North Korean region for period

(iii) onward shows that share gradually rising from 38 percent to 40 percent.11


3.3. Projecting National Pension Contributions and Benefits (South and North Korea)

            The public pensions in South Korea consist of two different plans: National Pension

(NPS) and Occupational Pensions. Since the Occupational Pensions cover a small portion of the

whole population, we assume that the North Korean residents will be covered by the NPS after

reunification. We project the NPS for South and North Korea in two steps. The first step is to

project the distribution of insurants and benefit recipients in North Korea; in the second step, we


as of 2000) is much larger than that of East to West Germany’s (26 percent as of 1989).
10
  The unemployment rate in the former East Germany after Germany’s reunification was about 15 percent. We
expect the unemployment rate in the former North Korea after reunification to be much higher, since the
productivity gap between South and North Korea is much larger than that between East and West Germany when
they joined.
11
     The capital income share of South Korea for the past decade is about 40 percent.



                                                           12
recalculate the contribution and benefit amounts by age-sex-year for both South and North

Korean residents.

         In the first step, we assume that the distributions of insurants and benefit recipients of

North Korea follows the same trends as the distributions of South Korea since the NPS’s

introduction in 1988. In other words, we assume that the maturation of the NPS in the former

North Korea follows the same path as in South Korea with the time lag between 1988 and the

year of reunification. Therefore, we compute the ratio of South Korean insurants and benefit

recipients by age and sex to the population of the same cohorts for the period since 1988; we

then project the distribution of insurants and benefit recipients in North Korea by multiplying the

ratio by the North Korean population by age and sex in the years after reunification.

         In addition, we adjust the distributions by taking into account the difference in

unemployment rates between South and North Korea, since we assume that the unemployment

rates will be much higher in the North Korean area for a considerable time post-reunification.

This adjustment is needed since the unemployment rates affect the contribution and benefit

amount of each cohort. 12 Instead of average income and benefit amount by age and sex, we

adjust the distribution of insurants and benefit recipients. The distribution of insurants is adjusted

by assuming that the number of insurants by age and sex in a given year is proportional to the

employment rate. For the distribution of new benefit recipients, we assume that the number of

new recipients by age and sex in a particular year is proportional to the average employment rate

during each cohort’s economically active period.

         In the second step, we recalculate the contribution and benefit amounts of South and

North Korea. We compute the contribution amounts by taking into account average income

12
  The benefits of a particular individual are affected by the employment rates over his lifetime, since the NPS
benefit amount is proportional to the period of his contribution to the NPS.

levels, number of insurants by age and sex and unemployment rates. Given the distribution of

benefit recipients and profiles of average benefit levels, the benefit amount of each cohort in

South and North Korea is recalculated based on the pension benefit formula. Note that the level

of pension benefits of South Korean recipients must be recalculated, since, as discussed above,

the flat part of benefits will fall with the inclusion of North Koreans in the calculation of average

income.


3.4. Projecting the Distribution of MLSS Benefits (North Korea)

            We compute the MLSS benefit level by age-sex-year by subtracting the average income

of each group, including labor income and capital income, from the minimum living expense

guaranteed by the Korean government. The minimum living expense guaranteed is computed by

using the distribution of households and profiles of the minimum living expense guaranteed by

the number of household members, and the resulting value is about 230,000 won per month as of

2000. We assume that the minimum living expense guaranteed grows at the productivity growth

rate of South Korea, and allow the profiles for North Koreans to change over time, consistent

with their rising relative incomes.


3.5. Projection of Other Fiscal Components (North Korea)

Determining Generational Profiles

            The profiles of taxes and transfers for North Korean residents, except for the NPS

contributions and benefits and the MLSS benefits, are assumed the same as those for South

Koreans, except for their absolute levels.13




13
     For the age and sex profiles for South Korea, see Auerbach and Chun (2003).



                                                          14
Projection of Aggregates

            The procedure for projecting aggregates of taxes, transfers and government consumption

for North Korean residents after the reunification is basically the same as that for South Koreans

described in Auerbach and Chun (2003). We assume the same scope of government activities,

and follow the same procedure of decomposing government consumption, contributions and

benefits of social insurance into (1) age-specific components and (2) non-age-specific

components. The scope of government covers the central government, local government, public

education institutions, social insurance programs, and non-profit organizations financed by the

government and providing services such as research on the economy, science and public

administration. The government consumption classified as age-specific includes government

expenditure on education, health, and social security and welfare services. 14 Social insurance

contributions and benefits, and government non-contributory transfer programs such as OSTP

are age-specific, and labor income taxes and capital income taxes are classified as age-specific.

            The non-age-specific components of taxes, transfers and government consumption are

assumed to increase at the rate of productivity growth. In the case of the components classified

as age-specific, the amount per member of the relevant population grows at the rate of

productivity growth. The only exceptions are expenditure on health and social welfare, whose

amounts per member of the relevant age groups grows at a higher rate than productivity growth

until reaching the OECD average.15

            For North Korea, a difference in the procedure for projecting aggregate fiscal

components is that we further classify the fiscal components into two groups: one in which the

14
  Government consumption is classified as: general public service, defense, public order and safety, education,
health, social security and welfare services, housing and community amenities, recreation-culture-religion, fuel and
energy, agriculture-forestry-fishing, mining-manufacture-construction, transportation and communication, and other.
15
     See footnote 4.



                                                        15
value per member of the relevant population grows at the productivity growth rate of South

Korea and the other in which the value grows at the productivity growth rate of North Korea

after reunification. The former group includes MI benefits and all components of government

consumption. The latter group includes IACI benefits, OSTP benefits, all taxes and social

insurance contributions, and seigniorage. Components of the latter group have benefit or tax

formulae based on income or assets. Components of the former group, on the other hand, are not

determined so mechanically, and we would not expect government to discriminate against North

Koreans in these areas. Not covered by this two-way classification is the EI benefit, since we

expect high unemployment rates during the transition period after reunification. We project the

aggregate EI benefit expenditure under the assumptions that the average benefit is proportional

to the average income of North Korean workers and the number of the recipients of EI benefits is

proportional to the unemployment rate.

        We also must add to government expenditure the reconstruction cost of North Korea,

since after reunification the government and private sector of South Korea will inevitably

transfer resources to the North Korean region in order to cushion the transition. Since, as

discussed above, estimates of the reconstruction cost by previous researchers show a wide range,

we derive our own estimate of the value following the procedure described in the appendix. Our

estimate of the reconstruction cost is 10 percent of the GDP of South Korea for 20 years after

reunification. In the base case, we assume that 50 percent of the reconstruction cost is paid by the

government and the other half by the private sector. Therefore, government expenditure on the

reconstruction of the North Korean economy amounts to 5 percent of South Korean GDP for 20

years after reunification.




                                                16
3.6. Government Net Wealth and Discount Rate (North Korea)

         The North Korean government debt is assumed to be 14.9 trillion won as of 2000, based

on the projection by the Bank of Korea (2001). We also assume that the debt, evaluated in

present value, does not change until reunification.

         We assume the same discount rate for government finance for the North Korean region

as for the South Korean region: a real discount rate of 3.5 percent, reflecting a nominal discount

rate of 6.5 percent and an inflation rate of 3 percent.


4. Findings

         The benchmark year in the GA calculation is 2000. We regard generations alive in the

benchmark year as “current” generations and classify cohorts by age. We treat cohorts born in

2001 and later as “future” generations. For the computation of the net payments of North Korean

residents, we include the taxes and transfers from the time of reunification onward, i.e., we

completely ignore the fiscal burden under the current North Korean regime, which is difficult to

calculate. We consider a hypothetical situation where Korea is reunified in 2010.16


4.1. Generational Accounts Disregarding Reunification

         Table 1 reports standard generational accounts (GA1) for South Korea, assuming no

reunification, under the base case assumptions for the productivity growth rate (1.5 percent) and

the nominal discount rate (6.5 percent).17 Following past studies, we report two variants of the

accounts: Net Payment I (NPI) which treats educational expenditures as government

16
  There is much uncertainty about the timing of reunification. Changing the date does not change the qualitative
results, except for some redistribution of fiscal burdens across generations. Results of a sensitivity analysis with
respect to time of reunification are available upon request.
17
  The accounts are expressed in thousands of won, the domestic currency of South Korea. As of August, 2004,
1,000 won were worth about US$0.86.



                                                        17
consumption; and Net Payment II (NPII), which treats educational expenditures as transfer

payments.

         The table shows positive values of net payments for most cohorts alive in 2000 except

for cohorts aged 90 or older, indicating that most generations will, on balance, pay more in

present value than they receive. One reason for positive burdens even among the elderly is the

high taxes on consumption, capital income and assets, relative to taxes on labor income.18 The

age profile of the average tax burden on capital is more skewed to older age groups than that of

labor income taxes, and the consumption tax burden for older age groups is quite high.

         The more important reason that even older generations have positive net payments is

that social welfare benefits such as public pension benefits, Medical Insurance (MI) benefits,

Minimum Living Standards Security (MLSS) Benefits and other social welfare services (OSTP)

were quite small in the aggregate as of 2000. Aggregate public pension and MI benefits were 1.1

percent and 1.7 percent of GDP respectively as of 2000 and those for the MLSS and the OSTP

were 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent of GDP respectively. However, maturation of the public pension

system and the projected increase in social welfare expenditures will increase transfer payments

to old-age groups. This maturation is shown in Figure 1, which displays the relative (to age-40

males) benefit profile in 2000 along with the corresponding profiles projected at other dates

through 2080. As a result, the accounts for a wider range of old-age groups will turn negative in

the future, given current policy.

         Among current generations, net payments are largest around age 20, when people tend to

join the labor market and start work. Therefore, they will experience the longest economic

participation periods from this age. For example, the age-20 NPI (NPII) account is about 38

18
  Revenues from consumption tax, capital income tax, taxes on asset holding, and labor income tax in South Korea
as of 2000 were 9.1 percent, 5.1 percent, 1.3 percent, and 2.2 percent of GDP respectively.



                                                      18
percent (126 percent) higher than the age-0 account. There is a sharp decrease in net payments

between ages 50 and 60, since around age 55 many workers tend to retire and acquire eligibility

for social welfare benefits, including public pension benefits.

          The row labeled “Future Gen.” indicates the present value of amounts that those born in

2001 will, on average, pay, assuming that subsequent generations pay this same amount except

for the adjustment for growth. The NPI (NPII) account for future generations is about 118

percent (198 percent) larger than those for those aged 0, which implies that the current fiscal

policies are not sustainable and that a substantial fiscal burden is shifted to future generations.

          Table 1 also reports the present value, rest-of-life transfer benefits and tax burdens by

category. The substantial negative entries for public pensions and Medical Insurance play a key

role in the large overall generational imbalance. On the tax side, three important characteristics

of the Korean tax system are: (i) the large share of consumption taxes; (ii) the relative

unimportance of labor income taxes; and (iii) the large proportion accounted for by taxes on asset

transactions. The largest present value (for age 0 and age 30) is the consumption tax, followed by

the capital income tax, the tax on asset transactions, labor income tax, other taxes, and taxes on

asset holdings. The present value of the tax burden on older age groups, relative to that on

younger age groups, is heaviest for consumption taxes, followed by capital income taxes, taxes

on asset holding, taxes on asset transactions, and labor income taxes.

          Table 2 reports the magnitude of the adjustment of tax and social insurance contributions

(tax, henceforth) and transfer payments required to attain long-run government budget balance

under each of the scenarios discussed in the paper.19 The results for the base case simulation just

discussed, given in column [1], indicate that a substantial adjustment is required, even without
19
  Long-run budget balance is defined as the situation where the sum of current government net wealth and the
present value of present and future flows of taxes and social insurance contributions equals that of transfer payments
and government consumption.



                                                         19
reunification. The required adjustment is a 59.2 percent increase in tax burden if the adjustment

is made only for generations born in 2001 and thereafter. If the adjustment is made to all cohorts

alive in 2004 and later, the required tax adjustment represents a 20.1 percent increase in tax

burden. If we delay the tax adjustment until 2010 (the assumed reunification year in subsequent

simulations), the required tax adjustment reaches 23.1 percent. If the proportional increase in the

tax burden is accompanied by the same percentage decrease in transfer payments to attain long-

run government budget balance, the magnitude of the required adjustment decreases to 35-39

percent (if the adjustment is made only for the generations born in 2001 and later years), 12-13

percent (if the adjustment is made to all the cohorts alive in 2004 and later) and 14-15 percent (if

we delay the tax adjustment until 2010).


4.2. Incidence of the Fiscal Burden of Reunification

          Table 3 reports the standard Generational Accounts for South and North Korean

residents by taking into account the fiscal impacts of reunification.20 The accounts for South

Korean residents indicate that the reunification will substantially increase the fiscal burden on

South Korean future generations, unless the current fiscal policies of South Korea are

substantially altered.21 The Net Payment I (Net Payment II) of South Koreans, born 2001 and

later, increases by 20.6 percent (30 percent) due to the reunification, if the additional burden is

completely shifted to cohorts born in 2001 and later.



20
  Under reunification, the accounts for South and North Korea combined are simply the population-weighted
average of the two countries’ separate accounts. For the very old, the accounts are virtually the same as the accounts
for South Korea, given the much lower current life expectancy in North Korea.
21
  The typical method to allocate the fiscal burden between subgroups of future generations is to assume the same
increase in the fiscal burden relative to age-0 individuals of each subgroup. We cannot adopt this method, since the
age-0 North Koreans have a negative account. Therefore, we allocate the net payments among future generations of
South and North Koreans based on relative present values of lifetime earnings. That is, we assume that each future
generation’s burden is fixed share of the present value of its lifetime earnings.



                                                         20
         Tables 4 and 5 and provide a breakdown of the accounts for South and North Koreans,

respectively, into their components, for this base case reunification scenario.22 The increase in

the fiscal burden is primarily due to the increase in transfer payments to North Korean residents.

Table 5 shows that the net transfers to existing generations of North Koreans are accounted for

primarily by public pensions, MI, EI, and MLSS. The present values of lifetime net transfers

from MI, EI and MLSS for most existing North Korean generations are higher than those for

South Koreans. In particular, MLSS benefits for the cohort born in 2000 in North Korea is about

5.5 times as large as that for the same generation in South Korea. Even though the absolute level

of net transfers from NPS to most existing North Koreans is lower than that to current South

Koreans, its ratio to income is much higher for North Koreans.

         Contrary to the high transfer payments to North Koreans, their tax burdens are very low.

Comparing the accounts for the cohorts born in 2000, the labor income tax burden of North

Koreans is 37.1 percent of that of South Koreans, the capital income tax 56.6 percent, the

consumption tax 32.3 percent, asset holding tax 52.2 percent, and the asset transactions tax 35.7

percent. As result, the accounts for all existing North Koreans (except for cohorts aged 90 and

older, which are essentially empty) are negative. This implies, not surprisingly, that reunification

will transfer resources to current North Koreans, unless fiscal policies toward existing

generations are substantially altered; most of the fiscal burden will be shifted to the future

generations of South Korea. The magnitude of adjustment needed to attain long run budgetary

balance will substantially rise. The required tax adjustment (see Table 2, column [2]) rises from

23 percent to 53-54 percent due to reunification, if we adjust the tax burden from the year of

reunification (2010). The required magnitude of increase in tax burden accompanied by the same
22
  The components for South Korea given in Table 4 are the same as those in Table 1 for the no reunification case,
except for public pensions, which, as discussed above, must be recalculated once North Koreans are included in the
covered population.



                                                       21
decrease in transfers also rises substantially because of reunification, from 14-15 percent to 30-

32 percent.

            Tables 6 and 7 show the alternative (GA2) generational accounts (for variant NPI) under

the assumption that the adjustment that we estimate to be necessary for long-run budget balance

is actually distributed to current and future cohorts in South and North Korea.23 These tables

reflect the scenario in which the government increases the tax burden on all cohorts alive in the

reunification year and later.24 The tax increase for South Koreans without reunification (column

[1] of Table 2) is 23.1 percent of net payments under current fiscal policies; under reunification

(column [2] of Table 2), the corresponding increase in net payments is 53.1 percent. Comparing

columns [1] and [2] in Table 6, we can compute the changes in net payments due to reunification,

given the assumed tax policy response. Under this scenario, the fiscal burden of reunification is

still substantially shifted to future generations of South Koreans. Yet, at least in percentage terms,

as shown in Figure 2, generations aged less then 75 as of 2000 would still bear a significant

burden, experiencing a more than 20 percent increase in lifetime net tax burden; thus, under this

realistic scenario, most of the generations alive in 2000 and thereafter will be much affected by

the economic cost of reunification. The percentage increase in lifetime net payments exceeds 40

percent for those born in 2051, 41 years after the reunification date.

            The fiscal burdens of North Koreans after reunification are much lower for existing

generations than those of South Korean residents, since the productivity gap between the two

regions is still very large for a considerable time, and for the same period North Koreans will

receive large amounts of transfer payments from such benefits as MLSS, EI, and MI. However,


23
  The accounts for future generations in these tables are discounted from the year of birth and deflated to offset
future productivity growth, so that they may be compared to the accounts for current generations.
24
     See the corresponding columns of Table 2, in the row labeled “NPI, Reunif. Year (2010).”



                                                          22
the gap will decrease with the convergence in productivity between North and South. As can be

seen by comparing column [2] of Table 7 and column [1] of Table 6, generations of North

Koreans born after 2031 will face a higher lifetime net payment than would the same cohort of

South Koreans in the absence of reunification.


4.3. Policy Experiments and Sensitivity Analysis

        We consider several other situations to investigate the relative importance of policy and

economic variables in determining the fiscal burdens of reunification: [3] MLSS benefit

reduction; [4] EI benefit reduction; [5] separate operation of NPS; and [6] higher cost of

reconstruction of North Korea. In situation [3] we assume that the government specifies an upper

limit (300 percent of the average wage of North Koreans) for MLSS benefits for North Korean

residents in order to prevent an excessively rapid increase in MLSS expenditures. In situation [4],

we assume that aggregate EI expenditure does not depend on the unemployment rate, under the

assumption that a substantial part of the unemployed will be covered by the MLSS system.

Scenario [5] assumes that the government maintains separate NPS systems in the two Korean

regions, in order to prevent a decrease in the benefit levels of South Korean residents. Except for

the separation, the same NPS system is assumed for the two regions. Case [6] assumes that the

reconstruction cost incurred by the government is 10 percent of GDP for 20 years after the

reunification instead of 5 percent, i.e., that government pays the whole cost of reconstruction of

the North Korean economy. The accounts for these scenarios are reported in the corresponding

columns of Tables 6 and 7, with summary measures reported in Table 2.

        As these tables show, the reduction in MLSS benefits for North Koreans would have a

substantial impact on the fiscal burden. The fiscal impact of the adjustment of EI is much smaller

than that of MLSS. Imposing the restriction on MLSS benefits reduces the required tax


                                                 23
adjustment to attain long-term fiscal balance from 53-54 percent of the current tax burden to 49-

50 percent (see Table 2), while imposing the reduction in EI benefits reduces the tax adjustment

only by 0.3 percent.

             Separate operation of the NPS raises overall fiscal burdens, since the benefit level of the

NPS for South Korean participants is not affected by reunification, while under the incorporated

system, the benefit levels fall considerably due to North Korean participation. But the fiscal

burden due to separate operation of the NPS is not very high. The required tax adjustment for

long-term fiscal balance increases by 0.7 percent of current tax burden.

             Doubling the assumed reconstruction cost from 5 percent to 10 percent of GDP for 20

years after reunification substantially increases fiscal burdens. The required tax adjustment for

long-term fiscal balance increases from 53-54 percent of the current tax burden to about 59

percent. But the impact of this increase in reconstruction cost, equal in magnitude to the entire

reconstruction cost initially assumed, is small relative to the overall impact of reunification on

the required long-run tax adjustment, from 23 percent in case [1] to 53-54 percent in case [2],

because a larger part of the reunification cost is attributable to the increase in social welfare

expenditure, relative to the low taxes that North Koreans will pay.

             Table 8 summarizes the sensitivity of our results, for variant NPI25 to variations in key

parameters (productivity growth of South Korea 26 and the interest rate 27 ), the length of the




25
     Those for NPII exhibit similar patterns.
26
  A higher growth rate in South Korea raises the reconstruction cost, since the required investment for the
productivity of North Korea to catch up becomes larger. In the case where South Korean productivity growth is 2
percent (1 percent), we assume that the reconstruction cost is 5.5 percent (4.5 percent) of South Korean GDP for 20
years after reunification, instead of the value of our base case (5 percent).
27
  We try sensitivity analysis for higher interest rates than in the base case, since our base case interest rate is quite
low compared with values typically assumed in previous research.



                                                          24
transition process for North Korea, and the behavior of North Korean fertility after reunification.

The base case results already discussed are presented in bold in the table.

          The generational imbalance is increasing with the interest rate and decreasing with

growth rate. The percentage difference is quite sensitive to the variations in the growth rate28 and

the interest rate, while the qualitative result that post-reunification fiscal policy in Korea is

imbalanced is sustained for a realistic range of growth and discount rates. The variation due to

these parameters in the tax (tax and transfer) adjustment required for fiscal balance, if imposed

on cohorts born in the year of reunification and later, spans a relatively narrow range, from 45

percent to 54 percent (from 29 percent to 32 percent).

          The base case assumes 50 years for the period of complete convergence between the two

Koreas. This assumption that convergence can be achieved in 50 years is generally regarded as

optimistic. Therefore, we consider more pessimistic assumptions about the speed of convergence.

A lower speed of convergence between South and North Korean productivity levels will increase

generational imbalance and the fiscal burden of reunification. Table 8 indicates the quantitative

impacts of more pessimistic assumptions concerning the adjustment process. If the adjustment

process is completed in 70 years after the reunification instead of within 50 years, the required

tax (tax and transfer) adjustment for long-term fiscal balance increases to 60 percent (36 percent)

because of the delay. A higher speed of convergence thus significantly reduces the fiscal burden

of reunification.

          Finally, we reconsider our assumptions about North Korean fertility. Thus far, we have

used the assumptions discussed above, that North Korean fertility will gradually fall from a rate

well above that in South Korea, eventually converging to the South Korean fertility rate. But, if
28
  The irregular pattern of the required adjustment with respect to the growth rate is due to the fact that there are two
conflicting forces affecting fiscal burden. Increasing productivity increases government transfers and consumption
as well as the tax bases of future generations.



                                                          25
the post-unification experience in Germany is any guide, the pattern may be different. In the few

years after the collapse of the Berlin wall, the total fertility rate in East Germany fell sharply

from a value well above that in West Germany to a value well below, then gradually recovered to

the West German rate (Federal Statistical Office of Germany 2003).29 Given the economic and

social disruptions that would occur immediately after reunification, a sharper drop in the North

Korean birth rate than we have assumed is certainly a reasonable possibility. Thus, we consider

the alternative assumption that the North Korean fertility rate drops immediately upon

unification to the South Korean rate. The result of this alternative assumption, shown in the last

column of Table 8, is to increase the per capita burden of fiscal adjustment, if the entire burden is

placed on the now smaller future generations, but to slightly lower the per capita burden, if

current generations share in the burden. For no method of distributing the burden, though, does

the change in fertility have a particularly large impact.


4.4. Comparison with the Case of German Reunification

             The fiscal burden of reunification is likely to be much heavier for Korea than for

Germany. According to estimates by Raffelhüschen and Walliser (1999) based on the NPII

variant, the generational imbalance for the base case was 156.1 percent, while that of the Korean

case under the same assumptions about the productivity growth rate (1.5 percent) and the real

discount rate (5 percent ) is 897.3 percent. The required tax adjustment for long-term fiscal

balance was much smaller in the German case. After Korean reunification, a 50.5 percent

increase in the overall tax burden30 would be required to restore fiscal balance, the bulk of which



29
     We are grateful to a referee for calling this to our attention.
30
  This percentage, for variant NPII, differs slightly from the value given in Table 8 for the same interest rate-growth
rate combination, 49.8 percent, which is based on the NPI variant.



                                                               26
is directly attributable to the added cost of reunification. In Germany, only a 9.5 percent increase

was estimated to be necessary to restore generational balance after reunification.

        The difference in the reunification cost is mainly due to differences in the productivity

gap and in relative population magnitudes. Productivity in North Korea relative to that of South

Korea (8 percent of the South Korean level as of 2000) is much lower than that of East Germany

relative to West Germany before unification (37 percent of the West German level). The

population ratio of North to South Korea (47 percent as of 2000) is much larger than that of East

to West Germany the year before German unification (26 percent as of 1989). Therefore, a much

longer transition period for complete convergence will be needed in the Korean case, and the

Korean government will inevitably pay much more during the transition for social welfare

benefits and government consumption.

        One other lesson from the German experience is that projections made prior to the

reunification process may be optimistic. Relatively early in the process of reunification, Gokhale,

Raffelhüschen and Walliser (1995) estimated a generational imbalance (based on variant NPI) of

26 percent. The comparable number reported by Raffelhüschen and Walliser (1999) just four

years later was 92 percent, reflecting the declining fiscal situation in Germany, at least part of

which appears attributable to the cost of reunification.


5. Conclusion

        This paper has reevaluated the fiscal impacts of Korean reunification using Generational

Accounting, considering the inter- and intra-generational redistribution of fiscal burdens among

current and future generations of South and North Koreans that could result from reunification.

Our findings suggest that early reunification will result in large increases in the fiscal burden for

most current and future generations of South Korea. The magnitude of the fiscal impact of


                                                 27
Korean reunification appears much larger than that of German unification, as the productivity

gap between South and North Korea is much larger than existed between East and West Germany,

and because North Korea has a much larger population, relative to South Korea, than was true of

East Germany relative to West Germany. The findings also suggest that the fiscal burden due to

increased social welfare expenditure for the North Koreans (relative to their tax payments) is

much more important than the reconstruction of the North Korean economic system in

determining the fiscal burden of reunification.

        Economic cooperation between the two Koreas, to help speed the growth of productivity

in North Korea, could alleviate some of the projected burdens. Reforms of South Korea’s fiscal

policies, needed to help restore fiscal balance even without reunification, take on added

importance in light of the large added burdens of reunification. Without such reforms, the total

fiscal burdens faced by South Koreans in the future will be substantially higher than at present,

making it likely that the government will face strong resistance from South Korean residents and

a difficult road to convergence of the two Korean economies.


Appendix. Estimation of the Reconstruction Cost

        We assume that the production technology is represented by a Cobb-Douglas function:


        Y = F ( K , eN ) = K θ (eN )
                                   1−θ
(A1)


where Y, K, N, and θ are GDP, the aggregate capital stock, aggregate labor (represented by the

economically active population) and the capital income share. The term e accounts for the level

of multifactor productivity, expressed in labor-augmenting units.

        Under the assumption of a competitive labor market, the South-North wage ratio is:




                                                  28
                                        θ             1−θ                        θ

         wN  eN     K N / (eN N N )       eN    
                                                             K
                                                             N      N S    
                                                                                 



        (A2) indicates that the wage gap results from differences in multifactor productivity as

well as in capital intensity. We assume that, along path of convergence, the multifactor

productivity gap is reduced by technology spillovers from South Korea to North Korea, i.e., that

the reconstruction cost comes from paying for part of North Korea’s capital accumulation.

                                                     wS e S
By assuming a balanced growth path, i.e.,              =    , and solving (A2) for the ratio of aggregate
                                                     wN e N

capital stocks, we get:


         K S  w S  N S      
(A3)        =               
         K N  w N  N N    


        Using (A3), the paths assumed for the ratios of labor productivity (wS/wN) and

economically active populations (NS/NN), and the assumed capital-output ratio of 3 (which pins

down capital stock levels), we compute the path of North Korea’s aggregate capital stock

required for its labor productivity to reach South Korea’s by the end of the transition. We then

compute the corresponding path of (gross) investment in North Korea, under the additional

assumption that the annual economic depreciation rate is 5 percent. We assume that the rate of

investment by North Korea itself is the same as that of South Korea, and that the residual

investment must be financed by South Korean residents for a period of 20 years after

reunification.
