The past 25 years has seen substantial change in the social safety nets for families with children
in the US and Canada. Both countries have moved away from cash welfare but the US has done
so relying more exclusively on inwork benefits with work requirements. This paper examines this
evolution across the two countries and examines the effects on employment and poverty. In
particular, we focus on the two largest programs over this period: the U.S. EITC and the
Canadian NCB/CCTB. In light of these policy changes, we examine trends in employment and
poverty of the most affected families -- single mothers with less than a college degree -- across
the two countries. We find that employment improved substantially in both countries, absolutely
and relative to a control group of single women without children. The cross-country differences
in relative trends are mainly explained by differences in the labor market conditions. Poverty
rates for single mothers also declined in both countries with more of the decline coming through
market income in the U.S. and benefit income in Canada.

I. Introduction

       The past 25 years has been a period of active policy reform in the social safety nets

of both the United States and Canada. Perhaps more than any other area of social policy,

programs in both countries aimed at low-income families and children have evolved from

their pre-1990 form. In 1990 in the United States federal cash welfare was an entitlement,

the Earned Income Tax Credit was a modest program, and there was no Child Tax Credit.

Additionally, public health insurance for low income families with children was largely

limited to those receiving cash welfare. In Canada there was no National Child Benefit,

Canada Child Tax Benefit, or Working Income Tax Benefit, and most benefits took the form

of cash welfare. Today, the U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit and the Canadian National Child

Benefit (and its successor the Canadian Child Benefit) provide the backbone of the social

safety net for low income families with children in both countries. These changes to the

social safety net in the two countries have evolved in ways that are similar to one another,

and yet there are notable differences between programs that reflect distinctly different

policy goals. The purpose of this paper is to examine this evolution across the two

countries, and to provide and review evidence on how the programs have fared in

achieving their goals.

       This paper focuses on single women of working age with children and the social

safety net that is provided to this group. Changes in labor supply and poverty for men and

for those without children over this period also provides for interesting study and while

not the subject of this paper we do provide some evidence on the changes in employment

and poverty for women without children as a comparison group. However, our focus is on

single women with children for several reasons. First, as we describe below, the major


                                              1
changes in the social safety net over the past 25 years have focused on providing benefits

to low-income families; less assistance is available, and less change has occurred, for single

individuals. Second, a significant amount of research in the past two decades has focused

on the relationship between these safety net programs and the labor market performance

of women as well as the educational and health outcomes for children. Third, while many of

the current programs and policies are aimed at children, independent of family structure,

we focus on single mothers because of their greater disadvantage. Finally, while these

programs have increased in generosity over the past 25 years, a good deal of poverty in

both countries remains concentrated among this group.

       Overall we find that the introduction and evolution of the EITC and NCB have had

positive effects on labor force attachment and poverty. Our findings suggest that

employment for single mothers without a college degree has increased over this period in

both countries and has caught-up to employment for childless women. While employment

for single women (with and without children) declined in the U.S. and not Canada after

2000, our findings show that this decline can be explained by differences in the labor

markets between the two countries (rather than changes in the social safety net).

Estimating a pooled difference in difference model controlling for local labor market

conditions, the relative changes in labor force participation for single mothers across the

two countries is statistically indistinguishable.

       Our evidence also suggests that poverty rates, measured both using after tax and

transfer income and with private income, have declined with the introduction of the EITC

and NCB. By the end of the period, the overall incidence of poverty, however, is lower in

Canada compared to the U.S. reflecting the more generous system (and its stronger cash


                                               2
welfare system). While the effects of these policy changes on poverty for single mothers are

qualitatively similar across the two countries, they also reflect the different policy choices.

The U.S. system, built on work requirements, leads to poverty improvements that reflect

relatively more gains in market wages while the Canadian system, mainly without work

requirements and more universal, leads to poverty improvements more through the

benefit system.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In section II we discuss the social

safety nets in the two countries and document the major changes that have taken place

over the past 25 years. In Section III we briefly discuss the previous literature examining

the effects of EITC and the NCB on employment and poverty. In Section IV we present

trends for women with children based on tabulations from the Current Population Survey

(for the U.S.) and the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (for Canada). In Section V we

present estimates from a pooled difference-in-difference model comparing single women

with kids to single women without kids in both Canada and the US. By combining data from

the two countries and controlling for the differing labor market conditions, we better

identify what is driving differences in employment and poverty. We conclude in Section VI.



II. Major changes in social safety net in the U.S. and Canada over the past 25 years

Changes in the United States

       Over the past twenty-five years, the social safety net for families with children in the

U.S. has changed dramatically. The main changes in the cash or near-cash benefits include a

reduction in cash welfare (welfare reform), the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit

and the introduction and expansion of the Child Tax Credit.


                                               3
       Since 1935, a central feature in the U.S. safety net for families with children was a

cash welfare program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The

program was means-tested, requiring families to satisfy income and asset tests. The

benefits were structured in a manner typical for income-support programs: If a family had

no income, they received the maximum benefit (guarantee) and as earnings increased the

benefit was reduced by the benefit reduction rate. States set the overall generosity of AFDC,

by setting the maximum benefits. The benefit reduction rate was high—varying over time

between 67 percent and 100 percent--providing strong disincentives for work (Moffitt,

1983). AFDC provided an income floor, though a fairly low one: on the eve of welfare

reform the median state maximum benefit was 36 percent of poverty (U.S. House of

Representatives, 1996).

       Concerns about disincentive to work and form two-parent families led to the reform

of the program. This began in the early 1990s, when about half of the states were granted

waivers to modify their AFDC programs. Following this, the Personal Responsibility and

Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) was enacted in 1996, eliminating AFDC

and replacing it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The key elements

of PRWORA include work requirements, lifetime time limits on the duration of welfare

receipt, financial sanctions for failing to adhere to the work requirements or other rules,

and enhanced earnings disregards. The time limit (statutorily limited at 5 years but set as

low as 2 years by some states) is an important provision in the law in that it eliminated the

entitlement nature of the program. The federal funding also changed from an (uncapped)

matching formula under AFDC to a (capped nominal) block grant under TANF. Under

TANF, states have enormous flexibility in how and on whom the block grant is spent. In


                                              4
2014, on average only 26 percent of the block grant is used for cash benefits with about 10

states spend less than 10 percent of the block grant on cash (compared to nearly 100% for

AFDC). In 2014 only 26 of every 100 families with children in poverty receives cash

benefits, down from 72 of every 100 in 1996 (Bitler and Hoynes 2016a).

       At the same time that out of work assistance (welfare) was contracting, in work

assistance through the Earned Income Tax Credit was expanding. The EITC began in 1975

as a modest program aimed at offsetting the social security payroll tax for low-income

families with children. The EITC is refundable so that a taxpayer with no federal tax

liability receives a tax refund from the government for the full amount of the credit.

Taxpayers receive the EITC as an annual payment as part of their federal taxes. Receipt of

the EITC requires earned income and at low levels of earnings the credit is a pure earnings

subsidy. At higher levels of income, the credit is phased out. EITC generosity increases with

number of children (capped at three or more children)1 and a very small credit exists for

individuals with no children. In 2017, a family with two children has a phase-in rate

(earnings subsidy) of 40% for earnings up to $14,040, beginning at $18,340 the credit is

phased out at a rate of 21.06% percent. The maximum benefit is $5,616 and at $45,007

they earn enough to be ineligible for the credit (Tax Policy Center 2016a).2 The EITC is

based on joint income; married couples have the same phase-in rate, maximum benefit, and

phase-out rate, but the phase-out region begins at a higher earnings level ($5,550 higher in


1 Qualifying children must be under age 19 (or 24 if a full-time student) or permanently
disabled and residing with the taxpayer for more than half the year.
2 In 2017, the parameters for other groups are as follows, for families with one child (three

or more children) the phase-in rate is 34% (45%), the maximum credit is $3,400 ($6,318)
and the phase-out range is from $18,340 to $39,617 ($18,340 to $48,340). For taxpayers
without children the subsidy rate is 7.65%, maximum credit is $510, and the credit is
phased out between $8,340 and $15,010.

2016).

         Significant expansions to the EITC have taken place since 1990. In 1990 the credit

was expanded and in 1993 it was expanded more significantly. The 1993 law more than

doubled the maximum credit for families with two or more children (from $1,511 in 1993

to $3,556 in 1996) and increased by 50 percent for families with one child ($1,434 to

$2,152). The 1993 law also introduced a very small credit for taxpayers without children

(in 2017, a maximum credit of $510 compared to $3,400 for those with one child). In 2009

as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the separate schedule for families

with three or more children was added. The EITC is received by 28 million tax filing units,

almost 20 percent of all tax filers and 44 percent of filers with children receive the EITC

(Internal Revenue Service 2016).3

         The Child Tax Credit (CTC) was introduced in 1997. It is structurally similar to the

EITC, but more universal in design and less targeted on lower-income families. The

maximum credit is $1,000 per child less than 17. The phase in rate is 15%; with a very

large flat zone for the credit and a low phase-out rate (5%), the credit extends to families

with incomes as high as $150,000 for married couples ($115,000 for singles) for families

with two children. Unlike the EITC, the CTC is not inflation adjusted; the nominal maximum

credit has been unchanged at $1,000 per child since 2003.

         The CTC, unlike the EITC, is not fully refundable. The refundable portion of the CTC

is known as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and is limited to 15% of earned income




3The EITC is federal, but states can and do include EITCs as part of the state income tax
system. As of 2016, twenty-six states offer state EITCs (Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities 2016), though they tend to be small add-ons to the federal credit, averaging
around 15-20% of the federal credit (Tax Policy Center, 2016b).
                                               6
above a fixed threshold. This threshold was $11,750 (in nominal dollars) in 2007,

preventing most low income families from receiving meaningful CTCs. But in 2009, the

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act reduced the threshold to $3,000 (again

nominal). This allowed more taxpayers to claim the ACTC and increased the amount of

refundable credits, making the low-income portion of the schedule more similar to the

EITC.

        In addition to the cash or near cash safety net, the two more important inkind

programs for low income families with children are food stamps and Medicaid. Food

stamps, now known as Supplemental Assistance for Needy Families or SNAP, is a means-

tested program and benefits are based on maximum benefit level that is reduced with

additional earnings using a benefit reduction or phase-out rate. While the eligibility and

benefits are like cash welfare, it is a voucher that can be spent on (most) food items in the

grocery store. Benefits are adjusted for changes in prices each year. It is federal and has

little variation and little scope for rule-setting by states. The benefit reduction rate for

SNAP is relatively low for a welfare program (30 percent), the gross income eligibility

threshold is higher (at 130 percent of poverty) than other U.S. cash welfare programs, thus

the program serves the working and non-working poor. 4 It has largely remained

unreformed during this time period.

        While not though the focus of our analysis, another important change during this




4 Welfare reform left Food Stamp rules relatively unaffected. However, beginning with
regulatory changes in 1999 and continuing with the 2002 Farm Bill, the USDA has allowed
states to make changes in how they implement the program’s rules to facilitate obtaining
access to benefits. This has led to a relaxation of asset requirements and expanded gross
income eligibility in what has been called broad-based categorical eligibility (U.S.
Government Accountability Office, 2007).

period is the expansion of public health insurance for low to moderate income children.

This began with expansions to Medicaid (between 1986 and 1990), followed by the

introduction of and expansions to the State Children’s Health Insurance Program

(introduced in 1997, expanded in the 2000s), and most recently with the Affordable Care

Act of 2010. The result is a dramatic decline in the share of children who are uninsured –

from 13% in 1990 to 6% in 2015 (Child Trends 2016). 5

Changes in Canada

       The structure of the social safety net for families with children in Canada also

changed significantly since the early 1990s. Most significantly, in 1993 Canada introduced

the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), a refundable tax credit (replacing the former child tax

credit and family allowance) payable to families with children up to 17 years old. The

benefit is paid monthly from July to June based on reported income in the previous tax

year. The benefit increased with the number of children. Importantly, there was no work

requirement to receive the benefit (thus those with and without earned income received

the benefit). As of 2014-2015 the benefit phased out for family net income over $43,953 at

a rate of 2% for one child and 4% for two or more children. In 1998 Canada added the

National Child Benefit Supplement (NCB) to the CCTB, aimed, in part, at assisting parents in

transitioning from welfare to work. The benefit, based on the number of children, is paid in

addition to the CCTB and for net incomes over $25,584 (in 2014-15) it phased out more

sharply at rates of 12.2% for one child, 23.0% for the second child and 33.3% for the third.


5 The period has also seen a steady decline in real value of federal minimum wage. The
current rate of $7.25 has been fixed in nominal terms since 2009. In the recent period,
there have been many cities and states that are setting and expanding local minimum
wages above the (low) federal rate. This is not an element of the social safety net per se, but
is highly relevant for a social safety net built around work.
                                                 8
The NCB was a joint federal-provincial program and provinces could, at their discretion,

subtract NCB payments from their welfare programs and use the recovered funds for other

social programs. As a result, the benefits available through the NCB differ significantly

across provinces. Overall, the CCTB / NCB benefits phase out at higher earnings and less

steeply than cash welfare, leading to increases in the work incentives that single mothers

face.

        In 2006 the Canadian government added a universal child care benefit of $100 per

month for each child under age 6. Unlike the CCTB this benefit is taxable and was paid

together with the CCTB and NCB. In 2007 Canada also added a Working Income Tax

Benefit (WITB), similar in structure to the EITC in that it supplements earned income. It is

available to low income earners (regardless of whether they have children or not) and, like

the CCTB and NCB, the amount payable has increased over time. It is paid separately

(quarterly from other benefits). At the federal level there are a few additional tax credits

available to families that are still available (the federal dependent children tax credit and

related credits).

        Finally, as of July 2016 the government of Canada introduced the new Canada Child

Benefit (CCB) to replace the existing child benefit programs (the combined Canada child tax

benefit, national child benefit and universal child care benefit). The new CCB is $6400 (tax

free, unlike the universal child care benefit) for each child up to age 5 and $5400 for each

child ages 6 – 17. The benefit is phased out starting at $30,000 with a second kink point at

$65,000 family net income. The phase out rate depends on the number of children. 6 The


6The reduction is calculated as follows: families with one eligible child: the reduction is 7% of the amount of
AFNI between $30,000 and $65,000, plus 3.2% of the amount of AFNI over $65,000. Families with two eligible
children: the reduction is 13.5% of the amount of AFNI between $30,000 and $65,000, plus 5.7% of the
amount of AFNI over $65,000. Families with three eligible children: the reduction is 19% of the amount of
                                                      9
benefit is paid monthly starting in July of each year. Given how new this change is, we note

the new program here but it is not included in our empirical analysis below.

        The provinces also offer a variety of supports for low-income families including both

welfare programs and cash benefit income programs (for example, Ontario offers the

Ontario Child Benefit, similar in design to the National Child Benefit, which we include in

our hypothetical budget constraint below). Instead of describing these programs in detail

here we list the major provincial benefit programs in Appendix A. In general, programs

have evolved in a number of provinces alongside the federal benefits, toward families with

children and away from single individuals, although (smaller) welfare programs do remain.

        Overall, Canada’s social safety net has evolved over the past two decades toward

providing more resources for families with children. In some cases these have replaced

some of the support that was previously available through social assistance/welfare

programs for families in the provinces. Traditional welfare benefits, on the other hand,

remain the primary source of support for individuals without children. Notably, the new

family benefits do not require labor market income to qualify (with the exception of the

WITB which makes up a fairly small portion of the overall support). Finally, the programs

work to reduce the welfare wall that exists in most social security programs with a gradual

phase out of benefits with earned income of approximately $15,000, particularly in those

provinces that integrated increased family benefits with declining welfare benefits.

Comparing the sources of support in Canada and the United States.

        To summarize these programs, Figure 1 plots real per capita expenditures since



AFNI between $30,000 and $65,000, plus 8% of the amount of AFNI over $65,000. Families with four or
more eligible children: the reduction is 23% of the amount of AFNI between $30,000 and $65,000, plus 9.5%
of the amount of AFNI over $65,000.
                                                   10
1990 for AFDC/TANF, EITC, the CTC, and SNAP. Post welfare reform, cash welfare (TANF)

has declined dramatically. The EITC, on the other hand, has increased substantially. The

CTC has expanded recently and spending has almost reached the levels of the EITC and

SNAP.

        While we are unable to report per capita expenditure by program in Canada, we

report aggregate per capita spending (including federal, provincial and local government

spending) over time in Canada in figure 1b. While there was an initial decline in per capita

social spending through the mid-1990s (Canada went through a major deficit reduction

exercise during this period beginning in 1995) it was followed by an increase in spending

to almost pre-1994 levels over the 2000s, in part generated by the introduction of new

federal programs and increased generosity of the NCB over this period.

        Figures 2 and 3 show the cash and near cash sources of support for hypothetical

families in the U.S. and Canada. For each country we consider a single mother with two

children and simulate the benefits for a range of annual earnings; all benefits amounts and

earnings are in 2015 (Canadian or U.S) dollars.7 These figures show only positive elements

of the tax and transfer system (i.e. do not include income taxes paid).

        Beginning with the U.S., we present the budget constraint for 1992 (Figure 2a) and

2015 (Figure 2b) for a single mother with two children living in Colorado. In 1992, welfare

is still an entitlement, the EITC has not been expanded, and the CTC has yet to be

introduced. Comparing the budget constraints in 1992 and 2015, we see striking evidence

of the shift in resources away from out of work to in-work. For example, in 1992 a single


7For the U.S. calculations, we assume that the household spends $6,000 per year on child
care, $8,400 per year on housing, and that the children are ages 4 and 6. For Canada we
assume 2 children under the age of 18 living in Ontario.
                                             11
mother with two children who is not working receives $12,600 (2015 USD) in assistance

(AFDC+SNAP), this falls by half to $6,132 (2015 USD) in 2015. In 2015 if the woman works

full time at the federal minimum wage (of $7.25) she would earn about $15,000. Benefits

for this minimum wage full time worker rises from about $5,206 in 1992 to $11,600 (both

in 2015 USD). This is a striking change. Also clear in these budget constraints are the high

implied tax rates faced by very low earning women in 1992 in contrast to the negative tax

rates for the same women in 2015.

       The Canadian budget constraints illustrate the programs available for a single

parent family with two children in the province of Ontario. In 1992 (Figure 3a) the major

source of support was welfare provided through the provinces. Federal supports came

through a series of small tax credits. By 2015 (Figure 3b) welfare (labeled “Ontario

Works”) plays a much smaller role in the total support available, focused mainly on those

with very low incomes. Instead, the Canada Child Tax Benefit (taking the place of the

largest of the 1992 credits), National Child Benefit, Working Income Tax Benefit, and

Universal Child Care Benefit provide considerable support for a much larger share of the

population. The structure of benefits changes significantly over this period. Ontario works,

like most cash welfare programs, provides out of work benefits that are phased out sharply

even at the lowest earnings levels. In contrast, the CCTB and NCB phases out more slowly

and the phase out begins at much higher earnings levels (more than $20,000). In contrast

to the EITC, the CCTB and NCB are also available to those out of work. The WITB phases in

with earned income, like the EITC, and the UCCB is universal. A child benefit in Ontario

supplements the federal child benefits, operating in much the same fashion as the NCB.

       Overall, several features stand out in these figures. First, there have been significant


                                              12
changes in policy design in both countries over the past few decades. The nature of

support, the conditions required, and the generosity have all changed in both countries.

       Second, for families with children, both countries have moved away from a welfare-

based out-of-work benefit system with high phase-out rates that dominated both countries

in 1992. Figure 2a and 3a show that in 1992, welfare was the main source of support in

Canada (e.g. Ontario Works) and the U.S. (e.g. AFDC plus SNAP). Benefit levels were higher

in Canada, but both countries targeted the non-working poor and high phase-out rates

would be expected to discourage work. Both countries have introduced programs that

move away from pure out of work assistance. In the US, the EITC provides strong incentives

to enter work (and cash welfare was substantially reduced) and Canada implemented an

EITC-like in work credit (Working Income Tax Benefit) thereby lessening the work

disincentives of a welfare based support system. 8

       Third, benefits in Canada start with universal (or near universal) child supports that

are not tied to work. This includes the universal child care benefit, the national child benefit

supplement, the child tax benefit as well as the provincial versions of these programs.

However, in contrast to cash welfare, the child supports have lower phase-out rates that

begin at higher earnings levels. The combined effect is to encourage work relative to before

these programs were implemented. In contrast, the U.S. is almost entirely based on a

system of benefits tied to work; the EITC and the child related tax credits all require wage

income in order to qualify and over the range that affects the poorest families, benefits

increase as wage income increases. The incentives to work embedded in the EITC are




8The working income tax benefit, while similar to the EITC in design, makes up a much
smaller share of the total benefit available to families.
                                               13
therefore stronger than those in Canada. Post-welfare reform. SNAP is only source of out of

work assistance, and thus while in work benefits have expanded the basic income floor has

decreased. We consider the difference in work requirement across the two countries one

difference that may matter.

        Fourth, the level of generosity between the two sets of programs is quite different.

In both 1992 and 2015 Canada provides more support to low income families. For example,

in 1992, the maximum benefit in the U.S. (e.g. that received if not working), including cash

and near cash benefits such as food stamps (Figure 2a) was approximately $13,000 (2015

USD). This fell to a little over $6,000 (2015 USD) in 2015 (Figure 2b) primarily due to the

reform of cash welfare. The maximum cash benefit in Canada in 1992 is about $27,000

(2015 CDN) and fell to about $25,000 (2015 CDC) in 2015. (PPP across the two countries

over much of this period is approximately 1.22 although the exchange rate fluctuated

considerably9). At an earnings level of $20,000 in 2015, benefits are about $20,000 in

Canada compared to $12,000 in the US. Thus, clearly Canada provides a much higher level

of support, particularly so for those at very low or zero earnings. The difference in the

generosity of the social safety net is a second difference that may matter.

        We include similar budget constraints for childless adults for both countries in

Appendix Figures 1 and 2. What is immediately evident is that the range of benefits

available for single individuals is considerably more limited in both countries. In Canada

the available benefits are welfare benefits and the small working income tax benefit. In the

U.S. benefits for childless individuals are SNAP and a small EITC. The Canadian out of work

benefits are more generous – the maximum benefit for a single person is $7,872 in 2015 in

Ontario, Canada (the benefits are at the provincial level)_ compared to $2,000 in the U.S.

         In order to understand how these changes in benefits coupled with income taxes

have affected the incentives to work in the two countries we calculate the average tax rate

(ATR) imposed by moving from (1) no work to part-time work, (2) no work to full-time

work, and (3) part-time work to full-time work. The ATR are calculated based on all of the

benefits modeled in the budget constraints above as well as ordinary income taxes. We

calculate average tax rates for single women with two children (as in the budget sets

above). We use the nominal minimum wage in each country in 201510 and the real value of

that wage in 1992 as a representative wage, along with 125%, 150% and 200% of the

minimum wage, and consider part time work as 20 hours per week and full time work as

40 hours per week. The results are reported in Table 1. The top panel presents the average

tax rates for the U.S. in both 1992 and 2015. The difference in the U.S. average tax rates

between 1992 and 2015 is striking. Whereas tax rates were almost always above 50% for

individuals moving from no work to work and part time to full time work in 1992, by 2015

they were negative for moving to part-time work in all four wage categories and remain

significantly smaller for movements into full time work. For example, a single mother with

two children working at 150% of the minimum wage faces a -9% average tax rate for

entering full time work in 2015 compared to 53% in 1992. For moving from part to full

time work the average tax rate has fallen from 45% to 26%. Overall the incentives to work

in the U.S. have risen dramatically over this period for single mothers in the U.S.

         The average tax rates also declined across all wage and work levels in Canada

(bottom panel of Table 1). For example, a single mother with two children working at


10   This amounts to $7.25 USD in the U.S. and $11 CAD in Canada.
                                               15
150% of the minimum wage faces a 52% average tax rate for entering full time work in

2015 compared to 83% in 1992. For moving from part to full time work the average tax

rate has fallen from 106% to 70%. This is a significant decline in average tax rates in

Canada which given the cumulative phase out of welfare and provincial benefits, could

exceed 100% in 1992. However, compared to the U.S. the average tax rates remain high –

average tax rates from moving between not working to part or full time work range from a

low of 24% to as high as 75%11. The differences between Canada and the United States

reflects the fact that, with the exception of the WITB, most of the benefits in Canada are at

their maximum at zero income, and while the phase out of the child benefits does not occur

with the first dollar of earnings, an individual working full time at minimum wage is well

into the phase out range. Appendix Table 1 shows the ATRs for single women without

children; it is evident that work disincentives for this group have not changed much over

time and remain quite high (in an absolute sense, and compared to single women without

children).

        Our budget set and tax rate analysis suggests several predictions for the trends in

employment and poverty across the two countries. The changes in the social safety net

should lead to increases in employment for single women with children, relative to single

women without children, in both the U.S. and Canada. All else equal, employment should

rise by more in the U.S. than in Canada given the greater decline in average tax rate.

Poverty should decline in both countries, though the U.S. decline should reflect more

heavily gains in market income (due to the work requirement) while the Canadian decline



11 By 2015 Ontario had ended the clawback of welfare benefits from the NCB. Ignoring changes in income tax
rates, the change in average tax rates would have been even larger over some ranges had the clawback
remained in place.
                                                   16
should reflect more heavily gains in benefits (due to the universality of benefits). All else

equal, we would also expect that absolute level of poverty rates would be higher in the U.S.

compared to Canada, given the higher level of support in Canada (throughout the period).

Additionally, we expect deep poverty (those with income less than 50% of the poverty line)

to have risen in the U.S. relative to Canada given the reduction in out-of-work support post-

welfare reform.12



III. Previous literature

       There is a substantial amount of evidence about the effects of the U.S. EITC and

Canadian NCB on family and child wellbeing over the past two decades and we discuss only

some highlights of it here. For more comprehensive reviews of the effects of the changes in

the social safety net, see the studies on welfare reform (e.g., Blank 2001, 2002, Grogger and

Karoly 2005, Moffitt 2003, and Ziliak 2016) and the EITC (Hotz and Scholz, 2003, Nichols

and Rothstein 2016, Hoynes and Rothstein 2016, Eissa and Hoynes 2006). In particular,

studies show that the EITC leads to substantial increases in employment for single mothers

(e.g., Eissa and Liebman 1996, Meyer and Rosenbaum 2000, 2001, Hoynes and Patel 2015)

with little evidence that existing workers reduce hours worked.13 Many of these studies use

a difference-in-difference approach comparing single women with children to women

without children (who are eligible only for a very small EITC) in periods before and after an




12 A final difference that isn’t evident in the figures but that potentially affects the
effectiveness of the social safety net is how benefits are paid to recipients. In Canada, the
CCTB/NCB/UCCB are all paid monthly. The WITB is paid quarterly. In the U.S., the EITC and
the CTC is paid annually. (Food stamps are paid monthly.)

phase-in region (Chetty, Friedman and Saez 2013, Saez 2010, Chetty and Saez 2013).
                                                 17
expansion in the EITC. The magnitudes are large – for example, Meyer and Rosenbaum

(2001) find that the EITC raised labor force participation by 7.2 percentage points for

single women with children relative to those without children between 1984 and 1996.

Hoynes and Patel (2015) find that the 1993 expansion increased employment of single

mothers with less than a college degree by 6.1 percentage points.14

       Milligan and Stabile (2007) investigate the effect of the introduction of the Canadian

NCB, and the ability of provinces to choose to subtract NCB payments from social

assistance/welfare, on the labor force participation of single mothers. The findings suggest

substantial labor market effects from the integration of benefits and social assistance. A

$1000 increase in benefits deducted from social assistance payments is associated with a 3-

4 percentage point decline in social assistance take up and an equivalent 3-4 percentage

point increase in employment. The effects are concentrated on the extensive margin of

labor force participation.

       A handful of studies have estimated the effect of the EITC on poverty. Hoynes and

Patel (2015) use a difference-in-difference approach and find that the 1993 EITC expansion

led to a 7.9 percentage point reduction in poverty. Their finding suggest that ignoring the

indirect effects of the EITC (increased earnings net of changes in other income) leads to an

underestimate—by as much as a 50% --of the anti-poverty effects of the EITC. Earlier

studies examined the effect of state EITC supplements on poverty (Neumark and Wascher

2001, Gunderson and Ziliak 2004) finding qualitatively similar effects.




14Eissa and Liebman (1996) examined the earlier 1986 expansion of the EITC and find that
labor force participation increased by 2.8 percentage points for single women with
children, relative to single women without children.

IV. Trends in demographics, employment and poverty

       In this section we examine the trends across the U.S. and Canada in demographics,

female employment and absolute poverty. Our analysis uses data from the U.S. Current

Population Survey (CPS) and the Canadian Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics where

we have harmonized the sample, data and variables to maximize comparability across the

two countries. To focus on the working age population, for both countries we limit our

analysis to women aged 25-54. Because of our interest in the social safety net and the

disadvantaged, our core sample is single women who have less than a college degree. 15 To

highlight the trends for single mothers, we compare trends across two groups: single

women with children and single women without children. We use a time period that spans

the major changes in the social safety net that we describe above though the exact years

differ somewhat across the two surveys. We briefly describe the two surveys below; for

more details on our data and variable construction, see the Appendix B.

       For the U.S. analysis, we use the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the

Current Population Survey, administered to most households in March every year. The

CPS-ASEC is an annual survey of about 90,000 households (or about 175,000 persons) that

collects labor market, income, and program participation information for individuals for

the previous calendar year, as well as demographic information at the time of the survey.

Our sample uses the 1991 through 2012 CPS-ASEC surveys, corresponding to the 1990-

2011 calendar years. Employment is measured as having any work during the calendar

year. We measure income and poverty at the household level, after dropping unrelated

or GED, and those who have some college but less than a four year degree.
                                             19
children (as does the Census Bureau). Our analysis is weighted using the March

supplement person weight.

       For the Canadian analysis, we use the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics

(SLID). The SLID is conducted annually by Statistics Canada with a stratified random

sampling of Canadians. As with the CPS, with survey weights, the data are nationally

representative. Our analysis uses public-use cross sectional individual and census family

files providing data for calendar years 1996 through 2011.16 The SLID provides

information on income and benefits received over the past year and detailed information

on demographics at the time of the interview. The survey consists of approximately 55,000

people per year, our sample of women ages 25-54 results in a sample of approximately

16,000 per year (considerably smaller than the corresponding sample in the CPS). For the

purpose of the Canadian analysis we treat individuals as married if they report being either

married or common law married and single otherwise.



Trends in demographics

       We begin by examining trends in the demographics underlying our sample of single

women with children. Figure 4 presents the share of women 25-54 with less than a college

education who are single with children, in the U.S. and Canadian samples. Both countries

experienced increases in single parenthood, though the rate is much higher in the U.S. The

share that are single mothers in the U.S. rose from 17 percent in 1990 to 23 percent by the


16The SLID replaced the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) as the major cross sectional
survey for labor market data as of 1996. Using previous years of the SCF or the longitudinal
SLID files that exist for the SLID in 1993 and 1994 produced inconsistent samples due to
questionnaire changes and collection and weighting changes that made results from
previous years misleading. Therefore we begin the Canadian data series in 1996.
                                               20
end of the period for those with less than a college degree. The share that are single

mothers in Canada (among those with less than a college degree) rose from just over 11

percent in 1996 to 13 percent by the end of the period.

Trends in Employment

       In Figure 5, we plot the share of women 25-54 with less than a college degree who

worked at all during the calendar year. For each country we show the share working for

single women with and without children; the figure pools this for both countries. While our

focus is on single women with children, we include women without children to highlight

the changes occurring for single mothers.

       In the U.S., employment for non-college graduate single mothers increased sharply

between the early 1990s and late 1990s. For example, the share working at all last year

increased from 69 percent in 1992 to 82 percent in 2000. This increase closes the

substantial gap in employment rates between single mothers and single women without

children that existed in the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2000, both groups

experience a steady downward trend in employment rates dropping by 10 percentage

points over this period.

       While the Canadian data start a few years later, we see a striking rise in the

employment rate of single mothers - rising from 62 percent in 1996 to 77 percent in 2001.

As with the U.S., this rise in employment closed the substantial employment gap (between

single women with and without children) that existed in the beginning of the period. In

contrast to the U.S., both groups experience steady employment through the end of the

period (2011) where the employment rates hover between 75 and 80%. Figure 6 presents

similar trends for full time work. Overall, these figures show similar patterns to those for


                                              21
any work in Figure 5. Notable, though, among single mothers with less than a college

degree, full-time employment rates are higher in Canada – ranging from 60 to 67 percent

compared to the peak in 2000 in the U.S. at 62 percent.

       Importantly, the post-2000 trends in Figures 5 and 6 differ significantly between the

U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., growth declined significantly after the historically strong labor

market of the late 1990s. This was punctuated by the Great Recession and the significant

downturn between 2008 and 2010. To illustrate the dramatic differences that emerge in

the macroeconomy over this period, Figure 7 presents the annual unemployment rate

series for both countries from 1990-2015. Historically, the U.S. unemployment rate has

been lower than Canada’s and the countries follow similar fluctuations. However, the U.S.

experienced a steady increase in unemployment in the 2000s along with a sharp increase

in the Great Recession. In contrast, while Canada’s unemployment rate was higher over the

1990s and early 2000s, Canada experienced a much smaller recession in 2008 followed by

a quicker recovery. This makes it quite difficult to derive conclusions about the role of the

social safety net by comparing trends across countries. We take a deeper dive into those

issues in the next section.

Trends in poverty

       To broaden our analysis to examine family well-being, here we examine trends in

poverty across the two countries. To facilitate comparisons across countries, we adopt the

OECD definition of absolute poverty (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and

Development, 2015), also recently highlighted in a UNICEF series on child poverty in the

Great Recession (UNICEF 2014, Bitler, Hoynes and Kuka 2014). The main advantage of this

approach is that one does not have to grapple with a different absolute poverty threshold


                                              22
across the two countries.17

       We construct the poverty rates for each country using the following process. First,

we compute an after tax and transfer (ATT) income measure for the family or household.18

Second, we compute equivalized ATT income (i.e. ATT income / equivalized household

size; where equivalized household size is computed using the OECD modified scale19).

Third, we compute the median of the equivalized ATT income in our base year, 1996

(chosen because it is the first year in the SLID; we use the same for the U.S.). The absolute

poverty line for 1996 is then 60% of the median of equivalized ATT income for 1996 (in

each country). To compute the absolute poverty lines for the other years, we start from the

1996 poverty line just computed and adjust for inflation. We refer to these as the “country



17 Official poverty in the U.S. is determined by comparing total pre-tax family cash income
to poverty thresholds, which vary by family size, number of children, and presence of
elderly persons. The poverty thresholds reflect a basket of goods set in the 1960s and are
adjusted each year for changes in prices. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a
family of three (one adult, two children) was $19,096. This measure has many drawbacks,
in particular is its omission of the key sources of support that we examine here: SNAP
(because it is inkind not cash), and the EITC and CTC (because they are taxes). The Census
now releases the Supplemental Poverty Measure along with official poverty in its annual
poverty reporting (Short, 2011). The SPM resource measure expands to include the cash
value of various in-kind transfers and nets out taxes (and deducts from income child
support payments, medical out of pocket expenditures, and work expenses including child
care). Additionally, the SPM family unit is modified to include cohabitors and their children
and poverty thresholds vary geographically. The Census SPM thresholds are defined to be
the average between the 30th and 36th percentiles of the distribution of consumer
expenditures on food, clothing, shelter, and utilities plus an additional 20 percent to
account for additional necessary expenditures. This makes the SPM a “quasi-relative”
poverty measure.
18 In the U.S. we use a “household” sharing rule, combining the income of all persons living

in the same household (excluding unrelated children). This allows for clear measurement
of inkind sources of income, including SNAP and energy assistance. See Bitler and Hoynes
(2016b) and Bitler, Hoynes and Kuka (2016) for more information on this measurement. In
the Canada we use the Census family (those related by birth and marriage). In practice in
the differences in outcomes for the Census and household income and poverty are minimal.
19 The OECD equivalized scale equals 1 for the head plus 0.5 for each additional adult [age

14+] plus 0.3 for each child [age < 14].

specific” absolute poverty rates.

       In addition to computing poverty rates using country-specific poverty thresholds,

we also compute a pooled poverty threshold using a modification of the methodology

described above. First, we convert Canadian income in each year to U.S. dollars using

published OECD PPP values for that year and then calculating the 1996 absolute poverty

threshold as described above, but using the combined U.S.-Canada income distribution

(now all in U.S. dollars). The absolute poverty threshold is then adjusted each year using

the U.S. CPI. We refer to this as the pooled absolute poverty rate.

       If the household (for the U.S.) or Census family (for Canada) has ATT equivalized

income below the equivalized poverty line, then they are assigned to be poor. In the case of

the combined US-Canada poverty threshold, we compare U.S. ATT income and Canadian

PPP adjusted ATT income to the combined threshold. To highlight the role of the labor

market versus the social safety net, we also construct a “private income” poverty measure.

Here the poverty thresholds remain the same. All that differs is the equivalized income

measure that is compared to the threshold. Private income is pre-tax and transfer income

and includes earned and unearned income. After tax and transfer income equals private

income plus cash transfers and the value of non-cash transfer payments, less payroll taxes

and net federal and state/provincial income taxes (including in-work benefits and child tax

benefits). For more information on income definitions for both countries see Appendix B.

       Figure 8 shows the trends in absolute ATT poverty for women aged 25-54 with less

than a college degree using the country-specific poverty thresholds described above.

Several things are evident in this figure. In the U.S. poverty rates for single mothers fall

between 1993 and 2000 absolutely and relative to single women without children, though


                                               24
throughout the period the poverty rate for single mothers remains higher than for single

women without children. Following the pattern for employment, beginning in 2000

poverty rates for both groups trend slowly up. In Canada, poverty rates for single mothers

throughout most of the period, falling dramatically relative to single women without

children. By the end of the period, the poverty rate for single mothers is below that for

single women without children (25% versus 33%).

       To explore the role of the social safety net in these trends, in Figure 9 we compare

private income poverty for the two groups of single women with less than a college degree

in the two countries. For the U.S. poverty rates for single mothers based on private income

are only slightly higher than ATT poverty at the beginning of the period (53% for private

income poverty versus 49% for ATT poverty), both decline over the 1990s along with a

slightly more pronounced increase over the 2000s for private income than for ATT income,

particularly following the Great Recession. In Canada, there is a similar level effect with

rates for single mothers starting at 60% for private income poverty versus 51% for ATT

poverty, with a similar decline over the 1990s and 2000s. However, in Canada private

income poverty for single mothers remains higher than for single women without kids over

the entire period, whereas ATT poverty levels for single mothers fall below those for

women without kids as noted above. In both countries it would appear that while part of

the decline in poverty is due to changes in market income, a growing part of the decline in

poverty over the 2000s is due to the effects of taxes and transfers. This is particularly so

for Canada.

       Figures 10 and 11 present trends in both ATT and private income poverty using a

pooled poverty measure across the two countries calculated using the combined income


                                              25
distribution (as described above). Perhaps surprisingly, using the pooled poverty threshold

reveals very similar patterns despite differences in income distribution between the two

countries. In the U.S. the drop in poverty rates for single mothers over the 1990s remains

as does the uptick over the 2000s. For Canada, poverty rates for single mothers drop

significantly over the 1990s and then continue to drop over the 2000s, passing the U.S.

poverty rate in 2005 and the rate for single women without children in Canada in 2006.

Similarly, using private income the decline in both countries is smaller and the poverty rate

for single mothers in Canada crosses that of the U.S. in 2007 and remains always above that

for single women without children.

Summary and connection to policy changes

       The trends in employment and poverty match the predictions of the policy changes,

discussed above. Single mothers in the U.S. and Canada increased employment closing the

historical employment gap between single women with and without children. Single

mothers also experienced reductions in poverty during this period, absolutely and relative

to single women without children. Consistent with the different models for reform, the U.S.

decline in poverty may be more driven by changes in market income while the Canadian

decline is more driven by changes in benefits. This reflect the work requirement in the U.S.

policies and a more universal approach in Canada. Additionally, by the end of the period,

absolute poverty rates in Canada are lower, consistent with the greater generosity in the

Canadian programs. On the other hand, given the work requirements in the U.S. and the

greater reductions in average tax rates embodied in the U.S. reforms (Table 1), we

predicted a larger increase in employment in the U.S.; the data is not consistent with that

prediction. One possible confounder is the difference in the macro labor market conditions


                                             26
across the two countries. We turn to that next.



V. Relative Trends in Employment and Poverty Combining U.S. and Canadian Data

       In order to better understand how much the different underlying labor markets

between the two countries drive the effects of the social safety net on single mothers we

use a regression framework where we combine the micro data from the two countries to

estimate models of employment and poverty rates. We combine the 1990 through 2011

data from the CPS and the 1996 through 2011 data from the SLID. Our sample consists of

all unmarried women ages 25 to 54 with less than college education in both countries. We

estimate a pooled difference-in-difference model while controlling for local labor market

conditions. In particular, the model includes fixed effects for the year*country,

year*country*single mother, state/ province as well as controls for the unemployment rate

(at the state/province x year level) and an interaction between the unemployment rate and

being a single mother20. We then plot the interaction terms for Canada * year * single

mother and US * year * single mother, using 1996 as a base year for both countries. This

allows us to examine the employment and poverty trends for single mothers relative to

single women without kids relative to the base year of 1996 for the two countries. We

present these results in figures 12 through 14.

       Figure 12 shows the relative trends for employment. Relative to 1996 and


20 As specification checks we run these models a) excluding Quebec from the analysis as
Quebec launched a subsidized day care program in 1997 that may have had separate
effects on employment for single mothers and b) include a dummy variable for those
province/years in Canada where welfare payments were reduced by the amount of the
NCB payment for NCB recipients. Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island all began by clawing back welfare payments from NCB recipients at the start
of the program.
                                            27
controlling for time trends and overall unemployment rates, employment for single

mothers (relative to single women without children) improved in both countries. While the

raw employment rates for single mothers presented in Figure 5 looked quite different for

the U.S. and Canada, once we normalize relative to the single women without children in

the country and control for difference in labor markets, the trends are remarkably

similar.21 The results are unchanged if we remove Quebec from the analysis and control for

the Canadian claw-back provinces.

       Figures 13 and 14 present similar results for absolute poverty levels using after tax

and transfer (ATT) income as well as using just private income. For these comparisons we

use the pooled poverty measure across the two countries described in section IV above.

Absolute poverty rates for single mothers using ATT income fell in both countries relative

to 1996 and single women without children. Once again, the relative decline in the two

countries, once we control for labor market differences, appears to be quite similar with no

statistically significant differences between the two trends. On the other hand, looking at

private income (Figure 14) the relative decline in the U.S. over parts of the sample range is

slightly larger, although no different post the Great Recession22. This is again consistent

with a larger share of the effect of the U.S. social safety net for single mothers coming

through market income relative to transfer income.




21 For employment (figure 12), the changes relative to 1996 and relative to single women
without children are not statistically different between the two countries (see p-value for
joint test of equality across countries at the bottom of the figure). For poverty, as is clear
visually, we can’t reject joint equality.
22 The results remain unchanged when we exclude Quebec and control for clawback

provinces.

VI. Conclusion

       The introduction of the EITC in the U.S. and the NCB/CCTB (and its successor) in

Canada represent a major change in the structure of the social safety net for single mothers

in both countries. The programs are striking in both their similarities and their differences.

They both reflect a move away from relying primarily on traditional welfare benefits. They

both encourage labor force participation either through having work requirements (EITC)

or lessening the welfare cliff with the introduction of child benefits that phase out at higher

levels (NCB) -- although clearly work incentives are stronger in the U.S. programs. The

evidence presented here suggests that these reforms have had positive employment effects

on single mothers – the group most targeted by the programs. We find that both sets of

programs are associated with a reduction in poverty rates among single women with

children. However, it appears that market income plays a larger role in the U.S. – consistent

with the stronger employment incentives inherent in the EITC – while benefit income may

play a relatively larger role in Canada.

       Despite the similarities in outcomes, there are some significant differences between

the programs. Perhaps the largest of these differences is in the work requirements: the

EITC requires household to work while the NCB/CCTB does not. In theory, we expect this

difference to result in greater labor force attachment in the U.S. compared to Canada. Our

evidence does not reveal strong differences along these lines as single mothers in both

countries experienced labor market improvements. While employment for single mothers

without a college degree fell in the U.S. in recent years relative to Canada, the decline

(relative to single women without children) is due to the other differences in the labor

markets across the two countries.


                                              29
       Additionally, the generosity of the Canadian social safety net exceeds that of the U.S.

This is revealed in lower absolute poverty rates in Canada, particularly in the recent period.

However, once the weaker labor market in the U.S. beginning around 2000 is accounted for,

poverty declines across the two countries (relative to single women without children) are

quite similar. Finally, the lack of an out-of-work safety net in the U.S. suggests we would

expect higher rates of deep poverty compared to Canada. We find that more of the decline

in poverty in the U.S. is due to market income than in Canada which suggests that those

without market income are relatively better off in Canada. More could be done to

understand the broader impacts of the social safety net on the distribution of income and

inequality in the two countries.

TAX BASED BENEFITS

Federal:
        The Canada Child Tax Benefit pays $1,446 per child in 2014-15. For family net
income over $43,953 it is phased out at a rate of 2% for one child; 4% when there are two
or more children. The benefit amounts and thresholds have been updated annually since
1997 for inflation, but otherwise not changed.
        The National Child Benefit Supplement began in 1998. The rates for 2014-15 are
$2,241 for the first child, $1,982 for the second, and $1,886 for the third. The benefits are
phased out sharply at rates of 12.2%, 23.0%, and 33.3% for incomes over $25,584. It is
indexed annually for inflation. There were substantial additional increases in several years.
Between 1998 and 2001 the benefit levels more than doubled. There were also increases of
13% in 2003, 14% in 2005, and 13% in 2006.
        The Universal Child Care Benefit began in 2006. It pays $100 per month for each
child under age 6 and is taxable in the hands of the lower income spouse.
        The Working Income Tax Benefit began in 1997. It pays $500 to families with
children, phased in with income over $3,750 and then phased out for income over $20,921.
It was removed when the National Child Benefit Supplement was introduced in 1998. In
2007, the Working Income Tax Benefit began payments to adults. There was no
supplement for children in this benefit. The amount for singles in 2014 is $998, with
couples getting $1813. There are some differences across provinces, but for most provinces
it is phased in at 25% for income over $3,000, and phased out at 15% starting at $11,332
for singles and $15,649 for couples. For singles, it is completely phased out by $18,000—so
this benefit is very narrowly targeted.
Newfoundland and Labrador:
        The Newfoundland Child Benefit was introduced in 1999 and is paid monthly. In
2014, the annual rate for a first child was $369, $392, for a second child, $421 for a third
child, and $451 for a fourth child. The clawback of these benefits was in the income range
$17,397 to $21,480. Increases through time followed inflation, except for a 25% increase to
the one-child rate in 2007. An additional supplement for children age zero was added in
2001.
Prince Edward Island:
        No child benefit program.
Nova Scotia:
        The Nova Scotia Child Benefit started in 1998 and is paid monthly. In 1998, the
payments ranged from $250 for the first child to $136 for a third (or higher) child. In 2001,
the payments for third and higher children increased substantially. In 2005, the payment
rates were $445 annually for a first child, $645 for a second, and $720 for a third. These
benefits are clawed back at high clawback rates for incomes over $16,000. Nova Scotia does
not update the benefit for inflation.
        In 2010, the Affordable Living Tax Credit was introduced with a base benefit of $240
augmented by $57 per child. This is phased out at 5% for income over $30,000.
New Brunswick:
        The New Brunswick Child Tax Benefit was introduced in 1997, before the national
NCB program reached its starting point. The annual benefit is $250 per child paid monthly,


23   This appendix draws heavily on Milligan, and Stabile (2011).
                                               45
and has not changed since 1997. The benefit is clawed back at 2.5% or 5% for family net
income over $20,000. In addition, there is a Working Income Supplement of $250 annually
that is phased in at 4% for earned income over $3,750 and clawed back at a rate of 5% for
family net income over $20,921. These amounts have been the same since 1997 with no
updates for inflation.
Quebec:
        Until 1997, residents of Quebec were eligible for a family allowance, an allowance
for young children, and an allowance for newborn children. These amounts increased with
the number of children in the family and did not depend on family income. In 1997, these
were combined into a new family allowance. The rates for the new family allowance were
$2,275 per child for a single parent family and $975 per child for a two-parent family.
These amounts were clawed back starting at incomes of $15,332 for singles and $21,825
for two-parent families. However, the clawback only took benefits down to a minimum
benefit level that was $80 annually for one and two child families and $975 for three child
families. But, for those with family net incomes higher than $50,000 these ‘minimum’
benefits were clawed back at a rate of 5%. In Quebec there was also an earned income
benefit called APPORT in place from 1988 to 2004. In 2004, this benefit was phased in for
earnings over $1,200 at a rate of 35% until an earnings level of $11,370 (two-parent) or
$7,790 (one-parent), and then clawed back at 43% after that. At the peak benefit level the
benefit amount was quite large, but take-up of this benefit was not high. In 2005 a new
Child Assistance program replaced the family allowance. The Child Assistance benefit in
2014 was $2,341 for the first child, $1,170 for the second and third children, and $1,755 for
the fourth or higher child. The phaseout rate is 4% for incomes over $33,944 (single) or
$46,699 (couple). The amounts have been updated annually for inflation. Benefit
distribution defaults to a quarterly schedule, although families can opt to receive the
benefit monthly.
        Also in 2005, a new Work Premium replaced APPORT. It is phased in for incomes
over $2,400 (single) or $3,600 (couple) at 25% (couples) and 30% (single). After a
‘turnaround’ point, it is phased out at a rate of 10%. The turnaround point is $10,286
(singles) or $15,914 (couples).
Ontario:
        Ontario introduced the Ontario Child Care Supplement for Working Parents in 1997,
and renamed as the Ontario Child Benefit in 2007. It pays out monthly. The initial rates
were $400 per child age 0 to 6, clawed back at 4% for net family income over $20,000. In
1998, the amounts were revamped and largely stayed the same until 2005. From 1998, the
amount was phased in with earned income over $5000, at a rate of 20% for 1998 and 21%
from 1999 to 2005. The 2014 benefit amount was $1,100 per child age 0 to 6 for a one-
parent family and $1310 for a two-parent family. The clawback rate was 8% for incomes
over $20,000. These amounts did not change between 1999 and 2014, with no adjustments
for inflation. In 2010, a new Sales Tax Credit was introduced, paying $260 per member of
the family; phased out with income over $25,000 at a rate of 4%.
Manitoba:
        Manitoba ran its own child benefit program called CRISP until 2008. In 2008, CRISP
paid $360 annually per child, with a clawback rate of 2.083% for incomes over $12,384.
These amounts had not changed in nominal terms since the 1980s.
        Starting in 2009, a new Manitoba Child Benefit was introduced, with a rate of $420
per child, clawed back after income of $15,000 at rates of 7.73%, 15.46%, and 23.18% for
families of one, two, and three or more children respectively. The amounts have not been
updated for inflation.

                                             46
Saskatchewan:
        The Saskatchewan Child Benefit was introduced in 1998. In the first year, it paid
$900 annually to a one child family, $1,104 for a second child, and $1,176 for a third. It is
clawed back at high rates for family net incomes over $15,921. As the NCBS increased in
the following years, the Saskatchewan Child Benefit was decreased downward dollar for
dollar, so that by 2005 it paid only $7 annually for a 2nd child and $86 for a third. It was
cancelled in 2006.
        Additionally, there is a working income supplement in Saskatchewan. In 2005 the
amount ranges from $2,385 for a one child family to $4,293 for a five child family. It is
phased in for earnings over $1,500 at rates between 25% and 45% and clawed back at a
20% rate for incomes over $14,640. There is a supplement for children under age 13 that
pays an extra 25% on top of the regular employment supplement. These amounts have not
been updated for inflation through time.
        In 2000, Saskatchewan introduced the Saskatchewan Low Income Tax Credit,
paying $77 for each adult and $55 for each child. It was clawed back at 1% for incomes that
varied with family type. The amounts increased to $100 and $75 in 2003, then $216 and
$84 in 2008. The phased out rate was increased to 2%, and all family types faced the same
threshold of $28,335. These amounts have been updated annually for inflation and it is paid
quarterly.
Alberta:
        Alberta has an employment-related child benefit that is paid monthly. It was
introduced in 1997 with a phase-in rate of 8% for earnings over $6,500 up to a maximum
of $250 for one child and $500 for two or more. The benefit is clawed back at a rate of 4%
for incomes over $25,000. Between 1998 and 2004, the benefit maximum was set at $500
for one child and $1000 for two or more children, but was otherwise similar to 1997.
The benefit changed again for the 2005 year. The new rates were $550 for one child, $500
for two children, $300 for three children, and $100 for four. These amounts were phased in
at 8% for earnings over $2,760, and then phased out on incomes of $25,000 or more at a
rate of 4%. These amounts have been updated for inflation each year since 2005.
British Columbia:
        The BC Family Bonus was introduced in 1996, two years before the NCB program,
and is paid monthly. The Bonus rate was $1,236 per child and was clawed back at a rate of
8% for one child and 16% for two or more for incomes higher than $18,000. These
amounts were increased to $1,332, 9%, 18%, and $20,500 in 2001 and have remained
constant since. However, the NCBS is subtracted from the BC Family Bonus, rendering it to
zero by 2005 since the NCBS is now larger than the prescribed BC Family Bonus payments.
There is also a BC Earned Income Benefit that was introduced in 1998. It pays differing
amounts for each child and is phased in between earnings levels of $3,750 and $10,000. It
is clawed back for incomes higher than $20,921 at high rates. The amounts for 2005 are
$365 for the first child, $370 for the second, and $372 for the third or higher. Until 2003,
the amount for the first child was $605, with $405 for the second and $330 for the third.
After 2003, the BC Earned Income Benefit was diminished as the NCBS grew, leading it to
zero by 2013.

SOCIAL ASSISTANCE
      Income support is provided by provincial/territorial governments in all 13
provinces and territories. The eligibility criteria differs by jurisdiction. In 2013, for
example, the basic welfare cut-off income for a single employable individual ranged


                                               47
between $6,807 (NB) and $10,876 (SK), and the basic welfare cut-off income for a couple
with two children ranged between $20,724 (NB) and $26,690 (PEI) (Tweddle et al., 2014).
The benefit amount also differs by jurisdiction, and is generally tied to the family status,
income level, and financial need of the individual or family. For single employable
individuals, the basic welfare income provided by the province/territory ranges from
$6,807 (NB) to $17,343 (YK), and for a couple with two children, the basic welfare income
ranges from $20,724 (NB) to $37,733 (YK) (Tweddle et al., 2014).24
       In British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and
Prince Edward Island, a separate social assistance program provides benefits for
individuals with a disability (Tweddle et al., 2015). In all provinces and territories, with the
exception of Newfoundland and Labrador, additional social assistance benefits are
provided in some form - either through a higher benefit as part of their general social
assistance program, or through separate program directed to individuals with disabilities
(Tweddle et al., 2014).

Appendix B: Data Appendix
United States: We use the CPS to construct private income (PI) poverty and after-tax-and-
transfer (ATT) poverty. Private income includes earned income, asset income, and private
transfers (child support, alimony, private disability and retirement). After-tax-and-transfer
resource measure, developed in Bitler and Hoynes (2010, 2015), includes private income
plus cash transfers (AFDC/TANF, Social Security, SSI, Unemployment Compensation,
veterans payments and workers’ compensation), the cash value (as reported by the
household or imputed by the Census Bureau) of non-cash in-kind programs (food
stamps/SNAP, school lunch, housing subsidies, and energy subsidies), tax credits (the EITC,
child tax credits, and stimulus payments) and then subtracts payroll, federal, and state
income taxes. We use the NBER TAXSIM model for all tax variables.

Canada: We use SLID income variables to construct private income (PI) poverty and after-
tax-and-transfer (ATT) poverty. SLID’s market income variable (private income) includes
earnings, investment income, private retirement pensions and support payments received,
such as alimony and child support. Moreover, SLID’s after-tax (and after-transfers)
income variable is defined by total income before taxes (market income plus federal and
provincial government transfers) minus federal and provincial income tax.
