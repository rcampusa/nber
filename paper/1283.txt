               The Specification and Influence of Asset Markets


                                      ABSTRACT




       This   paper is a chapter in the forthcoming Handbook of International

Economics. It surveys the literature on the specification of models of

asset   markets   and   the   implications of differences in specification for

the macroeconomic adjustment process. Builders of portfolio balance
models have generally employed tpostulated asset demand functions, rather
than deriving these directly from micro foundations. The first major sec-
tion    of the paper lays out a postulated general specification of asset

markets    and summarizes the fundamental short—run results of portfolio
balance models using a very basic specification of         asset markets. Then,

rudimentary     specifications of a balance of payments equation and goods
market equilibrium conditions are supplied, so that the dynamic distri-
bution    effects of the trade account      under static and rational expectations
with both fixed goods prices and flexible goods prices can be analyzed.
       The second major section of the paper      surveys and analyzes micro

 foundation models of asset demands using stochastic calculus. The micro—

 economic theory of asset demands implies some but not all of the proper-

 ties of the basic specification of postulated asset demands at the macro

 level. Since the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis depend crucially

 on the form of asset demand functions, it is important to continue to ex-

 plore the implications        of micro foundations for macro specification.

1. Introduction

      This chapter is a discussion of two complementary approaches to the

analysis of asset markets in open economies)—" Section 2 is devoted to

portfolio balance models with postulated asset demands, asset demands

broadly consistent with but not directly implied by microeconomic theory.

Some implications of the microeconomic theory of portfolio selection for

asset demands are spelled out in Section 3. Section 4 contains some

conclusions.



2. Portfolio balance models with postulated asset demands


2.1. Overview

     During the last fifteen years there has been a thorough reworking of

macroeconomic theory for open economies using a portfolio balance

approach..?-" According to this approach, equilibrium in financial markets

occurs when the available stocks of national moneys and other financial

assets are equal to the stock demands for these assets based on current

wealth, and wealth accumulation continues only until current wealth is

equal to desired wealth.

     In this section we review some of the important results that have

been obtained using portfolio balance models. Although these models were

originally developed to study movements of financial capital, variations
                                    —2—




in interest rates, and changes in stocks of international reserves under

fixed exchange rates, they were quickly adapted to study movements of

financial capital ,   variations   in interest rates, and changes in the

exchange rate under flexible exchange rates. Our discussion reflects the

emphasis placed on the case of flexible exchange rates in more recent

applications of portfolio balance models.

     The builders of portfolio balance models have employed postulate&

asset demand functions. By proceeding in this way, they have not denied

the desirability of deriving asset demands from explicit utility

maximizing behavior. Indeed, they have attempted to establish the

plausibility of their asset demands by appealing to microeconomic

theory--in the case of non-monetary assets to the theory of portfolio

selection and in the case of monetary assets to the theory of money

demand. There is widespread agreement on the importance of exploring the

implications of macroeconomic asset demand functions derived from

explicit utility maximizing behavior. A new sense of urgency has been

added by the argument that, iii general, utility maximizing behavior

leads to modifications in asset demands when the policy regime

changes.-1 While this exploration proceeds, results derived using

postulated asset demands can best be regarded as suggestive hypotheses to

be subjected to close scrutiny using asset demand functions with firmer

microeconomic foundations.

     After laying out a general specification of asset markets

(subsection 2.2), we summarize the fundamental short—run results of

portfolio balance models using a very basic specification of asset

markets (subsection 2.3). Then, we supply rudimentary specifications of

a balance of payments equation and goods market equilibrium conditions

(subsection 2.4) so that we can trace out the dynamic

                                              under static and rational expectations with
effects of the trade account

       The model contains four assets:                            home money, foreign money, home

money, home securities, and foreign
                                                securities measured in home (foreign)
currency." c         is   the expected rate of depreciation of the home currency;

it is equal to zero under
                                 static expectations and to the actual rate of

depreciation (E/E) under rational
                                              expectations (perfect foresight)...!'
The fifth argument in each
                               home (foreign) asset demand function is home
(foreign)     nominal output measured in home
                                                             *
                                                        currency. P (EP) is the home
currency price of the single good
                                             produced in the home (foreign)
                                                                                        country.
X (Y) is real output of the

each home (foreign) asset demand function is the

(foreign)      consumption bundle measured in home currency. Q and EO are

      *
h    (h) is the constant weight of the price of the home good in the price

                                                                                in each
of the home (foreign) consumption bundle. The seventh argument

home (foreign) asset demand function is home (foreign) wealth measured

in home currency.

        The signs of the responses of asset demands to changes in the

variables on which they depend are indicated by the signs over those

variables. The signs over the nominal rates of return reflect the

assumption that residents of both countries regard all the assets they

 hold as strict gross substitutes. The signs over nominal incomes and

 price indices reflect the assumption that residents of both countries

 hold both moneys for transactions purposes. The signs over nominal

 wealths reflect the assumption that all assets are "normal" assets.                   In

    the special case considered below some variables do not affect some asset

    demands.

         Equations (2.2) imply that the asset demand functions of equations

    (2.4) are subject to familiar restrictions:




         mk +      + bk   +    0,   k =   l,...,6;     m7 + n7 + b7 +      f7   1; (2.6a)




         mk +      + bk +      0,   k =     l,...,6;   m7 + fl7 + b7   +
                                                                           f7   1. (2.6b)
                                         -6-




 The assumption that private agents do not have money illusion implies

 that all asset demands must be homogenous of degree one in all variables

 measured in home currency:



     m m5PX +            +          rn
                                          rn5EPY + rn6EQ + rn7EW,
                   m60       m7W,                                            (2.7a)



     n   n5PX + n6Q + n7W,          n     n5EY + r6E + n7EW,                (2.7b)



         b5PX + b6Q + b7W,
     b                                           +
                                                     6E +                   (2.7c)



     f   f5PX + f6Q + f7W,                       +         +
                                                     6E6                    (2.7d)



     Only three of the four asset market equilibrium conditions are

independent. Equations (2.3) together with equations (2.1) imply that

world wealth measured in home currency is equal to the sum of the stocks

of all financial assets available for private agents to hold. Equations

(2.2) imply that the sum of all asset demands is identically equal to

world wealth. Thus, the sum of all the excess demands given by equations

(2.4) is identically equal to zero.            In the algebraic analysis below

attention is focused on the markets for home money, foreign money, and

home securities.



2.3. The basic asset market specification

     Many of the results that have been derived from portfolio balance

models with postulated asset demands can be illustrated using a basic
                                               —'-



asset mark t specification. The basic specification is obtained from the

general specification by imposing five simplifying assumptions. First,

residents of neither country hold the other country's money that is,

there is no "currency substitution" (M = N =                      m =   n   =
                                                                                rnk
                                                                                      =
                                                                                          k   =

country residents' demand for money is independent of the return on the

security denominated in the other country's currency (m4 = n3 =                                   0).
Third, in each country all changes in residents' demand for money

resulting from changes in their nominal income and the price of their

consumption bundle are matched by changes in their demand for the

security denominated in their country's currency (b5 =                                - m5,   b6 =   - m6,
      =   - n5,   and f6 =   - n6).       Fourth, in each country residents' demand for

money is independent of nominal wealth (m7 =                            = 0).         Fifth, in each

country residents' demand for money is unit elastic with respect to their

nominal income (m =                   n =
                             m5PX,          n5EPY).
           The first and second assumptions imply that in each country the

responsivenesses of residents' demands for the two securities to changes

in the return on the security denominated in the other country's currency

are equal and opposite in sign (f4 =                     - b4   and      = — b3).         The first and

third assumptions imply that in each country residents' demand for the

security denominated in the other country's currency is independent of

their nominal income and the price of their consumption bundle

      =      =      =    = 0).        The third and fourth assumptions taken together

with the homogeneity assumption embodied in equations (2.7) imply that

the fraction of any increase in wealth allocated by residents of each

country to securities denominated in their country's currency is equal to

the ratio of their total holdings of assets denominated in their
                                            -8--




country's currency to their wealth lb7 = (M + B)/W and                        =    (+
That is, in each country the sum of residents' demands for assets

denominated in a given currency is homogeneous of degree one in nominal

wealth. The third, fourth, and fifth assumptions taken together with the

homogeneity assumption embodied in equations (2.7) imply that in each

country residents' demands for money and securities denominated in their

country's currency are independent of the price of their consumption

bundle (m6 =
               b6 = n6
                           =        = 0).

Appropriate    modifications are made in equations (2.2), (2.3), (2.6), and

(2.7).

       The impact effects of asset exchanges under static expectations

(c   = 0)   are of some interest in themselves.' In any case the analysis

of impact effects with expected depreciation exogenous is one step in a


complete analysis under rational expectations (e    = E/E).
         An initial asset market equilibrium is represented by the

intersection of %%,                    and     in Figure 1. The unique home

(foreign) interest rate that clears the home (foreign) money market,

         is indicated by the horizontal %%    (vertical %i) schedule. The
pairs of i and I that clear the market for home (foreign) securities are

represented by the upward sloping Ti              schedule. An increase in

the foreign interest rate lowers (raises) the demand for home (foreign)

securities, so an increase in the home interest rate is required to raise

(lower) the demand for home (foreign) securities if equilibrium is to be

reestabi i shed.

         The assumption that residents of both countries regard the assets

they hold as strict gross substitutes implies that the         schedule must

be flatter than the fl? schedule, as shown in Figure 1.       If the

schedule were steeper, there would he excess supply of all four assets in

the region to the northwest of a0 between the          and 0P0schedules.

However, it has been established above that the sum of the excess demands

for all four assets must be zero.

         Depreciation of the home currency shifts both the      and

 schedules down without affecting the        and 11 schedules. It raises not

 only the home currency value of wealth in both countries but also the

home currency value of the supply of foreign securities. Thus, it

creates excess demand for home securities and excess supply of foreign

securities.!! A drop in i cuts (boosts) the demand for home (foreign)

securities.

     First consider an expansionary open market operation in the home

country (dpi =   -d    >   0).    With the exchange rate fixed the fW and

schedules shift down to                and       .   The shift in the     schedule     is


smaller; a reduction in the home interest rate not only reduces home

residents' demand for home securities by more than it increases their

demand for money because it simultaneously increases their demand for

foreign securities but also reduces foreign residents' demand for home

securities. The new equilibrium is at a1 where i is lower and i is

unchanged. Depreciation of the home currency shifts the                   and

schedules from             and         until they pass through a1

     Now consider three types of intervention operations. Intervention

of Type I is an exchange of home money for foreign money (df =                   -d>    0).
This operation shifts the 1 and              I   schedules   to     and 1iil .   The new

equilibrium is at a2 where i is lower and                 is higher. Depreciation of

the home currency shifts the li and                  schedules down until they pass

through a2.

      Intervention of Type II is an exchange of home money for foreign

securities (d =      - dr    >   0).   This operation shifts AI and     r   to
      and        .   The new equilibrium is at a1. The increase in the home

money supply and the decline in the home interest rate are the same as

they were in the case of an open market operation. Depreciation of the
                                  -12-



 home currency shifts     and P1? down until they pass through            The
                                                                  a1 .


 depreciation of the home currency is greater than it was in the case of

 an open market operation, since it must shift        from i11L to a1 instead

of from        to a1.

       Intervention of Type III is an exchange of home currency securities

for foreign currency securities (d = - d1? >    0).   Since this type of

intervention leaves both money supplies unchanged, it has been called

sterilized intervention. It shifts II and 1?? to B2B? and ?l.1? .         The new

equilibrium is at a0 where i and i are unchanged. flepreciation of the

home currency shifts      and 1?1? down until they pass through
                                                                  a0.
       An exogenous increase in P operates exactly like an open market sale

by the home authorities since it raises the excess demand for home money

and lowers the excess demand for home securities by amounts that are

equal in absolute value. Thus it causes i to rise and the home currency

to                                                      *         *
     appreciate. By analogy an exogenous increase in P causes i to rise

and the home currency to depreciate.

      We assume that there is 'local asset preference:° home residents

allocate a larger fraction of any increase in wealth to home securities

than foreign residents (b7 >          With local asset preference, a
                               b7).
transfer of wealth from home residents to foreign residents (dw < 0) has

effects   which are identical to those of a sterilized intervention
operation.    It lowers the excess demand for home securities and        raises
the excess demand for foreign securities by amounts that are equal in

absolute value.

       The impact effects of the home authorities' policy instruments on

two possible target variables are highlighted in Figure 2. The home

authorities have two independent policy instruments, open market

operations and intervention operations of Type II, which they can use to

achieve desired values for two target variables, the home money supply

and the exchange rate, given a constant foreign money supply. Movements

out the horizontal axis represent contractionary open market operations,

increases in the stock of home securities () matched by decreases in the

home money supply. Movements up the vertical axis represent

contractionary intervention operations of Type II, increases in the stock

of foreign securities () matched by decreases in the home money supply.

The M0M0 schedule shows the pairs of     and     that are compatible with a

constant value of the home money supply. If currency units are defined

so that the exchange rate varies in the neighborhood of unity, then the

     schedule has a slope of minus one. Under the basic specification,

both interest rates are constant along the itf schedule because there is a

one to one correspondence between the money supply and the interest rate

in each country. The        schedule represents the pairs of      and r   that

are compatible with a constant exchange rate. The         schedule must be

flatter than the MM schedule since an intervention operation of Type II

has a greater effect on the exchange rate than an open market operation

of equal size as shown above for the basic specification. It follows

that movements down along the     schedule lead to decreases in the home

money supply and increases in the home interest rate. The home

authorities can expand the home money supply from the level corresponding

to       to the level corresponding to         without changing the exchange

rate by conducting the open market purchase corresponding to      and the

intervention operation of Type II corresponding to iI

     As groundwork for the dynamic analysis below it is useful to provide

an algebraic derivation of the results just arrived at graphically. We

first select a state variable for the system and then express the asset

market equilibrium conditions in terms of deviations of the variables

from their stationary equilibrium values.

of w equals home residents' asset accumulation in the neighborhood of

long—run equilibrium:




       w=M+B+F.                                                  (2.11)

It is convenient not to divide through by the positive coefficient

2.4. The specification of the goods markets and the balance of payments

       Even when the objective is to study the behavior of interest rates

and the exchange rate at a point in time, it is not possible to conduct

the analysis using just the asset market equilibrium conditions except

under very restrictive assumptions.              It was shown in the last section

that if goods prices are fixed and expectations are static, then the
                                           -18-




conditions for asset market equilibrium are sufficient to determine

interest rates and the exchange rate at a point in time. However, if

goods prices are fixed and expectations are rational, then a balance of

payments condition must be employed together with the asset market

equilibrium conditions to jointly determine interest rates, the exchange

rate, the percentage rate of change in the exchange rate, and the rate of

transfer of wealth between home and foreign residents. Moreover, if

goods prices are flexible, then under both static and rational

expectations a complete model must include goods market equilibrium

conditions. Of course, when the objective is to study the behavior of

interest rates and the exchange rate over time, a balance of payments

condition must be employed no matter whether expectations are static or

rational

         In this subsection we specify equilibrium conditions for the home

and foreign goods markets and a balance of payments equation. Since the

focus of this chapter is asset markets, we have deliberately kept the

specification of the goods market equilibrium conditions and the balance

of payments equation as simple as possible.--1

           Below we consider two special cases of the goods market

equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation. In both

special cases real outputs in both countries are assumed to always be at

their "full employment" or "natural" levels. In the first special case

it is assumed that balanced budget fiscal policy is used in each country
                                                  *
to fix the price of output in that country (dp = dp = 0). Furthermore,
in each country the demand for the good produced in the other cOuntry is

assumed to be independent of the level of nominal spending
                                                 —21—




 (   =        =        =       = 0).       Therefore, the trade account of the home

country is independent of nominal disposable incomes and nominal wealths.

In deviation form the balance of payments equation is




         w = ode,



          =   X4 -         = X4 + X4 > 0.
                                                                                           (2.20)


n is the effect of a depreciation of the home currency on the home trade

surplus. In the neighborhood of stationary equilibrium dw = w and

d(E -     F =     0.
       In the second special case it is assumed that output prices are
                         *
flexible and that G and G are equal to zero. In deviation form the goods
market equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation are

  Assumptions imposed above imply that

 assume that responsivenesses of saving to wealth are the same in the two

 countries Cs2 =          so that transfers of wealth between
                                                              countries affect
 the distribution but not the level of world saving. Under this

 assumption C2 and C4 are positive. Since our assumptions imply that all

 the coefficients in equations (2.22)
                                             are positive, the signs preceding
 the coefficients indicate the signs of the effects of changes in the

 variables

      The
             relationships summarized by equations (2.22) are in accord with

 intuition. First,. consider a transfer of wealth from foreign residents

 to home residents (dw >     0).   Given that the responsivenesses of
                                                                                 savings
to wealth are the same in the two countries Cs2 =                    and that there is

marginal local good preference (x2 -    =             -
                                     x2          y2       y2
                                                               >   0),   the transfer
raises demand for home goods and lowers
                                               demand for foreign goods by
amounts that are equal in absolute value. An increase in the price of

each good has an effect on excess demand
                                                for that good that is greater in
absolute value than its effect on the excess demand for the other good

(kI                       jx*).-iZJ'   For example, an increase in P reduces
excess demand for home goods both by
                                            increasing savings and by reducing
the home trade surplus; however, it increases excess demand for the

foreign good only by increasing the foreign trade surplus which, of

course, is the negative of the home trade surplus.
                                                   Therefore, the
                              *
transfer causes P to rise and P to fall. The direct
                                                    effect of the
transfer on the home trade surplus is to reduce it since foreigners

The indirect effect resulting from the induced price changes reinforces

the direct effect)-"

         Now consider a depreciation of the home currency (de >         0).       Given
                                                       * *

depreciation increases demand for home goods and decreases demand for

                                                   in the price of home goods

has an effect on excess demand for home goods that is greater in absolute

value than the effect of the same percentage depreciation (pI

                                            intuition about this result can be
     as shown in equation (2.22c). Some
                                                  Assume temporarily that there

 measured in foreign goods [(W + EW)/EP]
                                         constant. Then the relative
                             *
 price of the foreign good (EP/P) remains constant, and there is no change
 in excess demand for either good or in the home trade surplus. Now

 assume again that there is local asset preference and assume temporarily

 that there is no local good preference (x2 =
                                                2'    =        In this case
 the changes in P and P considered above lower home real wealth measured

 in both goods and raise foreign real wealth measured in both goods.

 However, the goods markets remain in equilibrium since the redistribution

 of real wealth does not affect the excess demands for goods. Thus, there

 is no need for a change in the relative price of the foreign good and no
                                    *
need for further changes in P and P. The home trade
                                                    surplus increases

since foreign spending on home goods increases and home spending on

foreign goods falls. According to equation (2.22c), the result that a

depreciation increases the trade surplus when there is local asset

preference is very general :   it is independent of good preference and the

signs of security positions.


2.5. A distribution effect of a trade surplus with goods prices fixed

      If asset demands embody local asset preference, a transfer of

wealth to home residents through a trade account surplus raises the

demand for home securities and lowers the demand for foreign securities.

In this subsection we spell out the implications of this distribution

effect of a trade surplus with goods prices fixed. In this special case,

our model is similar to what some have called a "partial equilibrium"

model of exchange rate hehavior)—/
                                    —27-




      The first building block of the fixed price model is the balance

of payments equation from the first special case of the goods market

equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation.    This

equation is reproduced here for convenience:




      w = nde,                                                         (2.20)




      Ti =
             X4
                  -   = x4   + x4 > 0.




      The w schedule in the left—hand panel of Figure 3 represents this

relationship. It slopes upward because a depreciation of the home

currency increases the home trade surplus and, therefore, increases home


asset accumulation (w). The long-run equilibrium exchange rate (e0) is

the only value of e for which the trade surplus and, therefore, asset

accumulation equal zero as indicated by the horizontal w = 0 schedule in

the right-hand panel of Figure 3. The horizontal arrows show the

direction of motion of w. When the home currency price of foreign


currency is too high (e > e0), the home country runs a trade surplus and


accumulates assets (w > 0).

        The second building block of the fixed price model is the equation

 for the expected rate of change of the exchange rate (c)   implied    by asset

 market equilibrium in the basic specification of asset markets. Solving
                                           *
 equation (2.15c) for c with dp = dp = 0 yields

operation (d =       -d     > 0) on C.

      The As schedule in the right—hand panel of Figure 3 is the asset

market equilibrium schedule under static expectations. It represents the

pairs of e and w that are compatible with asset market equilibrium given

that C is equal to zero. This schedule is downward sloping under the

assumption of local asset preference (b7 — b7 > 0). A transfer of wealth

to home residents raises the demand for home securities, so the home

currency must appreciate to reequilibrate the asset markets if C is to

remain unchanged. The more pronounced is local asset preference, that

is, the greater b7 -        b7, the steeper is As.
      The AR schedule is the asset market equilibrium schedule under

rational expectations given that exchange rate expectations are

compatible with the stability of long—run equilibrium. Under rational

expectations the As schedule is simply the schedule along which

C = e =   0.   The vertical arrows show the direction of motion of e.
                                -30-




Above As there is excess demand for home assets with e = 0, so the home


currency must be expected to depreciate (e > 0) to equilibrate the asset

markets. Long—run equilibrium is a saddle point under rational

expectations as indicated by the arrows.--' Following a disturbance the

world economy will reach long—run equilibrium if and only if it moves

along the unique saddle path represented by AR.

      The effects of an unanticipated transfer of wealth from foreign

residents to home residents (w0 >      = ) are    shown in Figure 3. This

disturbance does not shift any of the schedules, tinder static

expectations the home currency appreciates (e05 <            and the home

country begins to run a trade deficit (w05 <     0).   As w falls, the home

currency depreciates. The economy moves along As back to long-run

equilibrium. Under rational expectations the home currency appreciates

but not as much as under static expectations (e05 <
                                                           e0    <         and the

home country begins to run a trade account deficit but one which is

smaller than under static expectations (WO,S <             0).
                                                 w()   <             Once again, as

w falls, the home currency depreciates. The economy moves along AR back

to long—run equilibrium. When agents take account of the future path of

the exchange rate, the initial movement in this variable is damped.

      The effects of an unanticipated contractionary open market

operation are shown in Figure 4. This operation shifts the
                                                                     As and AR
schedules down to A and A. Under both static and rational expectations

the home currency appreciates, and the home country begins to run a trade

account deficit. In the new long-run equilibrium, home wealth is lower

 long-run equilibrium (      = . What       happens is that the home interest

 rate rises by enough to clear the home money market. This increase is

 more than enough to reequilibrate the market for home securities, so home

 wealth must decline to reequilibrate that market.

        The effects of an unancticipated shift in spending in either

 country from foreign to home goods is shown in Figure 5. This

 disturbance shifts the w schedule, the w = 0 schedule, and the AR

 schedule down to w', (w =   0)',   and A4. tinder static expectations there

 is no effect on the exchange rate                          but under rational
                                      initially e0 =

both static and rational expectations the home country begins to run a

trade account surplus. In the new long-run equilibrium, e is lower

( < ) and     home wealth is higher (        >      e must fall in order to

reequilibrate the current account. With a lower e, w must be higher in

order to reequilibrate the market for home currency securities.



2.6. Distribution effects of the trade surplus with goods prices flexible

      If goods prices are flexible, not only local asset preference but

also local good preference is sufficient to insure that a trade account

surplus has a distribution effect. In this subsection we spell out the

implications of the distribution effects of a trade surplus with goods

prices flexible.

      The first building block of the flexible price model is the reduced

fom asset accumulation equation (2.22c), which is reproduced here for

convenience:




      w =          -
            C5de       C5dw,                                                   (2.22c)

                        +          +             > 0.



      The w = 0 schedule in Figure 6 repesents the pairs of e and w for


which w equals zero. If there is local asset preference, it slopes

upward. An increase in w lowers home asset accumulation, so the home

currency must depreciate in order to increase it.                If there is no local

asset preference, the w = 0 schedule is vertical since changes in the

exchange rate do not affect asset accumulation. The horizonal arrows

show the motion of w. Above the w = 0 schedule the home country runs a

trade surplus and accumulates assets.

       The second building block of the flexible price model is the

reduced form equation for the expected rate of change of the exchange

rate (c) derived by solving equation (2.15c) for c and eliminating dp and
 *
dp using equations (2.22a) and (2.22b):

      The As schedule in Figure 6 is the asset market equilibrium

schedule under static expectations. It represents the pairs of e and w

that are compatible with asset market equilibrium given that c is equal

to zero. If there is either local asset preference or local good

preference, the As schedule slopes downward. First consider the effect

of an increase in w.           If there is local asset preference, this increase

in w raises the demand for home securities directly. If there is local

good preference, the increase in w raises P and lowers P as shown in

subsection 2.4. The net effect of these induced price changes is to

increase the demand for home securities as shown in subsection 2.3.

Thus, either local asset preference or local good preference is a

sufficient condition for an increase in w to raise the demand for home

securities. Now consider the effect of an appreciation of the home

currency, that is, a decrease in e. This decrease lowers the demand for

lower the demand for home securities. Thus, a decrease in e

unambiguously lowers the demand for home securities. If there is neither

local asset preference nor local good preference, the A5schedule is

horizontal.

      The AR schedule is the asset market equilibrium schedule under

rational expectations given that exchange rate expectations are

compatible with the stability of long-run equilibrium. Under rational

expectations, the As schedule is just the        e   =   0 schedule. The

vertical arrows show the direction of motion of e. Above As there IS


excess demand for home assets with e = 0, so the home currency must be

expected to depreciate. Long-run equilibrium is a saddle point under

rational expectations as indicated by the arrows.-'          AR is the unique

saddle path aTong which the economy must move followng a disturbance in

order to reach long—run equilibrium.

          The qualitative effects of a transfer of wealth to home residents

on e and w when there is local asset preference are the same whether or

not there is local good preference. These effects are shown in Figure 6.

This disturbance does not affect either of the schedules. Under both

static and rational expectations the home currency appreciates (e05 <

                 and the home country begins to run a trade deficit. The
eOR
      <
          is),
economy moves along either As or AR back to long-run equilibrium.

          The qualitative effects of a contractionary open market operation

on e and w when there is local asset preference are also the same whether

or not there is local good preference. These effects are shown in Figure

 7. The As and AR schedules are shifted down to A and A. Under both

 static and rational expectations the home currency appreciates, and the

home country begins to run a trade deficit. In contrast to the results

obtained with goods prices fixed both home wealth and the exchange rate

are lower in the long-run equilibrium. Since asset accumulation now

depends on w as well as e and since w has declined, e need not return all

the way to its initial value in order to raise asset accumulation to

zero.

        While the qualitative behavior of the nominal exchange rate is the

same with local asset preference whether or not there is local good

preference, the behavior of the terms of trade or real exchange rate
  *
(EP/P) differs in the two cases. We illustrate this result with the case
of a transfer of wealth. At the outset note that for this disturbance

the real exchange rate is unaffected in the new long-run equilibrium.

Then focus attention on the impact effects and the adjustment paths.

First suppose that there is local good preference. It follows from

equations (2.22a) and (2.22b) that an increase in w raises P and lowers
*
P. It also follows from these equations that an appreciation of the

nominal exchange rate causes an appreciation of the real exchange rate:



        d(e +   - p)/de   =
                              (1/)(x22   -
                                             2y2)(b7
                                                       -
                                                           7)W   >0.   (2.26)




As a result the impact effect of the transfer of wealth must be an

appreciation of the real exchange rate,so the real exchange rate must

depreciate along the adjustment path. Now suppose there is no local good

preference. Increases in w and changes in the nominal exchange rate have

no effect on the real exchange rate, so the real exchange rate remains

unaffected by the transfer of wealth. This is a case of nominal exchange

rate dynamics without real exchange rate dynamics.
                                 -40-




         The effects of a wealth transfer and an open market operation on e

and w when there is local good preference hut no local asset preference

are shown in Figures 8 and 9. The only qualitative difference in the

effects on e and w in this case is that the long—run equilibrium value of

w is unchanged by an open market operation because asset accumulation is

independent of the exchange rate.

         An interesting special case arises when there is local good

preference but no local asset preference and when open market operations

are employed to peg nominal interest rates in both countries. In this
                                *
special case movements in P and P do not affect asset market equilibrium.
The effects of a wealth transfer are shown in Figure 10 in which the As

and AR schedules are horizontal. A transfer of wealth has no effect on

the nominal exchange rate. However, it follows from equations (2.22a)

and (2.22b) that it does affect the real exchange rate.     The impact
                                                 *
effect   of the transfer is to raise P and lower P. These variables return

to their original values as home residents decumulate wealth. This is a

case of real exchange rate dynamics without nominal exchange rate

dynamics.

         The effects of a wealth transfer and an open market operation when

there is neither local asset preference nor local good preference are

shown in Figures 10 and 11. The A and AR schedules are horizontal even

though interest rates are not pegged. There are neither nominal nor real

exchange rate dynamics. A transfer of wealth has no effect on the

exchange rate, but the home country begins to run a trade account

deficit. An open market operation causes the home currency to appreciate

immediately to its new long-run equilibrium value and has no effect on

the trade surplus of the home country.

2.7. Negative net foreign asset positions and stability

         A negative net foreign asset position is a net debt of residents of

one country denominated in the currency of the other country
         *
(F or B < 0).       Several writers have suggested that negative net foreign

asset positions alone can be a source of dynamic instability.--"

According to an alternative view presented in this subsection, negative

net foreign asset positions are not an independent source of instability.

Instability can arise only under nonrational expectations or because of

destabilizing specul ati on

         The exposition is simplified by retaining the assumption of local
                                      **                     *   **
asset preference [(M + B)/W       > B/W    and, therefore, (N + F)/W > F/W].

This assumption taken together with our other assumptions implies that

only net foreign asset positions can be negative: net domestic asset

positions are always positive (M + B, N + F >          0).   W, W, ,   ,I=
     _                                 *                               *
and N = N are all positive. If B and F are positive, B and F may be
                                                                    *   *
           However, if there   is local asset preference, M + B and N + F
negative.
                             *                            *
must still be positive. If B and F are negative, B and F and, therefore,
            *   *
M   + B and N + F are     positive.
          Suppose goods prices are fixed. The w and w = 0 schedules are the

 same as those shown in Figure 3 whether or not there are negative net

 foreign asset positions because net foreign asset positions do not enter

 the balance of payments equation.

             In contrast, the slope of the asset market equilibrium schedule

 under static expectations (As) may be different when there are negative

 net foreign asset positions.          A5 is downward sloping as in Figure 3 in
                                    -46-




 the "normal" case.   In this case, a depreciation of the home currency

 raises the value of c   required   to clear the asset markets (Ce > 0). As

shown by (2.24), since b7 > t7, an increase in w raises the value of c

 required to clear the asset markets (c > 0). Thus, an increase in w
must be matched by an appreciation of the home currency if the asset

markets are to remain in equilibrium. However, the A schedule is upward

sloping as in Figure 12 in the "perverse" case.      In this case, a

depreciation of the home currency lowers the value of e required to clear

the asset markets (Ce < 0). An increase in w must be matched by a

depreciation of the home currency if the asset markets are to remain in

equilibrium.

       The restriction required for the normal case (Ce > 0) is always

satisfied if there are no negative net foreign asset positions
    *                    *
(F, B > 0).   When F and B are positive, a depreciation of the home

currency unambiguously raises the demand for home securities           > 0)

because it raises home and foreign wealth.     The restriction required for
                                                 *
the   normal case may be violated if either F or B is negative and is

definitely violated if both are negative. If F is negative, a

depreciation lowers home residents' wealth and, therefore, reduces their
                                *
demand for home securities. If B is negative, a depreciation raises

foreign residents' wealth. However, their demand for home securities

falls as their wealth rises.

       We investigate the stability of long—run equilibrium by analyzing

an unanticipated transfer of wealth from foreign residents to home

residents. Long—run equilibrium is stable under static expectations in

the normal case. The analysis of a wealth transfer in subsection 2.5,

which is summarized in Figure 3, applies without modification. In the

normal case negative net foreign asset positions do not alter the

qualitative effects of wealth transfers and exchange rate changes on c.

Long—run equilibrium is definitely unstable under static expectations in

the perverse case as shown in Figure 12. The transfer of wealth from

foreign residents to home residents (w0 >       raises   demand for home

securities. In the perverse case, asset market equilibrium is restored


by a depreciation (e05 >      rather   than an appreciation of the home


currency, and the home country begins to run a trade surplus (w05 >        0).
As w rises, the home currency depreciates further. The economy moves

along As away from long—run equilibrium.-'

      If speculation is stabilizing, long-run equilibrium is stable under

rational expectations in both the normal and perverse cases.--" As the

arrows in Figures 3 and 12 indicate, long—run equilibria are saddle

points under rational expectations. What is remarkable is that this

result holds not only in the normal case but also in the perverse case.

It is usual to find that if long-run equilibrium is stable under static

expectations, it is a saddle point under rational expectations. However,

here long-run equilibrium is a saddle point under rational expectations

even if it is unstable under static expectations.

       under rational expectations the exchange rate jumps to clear the

 asset markets, just as it did under static expectations. Following a

transfer, the world economy reaches long-run equilibrium if and only if

it moves along the unique saddle path represented by AR in Figure 3 in

the normal case and by AR in Figure 12 in the perverse case. If the

bidding of market participants causes the exchange rate to jump to eOR

                                       under our assumption of local asset
 the home currency must depreciate

 preference.

       With goods prices flexible, just as with goods prices fixed, the

  this case, a depreciation of the home currency

  required to clear the asset markets (c >     0).   As shown by (2.25), the

                                           effects of an increase in w is to

  an increase in w must be matched by an appreciation of the home currency

  if the asset markets are to remain in equilibrium.      However, the A

this case, a depreciation of the home currency lowers the value of c

required to clear the asset markets (c < 0).
                                                             An increase in w must be

matched by a depreciation of the home currency if the asset markets are

to remain in equilibrium.

          The restriction required for the normal case (c              > 0)    is always

satisfied if there are no negative net foreign asset positions
      *
(F,   B >   0).   A depreciation of the home currency raises the demand for

home securities directly by raising home and foreign wealth e > 0) and

indirectly by raising the price of home goods thereby raising the home

interest rate and by lowering the price of foreign goods thereby lowering

the foreign interest rate. The restriction required for the normal case
                                        *
may be violated if either F or B is negative. It has been shown above

that the direct effect of a depreciation on the demand for home

securities may be perverse e < 0) if F or                   is negative and is

definitely perverse if both are negative. The indirect effects may also

be perverse: the price of home goods may fall if F is negative; the
                                  *
price of foreign goods may rise if B is negative. With goods prices
fixed, a necessary and sufficient condition for the slope of As to be
perverse is that the direct effect of a depreciation on the demand for
home securities be perverse e               <   0).   However,   with goods prices
 flexible,        6e <   o is neither   a necessary nor a sufficient condition for

the    slope of A to be perverse. For example, suppose residents of both
 countries have negative net        foreign asset positions (F, B < 0) and            that
 there    is no local good preference (x2 = x2 and y2 =                       Under those
                                                                    y2).
 circumstances the direct effect of a depreciation is perverse 6e <

 but the indirect effects are normal, so the overall effect is
 indeterminate.

       The results of stability analysis with goods prices flexible are

similar to those with goods prices fixed. Long—run equilibrium is stable

under static expectations in the normal case. The analysis of a wealth

transfer in subsection 2.6, which is summarized in Figure 6, applies

without modification since in the normal case negative net foreign asset

positions do not alter the qualitative effects of wealth transfers and

exchange rate changes on e. Long—run equilibrium is definitely unstable

under static expectations in the perverse case as shown in Figure 13

because the A schedule is steeper than the w = 0 schedule..L! The
             S

transfer of wealth to home residents (w0 >     leads to a depreciation of

the home currency (e05 >      and a trade surplus (WOS > 0), and the

economy moves along As away from equilibrium. 'If speculation is

      stabilizing, long—run equilibrium is stable under rational

expectations in both the normal and perverse cases..?" As the arrows in

Figures 6 and 13 indicate, long—run equilibria are saddle points under

rational expectations. The unique saddle path is represented by
                                                                   AR
Figure 6 in the normal case and by ARm Figure 13 in the perverse case.

When speculation is stabilizing, the exchange rate jumps to   eOR. The
home currency appreciates, and long—run equilibrium is stable no matter

what the sign of c.   When speculation is destabilizing, the exchange

rate remains unchanged or jumps to some value other than eOR. and long—

run equilibrium is unstable. No matter whether goods prices are fixed or

flexible, under rational expectations instability can arise only because

of destabilizing speculation and not because of perverse valuation

effects associated with negative net foreign asset positions.-1

3. The Microeconomic foundations of asset demands in open economies


3.1. Overview

       Demand equations for assets denominated in different currencies

are based on the solution to a maximization problem faced by an

individual investor. One specification of the problem is very common.

The investor consumes a bundle of goods each of which is produced in a

different country and priced in the currency of the country in which it

is produced. In each currency denomination there is a security with a

fixed nominal value and a certain nominal return. The investor has

initial holdings of some or all of the securities and an uncertain

stream of future labor income. Percentage changes in goods prices and

exchange rates are assumed to follow "geometric Brownian motion." This

assumption implies that successive percentage changes in these variables

are   independently distributed no matter how short the time interval and
that the levels of the variables are log normally distributed. The
investor   maximizes the expected value of discounted lifetime utility.

        In early analyses of portfolio selection in a closed economy, the

specification of the investor's maximization problem was simplified by

several assumptions.-" First, it was assumed that the portfolio

allocation decision in each period was separable from the saving

decision. Under this assumption the optimal portfolio rule could be

obtained by maximizing the expected utility of return in each period.

Second, no distinction was made between nominal and real returns because

the price level was assumed to be fixed. Third, it was assumed either

that uncertain asset returns were normally distributed or that utility

was quadratic in pártfolio return. Fourth, it was assumed that there
                                   -54-



 was an asset with a known return, the "safe" asset. These
                                                              assumptions
 yielded the classic portfolio separation results.

       More recent analyses of portfolio selection and saving in the

 closed economy have employed the tools of stochastic calculus.-'        An

 implicit solution for a general version of the investor's lifetime

 utility maximization problem has been obtained by applying the

 "Fundamental Theorem of Stochastic Dynamic Programming" and Ito's Lemma

on stochastic differentials. In this general case the portfolio

allocation problem is not separable from the saving decision and the

classic portfolio separation results do not hold.

      Recognizing the implications of some special assumptions in the

more recent continuous time framework provides some perspective on

earlier contributions. The assumption that the investor's instantaneous

utility function exhibits constant relative risk aversion implies that

the portfolio allocation decision is separable from the saving

decision." It is comforting to know that the separability of these

decisions, which was simply assumed in earlier contributions, is implied

by a class of utility functions. The assumption that the percentage

changes in asset prices follow geometric Brownian motion so that the

prices themselves are log normally distributed implies the classic

portfolio separation resu1ts.-' The very similar assumption that

percentage returns are normally distributed yields these separation

results in the earlier analyses.

      The investor in the open economy must take account of both

exchange rate and price index uncertainty.-' Although a foreign

security has a certain nominal return denominated in foreign currency,

its nominal return in home currency is uncertain.    Uncertainty about
                                  —55—




real returns arises not only because future values of exchanges rate are

unknown but also because future values of the price index used to

deflate nominal wealth are unknown. Exchange rate and price index

changes are related in general, and the covariance between nominal

returns inclusive of exchange rate changes and price index changes plays

an important role in portfolio choice in an open economy. Changing the

stochastic specification of the price index can have significant effects

on this important covariance.

        We begin by laying out a basic model with two assets, a home

security and a foreign security, in subsection 3.2. The implications of

a popular specification of the price index are spelled out in subsection

3.3. In subsection 3.4 we show the effect of imposing relative

purchasing power parity on this popular specification, and in section

3.5 we trace out some consequences of violating the law of one price.

Subsection 3.6 contains a three asset model that is generalized in

subsection 3.7. Finally, in subsection 3.8 we illustrate the

integration of money into the open economy portfolio allocation problem.



3.2. Asset demands in a two asset model with the exchange rate and the

home   price index stochastic
         Analysis of demands for assets denominated in different currencies
with   the tools of stochastic calculus has usually proceeded under two

simplifying assumptions. First, it has been assumed that percentage

changes in prices follow geometric Brownian motion. Second, it has been
assumed that the instantaneous utility function exhibits constant

relative risk aversion rIJ() =    (i/y), where     is real consumption, and

y <    1].   Under these assumptions, the solution for optimal wealth

allocation is the same as the one implied by maximization of an

objective function that is linear in expected return and variance of

return. Thus, the consumer can be viewed as deciding on the allocation

of his wealth by maximizing the objective function



       V = E(dW/W) -         (1/2)R[var(dW/1)].                 (3.1)



J is real wealth, and R is the coefficient of relative risk aversion

        In the two asset model, a home resident allocates a fraction x of

his nominal wealth W to foreign (currency) securities F and the remaining

fraction 1 -     x to       home (currency) securities B:



                    = EF,                                       (3.2a)



       (1 - x)W =      B.                                       (3.2b)



The exchange rate E is the home currency price of foreign currency. Home

and foreign securities are short bonds and have certain nominal returns

represented by i and i respectively:—



       dB/B =   idt,                                            (3.3a)


                *
       dF/F =   idt.                                            (3.3b)
                                         -57-




Real wealth          is nominal wealth deflated by the relevant price index 0:



           =     w/Q = (B + EF)/Q                                          (3.4)




Below we will discuss the alternative assumptions about the stochastic

properties of 0 that have been made by different authors. For what

follows it is useful to note that equations (3.2) and equation (3.4)

imply that



                 = 01W = XO/EF = (1 -    x)0/B.                             (3.5)




          We begin by postulating stochastic processes for E and

function depends on the mean and variance of the stochastic process

followed by the percentage change in real wealth d/t. In order to find

dW/, we make use of Ito's Lemma. Let H =                            K,t) be a twice
                                                        J(K1,...,
continuously differentiable function defined on RnX[O,00). Suppose the K1

follow geometric Brownian motion:
                                           -58-




        dK1/K. =   ,r1dt +             i   =

According to Ito's Lema the stochastic differential of H is given by



        dH (J/K1)dK1 +         (aJ/t)dt        +   (1/2)(a2d/aK.aK.)dK.dK.,           (3.9)




and the product dKdK is defined by



        dz1dz. =
                   r1dt      i,j =   1,...,n,                                         (3.lOa)



        dzdt = 0,              i =   1,...,n,                                         (3.lOh)



where        is the instantaneous correlation coefficient between the l1iener

processes dz and dz.-!



        The stochastic differential of real wealth dW is derived from the

expression for real wealth (B + EF)/f) in equation (3.4). d is equal to

the conventional first differential of this expression plus one half

times the conventional second differential:



     d = (1/Q)dB      +   (E/o)dF + (F/0)dE        -   (W/Q2)do



            +   (1/2)[— (1/02)dQdB + (1/0)dEdF            —       (E/02)dOdF


                      + (1/Q)dFdE - (F/Q2)dQdE



                      -                -                      -

                                      -59-




Note that V   is   not explicitly dependent on time, so there is no dt in the

stochastic differential.

       Multiplying equation (3.11) by 1/a, taking account of the

relationships in (3.5), and combining terms yields an expression for

d/i:



       d/t = (1    -   x)dB/B + xdF/F + AdElE - dO/O


                                                     -   2x(dO/Q)(dF/F)
              + (1/2)[— 2(1 -       x)(dQ/O)(dB/B)


                         -    2A(dE/E)(dF/F)-   2x(dQ/Q)(dE/E) + 2(dQ/Q)2].                  (3.12)




        Application of Ito's Lema to the products of the stochastic

processes yields



       (dO/Q)(dB/B) =    0,          (dQ/Q)(dF/F) =      0,   (dE/E)(dF/F) =   0,            (3.13a)



       (dQ/Q)(dE/E) =                (dQ/Q)2 =                                               (3.13b)

The following example shows how the terms in (3.13) follow from Ito's

Lemma. The product of (3.6) and (3.7) is



       (dQ/Q)(dE/E) =     lrqcdt2 + lrqaedtdze + qdtdZq + aqaedzqdze.               (3.14)
                                            -60-


 The first term on the right hand side is second order of
                                                          magnitude,

 approximately zero. The product dtdz is zero because dz is white

noise. Therefore, the second and third terms disappear. Since the

variance of a continuous time process is proportional to time, the

standard deviation term dz is of the order of magnitude of the square

 root of dt.-1 Therefore, the last term becomes



                                       =
     apedzpdze =
                     apaerpedt


Thus (3.14) reduces to the expression for (dQ/O)(dE/E) in (3.13b).

      The final expression for d/iI is obtained by substituting equations (3.3),

(3.6), (3.7), and (3.13) into equation (3.12):



     d/ = [(1 — A)i + Ai + Ac —

                                                                     ]dt

The expected value of dci/ is given by the coefficient of dt since the

expected value of the dz1 terms is zero:



     E(dt/t) =   (1 — x)i    +       Ai +      -          —          +
                                                     'q       qe         a.   (3.16)



Using Ito s Lema to evaluate (dW/W)                   yields


     (dt/1)2 =          -              +

The variance of dW/W is the coefficient of dt in (3.17):

     var(d/) = A2a -      +                                                     (3.18)

      The home investor's demands for foreign and home securities are

given by equations (3.2) which are repeated here for convenience:



    EF = xW,                                                                     (3.2a)




     B = (1 — x)W,                                                               (3.2b)




where x is given by equation (3.18). The partial derivatives of these

 demands for securities with respect to the expected return differential

 in favor of foreign securities are



      EF/a(i +          -
                            i)   =

 As risk aversion or the variance of the exchange rate increases, demands for

 securities become less sensitive to changes in the expected return differential

          In a model with two securities, the securities must be
                                                                 gross

However, we show below that in a model with three securities, the

securities need not be gross substitutes.



3.3. Implications of a popular specification of the home price index

subsection 3.4.

        In subsection 3.2 we specified a stochastic process for the domestic

price index 0. In this subsection the stochastic process for Q is implied

by the specification of the price index given by equation (3.21) and the

stochastic processes for E, P. and P given by equations (3.6), (3.22), and

the covariance of this process with the stochastic process for the exchange

          The specification of the home price index given by equation (3.21)

 implies that the optimal portfolio rule depends on the share of expenditure

 devoted to the foreign good. Substituting (3.25) into (3.19) yields:



         A =
               (1/Ra){         +     -   i   + (R -   1)1(1   -

 In section 2 it was shown that the properties of portfolio balance models

with postulated asset demands depend critically on whether there is local

asset preference. It seems clear that there is local asset preference

 in most countries. A widely accepted explanation for local asset

preference is that foreigners allocate a larger share of their portfolios

to foreign assets than home residents because they devote a larger share

of their expenditure to foreign goods. Therefore, it is interesting to

ask whether the portfolio rule of equation (3.26) implies a positive

association between the share of wealth devoted to foreign securities x

and the share of expenditure devoted to foreign goods .

         It    turns out that x does not necessarily rise when               increases.

The derivative of x with respect to                      can be written as

          qe
condition for an increase in          to raise A.— If E, P and P are all

stochastic variables, the analysis is somewhat more complicated.

In this case, R > 1 implies that an increase in          raises A    if   and

only if an increase in        raises         Presumably pe > 0   and e <

if R >    1   arises because real wealth is the ratio of two     stochastic

          The portfolio rule (3.19) can be rewritten in two intuitively

 appealing forms whenever the exchange rate and the price index follow

 geometric Brownian motion. This rule can be rewritten in a third

 intuitively appealing fom in the special case of the popular

 specification of the price index in (3.22).

          The optimal portfolio rule (3.19) can be viewed as a weighted

 average of the minimum variance portfolio rule and the logarithmic or

 "international investor's" portfolio rule.'1 The minimum variance

 portfolio rule (AM) is obtained by minimizing (3.17) with respect to A:
                                           —66-




        AM =
                                                                         (3.30)


 If the investor's utility function is logarithmic [U() =            ln],   then
 R =   1.     The logarithmic portfolio rule (XL) is obtained by setting R = 1

 in equation (3.26):



        AL =
                (1/a)( + c - i).                                         (3.31)



This rule has often been referred to as the international investor's

portfolio rule because it is independent of expenditure shares. The

optimal portfolio rule can be written as a weighted average of AM

and AL:



               [(R
                                           (1/R)[(1/a)( + c - i)].
        A =          -                 +
                         1)/R](Pqe/)                                    (3.32)



As the coefficient of relative risk aversion R approaches infinity the

optimal rule approaches the minimum variance rule. As R approaches one

the optimal rule approaches the logarithmic rule. The covariance term

       enters only through the minimum variance portfolio, and the return
qe
differential enters only through the logarithmic portfolio.

        The optimal portfolio can also be written as the sum of the

minimum     variance portfolio and a zero net worth "speculative"
portfolio...Z!           Writing the shares of the optimal portfolio in terms

of deviations from the shares of minimum variance portfolio yields

must sum to zero.

         Finally, in the special case of the popular specification of the

                                                                                be written as the sum
price index in (3.22), the optimal portfolio can

of an "expenditure                 share" portfolio and two zero net worth portfolios.
 In this case                 j5   given        by (3.25).            Therefore, the minimum   variance
                        'qe
portfolio          can be written as the sum of the expenditure share portfolio
 and a zero net worth "hedge" portfolio:

 The expenditure shares sum to unity. Therefore, the shares of the hedge

 portfolio, AH and - AH where



               =                       —             +                                           (3.36)

                                        -68-


 must sum to zero. Note that if E is the only
                                              stochastic variable so
 that               =   0, then the minimum variance shares are simply the
         pe
 expenditure shares.           If E, P. and P are stochastic, the minimum

 variance shares deviate from the expenditure shares when exchange

 rate changes are associated with changes in
                                                        goods prices. Substituting
 equations (3.35) into equations (3.33) confirms that the optimal

 portfolio can be written as the sum of the expenditure share portfolio,

 the hedge portfolio, and the speculative portfolio. Of course, the

 hedge portfolio and the speculative portfolio could be added together

 so that the optimal portfolio could be expressed as the sum of the

expenditure share portfolio and a single zero net worth portfolio.

3.4.     Implications    of relative purchasing power parity

         When                                                           *

vary. Here we explore the implications of assuming that relative

purchasing power parity holds, that is, that the relative price of
                               *
the foreign good is constant (EP/P = k,
                                                             *
                                                 so E =   kP/P).   Given
relative PPP the stochastic differential of E is

Substituting                                   ** **2

obtained using (3.22), (3.23) and Ito's Lemma yields



                                2
        dE/E =   (r -      +

Thus, the variance of the exchange rate and the covariances of the two

 eliminated from the optimal portfolio rule (3.26) with the use of the

 relationships in (3.39) and (3.41):

However, whether this observation confirms the view that the investor

does not face exchange risk is a question of semantics. Other

expressions for the optimal portfolio besides (3.42) are consistent with

relative PPP. For example, using the relationships in (3.41) to solve
for   e in terms of                         and pe substituting the result into

(3.26); and collecting terms yields



        A =

in which                         and          do not appear. All that relative PPP

implies is that E, P, and P are tied together so that specification of

stochastic processes for any two of the three variables implies a

stochastic process for the third.



3.5. Price index - exchange rate covariance and the law of one price

        The optimal portfolio rule depends on the covariance between the

        index and the exchange rate
                                                      'qe unless the coefficient of relative
price

risk aversion equals one.                  In their survey of the literature on
                                      —71—




international portfolio diversification, Adler and Dumes (1983) report

that for many countries the covariance between the consumer price index

and the exchange rate is low in monthly data. This finding suggests

that it is worth asking what might cause the covariance to be low.

      In exploring for possible causes of a low price index - exchange

rate covariance it is useful to adopt a general specification of the

price index, one in which neither relative PPP nor the law of one price

is imposed. Suppose that the home currency price of foreign goods        is

equal to the product of the exchange rate E, the foreign currency price

of foreign goods, and a variable representing the (proportional)

deviation from the law of one price V:



        = EPV.                                                 (3.44)




Then, the price index is given by


               -     *
      0 = P1       (EPV)     .                                 (3.45)


 The exchange rate, the price of home goods, and the price of foreign

 goods follow the stochastic processes (3.6), (3.22), and (3.23)

 respectively, and the deviation from the law of one price follows

 geometric Brownian motion:



      dV/V =             +                                     (3.46)

          The expression for qe implied by equations (3.45), (3.6), (3.22),

satisfied even if there were no deviations from the law of one price.

3.6. Asset demands in a three asset model with exchange rates and the

price Index stochastic

         In the two asset model of subsection 3.2 assets are gross

substitutes as they are in all two asset models. However, in models with

three or more assets, the possibility arises that some assets may be

complements. Whether assets are substitutes or complements depends on

the association between the returns on the assets. If the Interest rate

on the first asset rises and the returns on the second and third assets

are highly correlated, the demand for second asset may rise while the

demand for the third asset falls, or vice versa.

         In this subsection we spell out the conditions under which assets

are complements in a three asset generalization of the two asset model of

subsection 3.2. The objective function V is given by equation (3.1).

The investor allocates a proportion A1 of his nominal wealth W to the

first    foreign security F1, a proportion A2 to the second foreign security
F2, and the remainder to the home security B:



                         A1W = E1F1,                                 (3.Sla)

        (1 - A1      A2)W = B.                                       (3.Slc)

E1, i       1,   2, is   the home currency price of foreign currency I. The
first    foreign security, the second foreign security, and the home

security have certain nominal returns represented by l'             and   I


respectively:

           The portfolio rule can be obtained by inverting R:



           A   = [(R   —
                           1)/RJ.f1p   +       (1/R)f1s.                       (3.61)




This rule is analogous to the rule obtained in the two asset model. The

share of wealth devoted to a single foreign security is replaced by a

vector of shares. The inverse of the variance of exchange rate changes

is replaced by the inverse of the varince-covariance matrix of changes in

exchange rates. The single expected nominal return differential is

replaced by the vector of expected nominal return differentials.                   The

covariance of the price index with one exchange rate is replaced by a

vector of covariances of the price index with exchange rates.

           In equation (3.60) the optimal portfolio shares are expressed as

a weighted average of the shares of the minimum variance portfolio

   =      cfp    and the logarithmic portfolio              = c11o.   The structure of the

logarithmic and minimum variance portfolios in the three asset model is

analogous to the structure of those portfolios in the two asset example:

return differentials enter only the logarithmic portfolio and covariances

of the price index with exchange rates enter only the minimum variance

portfolio.

           The portfolio rule can also be written as the sum of the minimum

variance portfolio              =   cip        and a zero net worth speculative portfolio

      =   c(6     -




          x = ci1p + (1/R)c1(6             -   p).                              (3.62)


  -       p is   a vector of expected real return differentials.

 An increase in the nominal return on the first foreign security raises

 the demand for that security, as always. The two other assets are

 gross substitutes for the first foreign security if both cross partials

are negative, that is, if the correlation between the nominal returns on

the two foreign securities, which is just the correlation between the two

exchange rates, is positive but less than
                                                       y2/c,1.
                                                                 If   the two exchange

rates are positively correlated and have variances that are roughly

equal, the three securities are definitely gross substitutes. Negative

correlation between the two exchange rates implies that the two foreign

securities are complements. Positive correlation and a large enough

value of 11a2 imply that the first foreign security and the home

security are complements. Thus, in a three asset model, making the

assumption that the assets are gross substitutes is equivalent to

imposing restrictions on the correlations between the nominal returns on

assets.

3.7 Asset demands in a general model with exchange rates and the price

index stochastic



        The three asset model can be easily generalized to the case in

which there are N foreign securities and a home security. By analogy the

optimal portfolio rule can be written in two ways:



          =
              [(R -     1)/R]1p + (1/R)f1,                                   (3.64a)



        A =   2'p   +   (1/R)ci1(ss   -   e).                                (3.64b)



   =    c4p   is the minimum variance portfolio,             =      is   the logarithmic

portfolio, and            =       - e)      is the zero net worth speculative

portfolio. A is the N dimensional column vector of the shares of the N

foreign securities in the optimal portfolio. c is the NxN variance—

covariance matrix for the changes in the N exchange rates, which are

defined as foreign currency prices of the home currency. p is the N

dimensional vector of covariances of the price index with the N exchange

                                                                                       -
rates. ô is the N dimensional vector of return differentials, n +
                                                                                   n
n =    1,...,N.     A.M'AL' and           are all N dimensional vectors. For the rules

A, 2M' and AL' the home security share is one minus the sum of the N

foreign security shares; for the rule                  the home security share is the

negative of the sum of the N foreign security shares.

         The basic structure of the general model is the same as that of the

two and three asset models. The logarithmic portfolio is not sensitive

to the choice of assumption regarding price index dynamics. However, the

minimum variance portfolio is sensitive to this choice. Different
                                   -80-


assumptions about price index dynamics made by various analysts are
reflected in different p     vectors.


3.8. Integrating money into the microeconomic theory of asset demands

          The portfolio rules of subsections 3.2 to 3.7 are rules for

allocating     nominal wealth among interest bearing securities. If the mean
and variance of the change in real wealth are the only arguments in the
objective     function, non interest bearing money is not held in portfolios

because it is dominated by securities denominated in the same currency

that pay a certain nominal return. Money has been integrated into the

microeconomic theory of asset demands by assuming that real money

balances enter the investor's objective function. Some analysts justify

the procedure by arguing that real balances as well as goods are inputs

into a "production function" for consumption, so utility can be expressed

as a function of real balances and goods.-' Others argue that an

investor with higher real balances has more leisure because he need

make fewer trips to the bank.-1 There is a lively debate about whether

it is useful to assume that real balances enter the investor's objective

function. We make no attempt to summarize that debate here.-1 Rather

we report some of the results that have been derived under the assumption

that real balances enter the investor's objective function.

          The investor's augmented objective function   is assumed to be the

sum of V in equation 3.1 and a function of real balances Z(M/0), where

Z'   >0   and Z"   < 0:


            = E(d/W) -(l/2)R[var(dW/)} + Z(M/Q).                  (3.65)
                                                   -81-




The investor allocates a proportion A                          of    his nominal wealth to foreign

Solving (3.68a) for the share of foreign securities A yields exactly the

same expression as the one in equation (3.1), which is derived from the
                                  -82-


two asset model with no money. Equation (3.68b) implies a value for the

share of money     given values for W/Q and i. Below we assume some

specific forms for the function Z(M/Q) and solve explicitly for p. The

share of home securities is determined as a residual.

      The optimal portfolio has some interesting properties. The

investor can be viewed as making his portfolio allocation decision in two

steps. First, he divides his portfolio between foreign securities and

total home assets, money and securities, according to equation (3.68a).

Then, he expands his money holdings until equation (3.68b) is satisfied.

The rest of the portfolio goes into home securities. A change in wealth

or the home interest rate alters the holdings of all assets, but a change

in the foreign interest rate affects only holdings of home and foreign

securities. Changes in the transactions demand for money are changes in

Z'. Since these changes do not affect equation (3.68a), the resulting

adjustments in money holdings are matched one for one by adjustments in

home security holdings. All of these properties are reflected in the

basic specification of asset markets of section 2, except that in the

basic specification money demand does not depend on wealth.

      Assuming specific forms for Z(M/Q) makes it possible to solve

explicitly for p or the demand for real balances. First, suppose

Z(M/Q) =   aln(M/Q).-3"   Then Z' =   a/(M/Q), and according to (3.68b) the
demand for real balances is



    M/Q =    (/i)(W/Q).                                           (3.69)
                                          -83-


Now, suppose Z(M/Q) =           (M/Q)/.     Then Z' =   (M/QY   and the demand for

real balances is



                        1

       M/Q =       (W/iO)'.                                               (3.70)




If the underlying utility function displays constant relative risk

aversion, U() =        /y, the      solution of the lifetime consumption problem

implies that optimal real consumption              is a constant fraction of real

wealth t      at   every point in time.4' In this case the demand for money

can    be written as


                        1

        M/O =



with    real consumption as the "activity" variable.

         Under an alternative set of assumptions money demand depends on

real income V. Suppose that a measure of real transactions is given by

kV and that the augmented objective function V is equal to the sum of V

in equation (3.1) and a function that is linear homogeneous in real

balances i and real transactions Z =              (k)1    where 0 <    < 1. In this

case Z =        (k?)'t            and money demand is given by



                            1
          =   k?(,p/i)1
 The arguments of this money demand function are the same as those of the

 money demand function in the basic specification of asset markets of

 section 2 except that the arguments of this money demand function include

 real wealth.


 4. Conclusions


 The microeconomic theory of asset demands discussed in section 3 implies

 some but not all of the properties of the basic specification of asset

 markets in section 2. Under the assumptions of section 3 the demand for

 the sum of assets denominated in each currency is homogeneous of degree

 one in nominal wealth, and the demand for money in each country depends

on the return on the security denominated in that country's currency hut

not on the return on securities denominated in other currencies.

However, under these same assumptions the demand for money depends on

real wealth. Since the conclusions of macroeconomic analysis often

depend crucially on the form of asset demand functions, it is important

to continue to explore the implications of the microeconomic theory of

section 3 and other microeconomic approaches.

         The consumer of section three arrives at his asset demands by

maximizing his utility given interest rates and the parameters of the

distributions of prices and exchange rates. Of course, the distributions

of prices and exchange rates are not invariant to changes in the

distributions   of policy variables and stochastic components of tastes    and
technology. It    has been recognized that a very important item on the

research   agenda is imbedding consumers' asset demands based on utility
maximization    in a general equilibrium model in which the   distributions of

prices   and exchange rate are determined endogenously.-'

           In this appendix it is shown that the determinant of the

differential equation system made up of equation (2.22c) and equation

(2.25) with c = e is always negative. Thus, with flexible prices

stationary equilibrium is always a saddle point. In the perverse case of

subsection 2.7 this result implies that the A schedule is steeper than

the w = 0 schedule.

           Let G represent the matrix of coefficients of the differential

equation system made up of equation (2.22c) and equation (2.25) with

stochastic processes for the domestic price index and the exchange rate

      when the exchange rate E, the home currency price of home goods P,
'qe
the foreign currency price f foreign goods P, and the deviation from the

law of one price all follow geometric Brownian motion. The home price

index is given by

* The authors appreciate helpful coments made by Michael Adler, Shoichi

Katayama, and participants at the conference held at Princeton University

in May 1982 to discuss preliminary drafts of chapters 13 through 23,

especially Peter Kenen, Jorge de Macedo, and the two discussants of this

chapter, Jacob Frenkel and Tim Padmore. This paper represents the views

of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of

the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other members of

its staff.

1/   Almost all the contributions to the literature on asset markets in

open economies in the references of this chapter were published in 1975

or later. Many important contributions were published before 1975.

Bryant (1975) provides an excellent assessment of empirical research on

financial capital flows up to the mid 1970's. He includes in his

references most of the important theoretical and empirical analyses

dealing specifically with asset markets in open economies that were

available when he wrote.

2/   The portfolio balance approach to macroeconomic modeling was

developed by Metzler (1951) and Tobin (1969).

3/   This argument is often referred to as the Lucas (1976) critique.

4/   Throughout the rest of this paper home currency securities and

foreign currency securities are referred to as home securities and

foreign securities respectively. In order to simplify the analysis, we

assume that there are no home and foreign capital stocks and, therefore,

no equity claims on those capital stocks. Models with capital stocks and

equity claims are discussed by Bruce and Purvis in chapter 16 and by

Obstfeld and Stockman in chapter 17.
5/ We assume that the sum of the partial derivatives of each asset

demand function with respect to its first four arguments is zero so that,
                 4
for example            m< =   0.   Under this assumption expressing any asset demand
                k =0

as a function of nominal returns is equivalent to expressing it as a

function of real returns since the expected rate of change of the price

of a country's consumption bundle in terms of its currency can be

subtracted from all nominal returns without changing the value of the

asset demand.

6/ Precisely, the assumption that expectations are static implies

that c    is   exogenous. However, it is usual to specify paths for the

exogenous variables other than E             that   lead to a unique value for the

steady state actual rate of depreciation, and it is natural to set E

equal to that value. Throughout this section it is assumed that the

asset stocks available for the public to hold do not change continuously

over time ( =            =     =    = 0).   Steady states are stationary states in

which the actual rate of depreciation is equal to zero, so it makes sense

to set c equal to zero under static expectations. Kouri (1q76) develops

a model   in   which residents of the home country face a fixed foreign

currency price of the single world good and allocate their wealth between

home and foreign money. He sets the exogenous expected rate of

depreciation equal to the exogenous positive rate of growth of home money

under static expectations.

7/ Models that allow for currency substitution have been constructed by

Girton and Roper (1981), Kareken and Wallace (1981), Lapan and Enders

(1980), and Nickelsburg (1983) among others. In most contributions
                                         -91-




currency substitution is defined as substitution among national moneys

defined as currency and coin plus deposits that bear non market related

or zero rates of interest. According to firton and Roper, currency

substitution warrants special study because moneys are the only financial

assets that have their stated returns, if any, fixed in terms of

themselves. Girton and Roper employ postulated money demand functions.

Kareken and Wallace, Lapan and Enders, and Nickelsburg assume that moneys

are the only stores of value in models with overlapping generations

composed of individuals who maximize explicit utility functions.

8/ If goods prices, outputs, and initial asset holdings are taken as

exogenous, the model of equations (2.9) is representative of short-run

portfolio balance models of international financial markets. Other

models of this type are employed by Black (1973), Dooley and Isard

(1982), Frankel (1983), Freedman (1977), Girton and Henderson (1977,

1976a, 1976b), Henderson (1979), Herring and Marston (1977a, 1977b),

Hewson and Sakakibara (1975), Kouri and Porter (1974), and Marston

(1980). When short-run portfolio balance models are used to analyze a

regime of flexible exchange rates, it is usually assumed that exchange

rate expectations are static or regressive.

9/ Under the basic specification the derivative of the excess demand

for foreign securities with respect to the exchange rate,

       f7F + f5PY   +
                        f7   (+)-

11/ The implications of several alternative specifications of goods

markets are considered by Bruce and Purvis in chapter 16.

12/ For simplicity we adopt the system of taxes and transfers under

which interest payments do not enter the analysis suggested by Allen and

Kenen (1980). Each government taxes away all the interest received by

the residents of its country and transfers to the government of the

other country an amount equal to the interest received by the residents

of its country from the other country. Under this system, the current

account surplus and trade account surplus of a country are equal , and if

the budget of the government of a country is balanced, the disposable

income of its residents is equal to output minus government spending.

13/ For simplicity we assume that saving in each country does not

depend on the real returns on home and foreign securities. If this

assumption were relaxed in the case of flexible prices and rational

expectations, it would be necessary to analyze a system of four

differential equations rather than a system of two differential

equati ons.
                                                             *
14/ Our assumption about the effects of increases in P and EP on home

and foreign spending on home and foreign goods is sufficient but not
                                -93-



necessary to insure that increases in P reduce the home trade surplus and
                   *
that increases in EP increase it. Of course, without our assumption it
is possible that increases in P increase the home trade surplus and that
              *
increases in EP reduce it.
15/ In the derivation of equations (2.21) we make use of the

appropriately modified versions of equations (2.1) and equations (2.19).

16/   In the relatively lengthy and tedious derivation of equations (2.22)

we make use of the appropriately modified versions of equations (2.1),

equations (2.18), and equations (2.19). We approximate the goods market

equilibrium conditions and the balance of payments equation around long-

run equilibrium where home and foreign saving are zero.    In the

neighborhood of long run equilibrium equations (2.18) and (2.19) imply a

key relationship:



               +
                   X2W - y2W.


17/ This assertion can be confirmed by substituting relationships

implied by equations (2.18) and 2.19) into the definitions of

             and

18/   If s2 is not equal to s, the indirect effect from the induced price

changes does not necessarily reinforce the direct effect. However, the

overall effect of the transfer on the trade surplus is always to reduce

it; that is C6 is always positive.

19/ Kouri (1983a) uses this terminology.

20/ The determinant of the differential equation system made up of


equation (2.20) and equation (2.24) with e = e is -       < 0.

22/   The instability problem associated with negative net foreign asset

positions is a central issue in several recent papers: Boyer (1977);

Branson, Haittunen, and Masson (1979); and Martin and Masson (1979). It

is also discussed by Tobin and de Macedo (1981). Tobin (1980) summarizes

a main conclusion reached in these papers. The problem is considered

further by Henderson and Rogoff (1982), Kouri (1983a), Masson (1981), and

Melitz (1982). The conclusions presented here are similar to those of

Henderson and Rogoff and Kouri but somewhat different from those of

Masson. Melitz argues that the transactions demand for money is an

important stabilizing influence.

23/   The negative net foreign asset case is not the only portfolio

constellation that has led analysts to question the stability of open

economy portfolio balance models. Enders (1977) and Masson (1980)

discuss the possibility that instability might arise when positive net

foreign asset positions are "too large." See footnotes 24, 26, 8, and

30.

24/   If Ce is positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <
                                                                           b7),
long-run equilibrium is definitely unstable under static expectations.

With goods prices fixed, b7 <      is   a necessary and sufficient condition

for c to be negative. In this case, as in the perverse case of the

text, the As schedule is upward sloping. It can be shown that if the

assumption that in each country the demand for the good produced in the

other country is independent of nominal spending is dropped, long—run
                                      -95-




equilibrium is stable for some, but not all, parameter values. Thus,

with goods prices fixed, the Enders (1977) problem of instability caused

by large net foreign asset positions can arise even if it is assumed that

the home trade surplus depends on nominal spending in both countries.

25/    See footnote 20.

2.6/   If Ce > 0 but b7 <          so that     <   0, long-run equilibrium is
                              b7
definitely not a saddle point. The determinant of the differential

equation system made up of equation (2.20) and equation (2.24) with

  = e is -          > 0.   It can be shown that either the two roots of the

characteristic equation are real and positive or they are complex

conjugates with positive real parts. It can also be shown that if the

assumption that in each country the demand for the good produced in the

other country is independent of nominal spending is dropped, long—run

equilibrium is a saddle point under rational expectations if and only if

it is stable under static expectations. Thus, with goods prices fixed,

the Enders (1977) problem can arise under rational expectations even if

it is assumed that the home trade surplus depends on nominal spending in

both countries.

27/    This assertion is proved in Appendix 1.

28/    If Ce   is   positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <

long—run equilibrium is definitely stable under static expectations

With goods prices flexible and b7 <                  may he negative and C5 is
                                             b7,
definitely negative. Thus, the A5 schedule may be upward sloping, and

the w = 0 schedule is definitely downward sloping. It is shown in
                                  -96-



Appendix 1 that if the As schedule is downward sloping, it is flatter

than the w = 0 schedule. Although the effect of a wealth transfer on the

exchange rate depends on the slope of the As schedule, long-run

equilibrium is stable whatever the slope of this schedule. Thus, with

good prices flexible, the Enders (1977) problem cannot arise.

29/   It is shown in Appendix 1 that the determinant of the differential

equation system made up of equation (2.22c) and equation (2.25) with

e is always negative.

30/   If e is positive but there is foreign asset preference (b7 <

long-run    equilibrium is definitely a saddle point under rational

expectations. See footnote 21.

31/   Markowitz (1959) and Tobin (1965) laid the foundations of portfolio

selection theory.

32/   Merton (1971) pioneered this approach.

33/   Merton (1969) shows that the portfolio allocation decision is

independent of the saving decision in a continuous time model. He

assumes both that the investorss utility function exhibits constant

relative risk aversion and that percentage changes in asset prices follow

geometric    Brownian motion. Samuelson (1969) derives the same result in a
discrete time model. He assumes constant relative risk aversion but puts
no restrictions on the distribution of returns.

34/   Merton (1971) proves this result.

35/   Solnik (1974) was the first to analyze portfolio selection in an

open economy using stochastic calculus. He assumes that residents of

each country consume only the good produced in that country and that

goods prices are non stochastic.
