                     The Effects of Interest Rates on
                           Mortgage Prepayments

                                 ABSTRACT



         Three main types of mortgages are fixed interest contracts which
automatically fall due on the sale of a dwelling, fixed rate loans which
are assumable by a buyer, and floating rate instruments. When interest rates
rise, the fall in the economic value of these assets in savings and loan
associations' portfolios varies from one form of mortgage to another. For
either of the fixed interest rate contracts, the cash flow from the mortgage
is constant as long as it has not been prepaid. If the interest rate rises,
the homeowner has a nominal capital gain, since his loan is then at a below
market interest rate. He would therefore be less likely to prepay. The fall
in the savings and loans' net worth arises from two factors: (1) the interest
rate differential for mortgages of a fixed duration, and (2) the endogenous
lengthening of the duration.
         This paper is an attempt to measure the dependence of the duration of
mortgages on the implicit unrealized capital gain of mortgage holders resulting
from interest rate changes. Our estimate is based on a sample of 4,000 mortgages
issued in California which were active in 1975. We follow their payment history
from 1975 to 1982. Using a Proportional Hazards Model, we estimate the percentage
reduction in prepayment probability associated with interest rate changes. Our
results indicate that for due—on—sale fixed interest rate mortgages, a sudden
increase in the interest rate from 10 to 15 percent would induce a 23 percent
loss in the economic value of the mortgage. If the mortgage were assumable,
this loss would be 28 percent. Correspondingly, the 6—year average time to
repayment of mortgages at a constant interest rate would be lengthened to nine
years for due—on—sale mortgages, and 13—1/2 years for assumable ones.

1. Introduction

         Saving and loan institutions have experienced extremely difficult

times in the last four or five years largely because of the term structure

of their assets and liabilities. Most of these institutions hold relatively

long term fixed yield mortgage assets, while their liabilities are fairly

short term savings accounts. Both long and short term interest rates rose

in the 1980—82 period above their level in the preceding period. This

depressed the value of the saving and loans' mortgage assets, causing the

net worth of many of these institutions to become negative. This fact, however,

was somewhat disguised by standard accounting conventions which do not mark

assets to their market value. In addition to the negative net worth situation,

the institutions faced severe cash flow problems caused by the higher interest

rates on liabilities and the reduced prepayment experience on mortgages.

         The purpose of this study is more limited than an overall assessment

of the economic position of the saving and loans. Our purpose is to look at

the nature of the mortgage asset itself and ask what determines the probability

that the mortgage will be paid off at a particular time or age. For years, the

industry has seemingly worked with "rules of thumb." At one time, the conven-

tional assumption was that mortgages would, on average, be paid off in seven

years. The rule currently seems to be 12 years. We want to judge whether these

rules are adequate for valuing a mortgage portfolio and, implicitly, what caused

the "rule" to change from seven to 12 years?

        A mortgage asset is similar to an annuity. The owner receives a

fixed stream of dollars for the life of the contract (or, in the case of an

annuity, over the life of the owner). The value of both assets is sensitive


                                      1
                                        2


to interest rate fluctuations. A change in the interest or discount rate

from ten to 11 percent, for example, will change the nominal value of a 30

year annuity or mortgage by almost ten percent. There are key Institutional

differences between mortgage assets and annuities, however. First, the

mortgage borrower is usually free to buy out of the contract, subject to

some modest prepayment penalties, if interest rates fall. It is as if the

lending institution had sold a call option to the borrower on its mortgage

asset at the time the contract was agreed upon. Presumably this call feature

is priced in the interest rate and other terms of the mortgage. Second, most

mortgages have traditionally had a due—on—sale clause, meaning that the lender

could   claim the face value of the mortgage if the borrower sells the residence.
If interest rates are lower than the contracted rate of the mortgage at the time
of the sale, this option of the lender will not be enforced.   However, if the

prevailing   rate is higher than the contracted rate, the homeowner is forced to

give up a below—market loan should he sell the house. This sacrifice or "lock—in"

presumably affects the likelihood of selling and therefore the effective expected

maturity of the mortgage asset and its value. One would not expect people to switch

houses as frequently if they would have to exchange their low interest rate mortgage

for a new one at the higher market rates. The point is that the effective maturity

of the mortgage asset is endogenous to the evolution of interest rates and,

perhaps, other economic variables.
           The main goal of our research has been to estimate the sensitivity of

mortgage prepayments to prevailing interest rates. The subject is of immediate

importance because of the precarious financial condition of saving and loan

and saving bank institutions in the U.S. Since due—on—sale fixed—interest rate

mortgages play a major role in their portfolios, assessing their economic net

worth position requires valuation of these assets which, in turn, depends on

their effective or expected maturity.
                                      3

         One reason why assessing the net worth of the saving and loan

 financial intermediaries is of current importance is the level of merger

activity in the industry. In a fair number of these mergers effective

subsidies have been made to the acquiring institution by the FSLIC or FDIC.

The subsidy is deemed necessary to entice the purchaser to absorb a weak

institution. All parties in such arrangements need to be able to access

the true net worth of the acquired institution. Another demand for mortgage

valuation comes from financial markets. Not only is there merger activity

in the intermediaries themselves, but there also are financial instruments

such as pass—through certificates, mortgage backed bonds, and REITs which

must be priced in markets. The sensitivity of mortgage values to interest

rate changes is clearly important in this determination. In addition to

the standard negative relationship between valuation and interest rates

as with fixed term bonds, mortgage assets have the interest effect on

maturity which is the subject of our study.

        There has been a great deal of activity recently with respect to

due—on—sale clauses and their enforceability. In 1978 the case of Cynthia

J. Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, et al. prohibited the use of due—on—sale

clauses for the sole purpose of raising mortgage rates. By denying those

owning mortgage assets of their option to collect face value on sale

of the residence, a claim of substantial value was transferred from the

lending institutions to mortgage holders. Dietrich (1982) estimated that

the loss in mortgage value due to the unenforceability of DOS clauses amounted

to more than the total net worth for state—chartered California S&Ls in 1981.

He figured that the value of the mortgage portfolios of the California

institutions was reduced by 9.3 percent by this one action. More recently,

of course, the U.S. Supreme Court found in 1982 that DOS clauses are
                                         4

enforceable for federally chartered institutions. It is unclear whether

the legal aspects are completely settled at this time, but the episode

vividly demonstrated the value of the DOS provision to lending organizations.

            The approach we have taken is to collect data on individual mortgages

and analyze their prepayment experience. A large part of our effort has

gone into the collection of the data itself. We have followed the prepayment

experience of almost 4,000 mortgages of two California saving and loans for

the eight years 1975—1982. What we then estimate is a life—table for mortgages.

The analogy with mortality tables is rather complete. We compute for each n

(n =   0,   l...,29) the conditional probabilities of a mortgage which has been

outstanding n years of being paid off in the (n+l)st year. The sensitivity

of this probability series to the "lock—in" effect of interest rates is

estimated. An analogy would be calculating the effect of certain climattic

changes on mortality. The estimation techniques used are identical to those

used by demographers for life tables.

             The next section of the paper presents the methodology and estimation

procedure we utilize. Then, the third section describes our data set in some

detail. The fourth section presents the estimation results and our interpretation

of them. We conclude with some observations on the usefulness of the inormatinn

we have learned.

 2. Methodology
        We want to estimate the effect of changes in interest rates on

the turnover rates ofmortgages. It is most important to recognize that

the primary determinants of the decision to sell a house are not related to

interest rate fluctuations. They are largely concerned with the personal

circumstances of the owner: job changes, births of children, changes in

family income or wealth, changes in taste for the type of housing, divorce,

marriage, etc. We have no way of knowing why any given mortgage dd or

did not turn over in a given year. The only evidence of individual

characteristics that we do have is the length of tenure in the house.

        There are, thus, two relevant variables in our study: length of

tenure in the house, and an imputed "recapitalized" or "market" value of

the mortgages. We want to estimate the probability of turnover at each tenure

as a function of the relationship between this "market" value of the mortgage

and its remaining principal balance.

         Estimating the effect of the interest rate lock—in on mortgage

prepayments presents the problem of a time varying covariate. In addition,

the fact that much of the sample remained alive in 1982 (the last year of

observation), gives us the commonly encountered econometric problem of a

censored sample. Below we discuss these problems in detail and describe

our econometric method.

The Problem of Parameterization and Sample Size

           The most flexible specification would allow for a different hazard

function for each value of the exogenous variables affecting turnover. However,

estimating separate life tables for each risk—exposure category would require

vastly more data than we have available. Let us suppose that we divided the

interest rate differentials or lock—in magnitudes into five or ten groups.



             L1Lue LJULLU LeLL      r—UL                              f
The sample size within each group would be less than 1,000. For some ages,

particularly -——                                                     mortgages

at risk would be too low to permit an accurate assessment of their turnover rate.
Separating    the sample in this way, ::even if it were possible, would implicitly

assume that there is no relationship at all between the turnover rates at the

same age for various interest rate differentials. But economic theory and

common sense tell us that the extent of the lock—in effect should be increasing

in the interest rate differential. An accurate estimation procedure should take

these restrictions into account.

          Moreover, even though we have quite a large sample, the number of

parameters that would have to be estimated by the separate group method

would be beyond what the data could reliably provide. Morestructure, that

is to say, a more parsimonious parameterization is needed. We employ the

Proportional Hazards Model, which is widely used in demography and medical

research, as well as in economics.1 Under the Proportional Hazards Hypothesis,

the probability of a turnover can be divided into two multiplicative factors

as follows:

                  probability of turnover
(1)
                  of mortgage age (a) if     =
                  exogenous factors are
                  X1,.. .,x at time t
                          n

1See   Heckman and Singer (1982a and 1982b).
                                          7




Here A(a) is the "base line hazard" ——        that   proportion of the population

that would turn over even under completely stationary, homogeneous conditions.

The second factor, 71(x1,. .   .x)   is greater or less than one according to

whether the exogenous factorsx1,...,x make turnover more or less likely.

The essential assumption is that of proportionality. If x1,...,x make

turnover more likely at one age, they have an equiproportional impact at

all ages. Finally, it is implicit in the above formula that the effect of

X-,..
 1
      x     tm   turnover   time—separable. Past attrIbutes of the environment

and anticipated future values are assumed not to have any affect on turnover

in the present.

          We defer a discussion of the functional form of ir(x1,...,x) and the

choice of exogenous variables to the section on estimation, below. While we

continue to develop the methodology for the general a variable case, in the

empirical section we will deal only with the "interest rate lock—in" variable,

i.e., a =   1.

Non—constancy of Factors Affecting Turnover

          The standard proportional hazards model is based on the presumption

that factors affecting turnover are specific to the individual but do not

vary during the period over which the individual is followed in the sample.

For instance, in a medical context, a history of previous illness may be

known and may be thought relevant to the life expectancy of the patient.

The selected method of treatment in a randomized clinical trial would also

be such a time—invariant variable.

          In our model it is essential to recognize that the differential

between an. imputed "market" value of the loan and the contractual value is

fluctuating over time. The holder of a mortgage has an option to prepay,

and the value of that option depends on his expectations about the course of

future interest rates. We assume that borrowers consider the current value
                                            8


of their mortgage in deciding whether or not to prepay. They do not

attempt to buy options or futures contracts whose value would fluctuate so

as to insulate them from the risks inherent in the mortgage contract.

They make their decisions myopically, year by year. For the vast majority

of homeowners, this is undoubtedly correct.

         This time—separability assumption allows us to estimate the hazard

function ir (x1 ,..   . ,x)   even in the time—varying case, by using a maximum

lkelhood technique that treats each year for each mortgage as a separate

observation whose value is the binary decision: prepay or do not prepay.

The details are given in the estimation section.



Estimation

         The Proportional Hazards Model described above is implemented by

parameterizing the function ir as follows:




(2)               ir(xi,...,x) = e


We first discuss the estimation of the coefficients                   when the

exogenous variables x1,...,x are fixed for each mortgage. Of course, as

interest rates do vary, that is not the case. A more general estimation

procedure is necessary for the time—varying case. We discuss this subsequently.

         The data in the time—invariant case gives, for each observation, the

issue date of the mortgage, its termination date if it was prepaid, the original

interest rate, and the original principal amount. From this we compute the

magnitudes actually used as the exogenous x variables in the hazard function.

If the mortgage was still active at the time our data collection stopped, the
                                            9


observation      is referred to as "censored;" if it has been prepaid, we refer

to its age at prepayment as the "failure age."

             A typical mortgage will be denoted by the subscript L, and the total

number of mortgages is k, thus we let L =       1,... ,k.   The data relevant to each

mortgage is a vector of n numbers which may vary over the lifetime of the

mortgage. At calendar time t, the characteristics of mortgage & are described

by
                             x = (x1,.

For each mortgage, t runs from its issue date to the termination date. If

it is observed to be prepaid, the last t is the prepayment date; if it is

not prepaid, the last t is the date of our study, that is 1982.

             Because the maximum possible age of a mortgage is 30 years, we let

i =   1,...,30   describe the age of the mortgage at termination, whether this

is   a prepayment ("failure") or a non—prepayment as of 1982       ("censored").

For   each   i, let    be the set of mortgages that failed at age i, and let d1

be the number of mortgages in D. Let R1 be the set of mortgages at risk

of failure at age i; that is, the mortgages that did not fail at any age

less than i. Since, at age i, some mortgages fail and some do not,             is

a subset of R1.

             We now describe the log—likelihood of a given sample. It is a function

of the vector of parameters (B =
                                      B]... ,B)   that correspond to the influence

                                                                      =
of each of the n characteristics of mortgage £ at time t,
                                                                          (xi&,.. ,xQ).
                                                                                   .




In vector notation, the Proportional Hazards Model (2) is written


                             ir(x)   e 8x

The log likelihood is factored into a part due age alone and the part above
                                                   10


due to the variables x. The parameters B are found by maximizing the

second of these parts.

         Kalbfleish and Prentice (1980) present an approximation to this

expression, known as the partial likelihood. Let


                                  Sj            XLt
                                         LcD1

where tL is the calendar time at which mortgage L failed (i.e., it was age 1).

The log partial likelihood is


          30                  (                 xL       B
(3)              s — d1og                      e
          i=1             LeR(i)


where t   is    the calendar time at which mortgage L is age 1. (Kalbfleish

and Prentice discuss this partial likelihood method in their Chapter 4,

Section 4.2.2.)

          Given an estimate of B, we can estimate the hazard for a mortgage

age i whose characteristics are x2,                     which is

            The likelihood functions, equations (3) and (5), are maximized by

  an iterative Gaussian or Newton—type technique. The approach is to make a

  first guess or estimate of a or 8, calculate the first derivatives of the

  log likelihood function and the matrix of second partials and solve the

  linearized system of equations for a zero of the first derivatives.      This

  will give a "next guess" value for a or B which meet the first order conditions

  for a maximum, except that the assumed linearity of the first derivatives is

  inaccurate. The procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved. It

  should be noted that only local maxima    are   calculated from this type of procedure

  and that multiple equilibria are a real possibility. We have not experienced

 this problem as far as we can tell, but it cannot be ruled out a priori.

 A principal advantage of the Proportional Hazard specification is that the

 maximum likelihood estimate of 8 is separable from the estimation of the

baseline hazard function X(a). Therefore, 8 is computed first and X(a) is

computed by a separate maximum likelihood routine holding B fixed.

           The key covariate (x) for our analysis is a measure of the lock—in

caused by an interest rate differential between that prevailing in the

mortgage market and the contracted rate of the mortgage. We considered a

number of specifications of this phenomenon. The most straightforward, 'of

course,   would simply be the dollar value difference between the two valuations.

We felt that this was not the correct specification since a $15,000 lock—in

presumably affects the owner of a $60,000 dwelling more than someone who owns

a $300,000 home. It was our feeling that the prepayment probability was

probably affected by the percentage of the lock—in relative to the value of the
house. The lock—in effect can be thought of as a transaction cost of

moving similar to the brokers fees (which traditionally are five or six

percent). Unfortunately, one piece of information not in our data set
                                     12


is the market value of the dwelling. What we have done is create a

lock—in variable defined as the difference between the face and market

values of the mortgage (where the market value is calculated using

current mortgage rates for the full remaining life of the mortgage) divided

by the initial principal amount updated by the ratio of the price index for

housing to its level at the time of issuance. This gives us a proxy for the

percentage lock—in relative to the "real" initial mortgage amount. If house-

holds financed similar proportions of their purchase, then it would be propor-

tional to our preferred lock—in measure. As it stands, this measure imperfectly

captures what we would expect to be most closely related to prepayment behavior,

but it seems the most satisfactory available option given the data.

3. Data Set

        The data set contains 3,938 mortgages held by two large California

Savings and Loan Associations. A sample of mortgages active in a base year

was selected and followed through 1982. The base year in each case was

chosen on the basis of data availability; for the first association, data

were available beginning in 1975 and for the second association, data were

available in 1976. The mortgages were all issued for California homes and

all areas of the State were represented. Officials at both S&Ls believe

their portfolios are typical of those of California savings and loans.

(The data set we assembled with identifiers removed can be obtained by

writing the authors.)



        Approximately 52 percent of the sample came from the first association.

Extensive information was available regarding the active mortgages, including

original mortgage amount, interest rate, principal and interest payments,

current principal balance, payment history, loan—to—value ratio, term, and due

date. Information on paid off mortgages was much more limited; usually interest

rate, principal and interest payment, balance at payoff, and date of payoff were

available. The sample consists primarily of conventional mortgages, although

some VA and FHA mortgages are included. All of the mortgages have fixed

interest rates.

        The remaining 48 percent of the sample came from the second association.

Eighty—four percent are conventional mortgages, ten percent are VA mortgages,

and six percent are FHA mortgages. Information available on the active

mortgages included principal amount, interest rate, monthly principal and

interest payment, issue date, mortgage type, and impounds. For paid off
                                     14


mortgages, data include interest rate, principal and interest payment,

mortgage type, and payoff date.
        While we know the aggregate proportions for conventional, FHA, and

VA mortgages, we do not know which individual mortgages are of which type.

This is unfortunate, since VA and FHA loans are contractually assumable and

should, therefore, be treated separately. Obtaining this information for

our data set is difficult or impossible at this point, but this problem should

be recognized in designing similar studies in the future. The effect of this
mixture of mortgages on our estimates will be discussed below.
         Our data set is described in Tables 1 and 2. The first of these

shows the age and payoff distribution for the entire set. Of the 3,938 mortgages,

2,037 were paid off in the 1975 to 1982 period, while 1,901 were still active

at the end of 1982. Most of our mortgages were issued between 1962 and 1975,

and thus were ages 0 through 20 in the 1975 to 1982 interval. Table 2 gives

descriptive data for the sample by mortgage issue year. The rising pattern

of interest rates is shown, as is the concentration of the sample (in terms

of total principal amount) in mortgages issued between 1970 and 1975.

         There are a number of problems with the data set. Among the relatively

minor, technical difficulties, issue dates for paid off mortgages had to be

estimated by loan number. At both associations, numbers are assigned to loans

chronologically within large groups of numbers, so paid off mortgages were

assigned the issue dates of active mortgages with similar loan numbers. This

method of dating is not precise, and some mistakes were surely made, but it

is unlikely that any assigned issue year is off by more than one year in either

direction. Original mortgage amounts were not always available for paid off

mortgages, so these vlaues were calculated assuming each mortgage had a 30

year term; almost all active mortgages had 30 year terms, so this is not a bad

assumption.

        Another problem involves the sample of "old" (20 year or longer)

mortgages. A random sample of 2,000 mortgages active in 1975 will yield

few old mortgages because associations currently issue a much larger number

of mortgages each year than they did in the l950s, and most of the mortgages

that were issued in the early l950s were paid off before the base year of   1975.
While mortgages exist for each age, for the longest lives there may be only

two or three mortgages available. The sample would have to be either increased

drastically or drawn on a stratified basis to correct this problem.

         The most severe problem, however, is that the two institutions, while

now federally chartered, were state chartered until 1981. Both of them changed

the nature of their charter largely because of the Wellenkamp decision regarding

the enforceability of due—on—sale clauses. Both institutions included due—on—

sale clauses in their mortgages and enforced its provisions for single—family

home mortgage contracts before the court decision, but were prohibited from

doing so thereafter unless they could show that allowing assumption by the

purchaser of the house would impair the security of the mortgage due to an

increased risk of default. For practical purposes, this meant that the DOS

clauses were not enforceable. This situation has been reversed with the

DeLaCuesta decision and the Cam—St. Germain Act in 1982, but their impact

was not effective until after the completion of our data sample.

         The approach we have taken is to divide the sample into two periods,

1975—1978, and 1979—1982, and separately estimate for each of these intervals

the sensitivity of prepayment experience to interest rate fluctuations. Clearly

this reduces the power of our estimation procedures, since it leaves us with

a smaller number of observations in each of the two periods, but our estimates

are still reasonably precise. It also permits us to judge the effect of the

Wellenkamp decision on prepayment experience and hence the valuation of mortgage

portfolios.

4. Results

         In our empirical work, we have used the Proportional Hazards Model

with one variable. The lock—in variable is defined as



               lock—ini = face value1 — market value1
                            initial   principal amount1 x t
                                                         P0
where P is a price index for residential housing at time t and P0 is that

index at the time the mortgage was Issued.

         This lock—in measure is calculated for each mortgage still alive in

each year during the 1975—1982 interval. Since the mortgages in our sample

were issued between 1947 and 1976, mortgages of all ages are observed. Tables

3 and 4 show the number of mortgages which reached each age in the 1975—1978

and the 1979—1982 interval respectively. Again, the data are separated in this

way because of the Wellenkamp decision. Any mortgage which reached a particular

age in the interval of observation is termed "at risk." The number of mortgages

which were at risk for each age is shown in the first column of Tables 3 and 4.

The number which prepaid (or "died") is shown in the second columns. The third

and fourth columns report the average lock—in for all at risk mortgages and

for only those which prepaid, respectively. Interestingly, the average lock—in

is lower for those mortgages which paid off for almost every age in both the

pre—Wellenkamp period and in the 1979—1982 interval. This gives some preliminary

indication that interest rate lock—in may be an important determinant of

prepayment probabilities.

         The maximum likelihood estimates confirm this preliminary finding and

also allow us to measure the impact of the Wellenkamp decision. The estimate

for   in the pre—Wellenkamp period is —4.37 with a standard error of .55, while

the figure for the 1979—82 period Is —13.07 with a standard error of 1.37.

To aid in interpreting these numbers, note that they indicate that a modest

ten percent lock—in would have reduced prepayment probabilities by 33 percent

in the due—on—sale period 1975—78 and by 63 percent in 1979—82. The results

indicate that even in a due—on—sale regime, the likelihood of prepayment depends

on the relationship between the contractual rate on the mortgage and the market

rate. In the period when the due—on—sale clause was unenforceable, the prepayment

experience was even more sensitive to interest rates. In that period, prepayment

would seldom occur unless the buyer could for some reason not asssume the loan.

Also, for older mortgages the lock—in is smaller (relative to the current cost

of the house) and therefore the loan may be prepaid at the time of sale.

         Recall that a small fraction of our mortgages were FHA and VA

loans which are contractually assumable. This would bias the estimate

in the 1975—78 interval upwards in absolute value. Therefore, the large

effect we attribute to the Wellenkaiup decision may be underestimated)

         The estimated base line hazard as a function of mortgage age is shown

in Table 5. The hazards for the first 18 years or so are estimated with

reasonable precision, while for inortages older than that the relative scarcity

of data means that the hazard cannot be precisely determined.

         Tables 6 and 7 show the sensitivity to market interest rates of the

cash flow (interest plus principal plus prepayments) from $1,000,000 of ten

percent 30 year mortgages. The first of these tables is calculated for the

1975—78 period and hence with B = —4.37.   If interest rates climb to 15 percent,

the pattern of the cash flow from the ten percent mortgages is changed

significantly. For instance, the cash flow from the mortgages at age two is

reduced from $203,455 to $138,401. This is due entirely to the reduced prepayment

 experience. The cash flow is higher at 15 percent than at ten percent for

 older mortgages because more of the mortgages survive to these ages. For

 instance, at 20 years, the cash flow at ten percent Is $8,914, whereas at

 15 percent, it is $23,475.

          During the 1979—82 Wellenkamp period, this sensitivity of cash flows

to interest rates was greatly Increased as is evidenced by Table 7. In this

period, $1,000,000 of ten percent mortgages could be expected to generate

$203,455 at age 2 with interest rates at ten percent, but only $108,881 at

15 percent interest. At age 20, the numbers are $8,914 at ten percent versus

$80,704 at 15 percent. This nine to one ratio reflects the vastly greater

interest payments from the much greater number of old mortgages in the 15 percent

case.

         These cash flows can be put in perspective by calculating their present

value at the time of issue. This is done in Table 8. It shows that as market

interest rates rise from ten percent to 15 percent, the value of the mortgages

falls 22.74 percent if they are due—on—sale and 28.10 percent if that clause

cannot be enforced. Both numbers exceed the fall in value that would be

experienced by a fixed maturity instrument of the same duration, of course, but

the Interesting thing to note is the very significant difference between the

effects in the two regimes. The loss with 15 percent interest is 23.6 percent

greater in the Wellenkamp era, resulting in the mortgages losing 5.36 percent

of their value over and above what they would have lost in a due—on—sale

environment. This 5.36 percent difference could easily eliminate the net equity

position of a savings and loan. Thus, the table Indicates both that the value

of mortgages is highly sensitive to interest rates and that this value depends

significantly on the rules regarding due—on—sale.

          The sensitivity of the average time to repayment to interest rates

 is shown in Table 9 for ten percent mortgages. The figures indicate that a

 ten percent mortgage will, on average, prepay in 7.331 years if market rates

have gone up to 12 percent and due—on—sale clauses are enforced. If mortgages

are assumable, the average time to repayment is 10.337 years. The numbers

indicate that interest rate changes alone are sufficient to account for

the changing rule of thumb regarding standard lifetime assumptions, but

they also indicate how inappropriate any fixed rule of thumb really is.


5. Conclusion

         We began this research with the feeling that the determinants of

prepayment experience had received too little attention. The importance of

the matter seemed far too great to uncritically rely on rules of thumb to

assess prepayment likelihoods. The first thing we learned in this study was

that the data to examine prepayment experience are not readily available.

While longitudinal panel surveys do exist for households, similar information

regarding mortgages does not seem to be publicly available. We have corrected

this situation to an extent by collecting information on 3,938 individual

mortgages which were active in 1975 and 1976 and by following them through 1982.

Certainly research in the area of mortgage evaluation would be aided by better

data. We found the institutions quite willing to provide the data and were

limited only by the usual time and money constraints.

         Our results indicate that market interest rates are a significant

determinant of prepayment probabilities. When due—on—sale clauses were applicable,

our information indicates that a ten percent lock—in reduces prepayment

probabilities 35 percent. If the clause cannot be enforced, the reduction in
                                     28


probability becomes 63 percent. Both of these effects would be eliminated

if mortgages had floating interest rates. Our analysis indicates that the

rules regarding due—on—sale clauses significantly affect the value of

mortgage portfolios, possibly enough in some circumstances to wipe out the

net worth of savings and loan institutions. We also find that the average

age to prepayment is highly dependent on interest rates.

1. The method which resulted in the B = —4.37 estimate looked only at the
    mortgages which were at risk in the 1975—78 window. An alternative
    consistent estimator under the maintained hypothesis of the Proportional
    Hazards Model would include the experience of these mortgages in the
    pre—1975 period as well, notwithstanding the fact that the sample is
    selected so as to include only those which survive to 1975. Reestimating
    with this alternative, we find B = —2.52 with a standard error of .46.
    The discussion will stick with the original estimate, but this alternative
    procedure confirms the significant effect of the Wellenkamp decision on
    mortgage prepayment.
