                                             ABSTRACT

We use data from several national employer surveys conducted between the late 1980s and the mid-

1990s to investigate the effect of state-level underwriting reforms on HMO penetration in the small-

group health insurance market. We identify reform effects by exploiting cross-state variation in the

timing and content of reform legislation and by using mid-sized and large employers, which were

not affected by the legislation, as within-state control groups. While it is difficult to disentangle the

effect of state reforms from other factors affecting HMO penetration in the small group markets, the

results suggest a positive relationship between insurance market regulations and HMO penetration.

   Introduction

       In the early to mid-1990s, nearly every state enacted legislation aimed at reforming

the small group health insurance market. Motivated by concern about the problem of the

medically uninsured, these laws targeted insurer marketing and underwriting practices that

were seen to discriminate against “high risk” employer-sponsored groups. Several key

components of these state-level reforms were incorporated in the federal legislation known

as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which was enacted in

1996 and went into effect the following year. More recently, several states have

considered extending similar regulations to the individual health insurance market.

       Assessing the economic effects of small group health insurance reforms of the

1990s is crucial both for understanding how health insurance markets work in general and

for guiding future policies. A number of recent papers examine the effect of these state-

level reforms on health insurance coverage (Buchmueller and Jensen 1997; Sloan and

Conover 1998; Jensen and Morrisey 1999; Hing and Jensen 1999; Zuckerman and Rajan

1999; Marquis and Long 2001/2002; Buchmueller and DiNardo 2002; Monheit and

Schone 2004; Simon, forthcoming). These studies vary in the type of data used (individual

vs. employer level), the time periods analyzed, the way state reforms are categorized, and

econometric methodology. Despite these differences, most of these studies support a

common conclusion that the state-level reforms had little effect on the number of people

insured through the small group market.

       This result, however, does not necessarily mean that the reforms had no impact at

all (though this may be true in states that enacted minimal reforms). While the new laws

were designed to proscribe insurer risk selection strategies, they did not eliminate the

underlying incentives driving those strategies or the incentive for lower risk groups to seek


                                              1
out coverage at premiums reflecting their expected claims. As a result, the reforms may

have affected the types of coverage sold and purchased in the small group market and the

nature of competition between different types of insurers. In this paper we focus on one

possible change: an increase in the percentage of small groups obtaining insurance

coverage through a health maintenance organization (HMO).

       Since HMO coverage is likely to be relatively more attractive to lower risk

consumers, it represents a possible “self-selection” mechanism that may facilitate a

separating equilibrium in a regulated market. As we discuss below, the reforms may also

have “leveled the playing field” so as to increase the willingness of HMOs to participate in

the small group market. So, there are strong theoretical reasons to expect an effect of these

regulations on HMO penetration.

       Our analysis uses data from several surveys of employers conducted between 1988

and 1995 to investigate the effect of small group reforms on the probability that small

firms offered HMO coverage to their employees. Consistent with previous qualitative

studies and quantitative work on a limited number of states, our results suggest that the

new regulations increased HMO penetration in the small group market.

       In the next section we summarize the main features of the small group reforms

enacted by states. Then we discuss the relevant economic theory and review previous

studies that touch on this question. In the fifth section we describe our data and our

empirical approach and in the sixth section we present our econometric results. The

concluding section summarizes the analysis, discusses developments in the market in the

years since our analysis period, and identifies possible directions for future research.




                                              2
    The Small Group Reform Movement

        Most state-level small group reforms applied to groups of 50 or fewer employees

and had three main components. Table 1 summarizes how these components varied across

states as of 1995, the final year of our analysis. In general, states that enacted regulations

that were strong in one dimension tended to enact strong rules in others, and vice versa.

The table is arranged to provide a sense of these correlations which are an important factor

determining how we categorize states in our empirical analysis.

        The first reform component is rules limiting the ability of insurers to deny coverage

to certain groups. The most basic regulations mandate the “guaranteed renewal” of

insurance, which means that once a carrier agrees to sell insurance to a group it cannot

later drop the group for reasons other than non-payment of premiums, fraud or other

malfeasance. As shown in Table 1, as of 1995, 7 states had enacted legislation requiring

only guaranteed renewal. For several reasons, the impact of these laws is likely to have

been minimal. First, they do nothing for groups that were unable to purchase insurance in

the first place. Second, even in the absence of a mandate it is not unusual for insurers to

sell insurance on a guaranteed renewal basis. 1 Third, unless the law also limits the amount

by which premiums can increase from one year to the next, it is possible for insurers to use

large premium increases to force undesirable groups to voluntarily drop coverage. As a

result, it is not clear these laws should have significantly altered the behavior of many

insurers or represented new protections for employer-sponsored groups.

        “Guaranteed issue” laws go further by prohibiting insurers from denying coverage

to any group that is willing to pay the premium. By 1995, 37 states had enacted some type


        1
          Underwriting practices aimed at cream-skimming are much more prevalent in the individual health
insurance market. Yet, according to Pauly and Percy (2000) prior to recent regulations 80 percent or more of
individual health insurance policies contained guaranteed renewal provisions.

                                                     3
of guaranteed issue regulation. Among this group, a distinction can be drawn between 23

states requiring the guaranteed issue of only a limited number of plans (typically two) and

14 states where the guaranteed issue rule applies to all plans sold in the small group

market. 2

        A second reform component is rating rules which specify which subscriber

characteristics can and cannot be used to set premiums. The most restrictive is pure

community rating, which requires carriers to charge the same premium to all groups

purchasing a particular product, regardless of age, gender, health status or other variables

that predict medical claims. Only one state—New York—adopted pure community

rating. 3 Next most restrictive are rules that allow premiums to vary with age, and in some

cases other factors, but not subscriber health status. Laws that allow health status to be

used in setting premiums commonly specify “rate bands” that limit the extent to which

actual premiums can deviate from the “standard rate” defined for a given product. Since

using age as a factor alone can generate up to a 5:1 spread in premiums, the combinations

of age rating and rate bands can result in considerable premium differences across groups. 4

        The third main reform component limits insurers’ ability to exclude coverage for

pre-existing medical conditions. The most common version allows conditions present 6

months prior to when an individual enrolls in a plan to be excluded for a maximum of 12

months after enrollment. Most state laws also included “portability” provisions that

exempt insured individuals switching among health plans from these exclusions.


        2
            The HIPAA legislation, which went into effect in 1997, requires the guaranteed issue of all plans
sold in the small group market.
          3
            New York required pure community rating in both the small group and individual markets. New
Jersey also required community rating in the individual market but allowed insurers to vary small group rates
on the basis of employee age, gender, and business location.
          4
            For example, according to Ohio’s law small group premiums must fall within a band of plus or
minus 35 percent of a standard rate. This allows a difference of over 100 percent (1.35/0.65) between the
highest and lowest risk groups (Hall 2001/2002).

                                                      4
    Theoretical and Institutional Background

        There are several reasons why these new regulations might have increased both the

demand for and supply of HMO coverage in the small group market. Rothschild and

Stiglitz’s (1976) classic article on the economics of information in insurance markets is a

useful starting point for considering these potential effects. In that model, when insurers

have full information about consumer risk characteristics, all risk-averse consumers are

offered and purchase full insurance at actuarially fair prices. This outcome is not possible

when consumers have private information about their risk status. Instead, insurers may

offer different policies that induce consumers to reveal their true risk type by the policies

they select. In the resulting “separating” equilibrium, the market will be segmented with

low risk consumers purchasing a lesser quantity of insurance than high-risk consumers.

        Within this framework, imposing restrictions on insurer underwriting practices is

analogous to moving from a situation of full information to one in which insurers have an

information deficit. That is, even if they can observe consumer characteristics like the

presence of health conditions or, in extreme cases age, they cannot use this information to

determine whether or not to offer coverage or to set premiums. To the extent that these

new constraints bind, the forced pooling of lower and higher risks will lead to higher

premiums for low risks than would occur in an unregulated market. As in the Rothschild-

Stiglitz model, this gives them an incentive to seek out less expensive insurance policies

that are relatively less attractive to high risks.

        In a market with only indemnity insurance, self-selection may be based on plan

cost-sharing. Insurance carriers may offer plans with different deductibles and coinsurance




                                                 5
rates, hoping to attract low risk consumers to less comprehensive but less costly plans. 5 In

contemporary US health care markets, HMOs represent a potentially important self-

selection mechanism (Feldman and Dowd 1994, 2000; Pauly and Nicholson 1999). HMO

coverage can be seen as a lower quantity of insurance because of the restrictions placed on

which providers patients can see and under what circumstances they can see them—i.e.,

limited provider panels, the use of gatekeepers and limits on referrals to specialists. 6

Because these restrictions are likely to be viewed less negatively by low risk consumers

than by high risks, market reforms that significantly alter insurer underwriting practices are

likely to make HMO coverage more attractive to low risks, thereby increasing the market

share of HMOs. 7

         This demand-side effect may be magnified by pre-existing differences in

underwriting and marketing practices among insurers. Historically, HMOs have been less

likely than commercial indemnity insurers to deny coverage on the basis of risk or to vary

premiums according to subscriber risk status (Gabel 1997; Hall 2000a). Since the new

regulations proscribed the risk-selection techniques used by indemnity insurers, but did not

affect the way HMOs may be able to obtain favorable selection (e.g., through benefit




         5
            In theory, another way that insurers may induce risk-based sorting is by offering products that are
differentiated by benefit design. For example, plans that did not cover maternity care could be offered to
appeal to a certain class of low-risk consumers. State benefit mandates generally preclude the use of this
type of strategy in the US. However, according to Vaithianathan (2004), this is how Australian insurers have
responded to community rating regulations in that country.
          6
            Baker (2000) presents empirical evidence that HMO enrollees feel they are subject to more
constraints and restrictions than people enrolled in non-HMO plans.
          7
            It is well known that as managed care has evolved the distinctions among different types of
plans—e.g., HMOs, point-of-service (POS) plans and preferred provider organizations (PPOs)—have
blurred. Therefore, for some research questions it is managed care penetration, rather HMO penetration that
is the relevant conceptual variable. For this separating equilibrium argument, there is empirical evidence
suggesting that the most relevant distinction is between HMOs and non-HMOs, rather than between managed
and non-managed care. Several studies show that when HMOs and PPOs are offered side by side there tends
to be adverse selection against the PPOs, but among HMOs there is no evidence of biased selection by type
of HMO (Buchmueller 1997, 1998; Cutler and Reber 1998; Yegian et al. 2000).

                                                      6
design and provider selection), they may have made the small group market more attractive

for HMOs and less attractive to their indemnity competitors.



   Previous Empirical Literature

         Existing empirical evidence on the question of whether state level reforms

increased HMO penetration in the small group market is limited to a few studies, most of

which focus on a small number of states. While this literature suggests a positive

relationship between the imposition of new regulations and an increase in HMO

penetration in the small group market, most of the studies lack a clear counterfactual,

making it difficult to disentangle the impact of the reforms from a more general trend

toward managed care.

         Several qualitative studies provide valuable detail on how reforms were

implemented and how key market participants viewed their effects. Kirk (2000) describes

how individual market reforms in Washington, Kentucky and Massachusetts led

commercial indemnity insurers to exit, and HMOs to enter those markets. Hall (1998,

2000a) documents large increases in HMO penetration in New York’s small group and

individual markets after guaranteed issue and community rating were imposed in 1993. In

this work and case studies of other states (Hall 2000a, 2000/2001), he quotes a number of

informed observers who attribute rising HMO penetration in the small group market to

insurance reforms, though he notes that other factors may also have contributed to this

trend.

         Buchmueller and DiNardo (2002) also focused on New York, comparing outcomes

there to outcomes in Pennsylvania and Connecticut. They found that HMO penetration

grew more rapidly in New York’s small group market as compared to either of the other


                                              7
states or New York’s large group market. Changes in the demographic composition of the

HMO and indemnity segments of the New York market were consistent with the

hypothesis that many younger, healthier consumers responded to reform-induced premium

increases by switching from indemnity plans to less costly HMO coverage.

       Buchmueller and Jensen (1997) used two employer surveys from 1993 and 1995 to

investigate changes in California’s small group market after reforms were enacted there in

1993. The results indicate a 20-point increase in the percentage of small firms choosing

HMO coverage. However, HMO penetration increased as much for firms with 50-99

employees (who were not covered by the law) as for firms with 3 to 49 employees (who

were covered). If HMOs consider groups just above and below 50 members as a single

market, this could reflect a spillover effect of the law. Alternatively, the trend in both

segments may be due to other contemporaneous factors.

       Studies by Morrisey and Jensen (1997) and Marquis and Long (2001/2002) have

important similarities to our analysis. Morrisey and Jensen use a subset of the same data

we use to examine the decision by small employers to offer managed care plans. They find

a positive association between the presence of small group reforms and the probability of

offering a managed care plan. The effect is not statistically significant in a regression

using data from 1993 but is significant at the .10 level in a data using 1995 data. Marquis

and Long (2001/2002) use data from two surveys conducted in 1994 and 1997 to compare

employers in 9 states that enacted moderate to strong reforms with 12 other states that

either had no reforms or minimal reforms. The percentage of small firms offering HMO

coverage increased by 20.4 percentage points in the reform states compared to an increase

of 16 percentage points for small firms in the comparison states. However, this difference

likely understates the impact of the reforms as the first of the two surveys was conducted


                                               8
after the legislation went into effect in 7 of the 9 reform states. In fact, in those 7 states

where there was little or no change in regulations between 1994 and 1997, the growth in

HMO penetration was only slightly higher than in the control states (19 percentage points).

In contrast, HMO penetration grew 29 percentage points in the two states where the first

survey predates the reforms.

         An important difference between our study and the paper by Morrisey and Jensen is

that our model includes state fixed effects that control for underlying differences between

states that did and didn’t enact reforms. Another is that instead of a single dummy variable

for any small group reform, we distinguish between stronger and weaker reform

legislation. The main difference between our study and Marquis and Long is that our data

spans an earlier period, during which there was greater legislative activity. We now turn to

our data and our econometric approach.



    Data and Econometric Specification

         The main source of data for our analysis is six surveys of employers conducted

every year from 1988 to 1991 and in 1993 and 1995. The 1988-91 surveys were sponsored

by the Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) and the 1993 and 1995 surveys

were done by KPMG/Peat Marwick, with sponsorship from the Robert Wood Johnson and

Kaiser Family Foundations. All the surveys were administered by telephone to a sample of

US employers drawn from Dun and Bradstreet’s nationwide list of firms. Our complete

sample consists of 11,760 firms that have at least three employees and that offer some

health benefits. 8



         8
          Our decision to model the demand for HMO coverage conditional on offering insurance is
influenced by the fact that most studies find little or no effect of small group reforms on coverage.

                                                      9
        While the data set formed from these surveys is not without its weaknesses (the

most important being its small size), it has three elements that are essential for our study:

the type of coverage purchased (HMO vs. non-HMO), the state in which the firm is

located, and the size of the firm. The first variable is the dependent variable in our analysis

and the other two are necessary for identifying which firms were impacted by the state-

level reforms. 9 Information on the content and timing of the various state reforms is from

several sources, the most important being the detailed compendium of state laws prepared

by Simon (2000). The employer survey data sets also provide information on the ZIP code

in which each firm is located. With this information we can identify each firm’s county

and then merge the employer-level data with county-level determinants of HMO

penetration from the Bureau of Health Profession’s Area Resource File (ARF) and the

Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns (CBP) data file.

        The basic model we estimate is

(1)     H*= Xβ + γ1SMALL + γ2REFORM + γ3SMALLxREFORM

                          + δ1 STATE + δ2YEAR + ε,

        H = 1[ H*>0]



        where H* is a firm’s latent propensity to offer HMO coverage and H is its observed

dichotomous analog. 10 The vector X consists of firm and area characteristics, SMALL is an

indicator variable equaling one for firms with 50 or fewer employees (which is the most

        9
            Most studies on the effects of the state-level reforms on insurance coverage use data from the
Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is not a possibility for our analysis as there is no information on
the type of insurance an individual holds. Similarly, other household surveys, such as the Survey of Income
and Program Participation, the National Health Interview Survey, the National Medical Expenditure Survey
and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey lack one or more of the essential data elements.
          10
             In principle, an alternative dependent variable would be the percentage of employees choosing
HMO coverage. Unfortunately, we do not have a good, consistent measure of this outcome across the
different surveys. For small firms, the two variables should be highly correlated, since during this period
most small firms offered only one plan.

                                                     10
common definition of the small group market used in reform legislation), and REFORM

equals one if small group reform legislation was in effect in the particular state and year.

We include a full set of state and year dummies to account for the fact that there is

considerable variation across states in the prevalence of managed care and that managed

care penetration was increasing over this period.

         We interact the reform variable with the small firm dummy to account for the

targeted nature of the reforms. The change in a small firm’s propensity to offer an HMO

after the enactment of small group reforms is given by γ2 + γ3 and the corresponding

change for larger firms is given by γ2 alone. However, since the reforms should have had

no direct effect on larger firms, γ2 is best interpreted as representing the effect of other

factors that were incidentally correlated with the timing of the reform legislation, making

γ3 a more precise estimate of the legislation’s impact. 11 We estimate robust standard errors

to account for potential correlation of errors within state/year/firm size cells.

         Summary statistics for the variables in our model are presented in Table 2.

Because of the way we use larger firms as in-state controls, we report separate statistics for

firms with 50 or fewer employees and those with more than 50. The most important firm

characteristic available from the employer surveys is the number of employees. Not only

is this variable essential for identifying firms that are subject to small group regulations,

but firm size has an independent effect on HMO offers. In their early history, HMOs

         11
             According to the theoretical arguments made above, the shift to HMOs should have been greatest
for lower risk firms who benefited the most from risk-rating and therefore saw their premiums increase when
tighter rating rules were enforced. Therefore, a stronger test of our hypothesis concerning the effect of small
group reforms would be to add an additional interaction with some measure of risk. Unfortunately, this is not
possible in these data. The information on employee demographics is limited and not consistent across years.
Moreover, a convincing test of this type requires measures of risk factors that insurers could use in
underwriting before the reforms, but not after. Age works as such a variable in the case of pure community
rating, but not in most reform states where even after reforms age-rating was allowed. See Buchmueller
(2004) for an extended discussion of this issue.



                                                      11
marketed mainly to large employers. Even as HMOs have extended into other markets, a

strong positive relationship between firm size and HMO coverage remains (Dranove et al.

1998). To account for possible spillover effects of firm size, we also include the

percentage of establishments in the county with 100 or more employees. A similar

measure has been used in previous studies as an instrument for market-level HMO

penetration (see, e.g., Baker 1997).

       Since it is difficult to establish provider networks in sparsely populated areas, we

control for the percentage of the county’s population living in urban areas. The

expectation is that this variable will be positively related to HMO offers. Other county

level variables are the unemployment rate, median household income, the percentage of the

county’s population that is non-white, and the percent of adults with a college degree. We

include these variables to account for within-state differences in consumer preferences,

though there are not strong hypotheses concerning their effects.

       A key issue in estimating this model is determining how to categorize the reforms

enacted by different states. There was enough heterogeneity in the approaches taken by

different states that a simple dichotomy between states with and without any reforms is not

meaningful. At the same time, because the different small group reform components were

typically enacted as a package (either all at once, or over a short period of time), it is

neither meaningful nor practical to estimate the independent effect of each individual

component. Therefore, like several previous researchers (Zuckerman and Rajan 1999;

Marquis and Long 2001/2002; Monheit and Schone 2004; Simon forthcoming) we group

states into a small number of categories based on the strength of their reforms.

       Rules pertaining to guaranteed issue and renewal are important reform components

for categorizing states. As noted, the weakest version of these laws requires only the


                                               12
guaranteed renewal of existing contracts. For reasons discussed above, these laws are

unlikely to place significant constraints on the behavior of insurers. In addition, the

reforms in states requiring guaranteed renewal but not guaranteed issue tended to be

weaker in other dimensions, such as the limits placed on the dispersion of premiums and

the treatment of pre-existing conditions. States with guaranteed renewal only were also

more likely to use a narrower range of firm sizes to define the small group market. For

these reasons, we group these states with the five states that enacted no reforms. 12

        Our preferred definition of reform states is limited to those that enacted some type

of guaranteed issue law. As shown in Table 1, broader guaranteed issue laws are also

positively correlated with stricter rating rules. While there are a number of different ways

that rating regulations can be specified, the most important factor determining the

“tightness” of the rules is whether or not insurers can use subscriber health status as a

factor in setting premiums (Curtis et al. 1999). During the period of our analysis, twelve of

the fourteen states requiring the guaranteed issue of all plans prohibited the use of health

status in setting premiums; all but one states with partial guaranteed issue rules allowed

insurers to adjust premiums to account for health. There was relatively little variation

among states with any type of guaranteed issue with respect to rules on pre-existing

conditions and portability. Thus, even if one believed that such rules affect the structure of

the small group market, it is not possible empirically to identify their effect.

        We estimate models that combine all guaranteed issue states into a single reform

category, as well as models that distinguish between states mandating the guaranteed issue

of all vs. some plans. To test the sensitivity of our results, we also estimate models that


        12
           This is consistent with the approach taken by Marquis and Long (20001/2002). The distinction
between states requiring only guaranteed renewal and those with guaranteed issue mandates is the key factor
determining the two reform categories—partial and full—used by Simon (forthcoming).

                                                    13
define reform states as those placing “tight” restrictions on the distribution of premiums.

Following previous studies, we define tight rating rules as those that prohibit or

significantly limit the use of health status in setting premiums. We identify such states

using information provided by Simon (2000) and researchers at the Institute for Health

Policy Solutions.

       Several potential problems with this modeling strategy should be noted. First,

however we categorize the reforms we are left with somewhat heterogeneous groupings.

For example, earlier work (Buchmueller and DiNardo 2002) compared three states that

represent different points on the reform continuum: New York, which enacted the strongest

reforms in the country, Connecticut, which like New York required the guaranteed issue of

all plans, but allowed significantly more variation in premiums, and Pennsylvania, which

enacted no reforms. In our analysis New York and Connecticut are grouped together.

Even among states with similar laws, there is heterogeneity in factors affecting the

structure of the insurance market and the potential for HMO growth. For example, some

of the most stringent reforms were enacted by Vermont and Maine, states that are sparsely

populated and therefore not natural environments for HMOs to operate. As a result,

regulations that would lead to an increase in HMO penetration in other markets might not

have the same effect there. This within-group heterogeneity should cause our estimates to

underestimate the effect of small group reforms on HMO penetration.

       Other problems relate the use of firm size to define treatment and comparison

groups of firms. First, the definition of small firms used in the legislation may not

correspond precisely to the way insurers define market boundaries. A second source of

measurement error is the fact that not all employees within a firm are offered or accept

insurance coverage. Consequently, some firms with more than 50 employees will be


                                             14
groups of fewer than 50 for the purpose of purchasing insurance. The resulting ambiguity

in the assignment of firms to the treatment and control groups will also cause the

interaction term to understate the effect of the reforms. There is less ambiguity concerning

the assignment of firms with, say, 100 or more employees. However, larger firms may not

represent a suitable comparison group for those affected by small group legislation. If

other factors caused HMO penetration to grow faster (slower) in the small group market

than among larger firms, estimated reform effects based on the interaction term will be

overstated (understated). We return to these issues below.



Results

        Logit results are presented in Table 3. The results in column (1) are for a model

with single reform category consisting of all states with any type of guaranteed issue. In

column (2) we distinguish between the two types of guaranteed issue states, and in column

(3) we define reform states according to whether or not they allow premiums to vary

according to subscriber health status. All models include a full set of state and year fixed

effects, which are not reported for reasons of space.

        Before turning to our main results, we will briefly summarize the results for the

control variables. In the specifications reported in the table, firm size enters quadratically

along with a dummy variable for firms with fewer than 50 employees. As expected, we

find a strong positive relationship between firm size and HMO offers. 13 The coefficient on

the percentage of establishments in the county with more than 100 employees is also

positive and statistically significant. Another expected result is that HMO coverage is


        13
            We also estimate models using a set of dummy variables for different firm size categories, which
also imply a strong positive effect of firm size. The estimated effect of the reform laws is robust to
alternative approaches to parameterizing the firm size effect.

                                                     15
more prevalent in more urban areas. As noted, we did not have prior expectations

concerning four county-level controls: median household income, the unemployment rate,

the percent of the population that is non-white and the percent with at least a college

degree. The coefficients on the first two of these variables are negative and the

coefficients on the last two are positive. This pattern is similar to results reported by

Dranove et al (1998). The result for the college degree variable is similar to Baker’s

(1997) finding that HMO penetration is higher in areas with a greater proportion of white-

collar workers.

       Turning to our main results, all three models reported in Table 3 indicate that state-

level health insurance reforms contributed to an increase in HMO penetration in the small

group market. In column (1) the coefficient on the interaction between the reform variable

and the indicator for small firms is positive and significant at the .01 level (coefficient =

0.641, t-statistic =3.12). The coefficient on the reform dummy alone, which represents the

“effect” of small group reform legislation on larger firms that were not subject to the

regulations, is essentially zero (coefficient = - 0.019, absolute t-statistic = 0.19). This

result provides confidence that our estimate of effect of small group reforms is not driven

by unobserved factors relating to which states enacted stronger reforms or when the

reforms went into effect.

       The results in column (2) indicate a slightly stronger effect of laws that require all

plans to be offered on a guaranteed issue basis compared to laws requiring the guaranteed

issue of some plans. However, the coefficients for the two categories are not significantly

different from each other. When we define reform states according to rules on how

premiums can be set (column 3), the results are quite similar to those using a definition




                                               16
based on guaranteed issue. This similarity is not surprising given the correlation of reform

components discussed above.

         With a logit model, the coefficient estimates provide little insight on the magnitude

of effects, particularly in cases where the effects of interest are driven by interaction terms

(Ai and Norton 2003). Therefore, in Table 4 we present simulation results based on the

regression specifications reported in Table 3. For each observation in the sample, we

predict the probability of offering coverage in the absence and presence of reforms,

holding constant all firm and market characteristics and setting the year equal to 1995. 14

We then calculate the effect of the reforms based on the sample means for these

predictions. We derive bootstrap standard errors for these predictions by randomly

drawing 1000 replications from the estimated distribution of parameters (Efron and

Tibshirani 1993).

         The first panel reports results from the specification using a single reform variable

(column 1 of Table 3). The second and third panels correspond to the other two

specifications reported in Table 3. The simulations based on the model with the single

reform category indicate that 17.3 percent of small employers would have offered an HMO

to their employees in the absence of small group reform regulations. When strong small

group reforms are in effect, the rate of HMO offers in the small group market rises to 29

percent, an increase of just under 12 percentage points. This is a 68 percent effect relative

to the baseline rate. The results in the second panel show a slightly smaller effect for laws

mandating the guaranteed issue of some plans (9.6 percentage points) and a slightly larger

effect for laws requiring the guaranteed issue of all plans (13.2 percentage points). Using

rating rules to define states with strong reforms yields an effect of 12 percentage points.

         14
          We set the year equal to 1995 for ease of interpretation. The choice of year has virtually no effect
on the magnitude of the reform effect.

                                                     17
       As suggested by the coefficient estimates, the percentage of larger firms that offer

HMO coverage to their employees is essentially uncorrelated with the presence of

underwriting regulations in the small group market. It declines slightly in the first two

panels and increases slightly in the third, though in all three cases the change is not

significantly different from zero. Subtracting the change for large firms from the change

for smaller firms produces a “difference-in-difference-in-differences” type estimator.

Since the effect for large firms is so small, doing so does not have a material impact on our

estimate of the effect of the reforms.

       To test the sensitivity of our results, we estimated the model on several different

samples and using different firm size categories. Selected results are reported in Table 5.

The figures in each row represent the estimated effect of small group reforms on the HMO

offer rate using the same simulation methodology as in Table 4. Because the results are so

similar for the different reform variables, we report only the results for the specification

with the single guaranteed issue variable. For ease of comparison, we repeat the results

from the full sample in the first row of the table.

       As noted, there are several concerns about the use of firm size to identify reform

effects. One is that using 50 employees as the cut-off point between small firms that

should have been most affected by the reforms and larger firms that should not have been

is essentially arbitrary. The figures in the second and third rows of Table 5 show that the

results are fairly insensitive to the firm size cut-off point. When we define small firms as

those with fewer than 40 employees, guaranteed issue is estimated to increase the

percentage of small firms offering an HMO by 10.5 percentage points. When we use a cut-

off of 60 employees, we obtain an estimated effect of 10.7 percentage points. In both cases




                                               18
the change for small firms is statistically significant, while the change for larger firms is

small and insignificant.

        A second concern related to firm size is that very large firms may not be an

appropriate comparison group for firms that were the target of the small group reforms.

Therefore we also estimate the model on a subsample that excludes firms with more than

250 employees. Using this restricted sample, small group reforms are estimated to

increase the HMO offer rate among firms with 50 or fewer employees to 28.2 percent from

21.6 percent. While this is a smaller effect than implied by our full sample results, the

difference is still statistically significant at the .01 level. The model indicates a slight (and

statistically insignificant) decline in HMO penetration for firms with 51 to 250 employees,

to just less than 33 percent from almost 39 percent. As a result, subtracting the

reform/non-reform difference for large firms yields an estimated reform effect of 12.6

percentage points, which is comparable to the effect for the full sample.

        The final specification check is motivated by the fact that the potential for HMO

penetration varies significantly between urban and rural areas. To account for this, we also

estimated the models on a subsample of firms in counties where at least half the population

is classified as living in an urban area. These results are reported in the last row of Table

5. Dropping observations from largely rural counties increases both the baseline and post-

reform HMO penetration rates for both firm size categories, leaving the estimated effect of

the reforms unchanged.



Summary and Conclusions

        In the early to mid-1990s, nearly every state enacted some type of small group

health insurance market reforms, which restricted insurer business practices that were seen


                                               19
to discriminate against high-risk groups. Evidence from a number of studies suggests that

these laws neither led to a significant increase in health insurance coverage as reform

advocates had hoped, nor caused coverage to fall as a result of market-wide adverse

selection death spirals as a number of reform opponents have claimed. This is not to say,

however, that the state-level reforms had no impact at all. The results of this paper

corroborate the findings of earlier research focusing on a limited number of states

indicating that the introduction of underwriting and marketing regulations appear to have

affected the structure of the small group insurance market, contributing to an increase in

HMO penetration.

         For several reasons, we view our results as suggestive of the relationship between

regulations and insurance market outcomes, rather than as a definitive estimate of a

particular policy. First, our results represent an average effect for a set of states that vary

considerably both with respect to the content of their laws and the underlying features of

their health insurance markets. While these details cannot easily be incorporated in an

econometric analysis, they are important for gaining a full understanding of the effects of

health insurance market regulations. To give one example, Vermont’s reform legislation

allowed HMOs less rating flexibility than commercial indemnity carriers (Hall 2000b).

This rule, combined with the low population density in the state helps to explain why

HMO penetration has not increased as much in Vermont as it has in other states that

enacted less stringent reforms. This type of cross-state variation points to the value of

detailed state-specific analyses. We view this study as a complement, rather than a

substitute for such research.

       Second, there is a limit to how precisely “treatment” and “control” can be defined

according to firm size. Even where reforms are in place, there may not be major


                                               20
differences in the treatment of firms with just fewer or just more than 50 employees. Much

larger firms are easier to classify, but may not represent an appropriate comparison group

for very small firms. Our results are not very sensitive to the cut-off point chosen, but are

slightly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of very large firms.

       It is also important to note that the shift toward increased HMO enrollment is but

one of several ways that insurers and purchasers may have responded to new regulations in

the small group market. Indemnity carriers that remained in reformed markets may have

increased deductibles and coinsurance rates as a means of attracting and retaining low risk

consumers. In addition, there is some evidence that reforms in certain states increased the

prevalence of purchasing arrangements that are exempt from state insurance regulations,

such as plans sponsored by professional and trade associations (Hall 2000b). It is not

possible with our data to investigate the prevalence of these other outcomes, though such

an inquiry is a promising direction for future research.

       This final caveat is important in light of more recent market developments. It has

been a decade since the last state enacted small group reform and the market has seen

considerable changes. HMO enrollment peaked in the late 1990s and then declined during

a periods of “managed care backlash.” Pauly and Nicholson (1999) provide an explanation

for these developments that is based on the Rothschild-Stiglitz model and is consistent

with our interpretation of our results. They note that while HMOs had historically

attracted a disproportionately low-risk mix of enrollees, by the 1990s, the difference in

premiums between HMOs and less restrictive plans became so large that many higher risk

consumers began switching to HMOs. These new HMO members chafed at the constraints

imposed by their new plans and their complaints led plans to manage care less tightly.

This, combined with the fact that HMOs were no longer enrolling just a healthy minority


                                              21
of consumers, caused the premium differential between HMOs and PPOs to diminish,

leading to some reverse migration from HMOs to PPOs. In the context of the Rothschild-

Stiglitz model, this story suggests that the shift to managed care that we observe in

response to small group reforms may have been a temporary phenomenon, rather than a

stable separating equilibrium.

        More recently, employers have looked for other ways to respond to high and rising

health insurance premiums. There has been growth in enrollment in high deductible plans

with a PPO design including, but not limited to, plans offered in conjunction with a tax-

preferred health savings account. Anecdotal accounts suggest that these new plans are

beginning to alter the distribution of risks in certain markets, with high deductible PPOs

becoming the preferred plan of younger, healthier consumers, leaving consumers with

greater health needs in HMOs (see, for example, Girion 2005). In other words, these

recent developments can be viewed as attempts by insurers and low-risk consumers to find

a new separating equilibrium. Whether the end result is a stable equilibrium remains to be

seen.

Notes: The number of observations is 11760. Small and large firms are defined as those with fewer
and greater than 50 employees, respectively. Offer rates were simulated by setting the reform
variables equal to zero and one for each observation and predicting the probability of offering an
HMO. The year variable was set to 1995. The probabilities were then averaged over the full
sample within each size category. Bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: Reform effects are based on simulations described in the note to Table 4. In all models, the
reform variable is an indicator for the presence of a guaranteed issue requirement. Except were
noted otherwise, small and large firms are defined as those with fewer and more than 50
employees, respectively. Bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses.
