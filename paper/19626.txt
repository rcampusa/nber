                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the effect of local immigration enforcement regimes on the migration decisions
of the foreign born. Specifically, the analysis uses individual level American Community Survey data
to examine the effect of recent 287(g) agreements which allow state and local law enforcement agencies
to enforce Federal immigration law. The results suggest that one type of 287(g) agreement – the controversial
local “task force” model emphasizing street enforcement – nearly doubles the propensity for the foreign-born
to relocate within the United States. The largest effects are observed among non-citizens with college
education, suggesting that aggressive enforcement policies may be missing their intended targets. No
similar effect is found for the native born. After the extreme case of Maricopa County is excluded,
there is no evidence that local enforcement causes the foreign-born to exit the United States or deters
their entry from abroad. Rather, 287(g) task force agreements encourage the foreign born to move
to a new Census division or region within the United States.

The recent recession stemmed the tide of immigration into the United States, but the
estimated number of foreign born is around 38 million, representing more than 12% of the
population.      Approximately 11 million immigrants are undocumented (Hoefer, Rytina, and
Baker, 2012). Policy-makers have wrestled with the issue of undocumented immigration, and
policy responses have varied substantially across time and across local areas within the United
States. In the past decade, there has been a marked devolution of immigration enforcement to
local governments, further exacerbating local differences in policy regimes. Nevertheless, little
is known about how immigrants respond to local enforcement policies.

A key impetus for aggressive immigration enforcement is to reduce the number of
undocumented immigrants in a local area; conversely, localities opting for less aggressive
enforcement often do so in part to attract and retain the foreign born. 1 Much of the existing
work on immigrant location choice focuses on immigrant ethnic networks (for example, Bauer,
Epstein, and Gang, 2005) and local economic conditions (for example, Borjas, 2001, and Cadena
and Kovak, 2013). While these factors are important determinants of immigrant location, they
do not speak to the impact of enforcement policy on location decisions of the foreign born.
Empirical evidence on the degree to which immigrant location decisions respond to the policy
climate is limited.

Understanding immigrant location choice is of broader interest as well. Immigrants play an
important role in local labor markets, both because they constitute a substantial portion of the
workforce (15.8 percent in 2010) 2 and because they are a key driver of workforce growth.
Furthermore, location decisions of immigrants respond more to local labor market conditions
than those of native born workers and help to equilibrate differences across labor markets
within the United States (Borjas, 2001).

The analysis presented here focuses on the understudied role of local immigration enforcement
policy in determining the location choice of immigrants. In particular, the analysis explores the
recent devolution of enforcement to local law enforcement that has occurred through section
287(g) of the 1996 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since 2002, almost eighty state and local
law enforcement agencies have signed 287(g) agreements with the Federal government, which
allow these agencies to enforce Federal immigration law. Because enforcement decisions are
made at a local level, they may influence immigrant decisions of where to settle in the United
States.

As the nation debates immigration policy, understanding the impacts of enforcement on
immigrants’ behavior is critically important. The effect of immigration-related policies on
residential choice is of particular interest to local policy-makers. If regions seek to boost labor
force growth or change the local skill mix by changing the foreign-born population, it is
important to understand what policies facilitate or discourage immigrant inflows. Conversely,
as states and local law enforcement agencies consider adopting immigration-related policies, it
is important to know what implications these policies have for the composition of the local
labor force.    Enforcement activity in other parts of the country may also have direct
implications for projected foreign-born inflows to areas with less aggressive enforcement
activity. These impacts will be of particular interest to employers who rely on foreign-born
labor.

This paper uses data from the American Community Survey to examine migration responses to
local enforcement agreements.       First, an aggregate analysis offers a bird’s eye view of
migration. One can estimate cross-national inflows to and outflows from an area and outflows
from the United States by comparing numbers of immigrants in a local area in a given year, the
number of immigrants remaining in the United States in the following year who indicate that
they lived in the local area in the previous year, and the number of immigrants in the local area
who said they lived abroad in the previous year. The results suggest that - once the extreme
case of Maricopa County is excluded - cross-border migration flows are not affected by local
enforcement.


                                                3
Data analyzed at the individual level offer more detail and elucidate four patterns that would
not otherwise be evident. First, immigrant migration decisions respond only to the (recently
ended) task force model of 287(g) enforcement. Second, in most circumstances, immigrants
responding to local enforcement relocate within the United States rather than leaving the
country. The impact of full task force coverage on internal migration is similar to that of a
fifteen percent decline in predicted employment demand. Third, local enforcement affects the
decision to leave an area but does not deter foreign-born inflows, either from abroad or other
parts of the United States. Fourth, college educated non-citizens are more responsive to task
force enforcement, suggesting that aggressive enforcement policies may be missing their
intended targets.


The results have policy implications at both the local and Federal levels.           The Obama
administration ended all task force agreements at the end of 2012 and is developing alternative
models of enforcement. These include the Secure Communities program, which more closely
resembles the jail enforcement 287(g) model, and the Criminal Alien Program, which has a
mission that partially overlaps that of the task force model. These programs are on track to
achieve near universal adoption across the country, but their exact form is still evolving.
Furthermore, local governments will continue to have discretion in their implementation of
these Federal policies. Understanding how enforcement decisions are likely to affect immigrant
location choices is a key input into developing effective policy.


                                      II. Previous Literature



There is a rich literature examining immigrant location choice within the United States.
Analysts are particularly interested in location choice because it is central to understanding how
immigration affects the labor market outcomes of the native-born within the U.S. A number of
papers have exploited the geographic distribution of immigrants over time to identify wage
impacts, for example.      Because immigrants seek destinations with good labor market


                                                 4
conditions, the analyses typically exploit exogenous variation in the geographic distribution.
For example, many previous papers have used variations of the supply-push instrument
pioneered by Card (2001) which uses the interaction of initial country-of-origin shares in a local
area and national trends in immigrant inflows from those countries-of-origin. Borjas (2006) has
argued that immigrant inflows lead to native outflows from a local area, so that the wage
impacts of immigration are diffused across the country. While a full discussion of the debate is
beyond the scope of this paper, understanding internal migration decisions of immigrants is a
key input to the understanding of the national impacts of immigration.


Immigrant location decisions are also of interest in their own right. For example, immigrant
location choices are believed to equilibrate wages across local labor markets within the U.S.
(Borjas 2001, and Cadena and Kovak, 2013). Immigrant location decisions affect a wide range
of other outcomes such as native residential location decisions (Wozniak and Murray, 2012),
local rents (Saiz, 2003, Saiz, 2007), native female labor supply (Cortes and Tesada, 2011), firm
production decisions (Lewis, 2005), and school segregation (Cascio and Lewis, 2012). A number
of previous papers have examined the impacts of immigrant concentration in particular areas
(Bertrand et al., 2003, Funkhouser, 2000, Jaeger, 2007, and Edin et al., 2003). Researchers have
also explored the impact of the safety net on immigrant location choice (Borjas and Hilton,
1996, Borjas, 1999, Dodson, 2001, and Buckley, 1996).


In contrast, the literature on the impacts of immigration enforcement is relatively new. At the
national level, Ortega and Peri (2013) show that immigration restrictions do affect cross-
country migration flows whereas Orrenius and Zavodny (2003) find no evidence that the 1986
amnesty for undocumented immigrants affected long run migration flows.            There are also
several papers exploring the impacts of local enforcement on immigrant labor market
outcomes.    For example, see Davila and Pagan (1997), Bansak (2005), and Orrenius and




                                                5
Zavodny (2009). 3 Watson (2010) documents impacts of enforcement on Medicaid participation
among children of non-citizens.


Several recent papers have examined effects of local enforcement on migration using aggregate
data.    Bohn, Lofstrom, and Raphael (forthcoming) document declines in the foreign-born
population in Arizona following restrictive state legislation. Kostandini, Mykerezi, and Escalante
(2012) focus on the agricultural sector and find that local 287(g) enforcement reduces
immigrant population, changed farm inputs, and reduced farm profits in affected counties.
O’Neil (2013) finds no systematic relationship between 287(g) implementation and Hispanic or
foreign born population growth. The current analysis builds on existing studies by considering
individual level migration decisions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the
relationship between enforcement policy and immigrant location choice.


                                     III. Recent Enforcement Policy

Internal Federal immigration enforcement has declined markedly over the past several years.
This shift reflects both a decline in undocumented immigrants residing in the United States
(there has been an estimated 8% decline in the unauthorized population since 2007) 4 and a
policy shift away from non-criminal apprehensions.


Despite declines in Federal enforcement, there has been a recent increase in enforcement of
immigration law by local entities. Section 287(g) of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act offered the opportunity for local law enforcement officers to
enforce Federal immigration law after receiving training from U.S Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE); prior to the Act local law enforcement did not have jurisdiction over




3
  Davila and Pagan (1997) find evidence that monitoring of selected firms had impacts on employment, wages, and
industry choice of immigrants. Bansak (2005) also finds that the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act
adversely affected wages and employment for Mexican workers, and Orrenius and Zavodny (2009) find similar
impacts as the result of recent enforcement policies.

immigration-related matters. 5 The 287 provision was largely ignored until the events of
September 11th 2001 refocused national attention on immigration policy (Lacayo, 2010), and
starting in 2002 states and localities began to pursue 287(g) agreements. It took some time for
the practice to become widespread, but as of 2011 (the end of the sample period for this
analysis), there were 68 local law enforcement agencies in 23 states that were currently in one
or more agreements with ICE to enable local enforcement. Most of 287(g) agreements were
initiated in 2007 or later, as shown in Figure 1. A primary determinant of applying to the 287(g)
program is short-term growth in the local foreign-born population (Shahani and Greene, 2009),
whereas a substantial long-standing foreign born population promotes integrative or inclusive
policies (Boushey and Luedtke, 2011).


The 287(g) program is controversial because it allows state and local law enforcement entities
to apply to the Federal government to play a role in enforcement of immigration law, which has
traditionally been the purview of Federal officers. Agencies in the 287(g) program receive
Federal training and are then allowed to perform enforcement functions. In areas with local
“task force” 287(g) agreements, officers are permitted to investigate immigration violations in
the field and to ask individuals on the street for proof of legal presence if they have reasonable
cause to suspect a violation. Other areas have “jail enforcement” agreements which facilitate
the investigation of legal status of those arrested for other crimes. Some agencies have
combined task force and jail agreements; in those cases they are typically implemented at the
same time. The resulting correlation between types of agreements is around 0.1.


Detractors argue that 287(g) encourages street harassment of minorities, while proponents
view it as an effective tool in enforcing immigration law and encouraging “self-deportation.”
The Obama administration ended all task force agreements associated with the 287(g) program
at the end of 2012, so these programs are no longer in effect. Other ICE programs enabling
local enforcement such as the Secure Communities Program and the Criminal Alien Program are


5
 More generally, the 200-page 1996 Act expanded resources for enforcement, changed deportation procedures,
revamped employer sanctions, and made a variety of changes to the legal immigration process.

                                                    7
poised to take their place. Understanding how immigrants respond to different enforcement
regimes is an important input into the effective design of new policies.


Despite the decline of 287(g), there has been a recent wave of state and local legislation
targeting immigrants, most prominently illustrated by the far-reaching Arizona legislation
(known as SB 1070) passed in April 2010. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld one key
portion of the law allowing police to check the immigration status of those they detain. “Copy-
cat” state legislative activity has been reported in 26 states (http://www.nilc.org/state-
immenfleg-2012.html) and five states passed similar legislation in 2011. 6 There are also
numerous anti-immigrant bills at the local levels. Though the effects of the recent state
legislation are not yet observable, the 287(g) program offers some insight into the likely effects
of these aggressive sub-national enforcement regimes.


More generally, states and localities make many policy decisions related to immigrants. States
differ on the extent to which they offer safety net benefits to undocumented and legal
immigrants. For example, about half of states exclude legal immigrants from welfare and
Medicaid benefits for their first five years in the United States. Active policy discussions at the
state level include whether undocumented students should pay in-state college tuition rates,
whether undocumented immigrants should be allowed to obtain driver’s licenses, and whether
employers need to use electronic immigration status verification systems (E-Verify). On the
other hand, many localities have issued policy statements that they will not pursue
enforcement actions under certain conditions; these jurisdictions have been informally dubbed
“sanctuary cities.” 7 There is little evidence on how immigrants weigh the complex local policy
environment in their location decisions.


6
  Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina, and Utah passed similar laws in 2011. According to the national
conference of state legislatures, “[t]he laws typically include provisions that require law enforcement to attempt to
determine the immigration status of a person involved in a lawful stop; allow state residents to sue state and local
agencies for noncompliance with immigration enforcement; require E-Verify; and make it a state violation for
failure to carry an alien registration document” (http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/immig/omnibus-
immigration-legislation.aspx). The laws have been wholly or partly enjoined pending legal challenges.
7
  The designation “sanctuary city” is unofficial and there is disagreement over what types of policy regimes should
qualify.

                                                         8
In sum, relatively little attention has been paid to the local enforcement regime and how it
affects where the foreign-born live. As noted above, recent papers on the subject (Kostandini
et al., 2012, and O’Neil, 2013) have mixed findings. This paper uses individual level data to
analyze how the 287(g) program affects year-to-year migration flows within the United States.


                                            IV. Data and Methods



The primary data source used in the analysis is the American Community Survey (ACS) for years
2005-2011 provided by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (Ruggles et al., 2010). The
ACS is a large, nationally representative survey run by the Census Bureau. Importantly, the ACS
collects information on birthplace, citizenship, and residence in the year prior to the survey.
Thus, it is possible to construct one-year migration estimates for six cohorts (2005-2010) and to
observe detailed migration decisions for immigrants living in the United States for two
consecutive years. 8 Because the ACS is relatively new, it has not been used very often to
examine sub-state migration patterns. 9


The publicly available Census/ACS provides 543 geographic units which are consistently
identified over time and cover the entire United States. In cases where there are multiple such
units within a metropolitan area (defined according to 2000 boundaries) and state I combine
areas; this sometimes requires joining metropolitan areas or a metropolitan area and a rural
area into a single geographic region. The end result is 338 local geographic areas used for
analysis. The local areas are defined such that they do not cross state lines. These areas are
shown in Figure 2, with task force agreement areas outlined in red.




8
  “Immigrant” as defined here includes all those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. who
were not a citizen at birth. “Native” includes all those born within the 50 United States and Washington, D.C.
Individuals with citizenship at birth born in outlying areas (including Puerto Rico) are excluded. The results are not
sensitive to their classification.
9
   Wozniak and Murray (2012) were among the first to use it for this purpose.

                                                          9
287(g) agreement data is collected by examining current and historical agreements posted on
the ICE website, 10 screenshots of the website from earlier periods, published reports including
Lacayo (2010) and Vaughan and Edwards (2009), and news reports. These sources were used
to construct start and end dates for all 287(g) agreements that existed at any time; in six cases
end dates were not known to the exact month and were approximated based on available
information. All task force agreements were ended at the end of 2012, but this date does not
overlap with my sample period.

Enforcement agreements can cover local police jurisdictions or states. Given that Kostandini et
al. find differential effects of local versus state agreements, I separate them in the analysis.
Furthermore, local task force agreements and local jail enforcement agreements are analyzed
separately because they have different features (as described above) and may generate
differing migration responses.

To create an index of local 287(g) agreement intensity, the average number of local agreements
faced by a given resident of a local area is calculated. 11 In many cases an agreement might
cover only a portion of a local geographic area, so the value of the index for the local area
would reflect an average of values of one for the covered population and values of zero for the
non-covered population. Furthermore, individuals might be covered by two local agreements if
their county police force and their city police force each have an agreement, for example. If an
agreement was not in effect for the full year, the value of the index is the fraction of covered
months over the year. For example, if all local task force agreements in local area a in year t
are indexed by f, all local jail agreements in local area a in year t are indexed by j, all statewide
agreements are indexed by s, and individuals living in the local area are indexed by i:

11
   Local areas are combinations of Census public use microdata areas and may include several cities or counties.
Local law enforcement agencies typically operate at the County, City, or Town level and are fully enclosed within a
single local area. For example, if 25% of the overall population in a local area resides in City X, and City X is the
only part of the local area that has an agreement, then local area coverage is 0.25.

                                                         10

                                            𝑖=1 𝑗=1


The statewide agreement index variable is similar in that it reflects the average number of
statewide agreements faced by a given resident of a local area. This variable takes a value of
zero or one except when the agreement is in effect for only part of the year:

                                       𝑛   𝑆

                                     𝑖=1 𝑠=1


The analysis is composed of three parts. First, I aggregate ACS data by year and initial local
area, and estimate migration decisions for the population initially residing in the area. By
comparing the population in the ACS who report the local area as their place of residence in the
prior year to the population residing there in the prior ACS year, it is possible to construct exit
rates from the United States and migration to an area from abroad. 12 Because the ACS is a
sample, it is possible to estimate negative migration rates – i.e. in some cases there are more
people in year t reporting that they lived in a given area in t-1 than there are people counted in
the area in t-1.          These are entered into the analysis without adjustment. 13                      Death is
indistinguishable from exiting the United States in the data; I restrict the sample to those ages 1
to 65 to minimize the impact of death on the estimates. In addition, the first year of data is
excluded due to incomplete counting of residents of group quarters in the 2005 ACS, making
the computation of an accurate denominator difficult. 14

The aggregate part of the analysis also uses aggregated individual-level year-to-year migration
flows to construct internal migration statistics. For example, one can observe the fraction of
individuals living in area a in time t who subsequently move to a different local area, state,
Census division, or Census region by time t+1 as a function of local characteristics in time t.
12
   For example, one might estimate that there are 10,000 immigrants in Local Area X in 2006 using 2006 ACS data.
Using 2007 ACS data, one can then estimate the number of people living in the United States in 2007 who report
having lived in Local Area X in 2006. If that number is 9900, the estimated out-migration rate from the United
States would be 1 percent.
13
   Lleras-Muney (2005) faces a similar issue in the context of synthetic cohort mortality rates. She notes that using
the estimated rates does not affect the consistency of the estimates.
14
   The results are not substantively affected by excluding the first year.

                                                         11
The denominator here can be the local area population estimated using the year t ACS data or
the local area population estimated using migration history in the year t+1 ACS data. The latter
increases precision and is used to estimate internal migration conditional on remaining in the
United States.

The empirical model is as follows:

         𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑀𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑡 = 𝐵1𝑇𝑎𝑠𝑘𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑡 + 𝐵2𝐽𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐸𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑡 +

The key coefficients indicate the effect of enforcement on the fraction of the population in local
area a in year t that moved by the following year. A vector of controls includes a Bartik-style
shift-share index for local labor demand generally and a second Bartik index for immigrant
specific labor demand. 15 These are important controls because the sample time frame
coincides with the great recession. Predicted immigrant population is a supply-push-style index
based on national country-of-origin trends interacted with initial country-of-origin shares. 16 I
also control for the fraction of the population arriving in the last five years because this may
affect migration patterns.

Regressions include year dummies to account for national migration trends and local area
dummies to account for permanent characteristics of locations that may affect migration. As
an additional outcome, I also examine new migrant inflows divided by the initial foreign born
population.      Regressions are weighted by 2005 immigrant population and standard errors are
clustered at the local area level to account for serially correlated local shocks.

Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics for the 2028 local area-years in the aggregate
analysis. For some constructed variables the first year of the analysis is excluded and the
15
   Specifically, for each local area the initial (year 2005) employment share in each of 15 industry groups is
determined. These shares are then interacted with the difference between log employment in the industry in the
reference year and log employment in the industry in the initial year. These interactions of these shares*shifts are
aggregated to generate an index of predicted labor demand in each local area relative to 2005. In the immigrant-
specific index, the initial share weights are determined by the industry distribution of the initial immigrant
population.
16
   Initial shares are calculated using 2000 data. The Census 2000 rather than ACS 2005 dataset is used because the
larger sample size allows for a more accurate assessment of immigrant populations across groups.

number of local area-year observations is reduced to 1690. 17 The average out-migration from
the United States is about two percent and the migration rate across local areas is about three
percent conditional on staying in the United States. The average task force coverage is two
percent, suggesting a low rate of exposure to the policy.

The second part of the analysis exploits the individual level micro-data which allows one to
observe migration decisions for individuals who were living within the United States for two
consecutive years. This part of the analysis examines determinants of migration for foreign-
born residents staying in the United States for two consecutive years. The sample is restricted
to non-institutionalized adults ages 18 to 49 to focus on the individual level migration decision
among those most likely to be making such a decision. Children and older adults are excluded
from this part of the analysis. The empirical model is similar to that above except that the
analysis is at the individual level and allows for individual level controls:




              𝑀𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡 = 𝐵1𝑇𝑎𝑠𝑘𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑡 + 𝐵2𝐽𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐸𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑡 +

                           𝐵3𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑒𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑎𝑡 ∝ + 𝜕𝑡 + 𝜑𝑎 + 𝑒𝑖𝑎𝑡




The summary statistics for the individual level data are shown in Table 1b. The individual level
analysis controls for whether the immigrant arrived in the last five years, gender, marital status,
presence of own school age children in the household, educational attainment in four
categories (less than high school, high school, some college, college grad or more), age in two
categories (18-29 or 30-49) and country of birth in 22 categories.




17
  Year 2005 ACS data do not cover institutionalized population, so constructed variables that rely on prior year
estimated population in the denominator are measured incorrectly.

                                                 V. Results

A. Aggregate Analysis

Table 2 shows the results of the aggregate analysis of cross-border migration for the years
2006-2011. The unit of observation is the local area-year, where local areas are defined as
described above. The advantages of the aggregate analyses are that (1) they most closely
follow previous work and (2) they allow for estimation of exits from the United States in a way
that is not possible in the individual-level migration data. Because the results are sensitive to
the inclusion of Maricopa County, Arizona – a local area with extreme levels of enforcement in
some years – estimates are shown with and without this area included.

Three types of 287(g) agreements (local task force, local jail enforcement, and statewide) are
considered. Column I suggests that full coverage of a local area with a task force agreement
affects exits from the United States. Full coverage appears to increase the fraction of the initial
population that exits the United States in the subsequent year by 8.7 percentage points, a
dramatic increase over the mean of 1.7 percent.                    However, the relationship between
enforcement and exits is driven entirely by the inclusion of Maricopa County. Maricopa County
(which includes Phoenix and surrounding areas) is known for intensive and often controversial
enforcement tactics under the leadership of Sheriff Joe Arpaio.                    Thus, the intensity of
enforcement in this area is unusual. Furthermore, because the area is a short distance from the
Mexican border, out-migration may be a more attractive response in Maricopa than it would be
elsewhere. Excluding Maricopa, there is no evidence that 287(g) enforcement drives out-
migration from the United States, as shown in column II of Table 2. 18

Table 2 also shows the impact of 287(g) enforcement on inflows from abroad to a particular
local area. In the full sample, it does appear that enforcement reduces inflows from abroad.
Full local task force coverage yields a reduction of inflows by 1.3 percentage points on a base of
3.1 percent. Again, these results are sensitive to the inclusion of Maricopa County. Outside of


18
  Further analysis indicates that eliminating just one year of data for Maricopa County (the migration decision
between 2009 and 2010) eliminates the significant relationship between 287(g) task force agreements and cross-
border migration.

                                                      14
Maricopa, there is no statistically significant impact of enforcement on inflows from abroad to a
local area. Jail enforcement agreements and statewide enforcement have no measurable
impact on cross-border out-migration or inflows.

Table 3 investigates the effect of enforcement on internal migration (conditional on staying in
the United States) and inflows from other parts of the United States. Panels A and B show
results for immigrants with and without Maricopa County included. In both cases, local task
force agreements increase the probability of relocation within the United States. For example,
the fraction of immigrants moving out of state increases 0.99 to 1.38 percentage points (45 to
63 percent increase over baseline), out of the Census division increases 0.83 to 1.58 percentage
points (52 to 99 percent increase over baseline), and out of the Census region increases 0.54 to
0.96 percentage points (45 to 80 percent over baseline).

Interestingly, task force agreements do not appear to affect inflows from other parts of the
United States, as shown in the final column of Table 3. This result suggests that task force
agreements act as a “push” to prompt relocations from an area but do not affect “pull” by
deterring new arrivals. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the jail enforcement or
statewide agreements affect internal migration decisions.

An obvious concern is that unobserved economic factors that coincide with task force policies
are driving immigrants away from task force areas. The sample period of one of economic
volatility, and the year fixed effects incorporated in the model do not control for differences in
the magnitude of economic shocks. One way to examine this possibility is to investigate the
effect of enforcement on the native born as a placebo test. Panels C and D reject the notion
that 287(g) agreements drive native migration across divisions or regions, or affect native
inflows. Therefore it seems likely that the migration of immigrants is due to policy changes of
particular relevance to immigrants rather than unobserved economic conditions. 19                        Further
investigation of individual-level responses by both immigrants and natives is presented below.



19
  It is important to keep in mind that the foreign-born may respond differently than natives to economic
conditions, as suggested by Cadena and Kovak (2013). This possibility is considered in the fully interacted models

                                                       15
In sum, the aggregate analysis suggests that task force 287(g) agreements encourage
immigrants to leave a local area and relocate to other parts of the United States. Outside of the
extreme example of Maricopa County, there is no evidence that 287(g) agreements affect
international flows.



B. Individual Analysis

Analysis of the individual migration decision for foreign-born individuals who remain in the
United States for two consecutive years is shown in Table 4. The analysis is restricted to the
non-institutionalized population ages 18 to 49, and results are shown with and without
Maricopa County. 20

The results suggest that implementation of task force agreements increase the probability of a
foreign-born adult moving out of the local area, state, division, and region, conditional on
remaining in the United States. For example, estimates from the full sample imply that full task
force coverage increases the probability that an immigrant will choose to exit the state by 1.1
percentage points, the Census division by 1.0 percentage points, and the Census region by 0.8
percentage points.        Results excluding Maricopa County are larger in magnitude – 1.4
percentage points, 1.9 percentage points, and 1.2 percentage points, respectively. These
figures are similar to what was estimated in the aggregate analysis and represent a 57 percent
to a 97 percent increase over baseline migration levels. The results imply that those who are
induced to leave their local area typically leave the Census division and often the Census region.
As in the aggregate analysis, there is no evidence that jail enforcement or statewide
agreements cause migration out of a local area.

The coefficients on the controls offer further insight into migration behavior of the foreign
born. Immigrants are more likely to leave an area if employment demand for their skills is
weak, if there is a decline in the predicted immigrant population in their area (based on

in Tables 5 and 6. In Table A1, unemployment rates rather than Bartik instruments are used as an alternative
control for local economic conditions. The results are not sensitive to this change.
20
   Enforcement has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on institutionalization. Results with the
institutionalized population included in the sample are shown in the appendix.

                                                     16
national trends interacted with initial country-of-origin shares), if they arrived to the United
States within the last five years, if they are male, if they do not have school age children at
home, if they are more educated, or if they are younger adults Migration rates are not
statistically different across years after controlling for other factors (results not shown), but
year dummies are included in all models. For purposes of comparison, column VIII suggests
that full local task force coverage has the same impact as a 10-15 percent decrease in
immigrant-specific labor demand.

As in the aggregate analysis, it is important to consider the possibility that unobserved
economic factors that are driving migration away from an area. The regressions include two
Bartik-style controls for employment demand, but these may not fully capture local economic
shocks. 21 I consider two versions of a placebo test using the native born. One simply repeats
the analysis with a native born sample. The second reweights the native sample so that its
characteristics more closely approximate the immigrant sample, where cells are determined by
initial local area, sex, age category (18-29 or 30-49), and education category (no high school
degree, high school degree exactly, some college, college graduate or more). The results of the
exercise are shown in Table 5. Panel A shows estimates for immigrants, Panel B shows
estimates for natives, and Panel C shows the estimates for natives reweighted as described
above. Maricopa County is excluded, but the results (not shown) are qualitatively similar when
it is included.

Regardless of re-weighting, results for natives are uniformly negative and mostly insignificant.
That is, natives do not exit local areas with aggressive immigration enforcement in the way that
immigrants do. The difference between immigrants and natives in a fully interacted model is
shown in Panel D of Table 5.            There differences between immigrants and natives are
statistically significant; immigrants are 1.7 to 2.3 percentage points more likely than natives to
move out of an area under a full task force enforcement regime.



21
  Controlling for the unemployment rate is inappropriate because it is directly affected by out-migration.
Nevertheless, results are similar if unemployment rather than Bartik demand measures are used, as shown in
Appendix Table 1.

                                                   17
Table 6 shows the divisional response by education level. Among the foreign born in general
and non-citizens in particular, the effects of task force enforcement are monotonically
increasing in educational attainment. This may be because more educated immigrants (like
more educated natives) are more mobile and better able to respond to policy changes. 22
Nevertheless, it is surprising because undocumented immigrants often have low levels of
educational attainment.

It is also apparent from Table 6 that there are differences between immigrants and natives
even within education groups. Panel C shows results for natives and Panel D shows the
difference between immigrants and natives. The differential response is statistically significant
among those with some college or a college degree. There is some evidence that the least
educated natives are less likely to move under an aggressive enforcement regime.

The education results suggest that aggressive enforcement policies may be missing their
intended targets. Highly educated immigrants may be exiting local areas not because they fear
deportation but because they are averse to the policy climate associated with a strict
enforcement regime. Undocumented immigrants directly targeted by enforcement may not
have the knowledge or wherewithal to move to a safer environment, though the analysis
cannot provide any direct evidence on this question.




C. Robustness

The robustness of the relationship between enforcement and immigrant migration is examined
in Appendix Table 1. 23        Baseline results for individual cross-divisional moves are shown in
column I.       Column II shows results without demographic controls; results are largely
unchanged. Column III evaluates the impact of local task force agreements without controlling
for the other types of agreements. The measured effect remains positive and significant.



22
   This pattern does not hold for naturalized citizens. Less educated naturalized citizens do move in response to
task force enforcement (results not shown).
23
   All models in Appendix Tables 1,2, and 3 omit Maricopa County.

                                                        18
Column IV shows the effect of using unemployment rates rather than Bartik instruments to
model the economic climate. Unemployment rates are advantageous in that they capture
idiosyncratic shocks in a way that the Bartik measures do not. However, they also respond
directly to the migration rate and therefore are not a preferred measure of economic
conditions. Nevertheless, results are similar to the baseline when the unemployment rate is
used as an alternative to the Bartik measure.

Column V addresses the possibility that alternative immigrant-specific policies affect migration
and confound the estimated effects of 287(g). For example, a control is included for whether
the state allows the undocumented residents to receive in-state tuition benefits. Though this
policy arena has been active very recently, there were only three state changes between 2005
and 2010. The model also includes a dummy indicating whether any electronic employment
verification (E-Verify) was mandated at the time in the state. During the study period, most of
the e-verify laws in effect only applied to a small portion of employers in the state. The analysis
lacks the statistical power to evaluate the effects of these state policies, but the controls do not
affect the main results.

There may be additional unobserved state-level policies that affect the foreign born. For
example, Bohn, Loftstrom, and Raphael (forthcoming) find a migration response associated
with a 2007 Arizona law. To address the possibility that idiosyncratic state laws are driving the
results, columns VI repeats the exercise using state*year fixed effects. These models rely solely
on within-state variation over time to identify the effects of 287(g). Controlling for state*year
effects reduces the magnitude of the estimated impact of task force agreements, but the effect
is still positive and significant.

Column VII of Appendix Table 1 controls for individual industry of employment in fifteen
categories. Because the industry is measured after the potential move it may be endogenous
to the migration decision.           Nevertheless, inclusion of the industry controls does not
substantively change the main result.

Column VIII includes the institutionalized population in the analysis. The magnitude of the
coefficient is somewhat smaller and marginally significant.          One would not expect the
                                                  19
institutionalized population to migrate in response to immigration enforcement, so it is not
surprising that the estimated effect is weaker.

Finally, using a logit model rather than a linear probability model yields positive and statistically
significant effects for task force enforcement.        Column IX reports odds ratios from a logit
model. The coefficients imply that the odds of migrating are more than doubled under full task
force coverage. As in baseline the linear probability model, there is no significant impact for jail
enforcement or statewide enforcement.

Appendix Table 2 repeats the robustness checks in Appendix Table 1 with regional moves as the
outcome of interest.      The results are significant and of similar magnitude across most
specifications. When the institutionalized are included, the effect of task force agreements on
regional moves is smaller but retains significance at the 10 percent level. The logit model
results suggest that task force agreements more than double the odds of a regional move.

Appendix Table 3 examines the results conditioned on industry of employment, where industry
is collapsed into seven categories. This exercise shows that the results are robust to within-
industry comparisons between immigrants and natives. It also demonstrates that those who
migrate in response to enforcement are disproportionately represented in the professional
services/FIRE as well as in business and personal services. It is important to keep in mind that
industry is observed after the potential move, so it may be endogenous to the migration
decision itself. Nevertheless, these results highlight the relationship between enforcement and
the location of skilled professionals, which may have implications for local growth and
development.




                                  VI. Magnitude of the Impacts

Task force agreements have not been implemented widely across the United States, so their
current impacts are not expected to be very large. At the peak of the agreements, only 3.5
percent of the U.S. immigrant population was exposed. The implied partial equilibrium impact
of these agreements can be determined using the estimated regional migration coefficient, the

                                                  20
baseline immigrant population, and the task force coverage across local areas. This exercise
suggests that there were an extra 15,000 relocations of 18-to-49 year-olds to other Census
divisions in the peak year 2009 due to task force agreements. The cumulative effect over the
six year sample period is 50,000. Given baseline annual migration of this group around
435,000, 287(g)-induced migration is small. There were not major distributional shifts of the
foreign-born workforce across the United States as the result of 287(g) enforcement.

Task force agreements were curtailed at the end of 2012, but since 2010 states have used
287(g) as a model for legislative initiatives designed to bolster enforcement below the Federal
level. The impacts of these laws are yet to be seen, but the most extreme case would be one in
which the effects of Arizona SB 1070 and similar bills in five other states resembled the impact
of a local task force initiative. I perform a simulation which imagines that six states implement
laws having the same impact as full task force coverage. Full coverage of six states – AL, AZ, GA,
IN, SC, and UT - would affect about ten percent of all immigrants.            Partial equilibrium
simulations suggest that about 42,000 of them would be induced to relocate to a different
Census division annually as a result of the laws. These flows are large enough to be noticeable
in certain areas.

                                        VII. Conclusion

This analysis investigates the impact of local immigration enforcement on migration choice.
The results suggest that 287(g) task force agreements do not cause out-migration from the
United States except in extreme cases. Instead, task force agreements cause relocations across
states, divisions, and regions within the United States. Importantly for policy-makers, the
effects are concentrated among more educated non-citizens. These individuals are more likely
to be documented (though their legal status is not observable in the data) and are likely
productive workers in the local economy. Thus, the task-force enforcement regimes may be
missing their intended targets.

The overall magnitude of migration induced by the task force policies is modest due to the
relative small scale of the 287(g) program and the fact that only a small fraction of the foreign
born relocate each year. As a result, any one region is unlikely to receive a large number of

                                               21
immigrants as the result of strict enforcement elsewhere. Regional policy makers need not fear
that a weak enforcement regime will lead to major demographic changes in their area.
Nevertheless, enforcement policy could be one part of a policy effort to deter highly skilled
immigrants from or attract them to a local area.

As the country considers immigration reform, it is important to consider the effect of
enforcement action beyond its impact on the number of undocumented residents in the
country.   Even though the task force model itself has been eliminated, widespread
implementation of enforcement regimes like the task force model could drive a redistribution
of immigrants within the United States. It is enforcement involving street harassment that
appears to affect internal migration decisions. Current Federal immigration policy is moving to
expand the Criminal Aliens Program and Secure Communities Program. Though both programs
focus on individuals charged with a crime, both are criticized for incentivizing street harassment
by local law enforcement authorities. Policy-makers seeking to retain skilled immigrants should
consider their enforcement regimes accordingly.

More broadly, the results suggest that, in addition to economic opportunity and social
networks, the local policy environment influences location choice among the foreign-born
within the United States. Full task force coverage has the same impact on internal migration as
a ten to fifteen percent decline in employment demand for immigrants. The distribution of the
foreign-born in the United States is likely to gradually evolve as the result of local enforcement
policy, with highly skilled immigrants concentrating in areas that eschew aggressive
enforcement policies.
