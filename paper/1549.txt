                         Accumulation in a
                       Cash—in—Advance Model


                               ABSTRACT




       This paper analyzes the dynamic behavior of capital accumulation

in Stockman's (1981) cash—in-advance model. If the cash—in—advance

constraint applies only to consuittion, then money is superneutral along

the transition path as well as in the long run. Alternatively, if the

cash—in—advance constraint applies to gross investnnt as well as

consumption, then a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth

reduces the steady state capital stock. The effect on the speed of

adjustment depends on the sign of a certain simple function of the

parameters of preferences and technology.

             In   an interesting recent paper, Stockman       (1981) develops a model
 of    an economy with capital and with a cash—in—advance constraint. His

model produces the surprising result that if the cash—in—advance

 constraint applies to gross investment as well as consumption, then

a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth leads to a decrease

in the steady state capital stock; if the cash—in—advance constraint applies

only to consumption, then money is superneutral in the long run. It

was left as "an open question whether (and how) the rate of monetary

eansion affects the speed at which the economy approaches the steady

state" (p. 391).

         The ci.rrent paper addresses the question of the effect of monetary

growth on the adjustment speed and           demonstrates     that if the cash-in—advance

constraint applies only to consumption, then money is superneutral along

the transition path as well as in the long run.                Alternatively,   if the

cash—in—advance constraint applies to gross investment as well as consumption,

then the direction of the effect of increased monetary growth on the

speed of adjustment depends on the sign of a certain simple function of the

parameters         of preferences and technology. For example, with an isoelastic
utility function and a Cobb-Douglas production function, higher monetary
grDwth leads to faster adjustment of the economy if               capital does not

depreciate.          On the other hand, ifcompletely depreciates after one
                                             capital

period, then increased monetary growth leads to faster (slower) adjustment
of the economy if the elasticity of marginal utility is less (greater) than
one;    with    logarithmic utility, the speed of adjustment is invariant to the
rate    of    monetary growth. To be more precise, these results apply only in

the    neighborhood of the steady state, just          as   Fischer's (1979) and Asako's

(1983) analyses         of the Sidrauski (1967)     model   are limited to a neighborhood
of the steady state.

        In    section I we set up a general model which includes as special

cases a cash-in--advance constraint for consumption and gross investment,

and, alternatively, a cash-in—advance constraint for consumption only.

Defining          Mt+i/Mt as the (gross) rate of monetary growth and letting

be the discount factor applied to next period's utility, we show that

the existence of a steady state requires        > . We   also demonstrate that

setting      cY equal to   allows the economy to attain the Modified Golden Rule
in   the steady state. In     section II we analyze the dynamic behavior of an
economy in which cash is needed for consumption only. We show that if
the cash—in—advance constraint is always binding, then a change in monetary

growth has no effect on either the transition path or the steady state.

Section III analyzes the dynamic behavior of an economy with a cash-in—advance

constraint for investment as well as consumption. We demonstrate that the

unique stable root of the linearized economy is positive so that the approach

to the steady state is monotonic. In section IV we show that an increase

in the rate of monetary growth leads to a faster speed of adjustment if and

only if a certain siiple function of the pararrters of preferences and

technology is positive. Concluding remarks are presented in section V.

 I. The MDdel

         The model in this paper is the same as in Stockman (1981). A

representative individual maximizes the utility function




                         totUt)                      O<<1; tJ'>O; U"<O                     (1)




subject    to a budget constraint        and   a   cash—in—advance constraint. The

individual can hold two assets, money and capital. Letting Kt and Mt

denote the capital stock and the (nominal) balances, respectively, held

at the beginning of period t, the budget constraint can be written as



                  Ct +        +
                                  Mt+l     =   f (Kt) + (1 -) Kt + M:T                     (2)


where C, is consumption,           is the money price of the homogeneous good,
                                                                                          Tt
is the nominal money transfer received at the beginning of period t, and

is the rate of physical depreciation of capital. The production function
                                                                                               f(K)
is    strictly increasing and     strictly concave (V >0, f"<0).

            consider two   alternative         formulations of the cash—in—advance
constraint. In one formulation, we require that the nominal value of
consumption during period t       be less than or equal to the money on hand at

the   beginning of period t


                              c    < (Mt   +    Tt)/Pt

In the other    formulation, we require that the nominal value of consumption
plus gross investment during a period be              less   than or equal to the money
on hand at the beginning of the period

        It is convenient to define the paranter p where p=O indicates that

e are    considering the cash—in--advance constraint in (3)                       and   p=1 indicates

that   we are considering the cash—in—advance constraint in (4). Then the
consumer's optimization problem under each of the cash—in--advance constraints
can be solved using the following Lagrangean

                                                             M+T

Differentiating (5) with        respect   to Ct,Kt and Mti we obtain



                                 U'   (Ct) =         ÷                                              (6a)




               +i' (Kt÷i) + (1—6)) +                                 =       +                      6b

If Ii=1,   then equations     (6a-c)   are identical to Stockman's equations (3)—(5) -

       The   first—order conditions in (6a—c) are more easily interpreted in
the special cases in which p=O and p=l; we defer this interpretation to
sections II and III, respectively. Before examining these special cases,
we briefly examine the steady state in the general case.
       The steady state, if it exists, is characterized by a constant capital
                                             —5—




 stock, K, a constant level of consuntion, C, and a constant (gross)

 rate of inflation,             '—1' which is equal to the constant (gross)
 rate of monetary growth        0   Mt/Mi.     In addition, the shadow prices

 arid      are constant, It follows immediately from (6c) that in the steady
 state


                                    1= X(    — 1)                                        (7)


 Since         is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the cash-in—advance
 constraint,     it is clear that this constraint is strictly binding if and

 only    if the (gross) rate of monetary growth       exceeds 3.     If c1=, then this
constraint is not strictly binding.
          A steady state does not exist if ci<, as may be seen formally by observing
 from    (7) that o< in1ies y<O which violates the Kuhn-Tucker condition that
        0 for all         A more intuitive explanation for the non-existence of
a steady state when cY<$ is obtained by considering consuming one unit less
at time t and holding Pt more units of money. This money can be used to
buy 1111t+l     units   of consuntion at time t+l. Thus, this small change will
change    the net present value of utility by -U' (Ce) +         U' (ct÷1)/ll÷i.   In a

steady state              = 0 and the change in utility is (       - 1)U' (C). If G<
then    this change leads to an increase in utility and the original situation

could    not   have been optimal.

           steady state capital stock is easily characterized by substituting
         The

 (7) into (6b) to obtain


                    (f'   (K) ÷ l—S) = 1 +     —1)   (l—(l—S))                         (8)


1.   This àtàeiñent is based on the fact that in the steady state X>O. To
     establish this fact, substitute (6a) into (6c) and use the fact that
     ll=a in the steady state to obtain U' (C)=aA which implies X>o.
                                         —6—


As   a benchmark for comparison, we define K to be the Nodiied Gglden ule
capital stock in an economy without a cash—in-advance constraint. It
 is well-known (see, for example, Sainuelson (1968)) that


                            (f'   (k)   + l—) =   1                                (9)




Observe from (8) and (9) that the cash—in—advance economy achieves the

Modified Golden Rule if   either i=O or c=3. If       1i=O, cash is not required

to purchase capital and hence the cost of capital investment is unaffected

by changes in the rate of   inflation. Thus, as shown by       Stockman (1981),

money is superneutral in the long—run. Alternatively, if cash is required

for investment (p=l), then the cash—in—advance economy achieves the Modified

Golden Rule if        As mentioned above, if c1=, the shadow price of the

cash—in—advance constraint is zero. Therefore, the cost of capital investment

which requires cash-in-advance is unaffected by changes in the rate of

inflation so that the economy achieves the Modified Golden Rule. Note. that

the optimal rate of monetary growth., Y=, s, the same as. in:        (a) Brock's (1975)

model without capital; (b) the Sidrauski (1967) model with capital (as

pointed out by Dornbusch and Frenkel (1973)); and (c) overlapping generations

models with neoclassical production functions as pointed out by Abel (l984a).

II.     Cash    for Consuntion Only
         In   this section we suppose that the cash is required in advance for

consumption but not for investment, i.e., that p=0. We have already

shown    that   in this case money is superneutral in the long run as in

Stockman       (1981). Below we demonstrate that if            the cash-in-advance constraint

(3) is    binding, then money is superneutral along the transition path as well.
         To analyze the dynamic behavior of the economy, we combine (6a) and
(6c) to obtain


                                   U' (C1)      =                                          (10)



Next, set i equal to zero in (6b) and use (10) to eliminate A and
from (6b),


                U' (C) '                   + 1 oL1t+2 =   U'
                                                               (C+1)/11+1                  (11)


Equation      (11) can be interpreted by considering a deviation from the

optimal path. Suppose that in period t the consumer buys an additional unit

of    capital, thereby reducing Mt+1 by Pt dollars and              increasing K1 by one
unit. In period t+l, the reduction              in Mt+l forces the consumer to reduce
C1 by 11t+l             units.     The consumer' s nominal      income in period t+l increases
by   t÷l (Kt+i) units.            If the   consumer reduces gross     investment in period

t+1   by i-S units, then Kt2 will be            unchanged and Mt+2 will      increase by

          t+l      +   l-S).     This increase in Mt2 allows the consumer to increase

C2     by Ef' (Kt+i     +   1 1111t+2   units   and to maintain an     unchanged path of

future   consumption,              j=3,4,5            The effect on the     consumer's discounted
utility   is a    decrease of U' (Ct+i)/llt÷1 from the decrease in C1 and increase
                                             —8—




of 2U' (C÷2)    (f (Kt+i)+l_6)/Tlt+2
                  '
                                         from the increase in                Equation (11)
simply   states that the net effect on discounted utility of a small change

from the   optimal path must be equal to zero.
      We assume that cY> so that a steady state exists and the cash-in-advance

constraint is strictly binding in the steady state. If the cash-in—advance

constraint (3) is strictly binding, then, since Mti =                      + Tt we have
                                                                      Mt


                                             =                                            (12)
                                                 Mt+i


If the (gross) growth rate of the nominal nney stock is constant over time,

then from (12) it follows that2




                                 11t+2   —   _______
                                  t+l            t t+2

Substituting (13) into (11) yields


                                                 + l-) = U'                               (14)
              cC÷2U' (C2) Cf' (K1)                             (cti) C1


Finally, we can rewrite (14) as a third—order difference equation in Kt
first rewriting the budget constraint in (2) using the fact that Mt+l =                   Mt+ Tt
to obtain



                       =                 =              + (l_S)Kt -                       (15)
                           c(Kt,Kt+1)        fU(t)
2.   We have assumed that the xnetary transfer                  can be used to purchase
     consumption goods in period t. alternatively, if the transfer Tt could
     not   be used to purchase consuntion goods in period t,               then equation (12)
     would be replaced by PC = Mt            when the cash—in—advance constraint is
     binding. Nevertheless, equation (13) would continue to hold if the
     nominal rate of unetary growth is constant over time. In addition, the
     first—order conditions (6a—c) do not depend on whether                   can be used    to
     purchase consuntion goods in period t. Hence, the dynamic behavior of
     the economy is invariant to whether or not Tt can be used in period t.

Substituting (15) into (14) yields a third—order difference equation in Kt

which is independent of the (constant) rate of monetary growth c.                         Thus

provided that the cash-in-advance constraint (3) is binding, money is

serneutral        along the      transition path as well as in the long run.

         It is worth noting that, as in the Fischer (1979)                   and Asako (1983)
analyses      of the Sidrauski (1967) model, the analysis of the effect of a

change in monetary growth is interesting only if the economy is not

initially in the steady state.1 The reason is that since the economy

displays long-run superneutrality, the steady state is invariant to the

capital stock. Thus, if the cash—in-advance economy is initially in the

steady state, a permanent increase in the rate of monetary growth will

cause an equal immediate and peri1anent increase in the rate of inflation

and will have no effect on the capital stock, consumption or real balances.

         We   have shown that (a) the economy with a cash—in—advance constraint
only for consumption attains the Modified Golden Rule which is the same
steady state attained by the corresponding non—monetary economy with an
infinitely-lived representative consumer. (As mentioned before, Stockman (1981)
showed this result); (b) the dynamic behavior of the economy is independent
of the (constant) rate of monetary growth, if the cash—in—advance constraint
is binding. Note that (a) and (b) do not iirly that dynamic behavior of
the cash—in—advance economy is the same as in the corresponding non—monetary
economy.5 Indeed, in the corresponding non—monetary economy, a consumer would



3. A more general formulation of the cash—in—advance constraint would be
       < (Mt + Tt)/ where 0 < < I is the share of consumption which must
     be purchased with cash. The analysis in the text assumes ij=l. If l?<l,
     then superneutrality continues to hold in the steady state, but not, in
     general, along the transition path. See Abel (1984b) for further
     discussion using a model which, at a formal level, is similar to the
     model     with a cash—in—advance constraint for consumption                  only.

         A coxrarison of (11) and (16) reveals that, in general, the dynamic

behavior of the monetary economy differs from the dynamic behavior of the

non—monetary   economy. In a non—monetary economy,                        the marginal rate of

substitution U'   (C. ..
                    t+.L
                           )/BU'     t+

                                                    ecuated with one -.plus the net marainal

product of capital, l+f' (Kt+2)_s. In the monetary                         economy, this marginal

rate of substitution is equated with [1 +                    f'                           which is one
                                                                  (Kt+i)_S]llt+i/ll+2
plus the net marginal product of capital, adjusted for the change in

inflation    tax by reducing Mt÷l and increasing                       Mt+2. Of course, in the steady

state,   with constant     inflation arid           a constant capital stock, the marginal rate
of   substitution is the same in              the monetary and non—monetary economies.

 III. Cash   for   Consumption   and   Investment

        In this section      suppose that cash is required in advance for both

consumption   and investment as in (4), i.e., that 11=1.              assume   that O>
so that this constraint is strictly binding in the steady state In this

case, money is not superneutral in the long run. Setting p equal to one in

 (8)   obtain



                                 f! (K) =                                                (17)



Therefore, the steady state marginal product of capital is proportional to

c so that the steady state capital stock is a decreasing function of C as

shown by Stockxnan (1981).

       To analyze the dynamic behavior of the economy, set p equal to 1 in

(6b) and substitute (6a) into (6b) to obtain



                                        U'                                            (18)
                    Aif' (Kt÷i) =            (ce)    (l-S)U' (Ct÷i)



Using (10) to eliminate At+l from (18), we obtain



            2u (C÷2) t+1               11t+2 ft-I' (Ce)   (l—)U' (C+i))              (19)




       To   interpret equation (19)      consider the benefits    and costs of
consuming one less unit at time t and using the cash to increase Kt÷i by
one unit. The cost of giving up the consumption is U' (Ct). The benefits
arrive in periods t+1 and t+2 in period t+1, the consumer can increase
consumption by (1-s) units and maintain the previously planned path of the

capital stock. Also, in period t+l, the consumer receives extra output
                                                  —12—




f' (K1) which      can be sold for +1' (Kt÷i) units of uney. In period
t+2, this extra money can be used to increase consumption by f' (Kt+i)/ll+2

units. Thus, the present value of benefits is                     2u' (C2)f' (K i'11t 2 +
U' (Cr1) (1-S). Equation           (19)    simply states that the benefits      arid   costs   of

this   small   change are   equal.
          If the cash—in-advance constraint is binding, then from (4)                  and   (15) it
follows   that6       Ptf(Kt) =   Mt+i
                                          which, in terms of rates of change, is


                                                   f(K)
                                              G                                                (20)
                                   11t+l


substituting (15) and (20) into (19) yields the third—order nonlinear

difference     equation which governs the evolution of the capital stock


        32f(K+2)f' (K+i)U' (C(Kt+2,Kt+3))                af(K+i)fU'(C(Kt,K+i))
                                                                                               (21)
                  —
                      (1—)U' (C(K1,K+2))} =               0



          The strategy of    the analysis of dynamics is to linearize (21) around
the    steady state Kt = K    and then to analyze the characteristic roots of
the linearized system. Let       Kt - K denote the deviation of Kt from its
steady state value. Then linearizing (21) around Kt = K yields


                                  + 2Kt+2 +                   +     = 0                        (22a)


6.     If the monetary transfer Tt cannot be used to purchase goods in period t,
       then Ptf(Kt) = Mt if the cash-in-advance constraint is binding. However,
       the dynamics are unaffected ]y whether Tt can be used to purchase goods in
       period t. See footnote 2.

It follows immediately from (25a) and (25b) that h(Z) = 0 has at least

one real root between 0 and 1. From Descartes Rules of Signs, the fact

that there are two changes of sign in the coefficients of h(Z) = 0

indicates that there are either zero or two positive real roots. Since

we have located one real root between 0 and 1, these must be two positive

real roots. Furthermore, the other real root must be greater than 1.

Finally, the remaining root is real and       negative.    It follows immediately

from (25a,c) that the negative root is not between -1 and         0.   Therefore,

the negative root is less than -1.

         We have now demonstrated that only one of the three characteristic

roots has modulus less than one. Furtherure, this stable root is

positive so that the capital stock approaches its steady state monotonically.

         If the capital   stock Kt   is below the steady state capital stock,

then  the monotonic approach to the steady state inlies that Kt+i > Kt
that from equation (20), we have      < c. As the steady state is approached,

the real money supply increases over time and the rate of inflation increases
toward its steady state value of ci.       This behavior   of the capital stock,
real   balances   and the rate of inflation is qualitatively the same as in the

Sidrauski model, as discussed by Fischer (1979).

IV. The Effect of W,netary Growth on the Speed of Adjustment
        In this section we examine the effect of a permanent change in
monetary growth on the speed of adjustment with a binding cash-in—advance
constraint on consuition and investment. In order to make the                 analysis

more tractable we restrict the preferences and technology of our model
economy.    Specifically, we assume that utility function is isoelastic so that


                                        C-l                                              (26)
                             U(Cj =                            >
                               L         j()
We   assume that production function is Cobb-Douglas




                              f(K)=AK                   O<4<l                            (27)



Therefore   in the steady state we have


                                    C          -                                         (28)



         Using equations (26)—(28), the characteristic equation (23) can be
simplified   considerably. It is shown in pendix B that the characteristic

equation can be written as



              h(Z) =                     + (l—S)]g(Z) +    j(Z)    = 0                   (29a)
                        [(l—(l—6))-

where


               g(Z) =
                        (-
                             —l)Z2 —
                                        (- 11) )Z+ 11)
                                          +                                              (29b)



             j (z) = z{ (Z-l)(Z +   16)            -   (l- +   )   (Z -   }              (29c)
                                               —16--




Note that the polynomials g(Z) and j (Z) are independent of a.                         The

characteristic equation is a cubic equation in Z but is linear in the
monetary growth rate a.
         The effect of an increase in a on the stable root                           is calculated
by applying the implicit function theorem to (29a) to obtain


                              dw2          1U1)2)
                                                       / h(w2)                                       (30)



It   follows from (25a,b) that
                                     h(w2)     <   0 so that (30) implies


                            dw2                    3h(w2)
                  sign (           ) = sign    (                ) = sign   (g(w2))
                                                                                                     (31)




The second equality in (31) follows directly from (29a) and the fact that

l-(1-cS) > 0.     In Appendix C we prove the following lemma



Lemma.   sign   (g(w2)) =   sign    (g(l—S +       &fl.

         To calculate g(l—6+&), we use (2gb) to obtain



                           g(l—S +    &) = (—l)S(p,,S,B)                                             (32a)




where           s(p,,) =      (l- + &) [ -- +               C     -1)]     -
                                                                               1)                    (32b)




Since <l, it follows from (31), the Lemma and (32a) that


                                          du
                                   sign            = — sign       s(p,4,S,)                          (33)
                                                —17—




          Before   commenting on the isplications of (33), we show that the
speed of adjustment of the linearized economy is l-w2             In the linearized
economy, the movement of the capital stock is governed by the following



                                            ()t
equation

                                        =                                             (34)




Note that the unstable roots (w1 and U)3) have been excluded from (34) -

It    follows from (34) that



                                Kt — 1t—l =      2 _l)Kt1                             (35)




Pecalling that        is defined as the deviation of Kt from the steady state

capital stock K, (35) becomes



                                AKt = (l—w2)     (K—Ki)                              (36)




Thus, 1w2 is the fraction of the gap between the current capital stock

and   the steady state   capital stock which is closed in one period. It

follows    immediately from (33)      that the direction of the effect of an increase

in     on the speed of   adjustment is



                                d(l—w2)     =
                         sign     do            sign S(p,q,S,)                       (37)




          Equation   (37) along with the definition of S(p,,,i3) in (32b) indicates
the   direction of the effect of       an   increase in monetary growth on the adjustment
speed. Thus, given the two technological parameters              and   and the two
preference parameters p     and   ,    we   can easily determine the direction of the
effect on the adjustment speed. It is interesting to examine two special
cases: (a) Q; and (b) 5=1.
         If 3=0,      it follows immediately from (32b) that s(p,S,) =                 >0
              d(l—w2) > 0.       In this case we obtain the unambiguous result that
and hence
                 da
an increase in the monetary growth rate a leads to an increase in the

adjustment speed of the economy.

         The results are     dramatically     different if capital depreciates

completely after one period, i.e., 3=1. In this case,                             = (l—p) (--)


Therefore,      an increase in th.e rate of rtpnetary growth increases. (decreases.)

the speed of adjustment if the elasticity of marginal utility p is less

(greater) than one. If p=l, i.e., if utility is logarithmic, the adj stment

speed of the economy is invariant to a.

         Thus    far,   we have shown that the effect of increased monetary growth

on the adjustment speed 1w2 depends on the sign of s(p,,:5,).                    hit



calculate     the effect on net investment, given the capital stock Kt, we

differentiate (36) with respect to a to obtain



                                        dw                          dK
                             t-,-1
                                     = — —2 (K—K                    —
                           do            do      t )   + (l—w
                                                            2 do)                           (38)



Since   1-w2 > 0 and         <   0, the second of the two terms in (38) is negative.
                                              dw2
Thus,   for   instance, if 5=l and p=l so that —-           = 0,     an increase in monetary

growth decreases the rate of net investment. More generally, however, it

is possible for the two terms in (38) to be of opposite sign and the effect

on net investment could be either positive or negative.

V.    Concluding Remarks
          The analysis in this paper has examined the dynamic behavior along
the (linearized) transition path in Stockman's (1981) cash-in-advance
model as Fischer (1979) and Asako (1983) have analyzed the (linearized)
transition path in the Sidrauski (1967) model, In particular, these
analyses of the transition path have focussed on the effect of a permanent
increase    in monetary growth, on the speed of adjustment of the economy.

We have presented some general results for the cash—in—advance model which

may   be compared with the results for the Sidrauski model, For example, if the
cash—in—advance constraint applies to investment as well as consumption, and if
capital   does not depreciate, then an increase in monetary growth increases

the adjustment speed of economy; except for the logarithmic case (in which

the speed of adjustment is invariant to the rate of monetary growth),

Fischer (1979) also found    that higher   monetary growth   leads   to faster

adjustment   in the Sidrauski model. Alternatively, we showed that if capital
depreciates completely after one period in the cash—in—advance model, then higher
monetary growth   leads to faster (slower) (the same) speed of adjustment if

the elasticity of marginal utility is less than (greater than) (equal) to

one; these findings are qualitatively the same     as   in Asako's (1983) formulation

of the Sidrauski model in which money and consumption are perfect complements

in the utility function.

          The similarity of results between some specifications of the cash—in—

advance   model and some specifications of the Sidrauski model is superficial
and may mask an important underlying difference. The results derived by
Fischer and Asako   for   the Sidrauski model do not depend on the specification
of technology, except for the usual concavity assumptions. Although these
studies explicitly assume zero depreciation, the production function in these
                                        —20—




papers, f(Kt)i could   be interpreted   as f(K) =   f(Kt)   .SKt where f

is gross output. However, the results for the cash—in—advance model

depend crucially on the specification of technology. The budget

constraint (2) relates net investment Kt÷l      Kt to net output f(K) —

(and other variables), whereas the cash—in—advance constraint (4) relates

net investment to depreciation 5Kt (and other variables). Because the

capital stock enters two constraints in different forms (f(Kt) -

SK). it is no longer sufficient simply to specify the net production
function without specifying the gross production function and depreciation
separately. As we have emphasized, the effect on the adjustment speed of a
change in the monetary   growth rate can differ dramatically depending on

the   rate of depreciation.

Observing that       = 1,      the characteristic equation can be written using

1arrariging (B—lob) reveals that j*(Z)                  j (Z)   where j (Z) is given by (29c).

         In   this    Zppendix we prove the Lemma: sign (g(w2)) = sign (g(l—S+&)).
First   observe from (29b) that g(0) =                                           > 0    and g(l)        =      < 0.

Therefore, there exists a Z in (0,1) such that

The first equivalence in (C-2) follows from the facts that                                                  is the only

real root of h(Z)=0 in the interval [0,1] and h(0)>0, h(l)<0. Therefore, for

ZE[o,l],    h(z)0 as                              The second equivalence in (C—2) follows from (C—i).

                                                    h(Z) = j(Z)                                                           (C—3)




since g(Z)=0. another ixrlication of g(Z)=0 is, from (29b),



                              (z—l)      (z +          1                 1-' A
                                                                       = — z (z —          )                              (C—4)
                                                   1(16)

Substituting (C-4) into (29c) and then using                                    (C—3)   islies

                                 h(z) =            z        (Z—        (—(l—6+))                                       (c—5)
                                                       -          -)


Since 0 <     Z < 1,   it follows from (C—i) arid (C—5) that

                                 sign (h(Z)) = sign(g(1—+&))                                                           (C—6)
                                       C—2




Finally (C-2) and (C—6) imply   that

                     sign (g(w2)) = sign     (g(1—S+S4))   (c—7)
