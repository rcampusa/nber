                       Supply Shocks, Wage Indexation
                         and Monetary Accommodation


                                  ABSTRACT


        This paper develops a unified framework for the analysis of wage
indexation and monetary policy in the presence of supply shocks. We first
present simple formulae for the optimal wage indexation rule and for the
optimal money supply rule. In order to set the stage for an evaluation of
departures from the optimal policy rules we first analyse two extreme cases
—— a rule that stabilizes employment and a rule that stabilizes the real
wage. The analysis of these two extreme cases provides the ingredients for
the evaluation of various rules for wage indexation and for monetary
targeting. We examine the implications of indexing wages to (1) nominal
GNP, (ii) the DPI and (iii) the value—added price index, as well as the
implications of targeting the money supply to these alternative three indi-
cators. It is shown that, the various indexation rules bear a dual relation
to the various monetary targeting rules. The welfare ranking of the
various rules depends on whether the elasticity of the demand for labor
exceeds or falls short of the elasticity of labor supply. If the demand
for labor is more elastic than the supply, then policy rules that stabilize
employment produce a smaller welfare cost than policy rules that stabilize
the real wage. In that case, indexing wages to nominal GNP results in a
smaller welfare cost than indexing to value—added price index which, in turn,
produces a smaller cost than indexation to the CPI. Because of the dual
relation between monetary policy and wage indexation, it follows that under
the same circumstances, monetary policy that targets nominal GNP produces a
smaller welfare cost than policy that targets the value—added price index
which, in turn, results in a smaller cost than the policy that targets the
CPI. This ranking is reversed when the elasticity of the supply of labor
exceeds the elasticity of demand.

        The energy crises of the 1970's stimulated a renewed interest in

questions concerning the proper adjustment to external supply shocks. In

general, restoration of equilibrium in response to shocks necessitates

adjustment of both quantities and prices. When applied to labor markets,

various proposals for policy rules attempting to restore labor-market

equilibrium may be classified in terms of their impact on the division of

adjustment between quantities (the level of employment) and prices (the real

wage). The design of' optimal policies provides for the appropriate division

of this adjustment.

        This paper develops a unified framework for the analysis of wage

indexation and monetary policy. The analytical framework is applied to

determine the optimal policy rules in the presence of supply shocks as well

as to evaluate the welfare consequences and ranking of alternative (sub—

optimal) policy rules. In order to set the stage for an evaluation of the

welfare implications of alternative policy rules, we first analyse two

extreme cases —— a rule that stabilizes employment and a rule that stabi-

lizes the real wage. The analysis of these two extreme cases provides the

ingredients for the evaluation of various rules for wage-indexation and for

monetary targeting .   We   examine the implications of indexing wages to (1)

nominal GNP, (Ii) the CPI and (iii) the value-added price index. The

distinction between the CPI and the value—added price index is of a special

importance in the presence of supply shocks. We also examine the implica-

tions of targeting the money supply to these alternative three indicators.

        Our analysis demonstrates that, on the formal level, the various

iridexation rules bear a dual relation to the various monetary targeting

rules. We show that the welfare ranking of the various rules depends on

whether the elasticity of the demand for labor exceeds or falls short of the

elasticity of labor supply. Specifically, if the demand for labor is more
                                       2

elastic   than the supply, then policy rules that stabilize employment produce

a smaller welfare cost than policy rules that stabilize the real wage and

vice—versa. Accordingly, using this principle, we show that if the elastic-

ity of the demand for labor exceeds the elasticity of supply then, indexing

wages to nominal GNP results in a smaller welfare cost than indexing to the

value—added price index which, in turn, produces a smaller cost than indexa—

tion to the CPI. Likewise, because of the dual relation between monetary

policy and wage indexation, it follows that under the same circumstances,

monetary policy that targets nominal GNP produces a smaller welfare cost

than policy that targets the value—added price index which, in turn, results

in a smaller cost than the policy that targets the CPI. This ranking is

reversed when the elasticity of the supply of labor exceeds the elasticity

of demand.


          Our analysis is of relevance to both the theory and the policy

discussions concerning wage indexation and monetary rules. Specifically,

great attention has been given to the question of whether the monetary

authority, when faced with a higher price of imported energy, should follow

an accommodative policy and expand the money supply in order to "finance"

the higher energy price or, whether it should be anti—accommodative and

contract the money supply in order to lower inflation. The key question was

whether, in the absence of an active monetary response, labor markets can

adjust without costly deviations from full employment [e.g. Gordon (1975,

198Ls), Phelps (1978), Blinder (1981), Rasche and Tatom (1981) and Fischer

(1985)]. Our analysis deals with these questions as part of the more

general analytical framework.

          Section I describes the building blocks of the model including the

specification of the stochastic shocks and the determination of output and

employment. Section II introduces the objective function which aims at

minimizing the expected value of labor—market distortions. In our model, as

in Gray (1976) and Fischer (1977a, 1977c), the need for wage-indexation and
                                        3



monetary policy arises from the existence of labor-market contracts accord-

ing to which wages are set in advance of the realization of the stochastic

shocks. This labor-market convention results in some stickiness of wages.

Wage indexation and monetary policies intend to reduce the undesirable

consequences of this stickiness. With the aid of' the objective function we

derive the optimal wage inclexation rule which eliminates the welfare cost.

The key characteristic of the optimal indexation rule is that it separates

between    the effects of monetary and real shocks on the wage.
           In Section III we examine the implications of departures from the
optimal indexation rule. In this context we develop a general     criterion for

the comparisons between rules that. stabilize employment and rules that

stabilize real wages. We then apply this criterion to determine the welfare

ranking of alternative proposals for wage indexation rules.

           The question of monetary accommodation is addressed in section IV.

We start by specifying the conditions for monetary equilibrium. We then

determine the optimal money—supply rule and analyse its dependence on Ci)

the nature of the stochastic shocks (ii) the parameters of the demand for

money, (iii) the elasticities of the demand for and supply of labor, and

(iv) the degree of' wage indexation. The section concludes with an analysis

of various targeting rules for monetary policies. Analogously to the com-

parisons among wage—indexation rules, the monetary rules are analysed in

terms of their relative impact on stabilizing quantities (employment) versus

stabilizing prices (the real wage). Finally, section V contains concluding

remarks.

I.    The Model

          In this section we outline the structure of the model which includes

a specification of the productive technology, and a determination of the

levels of output, employment and wages.



1.1 Output and Employment

          Output is assumed to be produced by a Cobb-Douglas production tune—

tion using labor and. imported energy as variable inputs. Thus, for period




(1)        log I =   log   B +   8log   Lt +   A        log Vt +               , O<<1   ,   O<A<1




where         denotes the level of output,                            and V denote, respectively,

the inputs of labor and energy, B denotes a parameter including all fixed

factors of production and                  denotes a productivity shock. The produc-

tivity shock is assumed to be distributed independently and normally with a

zero mean and a known variance                     .      in       competitive equilibrium the para-

meters       and A denote, respectively, the relative shares of labor income

and energy bill in national product. Throughout the analysis we assume that

information is complete; thus, producers and other agents in the economy

know the realized values of the stochastic shocks.

          Producers, who are assumed to maximize profits, demand labor and

energy so as to equate the real wage and the relative price of energy to the

marginal products of labor and energy. Expressed logarithmically, these

equalities are



(2)        lo() = log B — (1—)log                  Lt +        A    log Vt +

              log)             log AB +     log Lt — (1—A)log Vt



where ,        P         and P denote the nominal wage, the nominal price of energy

and the price level, respectively.

             Equations (1)—(3) characterize the levels of output and factor

inputs for a given realization of the stochastic productivity shock

In the absence of stochastics shocks, the corresponding levels of output and

factor inputs are denoted by I. L and V and the corresponding real

factor prices are (W/P)0 and (PIP). For subsequent use we denote by

lower case letters the percentage discrepancy of a variable from the value

obtained in the absence of shocks. Thus, x =                log   X —   log X. Accordingly,
the percentage deviation of output from its non—stochastic level is



(1')          y =         +     +




where    y         log         log     9.   log L-lo L, and v = log V-lo V0.
Analogously, subtracting from equations (2) and (3)                the corresponding equa-
tions for the non—stochastic equilibrium yields



(2')          w—p = —(i—b)P. + Ày + ii



                              — (1—A)v +



where, for simplicity, the time subscript has been omitted. From equations

(2' )   and    (3'   ) the    demands for labor and energy (or more precisely the per-

centage discrepancy of the demands for labor and energy from their non—

stochastic levels) are

             where       o=   1 —p—A




Assuming that producers are always able to satisfy their demands for labor

and energy inputs, we substitute equations (i4) and (5) into (1') and obtain




(6)          y         a[(p-w) — A(p—p)   +




Equation (6), which may be viewed as the aggregate supply function, shows
that the percentage deviation of output from its deterministic level depends

on the percentage deviations of the real wage and of the relative price of

energy from their deterministic levels, as well as on the real productivity

shock              Higher values of the real wage anu of the real energy price oper-
ate like neatlve supply shocks and result in lower output, whereas a posi-

tive productivity shock raises output.

             We assume that the economy is small in the world energy market and

that    it   faces an exogenously given energy price wliich is distributed nor-

mally around a given mean. In order to simplify the notations we define an

effective real shock u as the sum of the positive supply shocks arising

from shocks to productivity and to the price of imported energy, Thus

u       —                     With this definition of the effective real shock, the
             A(p—p)       .



demand for labor in equation () and the supply of output in equation (6)

can be written as:



p4')          2.       n(p-w) + au
                                          7



and

(6')     y — a[8(p—w) +     u]


where =a(1-A) denotes the (absolute value of the) elasticity of the

demand for labor with respect to the real wage. This specification of

employment and output (or more precisely the percentage discrepancy of

employment and output from their non-stochastic levels) reflects the assump-

tion that 9. and y are determined exclusively by the demand for labor rather

than by the interaction between the demand and the supply of labor.2 The

resultant disequilibrium in the labor market induces welfare cost and our

subsequent analysis deals with ways to minimize this welfare cost. In order

to obtain a benchmark for the assessment of the implications of distortions

in the labor market, we turn first to an analysis of the equilibrium that

would have obtained in the absence of distortions.



1.2 The Undistorted Equilibrium

        In the undistorted equilibrium the demand for labor equals the

supply. Let the supply of labor be


              S                     w
(7)      log Lt       log A + c
                                  log()


where      denotes the elasticity of labor supply. As before, using lower-

case letters to denote the percentage deviation of labor supply from the

non-stochastic level, we obtain



(7')     9S   —
                  c(w—p)
                                        8



Equating the demand for labor (equation (u'))        with   the supply (equation

(7')) yields the undistored equilibrium employment, £, and the undistorted

equilibrium real wages, (w—p);



(8)
               Efl

Using equation (9)   in   (6') yields the undistorted equilibrium output y



(10)
         —
         y =
               (1i) u

When this equilibrium obtains, the demand for labor equals the supply of

labor arid, in the absence of other distortions, efficiency is maximized.



II. The Measure of Welfare Loss and Optimal Indexation

        Inc foregoing analysis determined the equilibrium undistorted levels

of output, employment and real wages. It was assumed that the flexibility

of wages and prices yielded an undistorted labor market equilibrium. The

values of the key variables in the undistorted equilibrium serve as the

benchmark against which the actual levels of output, employment ani real

wages can be compared. Such comparisons provide the basis for the computa-

tion of the welfare loss of labor market distortions. In this section we

outline a measure of the welfare loss and we discuss the optimal policies

designed to eliminate this loss. A more formal derivation of the measure of

welfare loss is presented in the Appendix.
                                                     9


11.1 The Welfare Loss

           It is assumed that due to costs of negotiations nominal wages are

Set In advance at their expected market clearing level, and employment is

determined by the demand for labor. For a given realization of the effec-

tive real shock, u, the resulting level of employment is                     9., as given by

equation (4'). The corresponding equilibrium level of employment is                   2., as

given by equation (4''), obtained by substituting into (4') the equilibrium

real wage (w-p) for the actual real wage.



(14'')     9. =   n(p-w)      + ou




The discrepancy between 9. and 2.                 is responsible for the welfare loss. That

discrepancy is



(11)       9. —   2.   =
                           nL—(WP)   +   (w—p)}



In order to compute the welfare loss associated with this discrepancy we

need to multiply it by one half of the difference between the demand and the

Supply prices at the actual level of employment.                       Diagramatically, in

Figure 1    £ and (W:p) designate the equilibrium values of employment and

real wages, whereas             9.. designates actual employment. At the actual employ-

ment level,       9.   ,   the demand price for labor, (w—p), exceeds the correspond-

ing supply price, (w-p)5. The welfare loss is represented by                      measuring

the area of the triangle ABC. This triangle expresses the welfare loss in

terms of consumer and produces surpluses. Thus,



(12)          =        {wpd     —
                                     (w—p)8j   (   — 2.)

                                                 10



By using the definitions of the elasticities of the demand and the supply of

labor we note that (w_p)d - (w—p)5           =    (! + J) ( — 9). Substituting   into

(12) and recalling that the equilibrium real wage, (W:p), is specified by

equation (9), yields


               1       c+n        o      2
(13)




Equation (13) measures the area of the triangle ABC in Figure 1. In what

follows we assume that the objective of policy is to minimize the expected

value of the welfare loss, and we denote the loss function by H where



        As is evident by inspection of (13), a policy that is capable of

generating a real wage w-p that is equal to the equilibrium wage
au/(+), will eliminate the welfare loss. In wh.. follows we determine the

optimal wage-indexation formula that eliminate the welfare loss. We then

use the loss function to evaluate the welfare implications of alternative

formulae for wage indexation and for money supply rules.



11.2 Optimal Wage Indexation

       As was already indicated it is assumed that due to cost of nego-

tiations nominal wages are set in advance and are adjusted over time accord-

ing to a simple, time—invariant indexation rule. Let the indexation rule be



(1L)     log       =   log W + b0(log   I' -      log   P0) +   b1u


Equation (114) specifies the wage at period t as a function of (i) W0, the

equilibrium wage that is obtained in the absence of shocks,14 (ii) the per—

centage deviation of the price from its non—stochastic equilibrium, and
                                        11



(iii) the effective real shock u. Expressing the wage rule in terms of

lower-case letters, recalling that the effective real shock is composed of

productivity and energy—price shocks, i.e., u=i—Aq, and allowing for dif-

ferent coefficients of indexation to i arid     q,   yields



(15)     w   b0 p + b1 i + b2 q



Equation (15) specifies an iridexation rule by which the nominal wage adjusts

in response to the price, p, to the productivity shock, .i, and to the

energy-price shock, q. The optimal values of b0, b1 and b2 are chosen so

as to eliminate the discrepancy between actual and equilibrium real wages.

Inspection of the last bracketed term in (13) reveals that the nominal wage

which eliminates the welfare loss is



                   aAu
         w   p +—i ——q

where —Aq has been substituted for the effective real shock u. Thus, the

optimal values of the coefficients in the indexation rule (15) are:



(16)          1,       =   , and   b2    —Ab1



        This formulation of the indexation rule is analogous to that of

Karni (1983) who showed in the context of a closed economy without energy

input that at the optimum the nominal wage must adjust to the price level by

an indexation coefficient of unity whereas, in general, its adjustment to

the productivity shock differs from unity.5

        The magnitude of the indexation coefficient b1 depends on the

structure of the economy as reflected by the elasticities of the demand and
                                     12


the supply of labor. For example, a lower elasticity of labor supply raises

the absolute values of the optimal coefficients of indexation to the real

shocks (i.e. to productivity shocks and to energy—price shocks). When the

elasticity of the supply of labor approaches zero, b1 approaches

 [1/(1—A)J>1, and b2 approaches -A/Cl—A). Likewise, the magnitude of the

coefficients of' indexation to real shocks depend on the relative share of

energy cost in output. As seen in equation (16), a higher share of energy

cost raises b1 as well as the absolute values of b2. In general, b1 will be

positive and b2 will be negative.

        The key point to emphasize is that by altering the nominal wage the

optimal indexatiori rule eliminates the welfare loss associated with the

distortion to the real wage. The equilibrium that is obtained with optimal

indexation replicates the equilibrium that would have been obtained if labor

market cleared after the realization of the stochastic shocks. Thereby, the

optimal indexation formula serves to nullify the distortions arising from

the assumption that, because of contracts, nominal wages are predetermined.

Further, if' economic policy was only concerned with the efficiency of

resource allocation then, in the absence of other distortions, once the

optimal indexation formula is adopted there is no need to undertake addi-

tional macroeconomic policies.

        The essense of the optimal incjexatiori rule lies in the separation

between the coefficients of indexation to nominal and to real shocks. In

the specification of equation (14), nominal shocks were represented by p

and real shocks were represented by u.       it was shown that with optimal

indexation wages should be indexed to p with a coefficient of' unity

whereas the magnitude of the optimal indexation to u depends on the

elasticities of the demand and the supply of labor. Since ultimately the

real shocks are manifested in the realized level of' output, we may also
                                             13


include the level of output directly in the indexatlon rule and, thereby,
obtain an alternative formulation. The alternative formulation expresses
the wage indexation rule in terms of the response of nominal wages to the

price and to the level of output. Accordingly,


(17)        wp +            b,y


where b              denotes the coefficient of indexation of nominal wages to real
output. Substituting by for (w-p) in (6') yields            the realized value of

y, and equating this realization with the equilibrium value y from

equation (10), yields the optimal indexation coefficient:




             y        1+E



Thus, the optimal inciexation rule expressed in terms of prices and output
is:




(17')       w = p +
                            !_y   .7


The advantage of this alternative (but equivalent) formulation is its
simplicity. Here the wage rule is specifiec in terms of the observable

variables        p    and y about which data are readily available.



ILl. Alternative Wage Iridexation Rules

        In the previous section we specified the optimal wage indexation

formula. In this section we apply the analytical framework to an evaluation

of specific proposals for indexation rules including the indexatiori of

nominal wages to nominal income, to the consumer price index (CPI) and to
                                      1'4



the domestic value—added price index.8 In general, restoration of labor
market equilibrium in response to some shocks necessitates some adjustment

of employment and some adjustment of real wages. The optimal indexation

formula provides for the optimal division of the adjustment between changes

in employment and changes in real wages. Tne various proposals which depart

from the optimal indexation rule differ in terms of the allocation of ad-

justment between employment and real wages. In order to evaluate the     rela-
tive merits and welfare costs of such alternative allocations of adjustment

we start with an analysis of two extreme indexation rules -- a rule that

stabilizes the real wage and a rule that stabilizes employment. In general,

the various proposals for wage rules involve some combination of the two

extreme rules. Tnerefore, the analysis of the two extreme cases provides

the necessary ingredients for an evaluation of the various proposals.



111.1 Stable Real Wages Versus Stable Employment

        Generally,   as   was shown before,   the expected welfare loss, H ,is
proportional to   the expected squared discrepancy between the actual wage and

the equilibrium real wage:



(18)     H   aE[—(w—p) + (W:p}2



where a denotes the proportionality factor implied by equation (13).

Consider first the indexation rule that stabilizes the real wage. With this

indexation rule w—p=O. Substituting the equilibrium real wage from equa-

tion (9) into (18) implies that in this case the welfare loss is



                     a 2 2

                                              15



In equation (19) H                indicates that this loss results from the
                        wp
stabilization of real wages. Thus, equation (19) shows the welfare loss

resulting from an indexation rule by which nominal wages are indexed to the

CPI with a coefficient of unity.

         Consider next the other extreme indexation rule which stabilizes

employment and thereby ensures that 2.=O.                 In that case it follows from

equation (4') that. the actual real wage is u/(1—A). Substituting into (18)

implies that with =0 the welfare loss is


                        U         au -2
(20)     H0 =    aE{—         +

                                          — __________        2




where the notation indicates that this welfare loss results from the stabi-

lization of employment.

         These two measures of the welfare cost are described diagramatically

in Figure 2. Trie schedules £d and                 portray the demand and the supply of

labor as specified by equations (4') and (7') in section I. The slopes of

   and      are —i/ri   and       1/c ,   respectively,   that is, the slopes are the

inverse of the corresponding elasticities. The initial equilibrium is

described by point 0 at which, the initial demand curve (not drawn)

intersected with the supply. Thus, initially, (w:p)O. The demand schedule

drawn in Figure 2 corresponds to a situation in which there was a positive

realization of the effective real shock, u. As indicated by equation (4'),

this shock induces an upward displacement of the demand schedule by u/(1—A)

and results in a new equilibrium real wage au/(cri) and, correspondingly,

in a new equilibrium level of employment.

         Wnen the indexation rule stipulates that real wages must not change

the real wage remains at point 0 and employment increases to                  at point

C. In that case the welfare loss is proportional to the area of the 'tri-

angle CEB,     and its expected value is             as specified by equation (19).

In the other extreme, when the inuexation rule stipulates that employment

must. not change, the level of employment remains at point 0 and the real

wage rises to u/(1—A) at point A. in that case the welfare loss is

proportional to the area of the triangle CAB, and its expected value is

as specified by equation (20). Since the various expressions relate to

percentage deviations from the non—stochastic equilibrium, the actual

welfare loss expressed in units of output is obtained by multiplying (19)

and (20) by the equilibrium non-stochastic wage bill.

          In order to determine the relation between the extent of the welfare

losses in the two cases we need to compare the areas of the two triangles

CEB (denoted by ) and CAB (denoted by 2• We first note from the
geometry that the two triangles are similar arid that the ratio AD/DO (where

point C inaicates the equilibrium real wage) equals the ratio AB/BC. It

follows, therefore, that the ratio of the two areas 2'1 equals (AD/DO)2.

As seen in Figure 2,



                      1    o     ______     u        and

therefore,


              2 =

Thus, if the elasticity of labor supply, ,           is   smaller than the elasticity

of'   labor   demand, r , then an indexatiori rule that fixes employment induces
                                           17


a lower welfare loss than an indexation rule that fixes the real wage. Tnis

is the case illustrated in Figure 2. On the other hand if the elasticity of

the supply of labor exceeds the elasticity of the demand,

      >    ;   under such circumstances rules which stabilize employment inflict
higher welfare cost than rules which stabilize the real wage.

           The preceeding analysis of the two extreme indexation rules provides

the ingredients necessary for the evaluation of various proposals which

combine elements of the two extreme rules. We turn next to examine the

properties of the proposal of linking the nominal wage to nominal income.



111.2 Indexation to Nominal Income

           When the nominal wage is indexed to nominal income with a unit

coefficient, w             p+y. In this case the coefficients of indexation to the

price arid to real output are both unity. We first note with reference to

equation (17') that as long as the elasticity of the supply of labor, c,

differs from zero, full indexation to nominal income entails welfare loss.

Only when c=O the optimal indexation rule requires that wages be indexed

to nominal income with a coefficient of unity.

           In order to evaluate the welfare cost induced by the deaprture from

the optimal indexation rule, we note that with indexation to nominal income,

w—p       y. Substituting w-p for y in (6') and solving for the realized

real wage yields:



(22)           (w-p)              u
                       w=p+y



where the notation in (22) indicates that this wage is obtained under the

rule by which nominal wages are indexed to nominal income with a coefficient
                                      18



of unity. With this real wage the level of employment can be read from

equation p4'). Substituting (22) for the real wage in equation (a') shows

that in this case .=Q. Thus, an indexation rule that links the nominal

wage to nominal income through an indexation coefficient of'   unity   results in

stable employment. The resulting welfare loss corresponds to the area of

the triangle OAB in Figure 2 and is expressed by equation (20). Thus it

follows that



(23)       H        — i-f
            w-p+y           2-0



111.3   lndexation to the Value—Added Price Index

        An alternative proposal which received wide attention especially

following the energy shocks of the 1970's links wages to the domestic value—

added price index. Tnis proposal was analysed recently by Marston and

Turnovsky (1983). In what follows we explore further the implications of

sucn an indexation rule.

        Let the price of final output p be a weighted average of the

domestic value-added price index,          ,   and the price of imported energy

input p , and let the weights correspond to the relative shares of value
added and energy in output. Thus



                        + Ap




It follows that the domestic value—added price index is



               1             A
(2k)
                                            19



An indexation rule which links the nominal wage to this index through a

coefficient of unity, sets w=p .            By using the definition of        from

(24), the implied real wage Is



(25)      (w-p)          =   -     q
                  Wpd


where the notation indicates that tnis wage is obtained under the rule by

which nominal wages are indexed O
                                                p with a coefficient of unity. A
comparison between equations (25) and (22) reveals that in the special

easefor which i=0 (so that shocks to the imported energy price constitute

the only component of the effective real shack) then u =              —Aq   and the

indexation of wages to the domestic value-added price index is equivalent to

the indexation of wages to nominal income. Furthermore, as was shown

before, in this case such indexation results in stable employment and the

corresponding welfare loss is also represented by equations (20).

         In the more general case, however, with non—zero productivity shocks

the indexatiori to               does not stabilize employment and the welfare loss

differs from the one represented by equations (20). The expression for the

welfare cost in that case is obtained by substituting the equilibrium real

wage from (9) and the actual real wage from (25) into (18).Accordingly,



(26)              =    _______ -2 A22       +     _______ -2     2
                      al(l_A)(C+fl)i°q           aL(1_A)(+fl)i   o

where the notation indicates that this welfare loss results from adopting

the rule by which nominal wages are indexed to d with a coefficient of

unity.

III.LI Ranking the Indexatiori Rules

        The preceeding discussion implies that, in general, the choice

between indexation to nominal income and to the domestic value-added price

index depends on the difference between the expressions measuring the losses

H       (In (26)) and H0 (in (20)). In order to facilitate such com-

parison it is useful to rewrite equation (20) somewhat differently by

decomposing the effective real shock into its two components. Thus,



(20')    H           a[
                                £
                                       j
                                           2-2
                                            j +    22
                                                  Ao       )
             9.0                -
                          (1—A)(Lfl)                   q



Since the terms involving the variance of q are identical in both of the

expressions in (26) ana (20'), differences in the welfare cost arise only

from the terms involving the variance of                       i.   Subtracting   (20') from (26)

and denoting the difference by D yields




(27)     D
                    a( 22
                        - )
                   [(1-x)( +)j2

Thus, the sign of U depends on whether the elasticity of the demand for

labor exceeds or falls short of the corresponding elasticity of supply.

Since r = (1—A)o exceeds unity (in practice, with typical relative snares,

the magnitude of r is likely to be around 3), and since estimates of the

elasticity of labor supply are typically small, it seems that indexation to

nominal income is likely to be preferable to indexation to the domestic

value—added price index. The opposite holds, however, for cases in which

the elasticity of supply exceeds the elasticity of demand.

         A comparison been (20') and (26) shows that when c=0 ,                          indexa-
tion to nominal income is optimal since in that case the value of the loss
                                      21



function in (20') is zero. In contrast, as shown in equation (26), the

welfare loss associated with indexation to the domestic value—added price

index is positive even though c=o. In this case, the expression In (26) is

reduced to a[1/(1—A)j2a2. As argued before, only when the variance of the

productivity shock, i ,   is   zero the two indexation rules yield identical

outcomes.9

         In order to gain a broader perspective over the issues involved in

the comparison between the two forms of indexation we note that the condi-

tion determining the sign of D in (27) is the same as the condition deter-

mining whether the cost of indexation rules that stabilize the real wage

exceeds or falls short of the cost of indexation rules that stabilize em-

ployment. These relative costs are reflected in the relative sizes of the

triangles in Figure 2. As shown in equation (21) when the elasticity of the

demand for labor exceeds the elasticity of supply indexation rules that

stabilize employment are preferable to those that stabilize real wages.

Those are also the circumstances under which the indexation of wages to

nominal income is preferable to indexation to the domestic value-added price

index.

         The equivalence between the condition under which stable employment

is preferable to stable real wages and the condition under which indexation

to nominal income is preferable to indexation to the value-added price index

is interpreted by reference to equations (22) and (25). When wages are

indexed to the value-added price index then, as seen in equation (25), any

given realization of the productivity shock, ji , does not alter the real

wage. Therefore, when the effective real shock consists only of produc-

tivity shocks this rule stabilizes the real wage. On the other hand when

wages are indexed to nominal income then, as seen in equation (22), any

given realization of the productivity shock alters the real wage by
                                           22


/(1-A).    This change in     the   real wage corresponds precisely to the vertical

displacement of the demand for labor arising from the productivity shock

and, therefore, results in stable employment. Finally, as indicated above,

when tne effective real shock consists only of shocks to the price of im-

ported energy then, as seen from equations (22) and (25), the two rules

yield identical outcomes in terms of real wages, employment and welfare.

          The following analysis of the various wage indexation rules is

summarized in Table 1 .        In   it we report the coefficients of indexation to

the price (b), to the productivity shock (b1) and to the energy—price shock

(b2) that are implied by the alternative indexation rules. For example,

when wages are indexed to              then, as indicated by the second line of

Table 1 ,such a rule implies an indexation to p with a coefficient b01

and an indexation to q with a coefficient b2                 A/(1--A)   .   This rule
follows from equation (25). Likewise, the third line of Table 1 specifies

the coefficients implied by an indexation rule by which nominal wages are

Indexed to nominal income with a coefficient of unity. These coefficients

follow from equation (22). The optimal indexation formula corresponds to

the final line in the Table that follows from equation (16).

       Our analysis also determined the welfare cost associated with the
various indexation rules. Accordingly, as shown in Table 1, if the elas-
ticity of the supply of labor is smaller than the elasticity of the demand,

then the welfare ranking of the alternative rules is



(28)        >-            P
                   Pd>


where the symbol x)' y indicates that x is prefered to y. Thus, it

follows that under this assumption full indexation to nominal income is

prefered to full indexation to the domestic value—added price index which,

in turn, is prefered to full indexation to the    CPI.   Of course, the optimal

indexation rule, b ,   is   prefered to all of the other alternatives. On the

other hand, for cases in which the elasticity of the supply of labor exceeas

tne elasticity of the demand, the welfare ordering of the sub-optimal rules

is reversed. In that case

IV. Monetary Equilibrium and Optimal Accommodation

        Up to this point the monetary sector has played no explicit role in

the analysis of the wage-indexation rules. Detailed considerations of the

money market could be left in the background since in all the rules that we

have examined, wages were indexed to the CPI with a coefficient of unity.

Furthermore, as shown in Aizenman and Frenkel (1935), the specification of

the model implies that there is a redundancy of policy instruments. There-

fore, in the absence of other distortions, once the optimal indexation rule

is adoptea there is no need to undertake additional macroeconomic policies.

On the other hand it also follows that if wages are not indexed optimally

then there may be room for other policies aiming at the restoration of labor

market equilibrium. In this section we introauce the monetary sector and

analyse the optimal money supply rule.



IV.l The Monetary Sector

        In order to determine the equilibrium levels of the nominal quan-

tities like the price level we need to introduce the conditions of money

market equilibrium. Let the demand for money be



                                              —
(29)     log      log k +   log    +   clog
                                              24


where   M denotes nominal balances,            i denotes the nominal rate of interest

and        denotes the (semi) elasticity of the demand for money with respect

to the rate of interest and               denotes the income elasticity of the demand.

The domestic price level is assumed to be linked to the foreign price

through purchasing power parity. Thus,



(30)       log Pt     log St +     log


where S denotes the exchange rate (the price of foreign currency in terms

of domestic currency), and P denotes the foreign price. Let the foreign

price be



(31)       log P1 =   log   F' +




where a prime (') denotes a foreign variable and where a bar over a variable

denotes the value of its fixed component. In equation (31),                   denotes

the stochastic component of the foreign price which is assumed to be dis-

tributed normally with zero mean and a fixed known variance. Using (31) for

log P yields



(32)       log P log S + log             F'




In principle, the random component of P, may also include stochastic

deviations from the purchasing power parity relation of equation (32). When

all shocks are zero, the domestic price is:



(32')      log P = log S0 + log          F'
                                             25



and subtracting (32') from (32) yields



(33)




where, as before, we suppress the time subscripts.
         The nominal rate of interest is linked to the foreign rate of

interest, i'        Arbitrage by investors, who are assumed to be risk neutral,

assures that uncovered interest parity holds:



                     +
                         E(log   S÷1 — log S)


where Et log S÷ denotes the expected exchange rate for period t+1

based on the information available at period t .        The foreign rate of inter-

est is also subject to a random shock, p , which is distributed normally

with zero mean and a fixed known variance. Thus,



(35)       i =   -' + Pt


The specification of the stochastic shocks imply that the expected exchange

rate for period t+l is S              (the level obtained in the absence of shocks)

and, therefore, E(lo S1 — log S) = — s•               Thus, using equations (3k)-

(35),   it follows that



                                 10
(36)       i - 1' =


In the absence of stochastic shocks i=i' and, therefore,



(29')      log Md        log K   log P0 +   log
                                     26



Subtracting (29') from (29), omitting the time subscript and recalling that

from (33)    sp—   yields



(37)        md   (l+a)p+y -



        The supply of money (or more precisely, the percentage deviation of

the supply of money from its non—stochastic level) is denoted by m.

Monetary equilibrium is obtained when the demand for money equals the

supply. We turn next to an analysis of the optimal money supply.



IV.2 Optimal Monetary Policy

        The analysis of section Ii derived the optimal wage—indexation rule.

In this section we focus on the determinants of a money—supply rule that is

designed to achieve the same goal of elinimating labor-market disequili-

brium. In order to determine the optimal money supply and to contrast the

results with those of the previous sections, we assume that wages are com-

pletely unindexed so that wO. The question that is being addressed con-

cerns the optimal response of monetary policy in the face of exogeneously

given shocks. This question is not new. It was addressed by various

authors in the context of the energy supply shocks of the 197Os.h1 The key

question was whether monetary policy should be accommodative and expend the

money supply in order to "finance" the higher energy price or whether it

should be anti—accommodative and contract the money supply in order to lower

inflation. It has of course been recognized that a real shock which lowers

the potential level of output can not be combated successfully by monetary

policy. The question was whether monetary policy could be designed so as to

prevent the additional costs arising from departures from the new (lower)

level of potential output. In what follows we reexamine this question.
                                                27


       In order to determine the optimal money supply we first equate the

dernanO for money md (from 37) with the supply m and, by using equation

(10) for the equilibrium level of output, we obtain the equilibrium price

level p:


                                        (1+dça
(38)            =   4; Lm + (x)

       From equation (9) it is evident that when w=0 (as is the case when

nominal wages are unindexed), the value of p which yields the equilibrium

real wage and thereby eliminates labor market disequilibrium is



                       0
(9')       p=—        C+ fl
                            u




Equating the value of p which clears the money market (from equation (38))
with the corresponding value of p which clears the labor market (from
equation (9')) and solving for cn yields the optimal monetary rule



(39)       rn       - a(p)      +   [(1d(1)]o        (-Aq)



where .i-Aq has been substituted for the effective real shock u.

        Inspection of equation (39) reveals that when the income elasticity

of the demand for money, ,             is   unity, while the elasticity of the supply of

labor, c, and the (semi) interest elasticity of the demand for money, x, are

zero then m =        0.   This is the case analysed in detail by Fischer (1985). In

this special case the price generated by the condition of money market

equilibrium is precisely the price needed to yield the equilibrium real wage

and, therefore, no accommodation is necessary. In fact, any attempt to

alter the money supply in response to the supply shock would result in
                                        28


suboptimal employment and would inflict welfare loss.      In general, however,

as long as a or c differ from zero and            differs from unity, there is

room for active monetary policy.12

          In interpreting the rule specified by (39) we note that a positive

foreign interest rate shock, p, as well as a positive foreign price shock,

x   lower the demand for money; the interest shock operates through its

direct effect on the Qomestic rate of interest while the price shock

operates through its impact on exchange rate expectations. Wneri both shocks

are present, their impact is to reduce the demand for money by

The proper response should reduce the money supply by the same amount and,

thereby, prevent further spill—overs of the effects of these shocks to other

segments of the economy. The second term on the right-hand-side of equation

(39)   specify   the optimal response to shocks to productivity, , and to the

imported energy price, q. Both of these shocks alter the equilibrium level

of output and result in a new equilibrium real wage. In addition, the new

equilibrium level of output alters the demand for money. Without changes in

the money supply, the conditions of money market equilibrium yield a new

price level and, thereby, a new real wage. As shown in equation (39) the

induced change in the real wage will be Just sufficient to restore labor

market equilibrium only if (1c) equals (1+a). In general, a rise in the

price of imported energy should induce an expansionary monetary policy if

(1+a) >     (1+c),   and vice versa. it is also relevant to note that in gene-

ral the optimal monetary response to the effective real shock depends on the

relative share of imported energy in output. A higher value of the energy

share, A, raises the (absolute value of) the optimal response.

          The preceeding analysis demonstrated that when wages are unindexed

monetary policy could be designed to ensure labor market equilibrium.

Furthermore, it was shown that when =1 and caO monetary policy should
                                           29


not accommodate supply shocks. Prior to concluding this section it is worth

reexamining these results for situations in which wages are indexed accord-

ing to an arbitrary rule by which w = b0p.      Recalling the equilibrium real

wage from equation (9) and using the assumed inuexation rule, yields the

equilibrium price which clears the labor market



                  -                U
(9,1)
                      (1-b )(En)


Following the same procedure as before we equate this price with the price

that clears the money market and obtain the optimal money supply rule



         -
(39')    rn =     —a(p)     +
                                   (1—b)(+n)    (i—Aq)




         Two points are worth noting with reference to equation (39').

First, in contrast with the discussion of equation (39) where nominal wages

were unindexed, here even if =1 and c=a=O,        rn does not equal zero, and

a real shock calls for an active monetary response. In that case the

optimal money supply rule becomes


                      —b
          —
              =
                        °       (ii —Aq)
(39'')   UI

                  (1—b0)(1—A)



Thus, with a partial wage indexation a rise in the price of energy and a

negative productivity shock require an expansionary monetary policy.

         Second, with one important exception, the welfare cost induced by

the choice of a sub-optimal value of b0 could be eliminated through the

monetary rule prescribed by equation (39'). The important exception occurs
                                          30


when b is set arbitrarily to equal unity. In that case the indexation rule

prevents changes in the real wage and results in an absolute real—wage

rigidity. Therefore, any real shock that alters the equilibrium real wage

results in labor market disequilibrium arid inouces welfare cost. Monetary

policy can not reduce this cost.



IV.3 Alternative Monetary Rules

         The preceeding discussion specified the optimal money-supply rule.

In practice, various alternative rules for monetary targets have been pro-

posed, with special attention given recently to the proposal that monetary

policy targets nominal income.1 In this section we apply the analytical

framework to the evaluation of alternative proposals. For this purpose we

substitute equation (6') for y into the demand for money (equation (37))

and recalling that with zero wage iriUexation w=O, the demand for money can

be written as



(37)       md (l÷+ço)p + ou           -




         Consider first a monetary rule that targets the CPI. With such a

rule prO    in   equation (37'), and the resulting money supply is



(40)             —
                     ou   —
                              c(px)


This   monetary rule assures that prO and, in the absence of wage indexa—

tion, the real wage is stabilized. The welfare loss associated with CPI

targeting is the same as the loss resulting from a full indexation of wages
                                             31



to the CPI since both stabilize the real wage. This loss is specified in

equation (19).

           Consider next the monetary rule which targets nominal income. Witri

sucn a rule p÷y=O. In this case, using equation (6'), the value of output

is you/(1o). Substituting into equation (37') and recalling that p—y,

the resulting money supply is




(1) m=                           u= 1—A

In order to evaluate the lfare loss associated with this monetary rule we

note that in this case, with w=O, the real wage (w-p) equals y                    and,

using (6') y=L1/(1—A)ju .         With this real wage the level of employment
remains unchanged (as seen from equation (14')) and, therefore, the resulting

welfare loss is specified in equation (23).

           Consider next a third monetary rule which targets the domestic

value—added price index. With this rule d0 and, using the definition of'

        form (214), it follows that p        [A/(1— A)jq .   Substituting   into (37')

the resulting money supply is



(142)
                         -              Aq
                                              -




With this targeting rule and with unindexed wages, w=PdO and the result-
ing welfare loss is specified by equation (26).

            Tne equivalence between the measures of the welfare cost associated

with the targeting rules for monetary policy and the iridexation rules for

nominal wages implies that the welfare rankings of the various rules is also
                                                 32


the same as those in equations (28)-(28'). it follows that if c < n ,             the
welfare ranking is



(143)      rn>m
                     p+yO
                            m d0           p=O



and, if      > n ,    the welfare ranking is


(143')     rn   rn           rn


                     pO dO fp+yo

It is interesting to note that the ranking provided by (3) is also

consistent with that in Tobin (1983) where the targeting of nominal income

(with annual revisions) is supported and the targeting of price indexes is

criticizea. However, in discussing the choice between targeting p and

targeting d Tobin concludes that

                      "...   if
                             any price index were to be a policy
                       target, it should surely not be the CPI,
                       subject as that index is to fluctuations from
                       specific commodity prices, taxes, exchange
                       rates, import costs, interest rates, and other
                       idiosynoracies. It should be some index of
                       domestic value added at factor cost, [Tobin
                       (1983, p. 119)].

Our analysis shows that this ranking is not robust. As revealed by the

comparison of (143) with (143'), the ranking of the various alternatives

depends on the relative magnitudes of the elasticities of the demand and the

supply of labor.

          In this section we have considered three specific targeting rules.

A similar procedure can be applied to the evaluation of other rules like

targeting the exchange rate (e.g., setting sO), targeting the interest rate

(e.g., setting i—i' =         0)   targeting the money supply (e.g., setting m=O), or
                                             33


Hall's   (1984) "elastic price rule". Each of these alternatives inflicts

welfare cost but, in general, the welfare ranking of the various rules

depends on the values of the pirameters. It can be shown, however, that



(414)              in        )m         >.m -
                        pO        s-O      i—i'—O



Thus, in the present model, a monetary rule that targets the CPI produces

smaller welfare costs than a rule that targets the exchange rate which, in

turn, has smaller costs than a rule        that   targets the rate of interest.

Furthermore, in the special case for which c=O , the targeting of nominal

GNP is optimal and, therefore, it dominates the other policy rules including

the constant money—growth rule.


          Finally, it Is relevant to note that when there are no real shocks

so that       qyO , then,                         In this special case all of the

targeting rules (including the optimal rule, m )               yield   identical money—

supply response. This response ensures that the real wage remains intact,

that changes in the money supply exactly offset shocks—induced changes in

the money demand, and that the welfare cost is eliminated.



V. Concluding Remarks

          In this paper we analysed the interactions among supply shocks, wage

indexation and monetary policy. We developed an analytical framework for

the determination of optimal wage indexation and monetary policy. This

framework was then applied to the analysis of the implications of sub—

optimal policy rules. The welfare ranking of these rules was based on the

relative magnitudes of the dead-weight losses associated with the various
                                     3L


policies.   The main results of our analysis are summarized in the introduc-

tion to this paper. In what follows we outline some of the limitations and

further extentions.

        In our framework labor-market contracts stipulate the nominal wage

rule for the length of the contract period. These contracts reflect the

cost of negotiations. Since the wage rule is set in advance of the realiza-

tion of tne stochastic shocks, it may give rise to dead-weight losses as-

sociated with disequilibrium real wages. Our analysis employs this specific

form of wage contracts as a stylized description of conventional labor—

market arrangements. Implicit in our formulation is the assumption that

workers and employers are risk neutral. A useful extension would allow for

risk aversion which would rationalize contracts in terms of the insurance

function Lsee, for example, Azarariadis (1978)J

        Further, in our specification the welfare loss arises only from sub—

optimal employment level. Implicit in this specification is the assmumption

that all other markets are undistorteu. An extension would allow for other

distortions. In that case the welfare loss due to sub-optimal money

holdings would be added to the loss associated with labor—market distortions

and would depend on both the level and the variance of inflation.

        While we have assumed In the main analysis that the stochastic

shocks are identically and independently distributed with a zero mean and a

fixed variance, we have outlined the way by which one could allow for more

general time—series properties of the stochastic shocks. An explicit

elaboration of such on extension would highlight the important distinction

between permanent and transitory shocks, and would generate a profile of

wage cynamics. Richer and more complicated dynamics could also be induced

by staggered contracts and by capital accumulation [see, for example,

Fischer (1977c,1985) and Taylor (1980)J.
                                    35


       Our analysis assumed that there is one composite good which is

traded internationally at a (stochastically) given world price. With this

level of aggregation we demonstrated that wage—indexation rules bear an

exact dual relation to monetary—targeting rules. This duality implied that

there was no fundamental difference between the outcomes of various wage-

indexatiori rules and the outcomes of the corresponding monetary—targeting

rules. Tnerefore, when there is a single composite commodity the choice

between wage indexation and monetary policy is governed by additional

considerations like the relative costs and complexities associated with the

implementation of the two alternatives rules. In the more general case,

however, when there are many sectors producing a variety of goods, the exact

duality between wage indexation and monetary policy breaks down.
Specifically, as shown by Blinder and Mankiw (19814), it is clear that

monetary policy, being an aggregative policy, is not suitable for dealing

with sector-specific shocks. Under such circumstances it is evident that

optimal sector-specific policies are called for. A natural extension of our

analysis would apply the analytical framework to the determination of the

optimal sector-specific wage—indexation formulae that would eliminate the

welfare loss resulting from labor-market distortions.

                    The Computation of the Welfare Loss




        In this Appendix we provide a formal derivation of' the welfare loss

that is used in the text.

        Consider a two—period model and let the present value of utility U

be:




                  U =               +
(A—i)
                         u(C1,L1)           u(C,L)

where      designates the subjective discount factor, C. and L1 (1=1,2)

denote the levels of' consumption and labor in period              i   and where the

subscripts 1 and 2 designate periods 1 and 2 respectively. The value of

assets which are not consumed in period 1 is A1            and their value in period

2 is (i÷r)A1 where r designates the exogenously given (stochastic) world

rate of interest on internationally traded bonds. Profits are denoted by R

and are assumed to be redistributed as lump—sum transfers. The value of

profits in each period is the corresponding value of output,                  minus

payments to labor and energy inputs:




(A-2)             Rt =    Yt(Lt,Vt)
                                        -
                                            )tLt    -
                                                        ()tv   (t=1,2)



where W, P     and P denote the nominal wage, the price of energy and the

price of output, respectively. Producers are assumed to maximize profits
                                         37




subject to the given real wage and the given relative price of energy. In

equilibrium the real wage and the relative price of energy are equated to

the marginal products of labor and energy, respectively.



                   Y(L,V)       w

                      aL - -

(A-   )
                   Y(L,V)   -
                            -p--

These conditions yield the demands for labor and energy inputs. The

brium real wage that clears the labor market is defined by (W/P) and L

and V denote the corresponding equilibrium levels of employment and energy

utilization. At this general equilibrium all markets clear.

          We turn now to the formal maximization problem starting with the

maximization of second period utility. Denoting by R1 (i1,2) the solution

to the producers' profit maximization problem in period i as implied by

the solutions to (A—3)—(A—), we can write the maximization problem in

period 2 as



(A—5)              max u(C2,L2)
                                                     *
          s.t.     C2 = (1+r)A1     +
                                        (—) L   +
                                                    R2




The solution to this problem yields C2 and L2 as the optimal values of

consumption and labor supply in period 2. These optimal values are condi—

tional, of course, on the historically given value of A1                 Thus, we can

define a function u(A1) which denotes the expected value of second
                                                                     The maximization
period's optimal utility. Thus, u(A1) =             E[u(C;L;)]   .



problem for period 1 can then be presented as:
                                                       38




(A-6)                     max u(C1,L1) +
                                                           u(A1)
                s.t.      C1 = Q   +                   +      — A1
                                                 L1



where Q denotes the given initial endowment. The solution to (A—6) yields

the optimal values C1 ,L1                  and A1 .            For subsequent use we note that the

optimal value of A1            is chosen so as to satisfy the first order condition

requiring that



(A-7)
                            u(A )/A1                  au(C1 ,L1 )/C1



                The value of utility in the general equilibrium is denoted by U(L1)

where it is understood that this level of utility is obtained when C1 L1

and A1 are set at their unconstrained optimal values C1 ,L1 and A1 .                            In
practice, due to contracts, the level of employment might be constrained to

     .    The resulting level of utility would be U(L1) where it is understood
L1

that C1 and A1            are still chosen optimally subject to the constraint that

the maximization of profits and the given nominal wage yield labor demand

(and therefore employment) at the level L1                             .   The welfare cost of the

constrained employment (L1 )               in   terms of first period consumption is



                               U(L1) — U(L1)
(A-8)                    —=
                         0
                           U
                                       -


where U = U(L1)-U(L1)              and where 0 =
                                                              u(C1,L1)/C1     denotes first

period's marginal utility of consumption evaluated around the general equi—

ii b r i urn.
                                                    39




         In order to obtain an expression measuring the welfare loss we first

compute the change in welfare associated with a marginal change in employ-

ment around an initial arbitrary level L .                           In   what follows we compute the

welfare cost for period 1 and we suppress the corresponding time
subscript.Using equation (A—6), the first order approximation of the change

in welfare resulting from a marginal change in employment is


                                                                                           *
(A—9)    U(LL)—U(L) = [.u(C,L)/aCiAC                         +   [au(C,L)/L)iL   +   [au       (A)/AJ.AA



Using equation (A—fl and expressing (A—9) in terms of first period

consumption yields



                   U(L+L)-U(L)                  =            - ()AL + A
(A-b)



where (W/P)5=—au(C,L)/L denotes the real wage as measured along the

supply of labor. From the definition of profits in (A—2) and the budget

constraint in (A—6) we note that

Finally, assuming a constant marginal utility of consumption (i.e. assuming

In order to obtain a more useful expression for the welfare loss we first

where     AL = L — L   ,       and where                e and n denote the elasticities of the

supply and the demand for labor. Substituting into (A—13') yields

       1This assumption is relaxed in Aizenman and Frenkel (1985) where it is
assumed (in the context of a model without energy) that the value of the
stochastic shock is not known at each point in time. In that case, behavior is
governec by the conditional expectations of the shocks based on the available
information.
       2The question concerning the efficiency of the assumed wage contract is
addressed in section 11.2, footnote 6.

by the equilibrium (non—stochastic) wage bill (W/P)0L0. For a useful discussion
of the measurement of the welfare cost see Harberger (1971).
       It is assumed that the initial contractual nominal wage is set at
the level that would have prevailed in equilibrium in the absence of shocks.
Any other initial wage would not minimize the expected value of            the   welfare
loss. In making this statement we use the approximation
           Ut ) —-
log Et_i(e         Et_. (ut). This approximation is valid for small values of the
variance and the realization of the stochastic shock u.
       5For an analysis of optimal indexation rules see Fischer (1977a, 1977b).
       6The assumption that employment is determined by the demand for labor was
challenged by Cukierman (1980) who examined alternative specifications. As is
evident with optimal policies, these issues turn inconsequential since, at the
optimum, there is an equality between the demand and the supply of labor.
Likewise, at the optimum the conceptual difficulties raised by Barro (1977)
concerning the existence of suboptimal contracts, are also inconsequential since
with optimal policies these contracts are in fact optimal. For a further
discussion and rationalization of such contracts see Hall and Lazear (1984), and
Fischer (1977b).
       7The specification in (17) constrained the coefficient of      p to be unity.
More formally let the coefficient of p in (17) be b; in that case the real
wage is w—p =   (b—i)    +   by,   and the level of output (using 6') is
y =
      1(b—1)P
                +
                    ouJ/(1+ub).       Substituting this expression into the real—wage
equation and using equation (13) reveals that in order to equate the realized
real wage with the equilibrium real wage, the coefficient of p must be unity
and the coefficient of y must be /(1+€). It is also relevant to note that
                                        44




equation (17') corresponds to equation (15) in Karni (1983, p. 286). The
precise analogy may not be apparent due to a typo-graphical error in Karril's
equation       (15).    Using Karni's notations his coefficient of indexation to real
output is /(w+ówa).
         8For    analyses   of alternative proposals see Fischer (1977a) Eden (1979)
Marston and Turnovsky (1983) and Marston (1984). For an analysis of alternative
compensation systems and for a related discussion of employment versus real wage
stabilization, see Weitzman (1983).
         91t is relevant to note that with a Cobb-Douglas production function
indexing nominal wages to nominal income is equivalent to indexing real wages to
the real    value of value added in terms of units of       final output. To verify,
define   the   real value added by Y—(P/P)V and the percentage change thereof is:
     —                                                            P/P
               (q+v).    From the first—order conditions ÀY/V =         and, therefore,
yq+v. It follows therefore that              -
                                                  y=y.   Marston and Turnovsky (1983)
argue that the rule according to        which nominal wages are indexed to the value-
added price index produces equivalent results to the rule by which real wages
are indexed to real GNP. Our analysis shows that this equivalence holds only as
long as there are no productivity shocks. Further, if the two rules are
equivalent then they will be optimal only if, in addition, €=O.
         10The implicit assumption underlying this formulation is that all
variables are stationary, i.e., that there are no trends, and that Et log
is not influenced by the observed price. Therefore, in the absence of shocks,
i=i' .     Our assumption about the absence of trend allows us to focus on the
properties of the stationary equilibrium for which the current values of the
stochastic shocks do not affet the expectations about future values of the
variables. In general, the stochastic shocks need not be identically and
independently distributed with zero mean and a fixed variance. Allowing for a
more general specification requires a modification of the definition of the
bench-mark equilibrium that is obtained in the absence of shocks. With a more
general specification of the stochastic shocks we let lower-case letters denote
an innovation of a given variable. Thus, x =         log X - Et_i log X instead of
the specification which is adopted in the text      according to which x = log X -
log   X. Obviously, in the special case discussed in the text, the assumed
properties of the stochastic shocks Imply that Et_i log X =        log X0. with this
interpretation of x (as the innovation of log Xe), the analysis can allow
for trends in the various series and the various stocks may include permanent
                                             45



and transitory components. It is also relevant to note that the specification
of equation (36) also embodies the assumption that the equilibrium is unique.
The choice of the unique equilibrium is consistent with the criterion suggested
by McCallum (1983). On the issue of uniqueness see Calvo (1970) and Turnovsky
(1983).
          11
               Relevant early references are Gordon (1975) and Phelps (1978). The
focus on the question of accommodation in the presence of supply shocks is
contained in Blinder (1981), Gordon (19814), and Fischer (1985), and various
structural issues concerning adjustment to external shocks in an international
setting are found in Bruno (19814), Bruno and Sachs (1982), Findlay and Rodriguez
(1977), and Marion and Svensson (1982).
          12
               Phelps (1978) emphasizes the implications of an income elasticity
differing from unity.
          131n the more general specification of the stochastic shocks (which was
described in footnote (10)), the term (px) in equation (37) would be replaced
by th innovation in i, +           log           which can also be expressed as

                         log P .       Thus, the innovation of this term is
i -    E log S÷ +                                                         —

      —
        Et_ii) + E            +
                                   p    where Etst+i         Et log         Et_i log S1 and
where p = log P —                      log P .     In   order to obtain this expression for the
innovation we first substitute equation (314) into the demand for money (equation
(29)), and replace i' (in equation (29')) with Et_ii . Subtracting the
resulting two equations from each other yields the more general expression
corresponding to equation (37).
          114For an analysis of nominal-income targeting see Meade (1978), Poole
(1980), Tobin (1980, 1983), Hall (1983), Bean (1983) and Taylor (1985). For
discussions of a close variant of nominal-income targeting see McCallum (19814)
and Mishkin (19814), and for other rules see Phelps and Taylor (1977).
