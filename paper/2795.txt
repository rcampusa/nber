                                          ABSTRACT




    Recent research based on variance ratios and multiperiod—return autocorrelations con-
cludes that the stock market exhibits mean reversion in the sense that a return in excess
of the average tends to be followed by partially offsetting returns in the opposite direc-
tion. Dividing history into pre—1926, 1926—46, and post—1946 subperiods, we find that the
mean—reversion phenomenon is a feature of the 1926—46 period, but not of the post-1946
period which instead exhibits persistence of returns. Evidence for pre—1926 data is mixed.
     The statisticai significance of test statistics is assessed by estimating their distribution
using stratified randomization. Autocorrelations of multiperiod returns imply a forecast
of future returns, which is presented for post—war three—year returns using 1926—46, full
sample, and sequentially updated coefficient estimates. The correlation between actual
and forecasted returns is negative in each case.
     We conclude that evidence of mean reversion in U.S. stock returns is substantially
 weaker than reported in the recent literature. If mean—reversion continues to be a feature
 of the stock market, then the experience of the past forty years has been an aberration.

1 Introduction
   A    t Lized version of eilieient ,iiarkets tlLeorv states that the seqILeIIc of holding period retiirlis on a

risky asset shouLd h serially random. A large body of etitpirical literature scented to support the t heorv
for stock prices (see Fatsia 119701 and LeRoy [1982! for surveys and discussion), finding no evidence of

serial correlation. However, a recent series of papers including those by Poterba and Summers [1987

(hereafter P&S), Lo and MacKinlay [19811, and ('lark [19871 challenge this conventional view, using the
variance-ratio methodology of Cochrane [19881. The variance ratio at lag K is defined as the ratio of the

variance of the K-period return to the variance of the one period return divided by K, and should be unity

under the random walk hypothesis. These authors find that historical variance ratios are below one at

long lags, which they interpret as evidence of long term mean-reverting behavior in stock market prices.
Cochrane showed that the variance ratio at lag K can be expressed as one plus a positively weighted sum of

the sample autocorrelations of returns from lags one through K - 1. A pattern of variance ratios declining

below unity as K increases therefore reflects negative long lag autocorrelation in returns. Evidently, a
 rise in prices is followed over time by a predictable decline. Using a closely related methodology based on

 autoregressions of multiperiod returns, Fama and French [19881 (hereafter F&F) claim to find evidence
 of mean-reversion and conclude that about 40% of the variation in stock returns is predictable from past

 returns.

       This paper questions the finding of mean-reverting behavior in stock prices reached in the recent liter-

 ature. Reexamination of the historical evidence for sample periods before and after the Great Depression

 and World War II suggests that the phenomenon identified in this literature is due primarily to that
 particular period. Post-war ratios do not in general display evidence of mean reversion. The autoregres-

 sions fitted by Fama and French have no predictive power after World War II.              In addition, measures

 of statistical significance have been based on Monte Carlo simulations assuming Normal disturbances.

 Actual stock returns are generally recognized to be non-Normal. This paper presents estimates of the

  unknown distribution of the variance ratio and multiperiod autocorrelation statistics using the random-
  ization method. The results suggest that historical variance ratios are not outside the range expected

Section 3 discusses the randomization method for approximating the unknown sampling distribution of

the test statistic and its exact significance level and present empirical results for the annual real SkP
series. We also investigate the effect of the large variance of stock market returns in 1930s by introducing

the idea of stratified randomization. Section 4 considers the alternative but closely related test for mean-

reversion proposed by Fania and French [1988] based on predictability of inultiperiod returns. We find
that their apparent finding that returns are predictable is also attributable to the Depression-World Var

H era. Post-war prediction tests fail to reveal evidence of predictability. Section 3 concludes the paper.


2     Variance Ratios and Choice of Sample Period
    The variance ratio test is motivated by the notion that if the underlying data generating process for
stock returns is serially random with constant variance, then the variance of the return over K periods

is simply Ka2 , where a2 is the variance of the one period return. Therefore, the simplest version of
variance ratio test calculates the statistic

                                                                           1
                                                                                                                   (1)
                                                                var(rt)
where r1 is the one period return,           =         r5_1 and K is measured in years. The null hypothesis of a

random walk is rejected if this statistic is significantly different from unity. Cochrane [1988] shows that

VR(K) can be approximated by


                                           VR(K)       1 +2 (K—iU(.)                                               (2)

Dividing by this quantity provides a bias correction for the sample variance ratio. For monthly returns
series, the variance ratio is expressed in terms of the variance of the 12K-month return relative to the

variation over one-year, as in Poterba and Summers [1987[. FoLlowing P&S we have

                          VR(k) =        var(r)/k
                                                                                                                (4)

where r =          r_ and (j) jth sample autocorrelarion of monthly returns. P&S derive the expected
value of VR(k) in (5) which provides a bias correction for monthly data.

   For the annual historical data we use two standard data sets based on the Standard and Poor's

Composite Index. One is the December closing value used by P&S which is available from 1871 from
Wilson and Jones [19871 and Ibbotson [19871 with adjustment for inflation in real returns based on the

CPI. The second is the January average value since 1872 using the PPI as the deflator as in Shiller
                                                                                                    [1981,
updated by Shiller and ourselves through 1986. The           estimated variance ratios over different sample
periods for the two annual S&P series using formula (1) with bias correction (3) are reported in Tables

1 and 2 respectively. Our primary concern in this section is the effect of the choice of sample period on

the results. The breaking points are 1926, which coincides with the starting date for the monthly data

sets also used by P&S and by F&F, and 1947 which separates the period including the Great Depression
and World War II from the post-war era.

   The first three columns of Tables 1 and 2 are full sample variance ratios for nominal, real and excess

returns. Our comments will focus on real and excess returns which are of greater economic interest than

    For the subsasnpte period prior to 1926, the December closing returns display istean reversion for
both real and excess returns. For the Shiller data this is the case only for excess returns, since VR's for

real returns rensain around one. During the subsampte period 1926- 1946 att versions of the VR decline
sharply, though more so for the December closing data.


    The post-war period starting in 1947 produces very different results, however. None of the six returns

series in Tables 1 and 2 show evidence of mean-reversion at lags over five years. and then ttiost notably

for nominal returns. VR's for longer lags rise to about two for nominal returns and to about three for
real and excess returns. It is clear that VR's below one for the whole history result front mixing the

very low values prior to 1947, particularly the 1926-46 period, with high values after World War II. If
mean-reversion continues to be a feature of the stock market, then the experience of the last forty years
has been an aberration.


   The next set of data we consider is CRSP monthly NYSE total returns, both equal- and value-weighted,

which is available from 1926. The one-month T-bill rate and the CPI for all urban consumers (not
seasonally adjusted) from Ibbotson Associates are used to calculate excess and real returns
                                                                                                      respectively.
Table 3 shows the variance ratios calculated using the P&S formula (4) for sample periods 1926-86, 1926-

46, and 1947-86. For the whole period, all of the return series show declining variance ratios.
                                                                                                             Using
the Monte Carlo standard errors reported by P&S for series of length 720, one would conclude that VR

is marginally significantly below unity at longer lags, particularly for the equal-weighted portfolio. The

returns at low lags, but nominal, real and excess return VR's all rise with lag until      at lag len years are
well above one as in the annual data. Corresponding results excluding dividends are not reported here

but are very sintilar.


    One way to summarize the CRSP results is that the patterns are reversed when we compare the
1926-1946 period with the post-war period. During the earlier period VR's start above one at low lags

and decline with increasing lag, while during the later period VR's are below one at low lags and then

rise to well above one at long lags. In general, what evidence there is for mean reversion is stronger for

equal-weighted returns than for value-weighted, as reported in previous studies.


3    Estimating Significance Levels for Variance Ratios

    Since the small sample distribution of VR's has not been derived analytically, the existing literature

reports standard errors estimated by Monte Carlo methods under the assumption of normality, or using

Bartlett's formula through Cochrane's approximation to the yR. Cochrane i9S8 presents standard
errors from a Monte Carlo experiment using 100 observations of random walk with drift in his study of

annual per capita real GNP series for    the period 1869 - 1986. Drawing innovation errors from a standard
normal distribution, he concludes that Bartlett's standard error only slightly understates the Monte Carlo

standard errors at long lag and thus can be used as an approximation. P&S report Monte Carlo estimates

of the standard deviation of VR under the normality assumption. In their test for mean reversion, F&F

also draw innovation errors from a standard normal distribution. However, they also perform a Monte
Carlo experiment where, in each replication, they simulate a heteroscedastic random walk that changes

the standard deviation of the white.noise returns every 2 years to approximate variation through time in

historical stock return variances. What all of these amount to is making implicit or explicit assumptions
about the distribution of stock returns in order to assess the significance of test statistics. The non-

    Both I lie hoot strap and randouuuization (or shuffling) methods are appropriate when the population

sample statistics. The question addressed by the bootstrap method is, as is stated in Efron [1979], given

a random sample x = (x1, 12,           . ,r.) front an unknown probability distribution F, est iuuiate the sauti ph ng

distribution of sonic prespecified random variable R(x, F), on the basis of the observed data x. Namely, tie

proceed as if the sample is the population for purposes of estimating the sampling distribution of the test

statistic, R(x, F). Randomization differs front bootstrapping in that it addresses the question of whether
or not there is a relationship between variables, regardless of the nature of stochastic disturbances.
The idea of randomization tests appeared in the literature as early as Fisher, R. A. [1935[. Noreen
[1986] provides a clear and practical exposition of Monte Carlo, bootstrap and randomization methods.

Randomization focuses on the null hypothesis that one variable is distributed independently of another.

In the present context the null hypothesis is that returns are distributed independently of their ordering

in time. Randomization shuffles the data to destroy any time dependence and then recalculates the lest

statistic for each reshuffling to estimate its distribution under the null.


    The advantage of this approach over Monte Carlo is that the null hypothesis is very simple since no

assumptions are made concerning the distribution of stock prices. Furthermore, as Noreen [1986] points

out, the data do not have to be a random sample from some specific population distribution function.

The practical difference between randomization and bootstrap is that in the latter method we sample the

data with replacement.t


    Randomization estimates of the distribution of VR(K) for the real return based on the S&P Composite

index 1871-1987 are reported in Table 4. Note that this is the series that seems to show most evidence
   LFOE results reported below we randomize the order of the differenced series 1000 times. Specifically, each tune we generate the
random numbers bounded from I to T . 1 using GAUSS and pick up the corresponding row from the original return series.             lit
bootstrapping same row may appear more than once, though with small probability.



                                                                 6

as well as Bartlett's approximation of SD, SOB for colilparison. Also re1,orted are the lower fractiles of
the distribution and estimated significance levels, the probability that the variance ratios from a random

sample is less than the historical value. Estimated means confirm that the correction for bias works
reasonably well. The fact that medians are below means reflects the positive skewness of the sampling

distribution of VR( 17) that is evident in the histogram shown in Figure 5 against a reference normal

distribution. This suggests that critical values based on fractiles and corresponding significance levels

may differ importantly from those based on standard errors under a t-distribution approximation for yR.

    Bartlett's approximation 5DB for the standard deviation closely approximates the estimated SD at

short horizons, but understates the dispersion of VR by an amount that increases with lag. At lag 15
years. SD and SDB are 0.410 and 0.286, respectively, and the discrepancy widens to .646 and .177 at

lag 29. Since evidence of mean reversion rests on long lag VRs. understatement of sampling error as lag

increases would seem to be a critical shortcoming of Bartlett's formula.

    The last column of Table 5 gives the estimated significance level of VR, the probability of observing

a VR as small as that observed in the historical data under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.
It is only for lags of twenty three years or longer that significance levels fall below 10%. Note that
these significance levels based on estimated fractiles are smaller than would be the case if we assumed a

normal distribution for VEt with the estimated standard deviation, and much larger than ones based on

Bartlett's formula. P&S argue that " ... unless one is strongly attached to the random walk hypothesis.

significance levels in excess of .05 seem appropriate in evaluating the importance of transitory components

in stock prices," and furthermore suggest that for the variance ratio test, a "40 % " significance level
is appropriate if the goal is to minimize the sum of Type I and Type II errors. This criterion would
 reject the random returns hypothesis for any lag. Under more conventional significance criteria we would

 reject only if we had chosen to base the test on the longest lags. We note that results across lags are not

 independent and we do not have a portmanteau statistic one which to base a joint test. Bootstrapping

errors are, of course, larger for this shorter sample period. The es intat ed sigiti ficance level of the historical

VR is below P&S's 40% at lags below ten years and over 25 years. The smallest value is 19% and most are

around 50%. Unless one is strongly inclined to find a transitory component in stock prices, these results

offer little encouragement to that hypothesis relative to the random returns hypothesis. More generally,

they reiterate the point that finding declining variance ratios in stock returns does not. necessarily iiiiply

strong evidence against the random walk hypothesis. Bootstrapping again produces very similar results.

We do not do the test for the post-war period which the reader will recall showed no evidence of issean

reversion, but instead rising VR's.


    As the investigation of historical variance ratios in section 2 suggests, fast declining variance ratios

for the 1926 - 1946 period seems to account for much of the overall slowly decaying variance ratios for

the whole historical sample period. A number of studies such as Officer [1973 and more recently Schwert

[1988] have documented the much higher variance of stock prices during the 1930s. Studying market-

factor variability over the period of 1897 to 1969. Schwert finds the decline of the variability of returns

 after 1930s is a return to levels prevailing before the Great Depression. Since the inclusion or exclusion of

 the Depression years gives rise to differing results it is natural to think of controlling for sampling period

 by using stratified randomization. Since one may reasonably suspect that stock returns in 1930s were
 drawn from an unknown distribution with higher variance, the distribution of the test statistic could
 be generated under the null hypothesis that within a given state of the world (the high variance state

 or the relatively low variance state) returns are stochastically independent. This is the same as putting

 historical returns into two different urns, depending upon whether they come from the 1930s or not, and

 shuffle independently to preserve the high variance property during 1930s in the randomization test.


     Table 6 reports stratified randomization estimates of the sampling distribution of the VR for real S&P

 annual returns based on December closing for the 1871 to 1987 period. We put each historical return into

variance. Skewness in the sampling distribution of VR is apparent in the histogram of VR( 19) in Figure

6. We have included longer lags in this experiment to see if the decline in significance levels with lag seen

in Table 4 continues, and it does not.


    What can we say at this point about the weight of evidence against the random return hypothesis and

in favor of mean reversion in the stock- market based on the annual data? We have estimated the exact

significance levels for the set of historical yR's that are most favorable to the mean reversion alternative.

namely real returns for the December closing S&P. Recall that VR's for the Shiller real returns do not

drop below one until lags exceeding 1.5 years. VR's for excess returns from both data sets rise with lag

to well above one (see Tables 1 and 2). We cannot assess the joint significance of VR's across a range of

lags but only at a particular lag. If one came to the data with the expectation of finding evidence against

randomness at lags in excess of twenty years. there is some if we include dat-a prior to 1926 but not for

the period 1926-87.


4     Evidence of Mean-Reversion Based on Autoregression of Multiperiod
      Returns
    A close relative of variance ratios is the regression coefficient calculated by Fama and French [1987,

1988] and Fama [1988]. They regress the cumulative return from period t+1 to period t-.-K on the return
from t-K+1 to t, so their estimating equation is



                                            TK,+K    = K + 3,C rKm + c,ts.,                                                 (6)
The OLS estimate of /3K is closely related to the VR since

3 is (listribitted around zero with negative values indicating mean reversion.

   F& F show that 3 is an estimate oft lie fraction of the variance of the K period return that is attribntahle

to, and predictable front, a transitory component stock prices. Following Hansen and Ilodrick [1980
they provide standard errors for the O[.S slope winch reflects the autocorrelation in residuals induced by

overlapping observations. They also adjust for bias estinsated by Monte Carlo simulation. F&F report
strong evidence of mean-reversion at return horizons of three to five years in the monthly CRSP data.

where 25% to 40% of the return is predictable from past returns.

    Table 7 replicates some of the F&F results for the CRSP data L926-86 for real and excess returns

on the equal-weighted and value-weighted NYSE portfolios. Estimates of bias (based on Monte Carlo)

and standard errors (based on Hansen and Hodrick [1980](hereafter H&H) ford from F&F appear in the

lower panel. Even allowing for downward bias, 3 appears to be highly significant at lags of three to five
years for equal- and value-weighted portfolios in real and excess return forms. The 3 estimate is also

calculated for sub-samples 1926-46 (the Great Depression and World War II) and 1947-86. As in the Vii

results it is the 1926-46 period which accounts for the evidence of mean-reversion. While .8 is a large

negative value in every case for the 1926-46 data, it is positive in most cases for the post-war data and

particularly so at the three to five year lags on which F&F base their conclusions.


    The randomization technique is used here to investigate the sampling distribution of the .3 statistic for

the equal-weighted and value-weighted CRSP portfolios 1926-86. The null hypothesis to be tested is that

 returns are drawn independently regardless of the underlying distribution. We first run the regression

 using OLS. Second, we randomize the original return series and construct the new K-year holding period

 returns and run OLS again. Third, to estimate the sampling distribution of the coefficient we repeat the

 procedure many times.

7. Estimated significance levels are as sinai! as 2.8% (at lag 4 years), hut exceed 30% at all but lags two

through five years. Again, we lack a measure of joint significance across lags. Unlike the case of yR's. we

get similar significance levels if we use the estimated bias and SD to calculate a t-statistic. as shown in

the first two lines of the bottom panel of Table 8. The last two lines show that much smaller significance

levels are implied (incorrectly) by H&H SD.

   Corresponding randomization results are reported in Table 9 for the real returns on the value-weighted

NYSE portfolio. Recall   that the evidence of mean reversion was weaker for value-weighted portfolios, with
bias-corrected 3s only about one standard deviation from zero. Significance levels based on randomization

are only as low as about 10% at lags two and three years and range as high as about 60% at lags five and

six. Again, we have no basis for combining significance levels across lags. It seems clear however that to

find evidence of mean reversion in the value-weighted returns would require a prior choice of particular

lags for the test. Finally, we note here that the obvious advantage of the randomization method in this

case is simplicity. MI we need to do is to run OLS. not worrying about the method of adjustment of
standard deviations such as the one of H&I-l which evidently produces SD's which are much too small,

leading to incorrect inferences of significance.


    Stratified randomization can again be used to allow for a change in the distribution of returns during

the 1930's. The results for equal-weighted NYSE portfolio returns, those most favorable to mean reversion,

are shown in Table 10. Comparing significance levels with those in Table 8, Stratification has the effect of

raising them at all lags. At lags two through five where p-values were well below 10% in Table 8, they are

roughly tripled. Stratification of the sample therefore substantially weakens evidence for mean-reversion,

even in the case of equal-weighted returns.


    The F&F approach lends itself directly to post-sample testing since it provides a predictive relation

86, those which gave tlte hest fit after the fact. The correlation is again - 0.08. To sittiulate real-time
forecasting we also forecasted ahead each month based on coefficients estimated up through that point in

time and the results are plotted in Figure 8 for both equal-weighted and value-weighted portfolios. The

plots suggest little relation between actuals and predictions, indeed the correlations are -A and - LOS

respectively.


    One way to interpret the failure of post-war prediction is that it confirms the fact that evidence of
mean-reversion comes from the pre-war period. One sees the waning evidence of mean-reversion in the

sequential estimates of the 3s for K = 3 plotted in Figure 9 through the post-war period. The value-
weighted 3 starts out about .65, loses a third of its value when the predicted market decline fails to occur

in the 1950s, loses another third in the mid-1970's when the predicted rise fails to occur, and ends up at

about .3. The equal-weighted 3 makes a fairly discrete jump toward zero in the inid-1970's as well.


S    Conclusion

    This paper reappraises the evidence of mean reversion in stock market prices provided by the variance

ratio and related tests presented in a number of recent papers. Specifically, the variance ratio, which is

theoretically one at any lag under the null hypothesis of a random walk, declines to below one at long

lags in historical time series. This has been interpreted as an indication of long-term mean-reverting

behavior in the stock market. Further it has been argued that 25 to 40 percent of the variation of 3 to
5 year holding-period stock returns is predictable from past returns, and that this is to be explained by

the existence of a slowly decaying stationary component in stock prices. The purpose of this paper is to

challenge this view, based on re-examination of the evidence from different sub-periods and measures of

when the stock market was highly volatile, plunging several t iiiies and then recovering. Mean-reversion

has not been a feature of the post-war era. On the contrary, post-War data displays, if anything, a
tendency towards persistence in returns reflected in variance ratios that rise substantially above one at

long lags and in positive multiyear autoregression coefficients.

    The randomization method is used to develop significance levels for test statistics which are free of

distributional assumptions. There are several advantages to this computer-intensive method over Monte

Carlo methods. Most important, it does not require that we pretend to know the underlying unknown
distribution of stock market returns, but rather it focuses on testing the null hypothesis of randomness.

Randomization is easy to execute and allows estimation of small sample distributions of test statistics

which are often difficult to derive analytically. To isolate the effect of higher stock market volatility
in the 1930's on the tests, we introduce a stratified randomization method which essentially puts those

observations in a separate urn.

    Stratified randomization of annual real total returns on the S&P Composite Index since 1871 suggests

 that significance levels are in the range of 20 to 30% for individual lags up to 20 years, and around
 10% for lags of 25 years and longer. For monthly returns 1926-1986 we randomize to estimate the
 distribution of the multiperiod return autoregression coefficient. We obtain significance level as low as

 3% for equal-weighted portfolios of NYSE stocks and 9% for value-weighted portfolios at a lag of three

 years, but significance levels are as high as 70% at longer lags. Further, stratification of the sample raises

 significance levels to 9% at best even for equal-weighted returns. In general we find that standard errors

 reported in previous studies based on other methods would imply much stronger significance.

     To sum up, while evidence of mean-reversion arises only from pre-Worid War 11 data, the magnitude

 of test statistics for larger sample periods is not readily dismissed purely as the result of chance. On the

 other hand, to build a strong case for mean-reversion one would have to argue the choice of particular data

Note:
1. Variance ratios are estimated using sample variance ratio formula (4) for monthly returns. To correct the downward-bias
the sample variance ratio is divided by the expected value of VR(k) given by Porterba and Summers [l98fl.
2. Monte CaIro standard errors are reported in parentheses from P&S for T = 720, namely for 1926-1985.

                                                 Data Dosetiptiori




     1. SItiller's January average (1872 - 1986):          Annual   total return for 1872 - 1986 period is derived
from S&P 500 January average from hiller 1981], revised and updated and deflated by PPI. For example.

continuously corsipounded real ret urn ( r   )   is derived from, r,    In (1   r, )     lo(p, ip, —   1,   /p, — ) where
     = real January S&P   500 at time   t and d, = nominal dividend paid during t.inie t divided by average

PPI at t. Pre-1925 excess returns are derived using corisinercial paper rate (CP) reported in Cordon
t19861 and one-month TB rate in Ibbotson Associates' Yearbook 1987[ for post-1926 period.


     2. December closing (1871 - 1987): Nominal total return (Re) for Decensber Closing S&P 500
is adopted from Ibbotson [19871 extended with Wilson Jones f19871.                 It   is adjusted for the inflation

rate of CPI   to derive real return (r,), i.e.. r =     (1 + R,)/(1      r) — 1.       For excess returns (Er). E =


(1     R,)/(1 + TB,) — 1 where TB, = annual T-bill rate extended with CP rate for pre.1925 period.

     3. Monthly NYSE returns (1926.1 - 1986.12): Both equal- and value-weighted, including and
excluding dividends, all NYSE stock returns are obtained from CRSP return files. To derive both real

and excess returns we use the same formula as those used for December closing. CPI inflation rate and

one month TB rate for 1926 - 1987 period are taken from the Ibbotson [1987[. All monthly returns are

continuously compounded, e.g, Ft = In(1 + r,).
