                    A given amount   of seigniorage revenue can be coflected at either

         a high or a low rate of inflati on. Thus there may be two equilibri

         when a governme nt finances its      deficit   by printing mo ney——imp lying that

         an economy may be stuck n a hi gh in4latiori equilibri urn              when, with    the

         same fiscal poi icy, it could be at a lower inflation            rate.
                    We show that under rati onal expectations the hioh ir,4 1 at ion

         equilibrium is stable arid the 1 ow inflation equilibr iurn urista ble; under

         adaptive expect ations or lagged adjustment of money           b a 1   a rices W2th

         rational expectations, it may be the low inflation equilibrium that is

         stable.

                   Extendng the model to allow       f or    bond as wel' as money fnancing

         of    deficits, we show that one of the equi libria disappears if the

         gov ornrnent sets a nominal   anchor for    the etciriomy,   4cr instne hy
         the    growth rate of money. The dual      equi 1   ibria and their stability

             SEIGNIORAGE, OPERATING RULES AND THE HIGH INFLATION TRAP.


                              Mi chael Bruno and Stanley        H scher .


              A given amount of seign iorage revenue can b e collected at either

a high or           a   low rate of inflati on.         Thus as Sargent and Wallace (1981,

1987) and Liviatan (1984) have shown, there may be two equilibria when a

go v err, men   t finances its deficit by printing money.                The dual

equi I ibri     a——a reflection of the Laffer curve——imply that an economy may

be stuck in a high inflation eq uilibrium when, with the same fiscal

policy   ¶    it could be at a lower inflation rate.?

              In this paper we first demonstrate the exis tence                   of the dual
equi 1 i b ru           in a simple model in which money is the only            source of

deficit financing. We show that under rati onal expectat ions                           the high
inflati on equilibrium is stable and the low inflation eq ui                       1   ibrium


unstabi e; under adapative expectations i t ma y be the low in 41 ati on

equilib rium that is stable.3 We then cx tend the model t oa how
                                                                 for the


possibi lity of bond financing of deficit s an d                   show that    one of     the

equilibria disappears                if the gov ernment sets a nominal a nch or           for the
economy,        4   or instance      by   4iing   the   gro wtn r ate of money.        The existence

of dual eq          uilibria is      thus a result of the       operati ng   rules the

g over n men t          chooses   for monetary and fiscal      Oi icy.

                The possibility of dual equilibria under pure money financing of

the defl cit is known from the work cited above.               Auernheimer (1973),

Evans and Varrow (1981), and Escude (1985) have shown that the high

inflation equilibrium may be stable if expectat ions adjust rapidly. The

contribution of this paper lies in its expositi on of the properties of

the dual equilibria——which appear to remain rd atively little known——arid

in the ettension to bond + inancing.

                Iii this section we in troduce the basic money—only model, the

properti es of which have been examined by Evan s and Varrow (1981) and

Sargent and Wallace (198 7)'               Output (V) is at the full employment level,

                The demand for h i gh—p owered money (H) is assumed to be of the

semi—logarithmic (Cagan) form with unitary in come elasticity:4,



(1) H!PY =         h   =




4This is an empirically relevant specification: its essential property for
this paper is that seigniorage revenue first increases and then decreases
with correctly anticipated inflation.

5We   iplictly assi.une (2) that the deficit s invariant to the inlatiori
rate, thereby omitting the well—known Clivera—Tanzi effect whereby higher
inflation increases the deficit. The basic results are unaffected by the
inclusion of this effect.

          The steady state relationship (5) is shown a the 45 line in

Figure 1, with intercept on the horizontal ai; equal to n. Two

potential steady state equilibria are shown in Figure 1, the lo

inflation equilibrium at 4 and the high inflation (B) equilibrium. The

dual equilibria are a reflection of the Laffer curves the same amount D4

inflation revenue may be obtained at either a low or a high inflation

rate.

          Depending on the   size   of the def icit         the government wishes to

finance, there may be zero, one, or two equilibria. Becau;s the

government cannot obtain more th an          0       in steady state, there is no

steady state if d > d*. For 0 <                   0* there are two steady st ates'.

For d     d*, and for 0 < 0, there     is'       a un ique steady state.

               The existence of   two steady state equilibria in the case

O(d<           d* suggests that an economy may find itself at a higher than

necessa ry inflation rate over long periods. An economy with a given

budget deficit may find itself at the high inflation equilibrium B,

r at her   than it the low i nfl ati on       steadte 4.   Whether this is likely

depends on the stability          of    the respective equilibrium points.

The adaptive expectations assumption makes most sense in conditi ons in

which there are no reliable data. or the government budget deficit or

money growth1 which is not unusual in countries with high in4iat on

rates and poorly developed statistical systems. Alternatively,

individuals may form expectations adaptively when the governments

policy and data announcements command very little credibility.

for real balances increases, and the government can print money less

rapidly. The economy              move; gradually from D to B.
              There is no very good intuitive ex planation for the in              itial fall
in the inflation rate. Siven that the economy                    is on the wrong side a
the La er curve, a decline in the inflati on                   rate is needed to generate
more r evenue when the deficit rise;. That                   is why the economy    ia;   to end
at B'.        For it to move in that direction f rem            B, given the exp ec tat ions
adju;t merit        equation (9), the    inflation    rat   e has to start falli nq.       Tha.t

is   eas y to see.           Less easy to see though i s the process by whi ch the

rapid       a&iustment of expectations ensures           stable adjustment towards

equilibrium.              We return to this issue     when we examine adjustment under

rati end      expectati on;.
Rational       Expectations.

              In   most respect; the case of rational expect ati on s, or p€:rfect
foresight          can be represented a; the      limiting case when 1      —     or

Usually point               would be identified as the rational expect at i or;

tie right of    A converges to point B.                   F oi n t   B is thus a st able   rational
expectation;    equilibrium.           Without a      learn i        ng process, or some   other

means of generating         dynanii   cs, there i s        no c lear princi pie     by which one

equilibrium is to be chosen over anot her.

        Ihe one resp ect in which the rati onal expectations equilibrium

is not the limiting case of adaptive                  e x p e c tat i   on; is that of the initial

condition. The adap bye expectations                      for mul at ion    does not allow r       to

jump, whereas under rational expectat ions it i s assumed that the economy

can move discretely from one equilibr ium to th e next. For instance

under rationa 1   expec tations            there is   no reason the economy could not

move from A t 0 4 at once.

chircet end Sargent lE7) use a i east squares learning mechari mm to 4cr
expectations of next perods price level in a model with a money demand
function similar to that of Cagan, (See DeCanio lcT9) for a particularly
clear example of the use of least squares learning). They show that the low
inflation equilibrium is stable for a range of initial expected inflation
rates; for higher initial expected inflation rates there is no equilibrium
with learning, even in conditions where the higher rational expectations
equilibrium is stable, The results may be interpeted in light of the
property that the least squares predictor of the inflation rate is always
less than the maximum inflation rate observed so far. The generality of
their results is not clear , for their money demand function unlike Cagan 's
permits real balances and seigniorage revenue to go negative, properties on
which their proofs depend.

Comp ara tive   Dynamics-
            Returning to the adaptive expectations case, we exanit e the

effects of changes in several empirically relevant variables.                       For

purposes of the discussion, we assume the economy is initially in the

low inflation equilibrium.

            A fall in the exogenous growth rate1 n, for instance due to a

productivity slowdown, shows in the figure as a leftward shift of the

45Q line. This ha; the same qualitative effect as a rise in d.                         A fall

in the growth rate of output implies that the government has to

accelerate the printing of money if it desires to continue extracting

the same relative real resources from seigniorage.'t

        One interesting aspect of this relationship is that a 17. change

in the growth rate of output implies a            greater than 17.   increase in the

inflation rat e.       Th e result is that




(11)    dii/dn     —    (1—o8V1



Accordingly seemingly small changes in the growth rate of output may be
associated with jar ge changes in the inflation rate.
        A second ty pe of dist urbance is a downward shift in the demand
function for base money, for example as a result of the introduction of
new financial asset       that is a   close money substitute.12 From equation

(3) we see that 8 =       d/h,   and thus a fall in h (for given ,r) has the

same effect as a ri se in d, s hiftirig the GB curve rightward.

        Finally, we note that the model can be extended to the case in

which output supply is variabl e. Suppose we have a Lucas—type output

supply function:'3

12Here again the Israeli case of the introduction of dollar linked liquid
bank deposits (Patam) after 1977 may serve as a good example, Another, but
probably less relevant, historical case is Hungary after World War II
(Bomberger and tlakinen, 1983).
'3This can be obtained from an ordinary short—run supply function
YY(W/P,K) , translated into rates of change, and writing the change in the
nominal wage as a function of expected inflation. The supply function can
also be e<tended to include raw material inputs.

where P is the actual and                  P       the expected price level. Then,

differentiating with respect to time, we obtain

Substituting (13) into (4), and using (8):

The fact that output supply is positively affected by a rise in

unanticipated inflation (,—r) has a stabilizing effect on the model

enhancing the likelihood                that       A is a stable equilibrium, with the

stability condition now requiri ng (1+—mp) > 0.                       The sta bi   liz i ng


influence arises from the fact that an increase in the i nflation rate

calls forth an increase in the demand for money as the I evel of output

rise;.

Lag g e d A


              An alternative source of dynamics is lagged adjustment                      of reel
bal ances.       Specifically, assume that real balances are adjusted

according to:



(14)          (HIP',') =       !((H/Pv)*       —   (H/PY))



where (H/PY)* indicates desired real balances, given by the demand

function (11.14


'4Note that this form of adjustment function implicitly assumes that nominal
balances adjust one—for—one with the price level and output, but adjust only
partially in response to difference; between the desired and actual ratios
of real balances to output.

                Assuming rational expectations              and imposing the government

          In Figure 2(a) we assume that iT is below the inflation rate ,,

at the low inflation equilibrium.       In this case A is a stable

equilibrium and B unstable.      In Fig ure 2(b) it' is between the inflation

rates at the high and low equilibri a.1        Once again the low inflation

equilibrium is stable, and the high inflation equilibrium unstable.

         Consider now an increase in the defic it. The iow inflation

equilibrium moves from A to A'.      On impact, w ith real balances the state

variable, the economy moves in each figure to point C.       In Figure 2(a)

the inflation rate jumps, and then gradually r ises to its new higher

steady state level, with real balan ces falling in the process.      In


Figure 2(b) the increase in the deficit raises the inflation rate

initially, but it then falls as the economy moves to the new

equilibrium.

The dynamic res ults typically make sense when adjustment——of either

expectations or money balances                    or       indeed other nominal variables——is

slow, and seem counter intuitiv e wh en adjustment is fast. This is

because intuiti on relates to g cods market behavi or: an increase in the

growth rate of money increases dem and and theref ore inflation. But

there is always in monetary niod ci; another sourc e of dynamics, most

clearly seen in the no adju;tme nt lag, rational expectations model: that

analysis of the Ricardian equivalence case.

obtained if consumption were explicitly a function of permanent income
which, with income exogenous, is a declining function of the real interest

Steady States and the Nominal Anchor.

           Using Figures 4 and       we examine th e steady state results of

three possible deficit financi ng policies.         Suppose first that the

govern ment f i   xes the real interest rate, at r*. This corresponds to a

p01 icy in wh   ich   monetary policy is used    to maintain the   real   interest
rate.    Opera tion ally, the Treasury    sell; whatever   amount of bonds it can

at mt er est    rate r* and leaves res idual financing to the central bank.

A;   in Sect i on I, there are dual——i ow—   and high—inflation——equilibria, at

A and B.

           Alternatively, the central bank can fix the growth rate of money

and leave the Treasury to finance the remainder of the deficit by bond

sales. Fixing the gro wth rate at $* results in a unique equilibrium at

C, with inflat ion rate equal to e*—n.24          This is a situation In which

there is stric t control over the nominal amount of credit the central

bank provides the Treasury, which has to borrow to finance any extra

need;.

           Finally, the central     bank could keep the    ronal    iriteret rate

constant. Ihus steady states lie along the line with slope o —4° on

which (,T+r) is       constant.   In Figure 4, there is only one possible

equilibrium with a constant nominal interest rate, at point E. That

result certainly holds for          = Q,6 i.e.    when wealth is constant, and


-A; in the money—only model, the deficit may be too large to be {inaced at

              An increase in the nominal interest rate i ncreases the ratio of

money to bonds                 This raises the 1 ow equilibrium i nflation rate in

Figure 4, but reduces it in Figure                         5.        Figure 4 th us confirms the now

common re suit that bon d financing of deficits is i nflationary; the

Figure 5 resu 1 t is an exception to this rule.

              There       r e ma   in 5       the question of the dynamic stability of the

economy un der t he alte rnative poli cy choices. Rel ative to the money

only model            the model               with bonds i ncludes an extra source of potential

instabilit y thr ough th e effects of rising interest payments associated

with bond          1 i nat   cc.        It contains a potential stabili zing            force in the

effects       of    the      i nteres t rate on sa vi ng




              We shal 1 in each case examine dynamic behavior under                           the

assumpti ons of rational and adaptive expectations. We                                  start with   the

c on stan t    real i nterest rate rule.

Constant Real I nterest                        Rate: Under rati onal expect ations         there can be

no dynasni Cs if             the real           interest rate is pegged.        B ien   the level of

wealth—'-d etermi ned               by the real interest rate——there              are only two

inflation rates               consistent with the government budg et                deficit.27       The

reason this case differs fr om the rational expectat ions money onl y model

is that there was in that c ase no off setti ng change in bcir'ds when real

balances change.


27Under       the assumption of constant wealth, the budget constraint becomes
                                    d     4    (r—n)v, which is satisfied by at most two inflation
rates.
                                          22




          Under adaptive expectations, dynamics are again quite simple.

Figure 6 illustrates. With constant wealth the budget constraint is the

same as the steady state constraint (17)" except that it and r      may

differ.    Thus



(17)''    (it+r) exp(-or)v = d + (r—n)v



The 66 curve in (,r,r) space thus intersects the 45° line is a hown, with

at most two equilibria (as is impl ied also in Figures. 4 arid 5)    with the

lower inflation equilibrium stable and the upper equilibrium u nstabl e,

          An increase in the deficit reduces wealth (rom (21)).      Un dot


the assumptions represented in Fig ure 4 the higher deficit moves the 99

curve down, shifting the two equil ibria from A to 4' and B to B'

respectively. A policy decision to increase the real interest r ate has

a similar effect. But recall the assumption that an increase in the

interest rate on balance requires an increase in inflation reven uc to

maintain budget balance.    If savin g is highly interest elastic, it is

possible that an increase n the r eal interest rate could shift the 66

curve up, reducing the equilibrium low inflation rate.29

          An increase in the deficit results in an immediate increase in

the inflation rate as the rate of money growth rises, and t hen in a

continuing rise in both actual and expected inflation.


20in this case the DD curve is U—shaped as in Figure 5.

         A downward shift in the demand for money function will in                                         t hi   s

case result       in a higher in flation rate around the low inflation

equilibrium. Given wealth                  the shift            from money is also a shif t into

bonds, thereby implying an increase in the interest bill faced by the

government1 and thus relat lye to the money—only model                                ,    a   lar ger   I rr ease

in the inflation rate.

C on st ant Mone Sr o wth          With c onstant money growth and rational

expectations dynamics are tot ally unstable unless interest rate eects

on saving and thus weal th are large. We now write the budget constraint

in the form




(23)      d   +   (r—n)b       $h + v — h




          To see the role of r,terest                      rate          e+4ects on wealth, consider

first setting         =    0, so that wealth is determined in the goods market

and is   i ndependent         of the interest rate. Then setting v                               0 in (23)

        When interest rate effects on saving are included, v in (23) is

no ion ger zero. Instead, with rati onal expectations, dynamics in the

model are described by two equations:




(25)    r/r      (d/v) 4   (r—n)   —   (,i+r)   exp(—odi+r))


(26)           +,—8 +



Examining local stability conditions, the trace of the

matrix is    positive. The characteristic determinant                     is given by




(27)    Det.      (v)_1Erb+rih.d3


This is negative if the     DD    curve is U shaped as in Figure                    , in   which

case there can be a saddle point approach to             eq u i 1 i b r i Lt   m.   Otherwise the

equilibrium is an unstable        + ocus.

III. Concluding Comments.



               The possibility of dual equilibria in inflationary economies

raises the possibilit y that an economy may find itsel + stuck at a high

i ni lati   or equilibrium when,            with   the same fiscal     p01 i C         a 1 ow inflation

equilibrium is attairabie. Such dual equi I ibria are                          a   resul t o+ the

failure to adopt a nominal anohor for the ec onom                            and   4'...—

prevented by a chan ge in policy operating rules.

nature of the equilibria and     dynamic proper ties of the model ire seen to

rational expectations and rap idly adaptive expectations

         The dual equilibrium problem can be avoided b y a policy                         t h at



fixes the growth rate of money.          In that case, stability of the

equilibrium becomes more prob lematic than it i s              with altern ative
policies, and depends on the interest elastici ty               of saving       as well

         The model can also be extend ed               to the open economy. Assume that
the sole sources of budget deficit 4 irance               are morey printing and
foreign borrowing. The fundamental dual equilibrium result remains                                 if
the government attempts to 4:x         the   r   cal   exchange rate, and d appa&-r a                   :4

by monetary policy. In such cases,               the rational expectations
equilibrium is saddle point stable,              while the inflationary process iS
stable under a fixed nominal rate of              cEchange depreciation with slow
adaptive expectations. Similar resul ts                obtain when as a matter of

policy   the nominal exchange rate is adjusted adaptively to the inflation
rate.

        The results of this piper reinforce the view that avoidance of

unbalanced budgets can play a major role in maintaining macroeconomic

stability.
