                                          ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a framework to account for innovation similar to the usual accounting
framework in production analysis and a measure of innovativity comparable to that of total factor
productivity. This innovation accounting framework is illustrated using micro-aggregated firm data
from the first Community Innovation Surveys (CIS1) for seven European countries: Belgium,
Denmark, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Italy for the year 1992. Based on the
estimation of a generalized Tobit model and measuring innovation as the share of total sales due to
improved or new products, it compares the propensity to innovate, and the innovation intensity
conditional and unconditional on being innovative, across the seven countries and low- and high-tech
manufacturing sectors. Even with relatively few explanatory variables our innovation framework
already accounts for sizeable differences in country innovation intensity. It also shows that
differences in innovativity across countries can be nonetheless very large.

1. INTRODUCTION

 Industrial countries have reached a stage of economic development that many describe as

 “the knowledge-based economy” (KBE). The concept of a KBE is appealing, but its

 definition is far from being clear-cut. Some say that what distinguishes a KBE from the

 past industrial economies is that growth is driven less by investments in buildings and

 equipment than by the generation of ideas and the accumulation of knowledge (see for

 example Aghion-Howitt, 1998; Foray, 2004; Neef, 1998). Others characterize a KBE by

 the importance of information and communication technologies, skilled labor, continuous

 learning, and globalization (see for example Quah, 2001). Whatever definition one comes

 up with, innovation is certainly one of the pillars of the knowledge-based economy.

 Competition among firms to attract customers is fought more and more via improved

 products, entirely new products or more efficient ways to produce existing products.

        How to measure innovation? So far, most of the work on science and technology

 indicators has been based on R&D, patent or bibliometric data. R&D data have been

 collected in a systematic fashion in OECD countries since the inception of the Frascati

 Manual (OECD, 1963). Patent grants have been recorded by patent offices around the

 world for a much longer time. Bibliometric data are also widely available in the form of

 publications and citations, or innovation announcements. All of these indicators have

 their shortcomings. R&D measures only research input with no guarantee that the

 research eventually leads to a marketable and appropriable innovation output. Most

 patents are worth little and the propensity to patent varies widely across sectors.

 Bibliometric data are not always collected systematically or readily available, and they

 suffer even more than patents from the absence of any associated value. It is only recently


                                             5
that, under the guidelines of the Oslo Manual (OECD (1992), statistical agencies have

started conducting surveys directly asking firms about their innovations.1 In these

surveys, firms are asked to give information about the inputs, the outputs and the

behavioral and organizational dimensions of their innovative activities. On the input side,

we have data on R&D expenditures and on current innovation expenditures besides R&D

(such as the acquisition of patents and licenses, product design, trial production, and

market analysis). On the output side, we have the declaration of whether an enterprise has

introduced a new product or process and the shares of sales due to incrementally,

significantly changed, or entirely new products, which can be new to the enterprise or

new to the market. As other dimensions of innovative activities, we have indicators of

whether R&D is done on a continuous basis and/or in cooperation with others, and

categorical data on the sources of knowledge, the reasons for innovating, the perceived

obstacles to innovation, and the perceived strength of various appropriability

mechanisms.

           In this paper, we take advantage of the first round of harmonized innovation

surveys conducted in Europe under the auspices of the Statistical Office of the European

1
    There have been a number of more or less similar surveys conducted earlier, focusing on particular aspects

of firm innovation process. Probably the best known are the one conducted by the Science and Policy

Research Unit (SPRU) of the University of Sussex, which combined information on specific innovations

obtained from firms and from a panel of experts, the Yale survey on appropriability, and more recently the

Carnegie-Mellon survey. See for example Robson, Townsend and Pavitt (1988), and Geroski, Van Reenen

and Walters (1997) for analyses based on the SPRU innovation data; Levin, Klevorick, Nelson and Winter

(1987) and Cockburn and Griliches (1988) for analyses based on the Yale survey data; Cohen, Nelson and

Walsh (2000) and Arora, Ceccagnoli and Cohen (2003) for analyses based on the Carnegie-Mellon survey.

Community (Eurostat), the so called CIS1 surveys (for first Community Innovation

Surveys) covering the years 1990-1992. More precisely, we try to compare the innovation

performance for seven European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,

the Netherlands and Norway, based on the CIS1 micro-aggregated firm data, as

assembled and harmonized by Eurostat. In an exploratory paper, Mohnen and Dagenais

(2001) compared the innovation performance of Denmark and Ireland. In the present

analysis, we could not consider France because the CIS1 micro-aggregated data available

for France did not include the variable on R&D expenditures. We also excluded Portugal

and Greece because their sample was not representative of the whole population but only

of innovating firms. Although the original data are firm data, Eurostat was entitled to

make them available only in micro-aggregated form for reasons of statistical

confidentiality.

       “Micro-aggregation” is one among various methods to protect confidentiality. It is

a particularly simple and effective way to control for disclosure by adding “error terms”

to the raw micro-data, making it extremely difficult, if not fully impossible, to break the

anonymity of the individual firm (or more generally statistical unit) surveyed and find out

its identity, while preserving “most” of the information useful for statistical analysis. In

micro-aggregation methods, the error terms are not defined explicitly but included

implicitly in the procedure. The procedure used by Eurostat for CIS1 is micro-aggregation

by individual variable ranking (and groups of three observations). It is the following: for

any given (continuous) quantitative variable, all firms are first allocated into groups of

three on the basis of their ranking by increasing values of the variable; the (simple)

arithmetic averages of the variable are then computed for all groups (i.e. over the three


                                             7
firms of each group); and finally the raw values of the variable are replaced for all the

firms by the corresponding average values. This amounts to adding to every (continuous)

variable, for a given firm (i), an error term ( ε i ) equal to the difference between the

average value of the variable ( yi ) for the group of three firms (i, j and k) in which this

firm is allocated and its individual value ( yi ).2 The procedure is similar for the (discrete)

qualitative variables (for more details see Eurostat, 1996 and 1997). Note that micro-

aggregation is a sense a misnomer, since the number of observations (firms) is the same

in the micro-aggregated and the raw samples. One great advantage of micro-aggregation

is that the error terms added to the variables behave differently than the classical random

measurement errors in variables; they are not a source of bias in the estimation of linear

regression models for large enough samples. On the basis of the raw firm data of the

French CIS2 innovation survey and the corresponding micro-aggregated data, we have

also been able to show that the estimates of a non-linear model similar to the one

performed here were not sensitive to the micro-aggregation procedure (see Mairesse and

Mohnen, 2001).3



2
    If i, j and k denote respectively the index of the three firms of a given group, when firms are ranked in

increasing order of the variable y, we can write equivalently      yi = y j = yk = ( yi + y j +yk ) / 3 or

yi = yi + ε i with ε i = [( y j − yi ) + ( yk − yi )] / 3 ,

y j = y j + ε j with ε j = [( yi − y j ) + ( yk − y j )] / 3 and

yk = yk + ε k with ε k = [( yi − yk ) + ( y j − yk )] / 3 .

       Besides contributing to the analysis of the information provided by innovation

surveys, and possibly to the improvement in their design, our main purpose in this paper

is to organize our thinking on measurement and comparison of innovation performance,

and to do so we propose and illustrate the idea of an accounting framework for innovation

similar to the now standard production (or output growth or productivity) accounting

framework. In this framework, the production of a country, an industry or a firm can be

traced back to the use of various factors of production and to other omitted, unobserved,

unknown or “residual” factors that are subsumed under the name of total factor

productivity, or multifactor productivity, or even simply productivity. Similarly,

innovation can be regarded as deriving in part from traceable factors such as R&D efforts,

and from contextual variables such as demand pull and technology push indicators, and in

part from yet-to-be-understood unmeasured factors that we propose to identify jointly as

total or multifactor innovative productivity, and to call “innovativity” for short. Total

factor productivity is generally considered as a measure of productive performance

controlling for a given set of factors of production, as well as a measure of our ignorance

in accounting fully for this performance. Likewise, innovativity can be viewed as both a

measure of innovative performance and a measure of our ignorance in matters of

innovation.

       The production accounting framework is generally applied to comparisons in the

time dimension (i.e. between periods) of output or productivity performances of the unit

(or units) under analysis, but it can also be extended to the comparison of such

performances in the cross-sectional or spatial dimension, that is between units (in a given

period). Similarly, the innovation accounting framework can be applied to either the time


                                            9
or the cross-sectional dimension. We shall illustrate it here by comparing innovation in

seven European countries in high-tech and low-tech manufacturing industries, based on

the CIS1 micro-aggregated firm data.

       The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we develop the idea of an

accounting framework for innovation. In section 3, we lay out the econometric model

which underlies such framework and is consistent with the nature of the innovation

survey data. In section 4, we describe the CIS1 micro-aggregated data we use. In section

5, we present and interpret the estimation results. In section 6, on the basis of these results

and along the lines of our framework, we proceed with the comparison of the innovation

performance of the seven European countries. We summarize the main points of the

analysis in the concluding section.



2.   ACCOUNTING            FOR        INNOVATION          AND      ACCOUNTING            FOR

PRODUCTIVITY: A PARALLEL

The innovation surveys provide us with a very interesting new way of measuring the

output of firms’ innovative activities, namely the share of sales in the last year (i.e. 1992

for CIS1) due to new and substantially changed products introduced on the market during

the last three years (i.e., 1990-1992 for CIS1), or the share of innovative sales for short.

This measure can be viewed simply as a sales weighted number of innovations and seems

to be generally well understood by firm respondents. It also offers various possible

refinements such as distinguishing between incremental or radical improvements, or

between products new to the firm or new to the market. Of course such a measure only

captures product innovations, but the surveys indicate that most firms innovating in


                                              10
processes also innovate in products.4 Process innovations do not directly show up in new

sales, if their only effect is to reduce the cost of producing old products. However, they

also lead in general to new or improved products through a change in product design or

quality.

           Merely comparing statistics on the share of innovative sales or other innovation

indicators is useful but does not say why these indicators differ across firms, sectors or

countries. To understand why they do and possibly build more informative innovation

indicators, we need a model. If an exact model of innovation in its various dimensions

existed and we knew it, we should be able to understand precisely why, for example, one

country has a higher innovation performance than another country. Of course, such a

perfect model does not exist and we shall never be able to characterize and explain the

innovation process fully. Nevertheless, it is worth trying to model differences in

innovative performance. Even a rather crude model may allow us to assess, at least

approximately and tentatively, to what extent some important innovation factors, like

firm size or R&D efforts, account for differences in innovation output. In such an

endeavor, what remains to be explained is as important to measure as what can be

explained. On the one hand what we call innovativity reflects the ability to turn the

innovation factors accounted for in the model into innovation output, on the other hand it

corresponds to other factors not measured, let alone unveiled, that challenge the

researcher on innovation to probe further.



4
    In CIS1 the proportion of firms that declared to be only process innovators (and not product innovators)

seemed particularly small; it is also relatively small in CIS2 and CIS3.



                                                      11
       To be more explicit and better motivate our approach, it is helpful to draw a

comparison with the standard framework for output growth or productivity accounting.

Output is viewed as being produced by inputs in a process that can be represented and

analyzed by a production function. The production function in turn underlies an

accounting framework, in which the difference in output between two periods (years,

decades) or between two spatial units (firms, industries, countries) can be ascribed to

differences in the inputs, and to a residual difference in what is called total or multifactor

productivity (TFP or MFP), or simply productivity. Likewise, innovation output can be

viewed as resulting from a process of transformation which can be summarized by an

innovation function, even if this process is much less predictable than a production

process. This innovation model can also give rise to an accounting framework in which

differences in innovation output between two periods, or two spatial units, can similarly

be ascribed to differences in direct inputs of innovation, and more generally contextual or

environmental determinants, and to a residual difference in what can be called innovative

productivity or innovativity.

       This parallel between productivity and innovativity is fairly straightforward when

both are measured on the basis of an econometrically estimated relationship. The analogy

is less clear when productivity analysis is based on “accounting data” and index number

computations. In this approach total or multifactor productivity is not estimated as a

residual but computed as the ratio of an output index to a weighted index of inputs, where

the weights are taken to be equal to the corresponding input shares (in total revenue or

total cost) available from firms'current accounts or country national accounts. In practice,

it is impossible to measure innovativity by such index number method in the absence of


                                             12
similar accounting information for innovation outputs and inputs. In theory, that might

not be unconceivable if well developed and functioning markets for innovation outputs

and inputs existed in the economy, where one could assume that in the long run relative

prices and marginal productivities would tend to be equal. In such an hypothetical world,

firms’ current accounts (and balance sheets) could describe and measure innovation

activities, as they do for production activities, and thus provide the necessary information

for the computation of an index measure of innovativity, as for that of productivity.

        The analogy between the two types of analyses could be pursued further to

highlight basic similarities, as well as essential differences. For example, the

methodological problems raised by extending a bilateral productivity comparison to a

multilateral one carry over to comparisons of innovation. In the case of a bilateral

comparison it is straightforward to compare the observations in one country with those in

the other country. In a multilateral comparison, it is useful to refer to a non-arbitrary fixed

point of comparison. If various firms of a given industry are compared, the reference

point would be the average firm; if various industries of a given country are compared, it

would be the average industry, and so on. As we are comparing here the innovation

performance in seven European countries, our choice for base of comparison will simply

be the hypothetical “average Europe”, where each of these countries is given equal

weight. 5


5 Our application of the innovation accounting framework bears a close resemblance to the interspatial

multilateral productivity comparisons introduced by Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982). They

recommend the use of a transitive multilateral productivity index (based on an approximation to a general

production function), treating all countries symmetrically by comparing them to a hypothetical country,



                                                   13
         In both types of analysis, the major challenge is to account for as many

explanatory factors as possible within the limits of available information. In our case, we

are strictly limited to the CIS1 micro-aggregated dataset. In addition to the usual R&D

intensity variable, we are able to consider a few other explanatory variables measuring or

proxying for firm organizational characteristics or external conditions propitious to

innovation activities. The econometric specification of the innovation model and its

estimation are thus largely conditioned by the availability and nature of the data. We now

turn to a presentation of the innovation model as we could specify it and estimate it on the

basis of the CIS1 data.



3. THE INNOVATION MODEL: ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION AND

ESTIMATION

The CIS questionnaires, like other innovation surveys, are set up in a way that gives rise

to censoring or selection problems. First, firms are asked some general questions such as

their total sales, their number of employees, their industry affiliation, and whether they

belong to a group of firms. Then, they have to answer a few central filtering questions to

determine whether or not they are “innovating” firms. Innovating firms are those

answering that in the last three years (i.e., 1990-1992 for CIS1) they have developed new

or changed products, or new or changed processes, or that they intend to do so in the near




which takes arithmetic average values for all variables entering the productivity formula (or geometric

averages if these variables are expressed in logarithms).



                                                      14
future.6 Only innovating firms have to fill out the full questionnaire, while non–

innovating firms are only asked about their perception of the degree of importance of

various obstacles hampering innovation. CIS surveys thus basically provide rich

information for firms which are innovating but little for firms which are not. If we limited

ourselves to use the information available for all firms, we could at best account for their

"propensity to innovate", but we would fail to exploit most of the information we have on

innovating firms, in particular regarding their innovation output and more precisely their

innovative sales. Therefore, we chose to specify an econometric model which exploits the

data of all firms, innovating or not, and which also accounts for firms’ innovation output

or “intensity of innovation”. The estimated model can then be used to compute expected

innovation intensity, controlling for a set of “exogenous” variables, and our indicator of

innovativity, defined as the residual difference between observed and expected innovation

intensity.7

           More precisely, we adopt a generalized (Type 2) Tobit model consisting of two

equations, where the first one is a probit equation determining whether a firm innovates

6
    This is the actual definition of innovating firms in CIS1. In CIS2 and CIS3 firms declaring that during the

last three years they have not yet completed or that they have abandoned innovation activities are also

considered as “innovating” firms.
7
    Porter and Stern (1999) do a similar type of analysis, as we do here, although they do not cast it in terms

of an accounting framework for innovation. They define an expected innovation intensity index in terms of

expected international patents per head conditional on resource, environment and demand conditions. They

compute their index by estimating a regression on a panel of 17 OECD countries over a 21-year period.

While their measure is based directly on aggregated country data, ours is based on micro-data, and we

therefore need to model the propensity to innovate as well as the intensity of innovation.



                                                       15
or not, and the second one is a linear regression (or Tobit equation) explaining how much

the firm innovates (see for example Maddala, 1983; Amemiya, 1985; Greene, 2003; or

Wooldridge, 2002). We assume that there is a latent variable y1i* for firm i that is

generated by the first equation

                                  y1*i = x1ib1 + u1i       (1)

where x1i is a vector of explanatory variables, b1 is a vector of parameters to be estimated,

and u1i is a random error term, which includes the effect of left-out variables omitted due

to the lack of appropriate data and our limited knowledge of the innovative process. This

equation is interpreted as saying that if y1*i is positive, incentives to innovate are large

enough for the firm to actually innovate. Denoting by y1i the binary variable indicating

that firm i is an innovating firm, we can thus write:

                                   =1        if y1*i >0
                             y1i =                               (1’)
                                   =0         if y1*i ≤0

       As explanatory variables x1i we can use industry dummies, firm size and group

membership. Industry dummies capture technological opportunity conditions (i.e. it is

easier to innovate in certain fields than in others), industry-targeted innovation policies,

an industry-specific differential demand growth effect (for instance, demand is growing

for electronic products but declining for textile products), or structural effects like the

intensity of competition. Size, measured by the number of employees, reflects access to

finance, scale economies, and differences in the organization of work. Firms that are part

of a group (i.e. controlled by another firm) are expected to benefit from intra-group




                                               16
knowledge spillovers, internal access to finance, or various other synergies (in marketing,

distribution, etc), and therefore to be more innovative.

         Three other variables are in principle available in CIS1 micro-aggregated data for

all firms irrespective of whether or not they are innovators. Past growth can be a

determining factor of innovation, as reflecting both a stronger demand and an easier

access to internal and external finance (see Brouwer and Kleinknecht, 1999).

Unfortunately, the growth rate in firm sales (in the three year period 1990-92) is missing

for Norway and Germany, and hence we could not actually use it to control for past

growth in a common model for all the seven countries considered. We could also have

considered the proportion of exports in total sales as an indicator of external competition

stimulating innovation. However, it would be a very unsatisfactory indicator, since it is

not likely to be exogenous. Exports can be driven by innovation, as new products open up

new markets abroad, and both innovative sales and export intensity can also result from

past innovative efforts. A third variable available with observations for both innovating

and non-innovating firms is the degree of importance of the obstacles to innovation.

Although this should be a priori a very important factor in explaining why firms will not

innovate, various authors have found that the obstacles to innovation are more strongly

perceived when firms actually innovate and face those obstacles than when they do not

innovate and hence do not encounter them (Baldwin and Lin, 2001, Mohnen and Rosa,

2002). Hence, this variable cannot be taken as exogenous to being innovative (actually it

can be negatively correlated with being innovative), and we prefer not to include it in the

model.




                                             17
           In the CIS surveys firms’ innovation intensity can be measured by the share of

innovative sales in total sales and thus their innovation output level by the magnitude of

innovative sales (measured as the share of innovative sales multiplied by total sales). It is

also possible to distinguish between innovative sales corresponding to products new to

the firm but possibly known to the market, which can be considered as imitations of

products already produced by other firms in the industry, and those corresponding to

products only new to the market, which can be regarded as true innovations (see, for

example, Brouwer and Kleinknecht, 1996). In the analysis here we preferred to simply

focus on the overall measure.8 The second equation of our generalized Tobit model is

thus specified in terms of a second latent variable y2*i , which is equal to the actual share of

innovative sales y2 i , if the firm is innovative (i.e. y1*i > 0 ). Since the share of innovative

sales is bounded by 0 and 1 (i.e., 0 < y2i                     1), it is actually preferable to specify this

second equation in terms of the latent logit-share variable z2*i = ln( y2*i /(1 − y2*i )) which can

vary from -         to + . Because the resulting variable is closer to normally distributed, the

maximum likelihood estimator is then more likely to be consistent for the underlying

parameters. We have y2*i = e
                                         z2*i /(1 + e z2*i ) .Similarly if     z2 i = ln( y2 i /(1 − y2i ))   is the


observed logit share variable, then y2i = e
                                                        z2i /(1 + e z2i ) .9

    The information on shares of innovative sales for products new to the market is not available for all seven

countries. There is also a breakdown of sales with respect to various stages of the product life-cycle, but we

have not tried to exploit this information.

9
    Note that the logit share variable   z2i is not defined for the two bounds 0 and 1 of the share of innovative

sales    y2i . In practice, we deal with the upper bound of 1 by simply setting the value of y2i to 0.99


                                                          18
        The second equation of the generalized Tobit model is thus the following:

                                      z2*i = x2ib2 + u2i        (2)

where x2 i > 0 is a vector of explanatory variables, b2 is a vector of parameters to be

estimated and u2 i > 0 is a stochastic error term reflecting omitted variables and other

sources of heterogeneity. Note that because of the logit share transformation of equation

(2), u2i varies from - to + . We can therefore write:

                                     = z2*i             if y1*i >0
                             z2i =                                       (2’)
                                     =undefined         if y1*i ≤0

or equivalently:

                                z    *   z     *
                              =e 2i /(1+e 2i )              if y1*i >0
                        y2i =                                                  (2’’)
                              =0                           if y1*i ≤0


        Although it would be helpful for identification, we cannot exclude any of the

explanatory variables we have in x1i from x2i a priori. However, since for innovating

firms we have information on more variables, we can include in x2i six other variables

which are relevant for explaining innovation intensity: four relating to R&D (assumed to

be the main innovation input) and two binary indicators characterizing the environment in

which the firm operates - one for the strength of competition and the other for proximity

to basic research. Competition is deemed to be strong (the indicator is 1) when firms



whenever it is higher (and less or equal to 1). By symmetry, we also set the    y2i to be 0.01 whenever it is

smaller and positive. See for example Cragg (1971) for a rigorous treatment of a Tobit model with both a

lower and an upper bounded dependent variable.



                                                   19
declare that increasing or maintaining market share is an important objective of

innovation for them, and weak if it is not (the indicator is 0). Similarly, proximity to basic

research is significant when firms answer that universities/higher education or

government laboratories are significant sources of information for innovation.10 The four

R&D-related variables are a binary indicator for R&D-performing firms, the R&D/sales

ratio for R&D performing firms, a binary indicator for doing R&D on a continuous basis,

and one indicating whether R&D is done in cooperation with partners or not.11

           Following the standard procedure we estimate our generalized Tobit model by

maximum likelihood, assuming that u1i and u2i are independently and identically jointly

distributed as a bivariate normal distribution with mean zero and contemporaneous

                               σ 12 σ 12
variance-covariance matrix Σ =           . Because σ 1 cannot be identified, it is
                               σ 12 σ 22



10
     Firms have to provide answers on their innovation objectives and sources of information using a five-

point Likert scale, and the cut-off values we chose to define our dichotomous indicators correspond roughly

to the sample median responses.
11
     Another potentially interesting innovation input variable contained in CIS 1 corresponds to the notion of

innovation expenditures, including R&D but also the expenditures on acquisition of patents and licenses,

product design, trial production, training and tooling-up, and market analysis. Unfortunately either this

variable was misunderstood by the respondents or firms were not used to keeping account of those

expenditures. In many cases, for example, this variable took values lower than the R&D expenditures,

declared elsewhere, that it is supposed to include. For these reasons we excluded this variable from the

analysis. We have also decided not to include in the explanatory variables the perceived strength of

appropriability of product or process innovations, because of the particular difficulty of assuming that it

enters exogenously in the model (likewise the perceived obstacles to innovation variable).

normalized to be equal to 1, and σ 12 = ρσ 2 where ρ is the contemporaneous correlation

coefficient between the two error terms.                      The log-likelihood function of our sample is

the following:

                                                              x1i b1 + ρ / σ 2 ( z2i − x2i b2 )
            ln L =        ln[1 − Φ ( x1i b1 )] +       ln Φ
                      0                            1                       1− ρ 2                     (3)
                  +       ln{(1/σ 2 )ϕ[(ln( z2i ) − x2 ib2 ) / σ 2 ]}
                      1



with the index 0 and the index 1 under the summation signs referring respectively to non-

innovating and innovating firms (i.e., y1i = 0 and y2i = 1), and Φ and ϕ being

respectively the standard normal univariate distribution and density functions.12

           We estimate the model on the pooled data of the seven countries, accounting for

country-specific and industry-specific effects by way of country and industry dummy

variables. We thus assume a common structure that applies to all countries and that can

later be used to compare innovation performance across countries. We also put all seven

countries on an equal footing, irrespective of the size of their respective samples, by

weighting appropriately the variables pertaining to each country (that is by the square root

of NE/NC where NC is the number of firms in country C and NE is the average number of

12
     The first term of the likelihood function (3) defined over the non-innovating firms is the same as the

corresponding term in the likelihood function for the probit equation, while, when =0, the second term

defined over the innovating firm becomes also the same as the corresponding term in the likelihood function

for the probit equation. The third term is the likelihood function for the linear regression over the innovating

firms. To ensure that the estimated       σ 2 is positive, it is replaced by exp(ω ) in the likelihood function, and

to ensure that the estimated ρ stays between -1 and 1, it is replaced by (exp(2ν ) − 1) /(exp(2ν ) + 1).

Initial estimates are obtained from Heckman'
                                           s two-step estimation (see Heckman, 1979).



                                                              21
firms per country, say in our hypothetical “average Europe”).13 Imposing a common

model structure and giving equal weight to the seven countries means that the estimated

coefficients b1 and b2 in the innovation propensity and intensity equations (and the

corresponding marginal effects) are to be viewed as “average Europe” coefficients. It

means also that our indicator of innovativity is to be interpreted as measuring not only the

effects of the unobserved factors of innovation, but possibly also differences across

countries in the model structure and estimated coefficients.14

           However, in estimating our generalized Tobit model, we found that the log-

likelihood function always increased with the value of the correlation coefficient

between the error terms in both equations, raising convergence problems in maximizing

the likelihood function. Various experiments with somewhat different specifications of

the model led to the same conclusion. A value of                   close to one suggests that the error

13
     We chose to give equal weight to each country. Another option, however, would have been to take as

reference a representative “average Europe”, by using grossing-up factors to “blow up” the country samples

to the entire country populations. Note that this option raises a number of practical problems. Even if one

would use the weighting factors for each stratum of firms (defined by size and industry) provided by

Eurostat, it would imply that non-responding units behave in the same way as the responding units. As a

rule of thumb, such an assumption seems unlikely when the percentage of non-responses exceeds 25% (see

Archibugi et al., 1994), and none of our seven countries satisfies this condition.
14
     Estimating different models for each country would make it possible in principle to take apart these two

components, by allowing us to account separately for differences in expected innovation intensity arising

from differences in the model structure across countries and those arising from the differences in average

magnitudes of explanatory variables across countries (for a common model structure). In the present

terms in both equations are nearly collinear and that common unobserved factors of

innovation are omitted in both parts of the model.15 We therefore ended up fixing the

value of       to 0.95, the estimated coefficients of the model not being too sensitive to the

exact value of         around 0.90-0.99. It is clear, however, that we have an identification

problem, most likely due to the poor specification of the first equation (the probit

equation) as a result of the lack of variables that could predict when firms are

innovators.16 We intend to investigate further this issue in future work in which the CIS

surveys could be matched to complementary sources of data. Nonetheless we think that,

at least for our mainly illustrative purpose here, the compromise we finally adopted is

satisfactory.



4. COUNTRY SAMPLES AND SIMPLE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS



illustrative analysis, we did not pursue this possibility, many of the parameters of our model being poorly

estimated at the country level (and hence not significantly different across countries).
15
     We were of course expecting a priori a high positive value of , if only because of the omission of

unobserved factors of innovation in the probit and Tobit equations, such as the quality of management and

the environment of the firm. Estimating a simple Tobit model, which in a sense corresponds to a limiting

case of =1 is unsatisfactory. In particular we would be restricted to two explanatory variables, those

entering equation (1) of the generalized Tobit model (apart from the industry and country dummies).
16
     As our model stands, the identification of the probit and Tobit equations is based on the functional

assumption of joint normality of u1i and u2i . We would have preferred to base identification on exclusion


restrictions, that is, on the exclusion in the Tobit equation (in x2i ) of variables belonging to the probit


equation (in x1i ). See for example Puhani, 2000.




                                                      23
As usual when working with firm level data, in order to construct country samples that

we could use in our analysis, we had first to clean the CIS1 micro-aggregated raw data for

outliers, missing observations, and inconsistencies. We thus eliminated all firms with less

than 20 employees, because these firms were not surveyed in four of our seven countries.

We also deleted firms with missing industry affiliation and restricted our samples to

manufacturing industries, since only two countries (Germany and the Netherlands) had

collected data on services. We also purged from our samples all firms with sales growth

rates between 1990 and 1992 higher than 250% and lower than -40%, R&D/sales ratios

higher than 50%, current expenditures on innovations higher than 100% of their sales.

We set R&D/sales ratios to zero when they were positive but lower than 0.1%. As the

Italian sample resulted from a census and not a survey, the Italian sample was ten times

greater than the second largest country sample, Germany. We therefore took (after

cleaning) a random subsample for Italy consistent with the sampling frame adopted by the

other countries, by keeping 5% of all firms with 20 to 49 employees, 10% of all firms

between 50 and 249 employees, and all firms with more than 250 employees. In the end

we were left with 8146 observations overall: 542 in Belgium, 572 in Denmark, 1910 in

Germany, 715 in Ireland, 2254 in Italy, 1678 in the Netherlands, and 475 in Norway.

       We distinguished eleven industries in total manufacturing, whose definition,

abbreviated names and related NACE codes are listed in Table B1 in Appendix B. In

defining these industries we made sure that we had enough observations per industry in

each country, starting from the industry aggregate classification used by Eurostat (1997)

in presenting the descriptive statistics of the CIS 1 survey, and aggregating it further when

needed. In our analysis, we considered separately the high-R&D industries (Vehicles,


                                             24
Chemicals, Machinery and Electrical) and the low-R&D industries, or high-tech and low-

tech industries, based on previous econometric evidence of important differences between

them (see for example Griliches and Mairesse, 1984). The numbers of firms per industry

in the seven countries are given in Table B2 in Appendix B.

           We have defined innovating firms in a somewhat more restrictive way than in the

CIS1 surveys, where they are all the firms that answer yes to any of the questions “Have

you introduced a new or technologically changed product during 1990-1992?”, “Have you

introduced a new or technologically changed process during 1990-1992?”, “Do you

intend to innovate in the next three years?”. Nearly 10% of the firms, however, declaring

that they have introduced new or changed products do not answer the questions on the

shares of innovative sales for incrementally changed, significantly changed or newly

introduced products, or they report zero shares. One explanation is that they do not know

the answer to the question or that there can be a significant time lag between the

introduction of a new product on the market and the realization of non negligible sales

from this new product. As we have only cross-sectional data, we have decided to be more

restrictive in the definition of an innovating firm by characterizing it as one that declares

a non-zero share of innovative sales for incrementally changed, significantly changed or

newly introduced products in the three years 1990-1992.17 Finally, about 4% of the firms


17
     Alternatively, we could have treated as zero responses all the non-responses on the share in sales of

innovative products by firms that declare to be innovators, and we could have replaced all these zero shares

by a 0.01 share because of our logit-share transformation. Some experiments led us to conclude that this

alternative treatment would have little bearing on the results. Note that the distinction between non-

responses and zero responses is not reliable both because it is unlikely that firms themselves always make



                                                     25
report that their sales are entirely due to new or improved products. Since the logit-share

transformation is not defined in this case, we have simply assumed that the share of

innovative sales is at most 0.99, and, by symmetry, for the handful of firms for which the

share of innovative sales was positive but less than 0.01, we set it to be at least equal to

0.01 (see footnote 9).

         Table 1 gives the means of all the variables used in our analysis for our seven

country samples, separately for the high-tech and low-tech sectors. Table 1 gives also

these means for our hypothetical average Europe, which serves as our reference country,

where these means are simply computed as the arithmetic average of the corresponding

seven country means (thus giving equal weight to each country). About 35-40% of the

firms in the country samples belong to the high-tech sectors, with the exception of

Germany where this proportion is as high as 55%. Overall, firms in the high-tech sectors

differ from those in the low-tech sectors in many respects. They are larger and therefore

account for a relatively greater fraction of total employment. They are more often part of

a group; they have a higher percentage of innovators (73.8% as opposed to 55.8%); they

feel more pressure from competition (69.7% as opposed to 53.1%) and are more closely

connected with basic research (58.1% as opposed to 41.1%). Firms in high-tech sectors,

when they innovate, have on average a higher share of innovative sales (46.8% against

38.9%); they perform R&D more frequently (90.2% against 77.7%) and more intensively

(with an R&D to sales ratio of 4.4% against 2.0%). When they do R&D, they do it more

often in a continuous fashion (81.9% against 72.2%) and in cooperation with others


such distinction, and because it seemed that the coding and subsequent micro-aggregation of CIS1 data

could also not be trusted in making this distinction consistently across countries.



                                                      26
(81.9% against 42.5%). The simple dichotomy between “high-tech” and “low-tech” firms

in the analysis thus controls for quite a number of systematic differences.

       Across the country samples, there are also a number of important differences. The

size distribution is more skewed towards large firms in Belgium and Germany than in the

other countries, especially in the high-tech sectors. Ireland on average has the smallest

firms. Germany has the highest proportion of innovating firms and the highest share of

innovative sales in both the high- and low-tech sectors. The lowest percentages of

innovating firms are in Italy and Norway. Norwegian innovating firms, however, have

almost the same share of innovative sales (48.2%) in the high tech sectors as the country

leader Germany. Doing R&D continuously is most common in Belgium and Italy and

least frequent in Denmark, whereas cooperative R&D is often encountered in Denmark

and Norway, but only rarely in Italy. Pressure of competition and proximity to basic

research are strong in Belgium and Germany and weak in Italy and Norway.



5. ESTIMATION RESULTS: COEFFICIENTS AND MARGINAL EFFECTS

Our estimation results are presented in details in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 shows the

pooled estimates of the coefficients of the generalized Tobit model, estimated separately

for firms in the high-tech and low-tech sectors, and controlling for unexplained industry

and country heterogeneity by introducing industry and country dummies in each of the

two equations of the model. Size is measured by the logarithm of the number of

employees in deviation from the size of the average European firm and the R&D/sales

ratio is also defined in deviation from the corresponding ratio of the average European

country. The reference group is the food industry for the low-tech sectors or the motor


                                             27
vehicles industry for the high-tech sectors, in Denmark, with no R&D, not belonging to a

group, experiencing little competition and not benefiting much from basic research.18

          Most estimated coefficients are significantly different from zero, although there

are not too precisely estimated. Many of them are also markedly different from each other

in the high- and low-tech sectors, even if not statistically so (at the conventional level of

significance of 5%). We find an estimated coefficient of R&D in the low-tech sectors that

is twice as high as that in the high-tech sectors, although R&D-doing firms in these

sectors innovate much less in average than those in high-tech sectors. Low-tech firms also

appear to benefit less from size, from being close to basic research, from the pressure of

competition, and from cooperation in R&D. In contrast, they are more likely to innovate

if they are part of a group.

          For a better assessment of the estimated coefficients, we proceed in Table 3 to an

analysis of the marginal effects of each variable (the equivalent of the slope in a linear

regression). We distinguish three types of marginal effects, those on the expected

propensity to innovate, those on the expected intensity of innovation unconditional on

being innovative and those on the expected intensity of innovation conditional on being

innovative. These expected functions are respectively given by:

18
     In Germany we have many instances of missing values for the variable “belonging to a group”. Small

firms had a separate questionnaire to fill out in which this question was not listed. Instead of considering

these firms as not belonging to a group, we have introduced a separate dummy variable to control for these

missing values. We have also introduced other dummy variables to control for missing R&D/sales ratios for

a number of R&D doing firms in the quantitative part of the model, instead of considering these firms as

non-R&D performers or dropping them from our samples. The coefficients of these missing values control

dummies are not reported in Table 2.

simply written E[ y2 i | x1i , x2i ] =                             ( x2 i b2 + u2 i ) f (u1i , u2 i ) du1i du2 i , which can easily be expressed as
                                                     − x1i b1 −∞



E[ y2i | x1i , x2i ] = Φ ( x1i b1 )( x2i b2 ) + ρσ 2ϕ ( x1i b1 ) , that is Heckman’s formula (see Greene, 2003).

20
     Note that, if the expected functions were linear, the marginal effects would be constant (and that they

would not depend on the values the variables).



                                                                                 29
from 0 to 1. We express the marginal country effects as the differences between the

values of the expected functions when having the country-specific dummy and the

average of the country dummy coefficients for the seven countries, and we similarly

define the marginal industry effects as the differences between having the industry-

specific dummy coefficient and the average of the industry dummy coefficients weighted

by the average industry composition in the seven countries. The country and industry

effects are thus interpreted as deviations from the average country and average industry

effects (see Suits, 1984).21

           The two first columns of Table 3 show that a 1% increase in size for the average

European firm in the high-tech sectors (corresponding roughly to 6 additional employees)

and in the low-tech sectors (corresponding roughly to only 3 additional employees) would

increase the probability of innovating by about 10%. They also show that a firm

belonging to a group has on average a higher probability of innovating than one which

does not, by about 5% in the high-tech sectors and 10% in the low-tech sectors. It appears

that German firms are more often innovative than the average European firm (by about

10% in the high-tech sectors and 15% in the low-tech sectors). So are the Irish and Dutch

firms, and the Belgian firms in the low-tech sectors. By contrast, for reasons to be

investigated (other than average industry composition, the average size or being part a

group), far fewer firms are innovative in Italy (by about 15% in the high-tech sectors and

35% in the low-tech sectors). The frequency of innovation is higher in the industries

21
     Note that if the expected functions were linear, the sum of the country effects and that of the industry

effects weighted by the average industry compositions would both be equal to zero (and that any deviation

from zero in the sum of these effects is thus due to the nonlinearity).



                                                         30
producing machinery and equipment and electrical and electronic products than in those

producing vehicles and chemicals. Among the low-tech sectors, the proportion of

innovators is particularly low in the wood-based and textile-producing industries.

        Turning to the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on the expected

intensity of innovation for firms that already innovate (given in the third and fourth

columns of Table 3), we see that we see that returns to scale are practically constant for

the average European innovating firm in the high-tech sectors and slightly decreasing in

the low-tech sectors in the low-tech sectors. Being part of a group has also a very small

impact. Doing R&D also entails a rise of the share of innovative sales of about 4% in the

high sectors and 1.5% in the low-tech sectors; and doing it continuously an additional rise

of about 4.5% in both sectors. A one percentage point raise of the R&D/sales ratio for

R&D doing firms corresponds respectively to an increase of the share of innovative sales

of 0.25% in the high-tech sectors and one of 0.55%, more than the double, in the low

tech-sectors.22 The effects of competition and proximity to basic research are quite

sizeable in the high-tech sectors, much less in the low-tech sectors.

        If we do not limit ourselves to the innovating firms, the marginal effects

encompass the combined effects on the propensity to innovate and on the intensity of

innovation when firms innovate. These marginal effects (given in the fifth and sixth

columns of Table 3) tend to be smaller than the corresponding conditional effects.

However, the joint effects of size and group, those of doing R&D and doing it

continuously and in cooperation, and those of proximity to basic research and perceived


22
  These estimated marginal impacts of R&D intensity on innovation intensity (conditional on both doing
R&D and being innovative) seem particularly small, which may be due to various specification problems to
be investigated in future work..


                                                  31
competition remain very substantial in the high-tech sectors, and to a large extent in the

low-tech sectors as well. It is interesting to observe that the marginal effect of the R&D to

sales ratio variable (computed at the average European ratio in both sectors) remains

about 50% higher in the low-tech sectors than in the high-tech sectors.



6. ACCOUNTING FOR INNOVATION: AN ILLUSTRATION

We can now move to the illustration of our accounting for innovation framework and the

measurement of innovativity. In Table 4, we provide, separately for the high-tech and

low-tech sectors, a decomposition of the innovation performances for each of the seven

countries in terms of “structural effects” (the effects of the main explanatory factors of

innovation that we have been able to consider) and of innovativity, respectively for the

propensity to innovate (panel A), the innovation intensity for the innovating firms (panel

B), and innovation intensity unconditional on being innovative (panel C). As it is set up,

Table 4 allows for a comprehensive comparison of the innovation performance of any

given country relative to the average European country, and hence for any bilateral or

multilateral comparison between any two or more of the seven countries. A detailed

explanation of how this table is constructed, based on our estimated model, is given in

Appendix A.

       The different structural effects and innovativity are all expressed in the three

panels of Table 4 in terms of deviations from the average European country. We thus start

in the first column, for each country, from the common average European values for the

innovation propensity and the conditional and unconditional innovation intensity

indicators. We show next, in the following columns, the estimated structural effects


                                             32
grouped in four categories: industry composition, size and belonging to a group, the four

R&D variables (R&D intensity and the indicators for doing R&D, continuous R&D and

cooperative R&D), and the two environment indicators (perceived competition and

proximity to basic research).23 We then have, in the following two columns, the sum of

structural effects and the expected innovation propensity and intensity indicators, which

are themselves computed by adding the structural effects to the corresponding average

European indicators (in the first column).24 Finally we find for each country, in the last

two columns, the estimated innovativity and the observed innovation propensity and

intensities, where innovativity is obtained as the difference between the observed and

expected values.25

           As we have been able to illustrate it here, for many of the possible pair-wise

country comparisons, our framework imputes most of the differences in innovation

performance to innovativity. and attributes relatively little of these differences to the


23
     We have only the first two groups of structural effects for the innovation propensity in panel A. We have

added the dummy variable for missing values on the variable belonging to a group to the German country

effect (as it affects German firms only), and have regrouped the dummy variable for the missing values on

R&D/sales ratios for the R&D doing firms with the four R&D variables.
24
     Note that the expected marginal effects so computed are the ones we directly estimate for each country

from equations (4), (5) and (6), but up to an approximation error due to the linearization of the effects

around the average European country (see Appendix A).
25
     Note that the country effect is not treated as a structural effect, but that it constitutes the main component

of innovativity, the two other components of innovativity, as we compute it here, being the two

approximation errors due to the intrinsic non linearity of the expected marginal effects and to the

linearization around the average European country (see Appendix A).



                                                         33
structural effects. This is particularly true for all three innovation indicators in the low-

tech sectors, but much less so in the high-tech sectors. Let us consider two extreme cases:

firstly the comparison between Germany and Italy, which appear respectively as the most

and the least innovative of the seven countries, both in the low- and high-tech sectors and

for the three innovation indicators; and secondly the comparison of Denmark and the

Netherlands, which are on the contrary very close to each other and to the average

European country in terms of innovative performance.

       In the high tech-sectors, the structural effects account for about one-third of the

overall differences between Germany and Italy in the unconditional and conditional

innovation intensities (respectively 5.5% out of 18.2%, and 3.8% out of 10.2%), but for

none of the overall difference (23.0%) in the innovation propensity. In the low-tech

sectors, the structural effects account only from 5 to 10 percent of the large overall

differences in the three innovation indicators (respectively 27.3%, 15.4% and 45.4%). Of

the 5.5% (3.8%) total difference in unconditional (conditional) innovation intensity, that

can be attributed to the structural effects in the high-tech sectors, 3.3%, 1.8% and 0.9%

(2.0%, 0.8% and 1.2%) correspond respectively to relatively favorable differences in the

environment conditions, R&D activities and industry compositions, while only -0.5% (-

0.1%) relates to unfavorable size and group membership effects.

       In the case of Denmark and the Netherlands, we have, at least at first sight, a

different picture. In the high-tech sectors, very little of the (rather small) differences

between the two countries in their unconditional and conditional innovation intensity

indicators is related to innovativity (about -0.5%), while practically all is accounted for by

the structural effects (about 4%), mainly so by the industry composition effects (about


                                             34
2.0%) and the R&D effects (about 1.5%). The situation is the same in the low-tech

sectors for unconditional innovation intensity, with innovativity accounting for little (-

0.3%) and the structural effects accounting fully for the small difference (1.8%) between

the two countries. It is the opposite, however, for the conditional innovation intensity,

where innovativity plays a larger role (3.6%) than the structural effects (0.8%). The

situation is also different for the innovation propensity in both sectors in the sense that

innovativity and the sum of structural effects are of the same order magnitude but of

opposite sign in accounting for the overall small differences (0.8% and -1.8%) between

the two countries.

         In brief, we see that the divergence between the Germany-Italy and the Denmark-

Netherlands pair-wise comparisons really concerns our estimates of innovativity, which

are very large in the first comparison and small or negligible in the second, but not our

estimates of the structural effects, which are more or less on the same order of magnitude

in both cases. Considering other bilateral comparisons show also distinct configurations,

with relative and absolute orders of magnitude of the structural effects (and their

components) and of innovativity that can be quite different.26 All country comparisons are

in fact case-specific, which of course is not surprising.




26
   For example in the high-tech industries, the case of the Denmark-Netherlands comparison appears very
different from that of Ireland-Netherlands comparison, although the three countries are close to the average
European country. In the first case, the small differences in the conditional and unconditional innovation
intensities are mainly attributed to the structural effects, while in the latter case they are mainly imputed to
innovativity.


                                                      35
7. CONCLUSION

       We propose in this paper an accounting for innovation framework and illustrate it

by an application based on the micro-aggregated firm data from CIS1 (the first European

Community Innovation Survey, covering the years 1990-1992) for the manufacturing

industries in seven European countries. In this application, we measure innovation

intensity by the share of innovative sales, but our framework can also be applied to other

sources of data and other measures of innovation. Trying to make the best use of the

qualitative and quantitative information available in the survey, we select a certain

number of explanatory variables for the propensity to innovate and the intensity of

innovation, and we specify and estimate an innovation function as a generalized Tobit

model. Based on this model, we compute the expected share of innovative sales and

define innovativity as the part of the observed share of innovative sales that remains

unexplained. Innovativity corresponds to the notion of total factor productivity (TFP), or

simply productivity, in production function analysis and the standard growth accounting

framework. As it stands with relatively few explanatory variables our innovation

framework already accounts for sizeable differences in country innovation intensity, more

so in the high-tech than in the low-tech sectors. It also shows, however, that differences in

country innovativity can be even more sizeable.

       Given the limitations of our attempt, in particular that related to using only the

micro-aggregated data from CIS1, these initial results should be merely taken as

illustrative. We hope they will suffice to indicate the potential interest and advantages of

explicitly implementing an accounting for innovation framework, in order to compare

innovation performances between countries (as here), or between industries, or firms,


                                             36
either in terms of absolute levels in a given period (as here) or in terms of changes over

time. These advantages are be similar to those of the standard growth accounting

framework, in spite of the fact that in both cases many conventional decisions have to be

made and many variants may be considered in setting up an appropriate framework. To

make progress in future work, besides gaining experience in using innovation surveys and

improving them, it will be important to be able to match the specific information they

provide with the usual current accounts, balance sheets and stock market data, as well as

with complementary data from other sources such as on patents and R&D. In view of the

fundamental role of research and innovation activities in our increasingly knowledge-

based economies, it will also be of great interest to develop jointly productivity and

innovativity analyses by combining in some systematic way an integrated production and

innovation accounting framework.27

           APPENDIX A: Accounting for Innovation and Measuring Innovativity


        Assume for simplicity that there are only two countries (A and B) and two industries (1 and
2). The expected intensity of innovation, whether unconditional or conditional on being innovative,
that is equations (5) or (6), can be written as (ignoring the firm subscripts to ease notation):
           y = f (C , Z ) = f (α1 + α 2CB + β 2 I 2 , Z )
        where we have taken country A and industry 1 for reference in expressing the general
country and industry specific constant C, with C B being the dummy for country B and I 2 the
dummy for industry 2, and where Z stands for a set of other explanatory variables (or innovation
factors). Note that the function f could as well represent the expected probability to innovate, that
is, equation (4). Note also that we could have made a different choice of normalization (so that for
example the two countries and the two industries be treated symmetrically); our final innovation
accounting decomposition in terms of structural effects and innovativity, as shown in Table A1,
does not depend on it.
        Let y A , y B , and y E be the respective mean values of the observed intensity of innovation
for country A, country B and the average country of reference (say the hypothetical average
European country), and let y* A , y*B , and y*E represent the corresponding expected intensity of
innovation taken at respectively the mean values of the explanatory variables for these three
countries. Assuming for simplicity that we have the same number of observations for the two
countries (or giving them equal weight as we have done in our analysis), we have respectively
                                y A = y * A + e* A = f (α1 + w2A β 2 , Z A ) + e* A

                                y B = y *B + e*B = f (α1 + α 2 + w2B β 2 , Z B ) + e* B

                                y E = y* E + e*E = f (α1 + α 2 / 2 + w2E β 2 , Z E ) + e*E

        where w2E = ( w2A + w2B ) / 2 is the average proportion of firms in industry 2 in the two

countries, Z E = ( Z A + Z B ) / 2 is the average value of Z in the two countries, and e* A , e*B , and e*E

are approximation errors due to the fact that the expected innovation intensity functions f(.) are not
linear. Going one step further, by considering a linear approximation of y* A and y*B around y*E
(i.e., in deviation to the mean values of the explanatory variables for the country of reference), we
can write the two following innovation accounting equations:
        y A = y E + f CE β 2 ( w2A − w2E ) + f ZE ( Z A − Z E ) + f CE (−α 2 / 2) + e A + (e* A − e* E )




                                                              54
            y B = y E + f CE β 2 ( w2B − w2E ) + f ZE ( Z B − Z E ) + f CE (α 2 / 2) + e B + (e* B − e* E )

           where f xE represents the gradient of f(.) with respect to C and Z evaluated at the country of

reference average values for C and Z , and e A and e B are first-order approximation errors. Notice
that e E = (e A + e B ) / 2 = 0.
           The first term of these approximations is the innovation intensity of the average country of
reference. The second and third terms are the deviations from this value of reference (for country A
or B) which are respectively accounted for by the industry effects and the explanatory variables Z,
these two terms summing to what we can label as “structural effects. The last three terms, the
country effect, the first-order approximation error and the non-linearity discrepancy, capture what
we call innovativity, the difference between the observed innovation intensity and the approximate
expected innovation intensity, practically computed as the sum of three first terms. If the function
f(.) was linear, the last two terms would be nil and innovativity will be nothing but the country
effect.28
           The following Table A1 summarizes the resulting decomposition of the country differences
in innovation relative to the average country in terms of the structural effects of the various factors
of innovation taken into account in the analysis and of innovativity. It allows for an easy bilateral
comparison of the innovation performance of the couple of countries considered, or a multilateral
comparison when more than two countries are considered.



   28
        Note that we could have performed a similar decomposition without making a linear approximation. We could
   have computed the effects of each explanatory variable sequentially, by starting from the value of innovation
   intensity taken at the means of all explanatory variables for the country of reference, and replacing them one by
   one by their respective country means. In this case, however, the size of the effects of the different variables
   would not be independent of the order of the sequence. One advantage of the linear approximation, besides
   being quite straightforward, is that the order in which we examine the separate structural effects makes no
   difference.
