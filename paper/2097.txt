     Dynamic efficiency is a central issue in analyses of economic growth, the

effects of fiscal policies, and the pricing of capital assets. In a celebrated

article, Peter Diamond (1965) shows that a competitive economy can reach a

steady state in which there is unambiguously too much capital. In situations

where the population growth rate exceeds the steady state marginal product of

capital, or equivalently the economy is consistently investing more than it is

earning in profit, the economy is said to be dynamically inefficient.     In the

terminology of Phelps (1961), the capital stock exceeds its Golden Rule leveL

A Pareto improvement can be achieved in a dynamically inefficient economy by

allowing the current generation to devour a portion of the capital stock and

then holding constant the consumption of all future generations.

     Recent work suggests that dynamic efficiency is crucial for issues of

positive as well as normative economic analysis. Weil (1986) argues that

dynamic efficiency is a necessary condition for an altruistic bequest motive

to be operative and thus for the Ricardian equivalence theorem of Barro

(1974) to hold. Tirole (1985) shows that speculative bubbles can arise as

rational expectations equilibria of dynamically inefficient economies, but are

ruled out if dynamic efficiency prevails.

    Whether actual economies operate above or below the Golden Rule level of

capital intensity is a question of substantial importance. Many authors take

the position that the United States economy is dynamically efficient. Such a

presumption must underlie optimal growth arguments for increased national

savings, such as those presented by Tobin (1965), Solow (1970), and Feldstein

(1977). These authors base their judgment that the economy is dynamically
                                      —2—


efficient on estimates of the marginal productivity of capital derived from

observed accounting profit rates. Such calculations (e.g., Feldstein and

Summers (1977)) suggest that the marginal productivity of capital is about 10

percent, far above the economy's growth rate, and thus indicate the economy is

dynamically   efficient.

     Yet there is an alternative, and on its face equally plausible, procedure

for judging whether an economy is dynamically efficient --   looking   at the safe

real interest rate, such as the return on Treasury bills. Unlike the

accounting profit rate, the short-term real interest rate can be measured with

little ambiguity, and contains at most a negligible risk premium. Feldstein

(1976), in arguing against the Ricardian equivalence proposition, explicitly

conipares the economy's growth rate and real interest rate. Numerous other

authors in a variety of contexts also note that real interest rates on safe

assets are typically less than economic growth rates. Ibbotson (1984) reports

that the mean real return on Treasury bills over the 1926-1983 period was

roughly zero percent, well under the economy's average growth rate. Data on

other nations, such as those presented by Mishkin (1984), suggest that

interest rates are less than growth rates in other countries as well. This

comparison of real interest rates and growth rates seems to suggest that

mature capitalist economies have overaccumulated capital.

     In abstract growth models like Diamond's, there is no difference between

the marginal product of capital, which might be inferred from data on profits

and the capital stock, and the real interest rate on safe government

securities. Nor are there fluctuations in the economy's growth rate or in the

relative value of capital goods. Such models therefore give little guidance
                                       —3—


 as to which features of actual economies should be examined in assessing

 dynamic efficiency. To address this issue, it is necessary to examine models

 in which profitability, the value of capital, and the growth rate are

 uncertain, so that the distinction between the marginal productivity of

capital and the interest rate on safe government securities is a meaningful

one. This paper examines the conditions for dynamic efficiency in such

models. Our goal is to ascertain what observable features of actual economies

can be used to make inferences about dynamic efficiency and then to assess

whether the United States economy is dynamically efficient.

     We begin by generalizing the original Golden Rule result of Phelps (1961)

and others: an economy is dynamically efficient if it invests less than the

return to capital and is inefficient if it invests more than the return to

capital. This result applies to a stochastic setting with a very general

production technology. In a competitive economy, therefore, the issue of

dynamic efficiency can be resolved by comparing the level of investment with

the cash flows generated by production after the payment of wages. More

metaphorically, the key question is whether the capital sector is on net a

spout or a sink. This criterion has the substantial virtue of not requiring

any information on capital gains and losses, and not requiring the use of

accounting conventions in the measurement of profit. Its application to the

United States economy suggests very clearly that it is dynamically efficient.

The economy has always (since 1929 at least) consumed a substantial portion of

the return to capital. Similar results obtain for other developed capitalist

economies as well.

     While we argue that the net cash flow criterion is the most natural and
general way to think about the issue of dynamic efficiency, much of the

discussion of the issue centers on comparisons of rates of return and growth

rates. We therefore present results characterizing the circumstances under

which a comparison of growth rates and rates of return can determine whether

an economy is dynamically efficient. Our conclusion is that the appropriate

criterion involves evaluations of whether asset returns dominate the growth in

wealth valued in terms of consumption goods. That is, dynamic efficiency

cannot be assessed by comparing the safe rate of interest and the average

growth rate of the capital stock, output, or any other accounting aggregate.

Rather, the safe rate must be compared with the rate of growth of the market

value of the capital stock. In actual economies, where the market value of

existing capital goods fluctuates widely and declines frequently, this

comparison is   unlikely   to render any verdict about dynamic efficiency.

     While these results suggest we are safe in concluding that economies like

that of the United States are dynamically efficient, some troubling questions

remain. Why, if physical assets that always yield a positive return are

available, is the safe rate of interest so low? If the safe rate of interest

is zero or negative, why don't infinitely-lived productive assets have an

infinite value? If the safe rate of interest is below the economy's growth

rate, can't a pay-as-you--go social security system be Pareto-improving? To

address these questions, we present a simple example highlighting the

potential importance of capital price risk in determining asset values. We

show that in a dynamically efficient economy where output evolves as a

geometric random walk with positive drift, the safe rate of interest over all

horizons may at all times be negative. This example makes clear that
                                       —5-


 comparisons of the safe rate of interest and average growth rates are

 misleading for the purpose of assessing dynamic efficiency.

      The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 develops our cash flow

 criterion for assessing the dynamic efficiency of an economy and applies it to

 United States data. Section II considers rate of return criteria for dynamic

 efficiency. Section III highlights the role of capital price risk in

 accounting for the low observed level of safe interest rates. Section IV

 concludes the paper by calling attention to a number of issues requiring

 further research.



I.   A General Criterion for Dynamic Efficiency


     Here we examine a generalization of the economy studied by Diamond

(1965). There are two crucial differences between Diamondts
                                                               overlapping
generations model and ours. First, we allow both the rate of population

growth and the production technology to be stochastic. Second, our production

technology is very general; it allows, as special cases, for costs of

adjustment, time-to-build, vintage capital, and embodied and disembodied

technological progress. Unlike the technology typically assumed in one-sector

growth models, our general production technology allows for fluctuations in

the relative price of claims on existing capital goods and consumption. This

feature of the model is important, because much of the risk associated with

holding capital in actual economies involves uncertainty about capital gains

and losses arising from changes in the relative price of capital.

A.      The Economy

        Each individual lives for two periods and maximizes a

von Neumann—Morgenstern utility function that, for simplicity, is additively

separable over consumption -in the two periods. Thus, individuals maximize



(1.1)       u(c) + Ev(c+1)

where c is the consumption of a young person in period t, c1 is the
consumption of an old person in period t+1, and Et is the expectation

conditional on information available at time t.

        There are Nt individuals in the cohort born at time t. The young supply

their labor inelastically, and the old do not work, so Nt is also the labor

supply in period t. Each young person consumes some of the return to his

labor and invests the rest by buying shares in the new and existing firms that

compose the market portfolio. In old age, he receives dividends from his

shares, sells them ex dividend to the young cohort, and consumes the total

proceeds.

        An individual therefore faces the following budget constraint:


(1.2)        c = w       —
                             Vs
(1.3) c1 =                   +
                                  v1)s
where w. -is the wage,           iS his share of the market portfolio, Vt is the total

value of the market portfolio ex dividend, and           is the total dividend.

Letting Rt+i denote the return on any asset between period t and period t+1,

then the standard first—order condition for capital asset pricing is
                                                            —7—


                             0
                   v (c
                    I
                                 )   R
 (1.4)                                       =
              E[            u' (c)


Equation (1.4) of course holds also for the return on the market portfoUo,

for which               =
                            R1           (Vt+i+Dti)/v.
         A few identities are instructive. Aggregate consumption C is


(1.5)
            Ct              Ntc +          Ntic.
and the aggregate share is Ntst =                      1.   Equations (1.2) and (1.3) therefore

imply that consumption is labor income plus the dividend:


(1.6)               wtNt +
             Ct                      Dt.

                                                   —                               -
Let       be gross output,                             wN   be profit, and
                                                                                       C   be

investment. Equation (1.6) implies

                             —
(L7)         D E

The dividend as we define it equals profit less investment. (Equivalently,

the dividend equals consumption less labor income.) Note that a repurchase of

shares by firms is represented here as a dividend payment. Similarly, a new

equity issue is a negative dividend. The dividend thus represents the net

flow of goods from firms to households (except of course for labor income),

and there is no presumption regarding its sign.1

        Firms produce output from capital and labor. We assume that the

production technology is:


(1.8)             = F(It_l,It_2,...It_n;Nt,øt)
                                           -8-



where       is the gross investment in period t, and 8, is the state of nature

in period t.        Note that the technology expressed in equation (1.8) is very

general. Under the common assumption that capital fully depreciates each

period, each period's investment equals next period's capital stock, so

   =                      A dependence of output on past investment, however,
        F(It_i;Nt,Ot).
arises if there are costs of adjustment of capital. It also arises if, as is

plausible, capital does not fully depreciate each period and the type of

capital built each period varies because of changes in the available

technology.

        We assume that the technology has constant returns to scale. That is,

F(.) is homogeneous of degree one in past investment and current labor supply.

The competitive wage is therefore

(1.9)        wtF(Iti,It.2s...It_n;NtOt)/t

The total return to capital is



(1.10)          =
                     FIt_
where       indicates the partial derivative of F(.) with respect to vintage t-i

investment. We assume that            0. The specification in (1.8) implies

that       E 0 for i > n.    Equation (1.10) says that profits are composed of

return to capital of all vintages.

        An equilibrium of this economy is a set of state-contingent allocations

and market prices that satisfies all the individual and economywide

constraints and that also satisfies the first-order condition (1.4). We are

interested in characterizing the conditions under which such an equilibrium is

dynamically efficient or inefficient.

 B.    Dynamic Efficiency

       Let (°t) be the ex ante utility of generation t given that this

 generation is born in state of nature 0•               That   is,


 (1.11)     (°t) =   u(c'(e))        +
                                         E(v(c             o.
We call an initial equilibrium namically inefficient if it is possible to

 increase cl(05) for some G without decreasing (8t) for any other et; if such

a Pareto improvement is impossible, an equilibrium is yjcjl efficient.

       Consider a social welfare function


           W =
(1.12)
                  v(c)   +
                             t=o
                                   Z 1(;t(Ut)

where g(Q)   is   the weight the social planner gives to

An equilibrium is dynamically efficient if it maximizes social welfare W

for some set of positive weights                   It   is important to stress the nature

of the social welfare function in equation (1.12). In the unfettered

equilibrium, there are no private markets in which individuals can insure

against the state of nature in which they are born. Since our concern in this

paper is the issue of overaccumulation, and not intergenerational

risk—sharing, we do not call an equilibrium inefficient if the absence of

these insurance markets is the only market failure.                  Formally, we allow the

social planner to apply separate social planning weights to the same

individual born in different states of nature.

      We now turn to the principal result of this paper:
                                      —10-


Proposition   1:   If D/V,     0 in all periods and all states of nature, then

the equilibrium is dynamically efficient. If Dt/Vt     -c < 0 in all periods

and all states of nature, then the equilibrium is dynamically inefficient.


This proposition states that if goods are on net always flowing out of firms

to investors, then the equilibrium is efficient. Conversely, if goods are on

net always flowing into firms from investors, then the equilibrium is

inefficient. Our proposition is a generalization of the Golden Rule result of

Phelps (1961): an economy that invests more than its total profit in steady

state is dynamically inefficient.

     The familiar condition from the Diamond model for dynamic efficiency is

that the marginal product of capital (r) exceeds the growth rate of population

(n). Note that the growth rate of population equals the growth rate of the

capital stock in Diamond's steady state. Therefore, since rK is the total

return on the aggregate capital stock K and nK is new investment, the net flow

out of firms (the dividend) is rK - nK.   Hence, while Proposition 1 is much

more general, it is consistent with the traditional criterion in the steady

state of Diamond model.

     The proof of efficiency is in the Appendix. The proof of inefficiency

follows.


C.   Proof of Inefficiency

     Following Cass (1972), we provide a constructive proof of the

inefficiency condition by illustrating a Pareto-improving intervention that is

feasible if the inefficiency condition is satisfied. Suppose that in period 1

the consumption of each old consumer is increased by 6 and the consumption of
                                                —11—


the current young consumers and the consumptions of all future generations are

left unchanged. Clearly, such a change would be Pareto-improving. If such a

change is feasible, then the initial equilibrium was inefficient.

         Since aggregate consumption in period 1 is increased by 5N0, the change

in aggregate investment, d11, is equal to -oN0. This reduction in I implies

that output will be reduced by FdI1 in period 2. Since consumption in period

2 -is to remain unchanged, investment must fall by the same amount as output


(1.13)          d12 =   FdI1.
In each subsequent period the reduction in output must be matched by a fall in

investment of the same magnitude, so that, differentiating the production

function, we obtain

                        n
(1.14)          dlt =   z
                        1=1


         Now define           E dlt/It to be the proportional change in period t investment.

Using this definition and dividing both sides of (1.14) by I, yields a

homogeneous linear difference equation in



(1.15)             =
                        E(FIt./It)t.
If the proportional change in investment               is always finite and approaches

zero as t goes to infinity, then, for an appropriately small 0, the

intervention is feasible. Therefore, if the coefficients FIt /Iti i = 1,

 •   . ,n,   in the difference equation (1.16) are always positive and sum to less

than one, then the intervention is feasible.

         It remains to show that the condition D/V.           -c   < 0 implies that
                                                  —12—



               <   1.    We suppose that D/V -c <              0 and use (1.7) and (1.10)

to obtain



(1.16)      [(EFIt.) -           I]/V -c          <   0.


Observing that 0                   1, equation (1.16) implies
                        It/Vt



(1.17)
            [(tFI.) I)/v                         cI/V < 0.


Equation (1.17) implies directly that



(1.18)
            ZFI./V (1_c)I/V.

Dividing both sides of (1.18) by                      yields


(1.19)                          1 - c   <   1,


which is the condition that coefficients in the linear difference equation

(1.15) sum to less than one. Therefore, if D/V -c < 0, then the proposed

Pareto-improving intervention is feasible.

                                                                                   Q.E.D.


0.   Applying the Cash Flow Criterion

     The criterion derived above for determining whether an economy is

dynamically efficient can be applied relatively easily to actual economies.

Unlike the criteria applied in many previous applications of optimal growth
                                      -13-


models (e.g., Solow (1970)), our criterion does not depend critically on

accounting judgments about depreciation or the measurement of profits in an

inflationary environment. It requires only the comparison of the cash flows

going into and coming out of an economy's production sector.2 As the

preceding discussion makes clear, the applicability of our criterion depends

on the assumption that capital receives its marginal product, an assumption

that excludes the possibility that capital income includes substantial

monopoly profit.

     We apply our criterion to the United States economy and to the economies

of several other major countries. While the theory developed above is most

directly applicable to the economy as a whole, we examine the U.S.

nonfinancial corporate sector as well, for two reasons. First, many popular

discussions of the desirability of increased capital formation refer to

corporate investment rather than investment in housing. Second, in measuring

the rental income generated by owner—occupied housing, one must use estimates

of imputed rents, rather than direct measurements of market transactions.

Fortunately, the calculations for the economy as a whole and the calculations

for the corporate sector yield very similar results. Both suggest that our

criterion for dynamic efficiency has been satisfied by a wide margin in all

years.

     Table I presents information on gross capital income, gross investment,

and their difference, all expressed as fractions of gross national product

(GNP) for the 1929-1985 period. Gross capital income is measured as national

income less employee compensation and an estimate of the labor income of

proprietors plus capital consumption allowances. Alternatively, it can be
                                       —14--



 thought of as the sum of profit, rental, and interest income.3 Gross

 'investment includes investment in both residential and nonresidential capital

 along with increases in inventories. Their difference corresponds to the

 "dividend," D, paid by firms. For the period 1952-1985, for which an estimate

of the market value of the economy's tangible assets is available, the table

 also presents the ratio DIV. which plays a key role in the preceding analysis.

     The data indicate very clearly that capital has consistently generated

more income than has been reinvested. Indeed, the difference between

capital income and investment has exceeded 15 percent of GNP in every year

•sirice 1929. Put differently, the economy has never invested much more than

half of its gross capital income. The final column of the table indicates

 that the dividend generated by capital has consistently exceeded 4 percent of

total wealth. Given the downward trend in the ratio of the dividend to GNP

and the upward trend in the ratio of total wealth to GNP, it is fairly certain

that the dividend generated by capital exceeded 4 percent during the entire

 1929—1985 period.

     Table 2 presents calculations paralleling those in Table 1 for the

nonfinancial corporate sector. Outflow from the nonfinancial corporate sector

 (D) is defined as the sum of dividends, interest payments, and corporate tax

payments, less net financial investments. Except for a statistical

discrepancy, this outflow in turn equals the difference between gross pretax

operating profits and gross capital investment.   (Again, investment is

measured as including both purchases of plant and equipment and increases in

inventories.) In all calculations, the denominator is the market value of the

corporate sector measured as the sum of the market value of outstanding
                                      —15-


equity, and net financial liabilities as reported in the National Balance

Sheets. The results establish that for the 1952-1985 period gross capital

income far exceeded gross investment. Indeed, in most years, the disparity is

somewhat greater for the corporate sector than it is for the aggregate

economy. This finding is not surprising given the heavier tax burdens placed

on corporate capital. It appears clear from these calculations that the

corporate sector is on net productive, in the sense that net outflows of cash

from the corporate sector are positive.

     Table 3 presents values of 0/GNP for England, France, Germany, Italy,

Canada and Japan for the 1960-1984 period. Examining the dynamic efficiency

of economies other than the U.S. economy is of interest because the American

savings rate has traditionally been much lower than that of other countries.

Japan in particular, with its high rate of accumulation and tradition of low

real interest rates, seems a plausible candidate for inefficiency. Yet the

data reveal that our criterion for dynamic efficiency is comfortably satisfied

for all countries in all years. Countries like Japan with higher investment

rates also have higher rates of profit. In 1984, for example, the U.S.

invested 16 percent of GNP and had gross capital cash flow of 28 percent of

GNP. For Japan, the corresponding figures were 28 percent and 38 percent.

     The calculations in Tables 1—3 show that our criterion for dynamic

efficiency has been very decisively satisfied for the worldts major capitalist

economies. Yet as Phelps emphasized in his initial development of the Golden

Rule, a path cannot be judged as dynamically efficient or dynamically

inefficient prior to eternity. That is, dynamic efficiency cannot in

principle be judged by observing only a particular segment of time. These
                                         -16-


calculations do allow us to conclude, however, that if the economy behaves in

the future as it has -in the past, it will be realizing a dynamically efficient

equilibrium.



II. Using Rates of Return to Diagnose Overaccumulation


        In Section I we presented sufficient conditions for dynamic efficiency

and dynamic inefficiency expressed in terms of investment and profit. Much of

the literature on dynamic efficiency expresses the relevant conditions in

terms of rates of return and growth rates. In this section we examine how one

can compare rates of return and growth rates to assess dynamic efficiency.

        Recall that the rate of return on the market portfolio,       is equal to

(vt÷i+Dt41)/vt. Defining            V1/V as the growth rate of the value of

the market portfolio we obtain


(2.1)        RM /6      E   +D   /V
              t+1 t+1         t+1 t+1

Equation (2.1) immediately implies the following corollary to Proposition 1.


Corollary 1: If R/G 1 + c         > 1 in all periods and all states of nature,


then the equilibrium is dynamically efficient. If R/Gt        1 —   £<1   in

all periods and all states of nature, then the equilibrium is dynamically

inefficient.


        Corollary I states that the rate of return on capital can be used in

assessing whether the economy is dynamically efficient. The condition for

efficiency in Corollary 1 will be satisfied if the dividend is always greater
                                        —17-


than zero.

     A more general result is also available for assessing dynamic efficiency.

The competitive rate of return on any other asset can also be potentially

useful in determining whether the economy is dynamically efficient or

inefficient. Let Rt+i be the competitive rate of return between period t and

period t+i on an arbitrary asset. In the Appendix we present an extension of

the proof of Proposition 1 that proves the following Proposition:


Proposition 2:   If there is some asset with rate of return R such that

        1 +      1 in all periods and all states of nature, then the

equilibrium is dynamically efficient. If there is some asset with rate of

return Rt such that          1 -    I   in all periods and all states of nature,

then the equilibrium is dynamically inefficient.


     This result can be applied in the special case of the safe interest rate.

It says that if an economy's safe interest rate is always greater than the

growth rate of the market value of the capital stock, the economy is dynamically

efficient. If the safe rate is always less than the growth rate of the value of

the capital stock, the economy is dynamically inefficient. Neither

proposition is very helpful in judging the dynamic efficiency of actual

economies, where capital gains and losses cause the growth of the market value

of the capital stock sometimes to exceed and other times to fall short of the

safe interest rate. The result here is illuminating primarily in suggesting

that comparisons of safe interest rate with the average growth rate are in

general not sufficient to resolve the issue of dynamic efficiency.

III. Capital Price Risk and the Low Level of Safe Interest Rates


     The previous section suggests that a safe interest rate below an

economy's average growth rate is not sufficient to establish dynamic

inefficiency. This conclusion may at first seem surprising. If all the

investments an economy is making are productive, how can the safe interest

rate be so low? More generally, how can the measured rate of profit suggest

that the marginal product of capital is so high at the same time that the real

interest rate is so low? These questions differ from the puzzle regarding the

equity risk premium raised by Mehra and Prescott (1985). Mehra and Prescott

ask why, given the wide spread between mean equity and debt returns and given

the limited variability of consumption, consumers do not try to borrow to buy

equity, thereby reducing the mean equity premium. Here the question is why

low interest rates can persist given the consistently high level of the

average product of capital. To pose the question starkly, can physical assets

that always yield a positive dividend have a finite value when real interest

rates are zero or negative?

     A basic answer to these questions lies in the notion of capital price

risk. The principal risks associated with the ownership of capital do not

involve the rents it will generate in the succeeding period, but rather

involve the possibility of changes in its market value. Individuals

considering the ownership of capital take account of these risks. Even if an

asset will always be productive, individuals are exposed to the risk that its

price will decline if anticipated future profits fall off, or if the demand

for wealth declines. Such risks explain how a low safe rate can coincide
                                         —19—


permanently with a high rate of profit in a dynamically efficient economy.

        We illustrate this point with a simple example based on Lucas's (1978)

analysis of asset pricing. In contrast to the preceding sections, we assume

here that there is a single representative infinitely lived consumer. Since

the competitive outcome in this case replicates the solution to the social

planning problem of maximizing the utility of the representative consumer, we

know it is dynamically efficient. (As we shall see, application of our

criterion from Section I leads to the same conclusion.) An infinite horizon

example is used to highlight the fact that the importance of capital risk in

no way depends on the finiteness of individual lifetimes.

        Consumers are assumed to maximize the infinite horizon utility function:



(3.1)
             Et 01'u(ct+i)

        The economy's only productive asset is a "fruit tree" whose output

evolves as a geometric random walk with positive drift. It is not possible to

produce or cut down the fruit tree. The output of the fruit tree, all of

which is consumed in each period, thus evolves as:


(3.2)


where g > 0 and       is i.i.d. with zero mean, and   >   -(1+g).   Note that in

this example capital income, D, is always positive and thus always exceeds

the economy's zero level of investment, so our criterion for dynamic

efficiency is satisfied.

     Assets in this economy are easily priced by making use of the consumer's

first-order condition:
                                                 -20—



(3.3)        Et(Rt+iU'(Ct+i)/U'(Ct)) = 1

where       is the gross return on any asset.

        Now suppose the utility function is logarithmic, U(C) =             ln(C),   and recall

that C           so that (3.3) can be written as


(3.4)                                   =   1.

Equation (3.4) can be used to price any asset. In particular, the gross rate

of return on a riskiess asset,                   is constant and given by



(3.5)               =
                        E       [   )
                            t


If the variance of v is sufficiently large, it is clear                     can be less

than one, so that the net interest rate can be negative despite the upward

drift in output.4 Since the safe short-term rate is constant, safe interest

rates over any horizon are also negative as long as output is sufficiently

volatile.

        Equation (3.4) can also be used to determine V, the value of the stock

of fruit trees. Since the rate of return on a fruit tree is (Vt+i +

equation    (3.4) verifies



(3.6)        Vt =   (.L.)D

Despite the uncertainty in this model economy, the dividend-price ratio is

constant. It is straightforward to show that the mean return on the fruit tree

is (1+g)/, regardless of the amount of uncertainty. Hence, increases in
                                      —21—


uncertainty raise the risk premium solely by lowering the risk-free rate.

     This example makes clear that because of asset-price risk, permanently

productive assets can exist in equilibrium with a negative real rate of

interest, and that such a situation can easily be efficient. A lo safe

interest rate, even a negative rate in perpetuity, need not imply that the

economy is overcapitalized.

     The example suggests the limited validity of arguments based on

comparisons of the safe rate of return and the average growth rate of output.

For simplicity, suppose the safe rate is negative and the mean growth rate is

positive. It has been argued that a pay—as-you-go social security scheme that

transferred one dollar from young to old in each period would be Pareto

improving, and so it would. But as long as output can conceivably fall in

each period, the feasibility of such a scheme is not guaranteed. The fact

that output has an arbitrarily high probability of rising as the horizon is

lengthened is not sufficient to assure feasibility. Internally, the argument

here parallels the well-known fallacy regarding the appropriateness of

investing only in high-yielding assets over long horizons, discussed

monosyllabically by Samuelson (1979). In both cases, "almost surely" is not

certain enough.

     Our "fruit tree" example shows that a low safe rate of interest need not

imply dynamic inefficiency. Yet the results of Mehra and Prescott (1985)

suggest that additional considerations, such as market imperfections, may be

necessary to explain the observed low safe rate. The interaction between

these imperfections and dynamic efficiency may be important. For example,

some individuals may be liquidity constrained, so that the relevant interest
                                            —22—


rate for evaluating a hypothetical Social Security scheme exceeds the safe

rate of interest. Considering dynamic efficiency in "distorted" economies is

a worthwhile subject for future research.



IV.   Conclusion

      In   the   literature on optimal accumulation and dynamic efficiency,

substantial intellectual capital has been put into place since the early

1960s. Yet despite this investment and the growing policy concern over

capital formation, no clear answer has emerged as to whether actual economies

are dynamically efficient. To address the issue of dynamic efficiency in

practice, it      is   imperative to recognize the impact of uncertainty on

production, investment, and growth. The goal of this paper has therefore been

to extend dynamic efficiency results to an uncertain world.

      Our central finding is simply expressed. If the capital sector is

regularly contributing to the level of consumption, then the economy is

dynamically efficient. If it is a continual drain, then the economy is

inefficient. In the United States, profit has exceeded investment in every

year since 1929. This finding leads us to conclude that the United States

economy is dynamically efficient.

      Established tradition suggests that dynamic efficiency is to be evaluated

by comparing growth rates and rates of return on assets. In an uncertain

world, there is no Obvious metric for economic growth; nor is there a single

rate of return. The appropriate indicator of dynamic efficiency is the rate

of growth of the value of the capital stock, as measured in consumption goods.
                                        -23-


 If the rate of return on any asset dominates this rate, the economy is

 dynamically efficient. If the return on any asset is dominated by this rate,

 the economy is dynamically inefficient. While this rate-of-return criterion

 is theoretically valid, we believe it is less useful in practice than the

cash flow criterion for assessing dynamic efficiency.

     We started this analysis with the troubling observation that real

interest rates are startlingly low. We reassured ourselves by demonstrating

that low, or even negative, safe rates, even in perpetuity, need not indicate

dynamic inefficiency. Our fruit-tree example suggests that asset price risk

could in principle explain the low safe rate, but we have made no attempt to

measure this risk.5

     Our conclusion that the United States economy is dynamically efficient

has several important corollaries. First, Tirole (1985) shows that rational

speculative bubbles are ruled out in dynamically efficient economies.6 We

suspect, but have not proven, that Tirole's result generalizes to economies

with uncertainty. Our results thus call into doubt the existence of rational

bubbles of the sort Tirole examines.7

     Second, Weil (1986) shows that an interior bequest motive, of the sort on

which Barro (1974) relies, can be ruled out in dynamically inefficient

economies. Again, we suspect that this result generalizes to uncertain

settings. Our finding of dynamic efficiency, however, suggests that such a

bequest motive cannot be ruled out. In contrast to the conclusion of

Feldstein (1976), the low safe rate of interest may not preclude Ricardian

equivalence.

    While it is comforting that our cash flow criterion leads unambiguously
                                       —24-


to the conclusion that our economy is dynamically efficient, several questions

remain open for future research. The most important direction for future

research is the evaluation of alternative dynamic paths using stronger

criteria than the dynamic efficiency criterion. Our criterion is the dynamic

analogue of the standard Pareto criterion. The dynamic efficiency test is

therefore relatively weak --   passing it does not imply that a path is
desirable for any very attractive social welfare function. Results

characterizing the social welfare functions necessary to justify particular

paths would aid in evaluating and ranking them.

     The importance of going beyond the Pareto criterion is greater in the

context of dynamic efficiency than in the normal static context. As we have

already noted, a path cannot be judged as dynamically inefficient prior to

eternity, because there is always the possibility that "excess" capital will

be consumed later. Using social welfare functions would permit, at least

sometimes, judgments that regardless of what happened in the indefinite

future, certain policies maintained over finite intervals would be

undesirable. Putting the point differently, the use of social welfare

functions would make possible the evaluation of alternative social decision

rules for determining the level of investment.

     Risk-sharing considerations, which we have systematically excluded from

our analysis, provide yet another reason for introducing a social welfare

function. Programs such as social security have the ability to spread risks

across generations. We dodged the possibility of ex ante risk-spreading

bargains by treating individuals born at the same time under different

realizations of the world as being on different, separately evaluated paths.
                                      -25-


But given that social security or tax and expenditure policy can promote

ex ante risk spreading, such risk spreading could be considered in studies

that follow.

If the initial equilibrium satisfies these conditions for some set of positive

weights            and multipliers A(E), the equilibrium is efficient.

        Equation (A.3) defines the initial Lagrangian multiplier A0. Equations

(A.4) and (A.5) then uniquely define all multipliers A(Ot) and social planning

weights            given the initial equilibrium. Thus, to show that the

equilibrium solves a planning problem, we need only show that (A.6) and (A.7)

are satisfied.

        The first-order condition (A.6) follows from the capital market

equilibrium condition (1.4). To see this, let q÷. be the price (relative to

consumption) at the end of period t+j of a unit of investment installed in

period t. Observe q =            1   and q = 0.       Let            be the rate of return

The second term can now be written using (A.8) as the sum of A(9t+i)V(t+i) and

a remainder, producing

The third term of (A.16) can be rewritten as

by beginning the index at j              at   one rather than zero. This expression is now

identically

Therefore, returning to (4.16),

Noting   that Dt+1 =           -              we obtain



(4.21)     Zx(e)V(et) =                   (1+D+1/V+1)A(Bt+1)V(et+i).
                                                -30-


By hypothesis, Dt+i/Vt+i              0,    which implies


(A.22)      ZAEtV(et) ? (1+c) A(Ot+i)V(8t+i)
                                      t+1


Recursive substitution shows


(A..23)     IX(G)V(e)            (l+c)tA0V0.



Since c >   0, (A.23) implies the tranversality condition is satisfied.
      In this case, the equilibrium can be represented as the optimum of the

social planning problem defined above.

                                                                            Q.E.D.


Proof of Proposition 2:

      The capital market equilibrium condition (1.4) implies that


(A.24)                R(Ot+i)p(Ot+ijUt)vt(c+i(Ot+i))/ut(c(Ut)) = I



Setting j equal to zero in (A.11) and substituting into (A.24) yields

(A.25)      A(et) =
                      et+1I et

from which it follows

(A.26)      A(Ot)V(et) =
                             t+1 t
Recalling that G(et+i) E                          equation (A.26) implies
                                 V(O+1)/V(9t),
(A.27)      A(et)V(Ot) =          Z

                             t+1 t
Now sum both sides of (A.27) over              to obtain
                                                   —31—


(A.28)        t x(e)V(e) =
                                   9E
                  t                t+1

Therefore, if R(6t+j)/G(Ot+i)                1 + c > 1, then (A.22) and (A.23) hold, which

verifies the transversality condition. In this case, the equilibrium can be

represented as the optimum of the social planning problem defined above.

      If R(e+1)/G(e+1)             I — c < 1, then

(A.29)        E
                      x(et)V(et)   (1-.c)Z
               t                           t+1
Recursive substitution yie1ds


(A.30)        E A(e)V/(9)           (1c)


(A.30) implies the transversality condition cannot be satisfied. Hence, the

equilibrium cannot maximize any social welfare function of the form in

equation (1.12).

      Note that the social welfare function in (1.12) is linear in c2(o). This

proof can be applied to a general social welfare function that is non-linear

in cz(e.t).    In this case, i(Gt) can be interpreted as the derivative of social

welfare with respect to                  evaluated at the equilibrium.

                                                                                   Q.E.D.

1.     If new firms are regularly being started with new equity issues, the

aggregate dividend as we define it may always be negative, even when existing

firms always pay positive dividends.

2.     That it is easier to measure cash flow than economic income has been a

major theme in discussions of the consumption tax, such as those presented in

Pechman (1983).

3.     As noted above, rental income includes imputed rent on owner-occupied

housing. The imputed rent estimates in the National Income Accounts upon

which we rely indicate that the gross rental rate on owner-occupied housing is

considerably lower than the rate on other kinds of capital. Thus, excluding

owner-occupied housing would reinforce our conclusion.

4.     Suppose that 1+g+v is lognormally distributed with mean 1+g. In this

case, ln(i+g+v1) - N(gi,a      )    an

(Fl)        E(l+g4v1) = exp(ji       +


(F2)        E[(1+g+v41)] =         exp(—M +

It follows from (Fl) and (F2) that

(F3)        E[(1+g+vt+i)') =       exp(a2)/E(1+g+v+1).
Recalling that E(1+g+v1) = 1+g and substituting (F3) into (3.5) yields
             F                           2
(F4)        Rt+i =   [(1+g)/]exp(—a
For sufficiently large a2, RF will be less than one.

5.     The results of Mehra and Prescott (1985) suggest that observed

consumption variability cannot itself explain the spread between the return on

capital and the safe rate of interest. Our point is that a low safe rate is
                                        -33-

not,   in itself, inconsistent 'dth dynamic efficiency.

6.     Tirole shows that bubbles can drive an economy to the Golden Rule. Our

finding of a strictly positive dividend indicates that the capital stock is

strictly below the Golden Rule, in which case bubbles cannot exist.

7.     Of course, our results do not speak to the possibility of irrational

bubbles, or fads, such as those discussed by Shiller (1984) and Summers

(1986).

            capital consumption allowances less wages and salaries and
            67 percent of proprietors' income which is imputed to labor.
            This imputation is discussed in Christianson (1971).

           income of proprietors. As discussed by Sachs (1979), this
           approximation is quite innocuous. For the United State, the
           adjustment is equal to about 4 percent of GNP.
