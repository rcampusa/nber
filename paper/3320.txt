           PREDICTING EXCHANGE RATE CRISES:       MEXICO REVISITED


                                   ABSTRACT

This  paper predicts ex—ante the probability of currency crises end size of
expected devaluations month by month for Mexico between 1980 and 1986
using a heterodox linear discrete time model of exchange rate crises. The
forces contributing to speculative attacks on the Mexican peso include internal
money creation, external credit shocks, and relative price shocks. The
framework proves highly successful for generating forecasts of the probability
of speculative attacks on the peso and for predicting lower bounds for post—
collapse exchange rates using a range of assumptions about critical levels of
central bank reserve floors. Simulation results suggest that reducing domestic
credit growth, increasing the uocertainty surrounding this growth, and reducing
the size and perhaps increasing the frequency of currency realignments might
have greatly reduced the amount of currency speculation against the peso in
some of the crisis periods between 1980 and 1986.

Introduction1
The theory of exchange rate crises      has received considerable attention in recent       years2
because of both the legacy of the debt crisis of the early 1980s and the sharp exchange

rate realignments of the mid 1980s. Though there has been no shortage of actual crises,

very few   attempts have   been made   at applying   and testing crisis models.   In this paper a
discrete time model of     a collapsing exchange regime is applied to the experiences of
Mexico, 1980 to 1986. The model is used to assess the probability that the existing
controlled exchange rate will be collapsed by a speculative attack on central bank foreign

exchange reserves. It also is used to generate forecasts of lower bounds for sustainable

post—collapse exchange rates.

           An exchange rate crisis can take the form of either     a discrete devaluation      of   a
controlled exchange rate or a switch to a floating rate accompanied by a sharp
speculative attack on central bank holding of foreign exchange reserves. The dynamics of
the collapse as rooted in domestic money market equilibrium when there is excess
domestic credit creation, money market equilibrium can be achieved through offsetting

reductions in central bank foreign exchange reserves or by exchange rate adjustment
Flood and Garber (1984)1. Under     a   fixed (or controlled) rate regime, as long     as   foreign

exchange reserves remain in positive supply, monetary authorities can succeed at
sustaining the exchange rate through the purchase of domestic currency and sale of

foreign exchange reserves, If speculators perceive that an attack on central bank reserves

can force the exchange rate to be devalued and the exchange regime abandonned, they

will deplete reserves by their

overvalued currency and force the realignment. Models of collapse endogenously predict

the timing and probability of speculative attacks and forecast lower bounds for the post-

collapse exchange rates.
          The potential of this line of research has already been demonstrated. For
exacople, van Wijnbergen (1987) shows that the sustainability of the move from a
fiexibie to a fixed exchange rate as undertaken in Brazil, Israel and Argentina with the
iotent   of    controlling runaway inflation can be severeiy limited by the pursuit of
inconeistent monetary and fiscal policies. Blanco and Garber' s (1986) application of a

coliaoee model to the Mexican experience [1973 to 1982 illustrated the predictive

potential of these models concluding that "devaluations, both in and out of sample, did
occur when      the conditional   exchange rate eet by the central   hank's   policy rule exceeded

the fixed exchange rate... Furthermore, the expected exchange rates conditional on
devaluation are close to the values that actually materialized in the major episodes."

Gumby and van Wijnhergen's (1988) application of a similar model              to the crawling peg

experience of Argentina [1979 and 1981[ led them         to conclude that the domestic credit
growth strategy pursued by the Argentine government nearly conp1eteiy undermined the

announced crawling exchange rates.

              While these studies provide evidence for the qualitative and intuitive success of

applying these linear discrete time models, the results can             be improved     upon and
broadened in a number of dimensions. Restrictive assumptions prevailing in previous

studies include strict purchasing—power—parity (PPP), interest rate parity, and the

unresponsiveness of the demand for real balances to currency substitution motives. In

addition, a richer specification of the forces contributing to crises can he modelled. While
domestic credit shocks are still expected to be the dominant force in triggering



                                                 —3--
speculative attacks on      a currency, the Goldberg modification of Flood and Garber is
applied in     this paper to also track the   significance of external credit shocks and relative

price shocks. It is shown that the relative price shocks played an important in role in
the dynamics of the peso crises This is not the case for external credit shocks in the
1980s.

                The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the
extended collapse model. Section       II provides a summary of the currency history for
Mexico in the 1980s. Section III presents the procedures used for data analysis and

describes the iterative estimation procedure used for generating month—by—month

predictions of post—collapse exchange rates and collapse probabilities for Mexico. Section
IV provides out—of—sample estimates of predicted shadow exchange rates and collapse

probabilities under    a range of assumptions, including structural breaks    in money demand

behavior. Out—of—sample forecasts are compared with those generated by Blanco and

Garber for a subperiod of our study. Section V analyzes the forces contributing to

Mexico's crises and provides simulations of crises under different patterns of shocks to
the Mexican economy. Section VI concludes.

1. The Extended Collapse Model

The discrete—time model relies on a money market equilibrium condition which
determines either the equilibrium exchange rate under a flexible exchange system or the

endogenous path of central bank reserves under a controlled rate system? The demand
for real money balances is elastic with respect to nominal interest rates          [ij, domestic
real income [yj, and the desire to substitute domestic currency for foreign currency when

there   is   some expectation of a change in the nominal exchange rate, St.

Domestic credit creation (and domestic spending excesses) are viewed as the primaty

reason   for    reserve depletion and an eventual exchange regime collapse. Thus, the

domestic credit component              of   the money supply is modelled as evoIing according to a

trend rate     that reflects the mean            basic deficit       fpl.

The shocks      to    domestic credit creation are generally treated as random disturbances

analytically similar     to a first         order process dciving domestic credit creation [Blanco and

Garber (1986)]. Cumby and van Wijnbergen (1988) interpret domestic credit expansion as

mirroring trend fiscal deficits,   ,., subject   to random disturbances    €.   However, these

disturbances may be decomposed by source: i) random revenue or expenditure affecting
the   need to monetize government deficits -y,j; and ii) random and constrained access          to
external credit that makes uncertain the share of government deficits to be financed by
external borrowing    J    instead of inflationary finance.5 By construction    and     are   the

orthogonal components of these net revenue and external credit shocks.

If, in any period, expansion of domestic credit is too large to be absorbed by the
demand for real balances, equilibrium in the money market
                    = Md                                                                  (8)
is restored by adjustment of the exchange rate in      a flexible rate system or   by offsetting

movements of the central bank reserve stock under        a controlled rate system. Prolonged
difficulties for the central bank arise when this depletion of foreign exchange reserves is

the outcome of fundamental disequilibrium (systematic overvaluation) rather than
transitory events. The resulting systematic decline of reserves may lead economic agents
to doubt the ability of the central bank to sustain the controlled rate. Agents may
initiate speculative attacks on the currency which can fulfil their own expectations by

collapsing the exchange rate lObstfeld (1986)1.
          The ahadow exchange rate, S÷1, defines the exchange rate that would
equilibrate the money market in t+1 if a speculative attack were to drive reserves to
their minimal level and force the collapse of the controlled exchange rate. Under
domestic currency convertibility, if agents are cumulatively powerful enough to deplete

existing stock of central bank foreign exchange reserves, speculators will attack reserves

  5The treatment of this second source of shock alternatively can be interpreted as
  randomizing the level of net central bank reserve floors.

at the moment such behavior is        expected    to yield profits. By equations   1 through 8, the

period   t+1 shadow exchange rate      is   derived as:

t+=    {1/at+i{p*t+i±at+i(ot÷i+pt,i)}{(a.+a3+at+i)/at+j}pt+i+D+ R0+(7÷l—t÷1)} (9)
Relative price shocks,      if positive, put downward pressure on the exchange rate by
increasing real money demand for transactions purposes. Internal government basic budget

shocks,       increase devaluation pressure by increasing the amount of fiscal monetizing.
External credit supply shocks,     if positive, decrease the pressure on the exchange rate by
reducing the need for domestic credit creation.
           The conventional approach is to define            ir,
                                                         the probability of a (successful)
speculative attack in the beginning of t+1 as assessed in period t, as analogous to the
probability that the expected post—attack exchange rate will exceed the controlled exchange

random components to the right—hand side of the bracketed expression, and all
'fundamental' variables to the left hand side,            the conditional probability of speculative
attack or collapse is:
              = Pr {                                  < K1 }                                 (11)

This result states that the probability of          a speculative attack on foreign currency reserves
depends on agents' forecasts of          the evolution of a range of economic variables which include

domestic credit growth, the systematic overvaluation of domestic goods (pt+i' 0), and the

possible magitudes of internally and externally generated economic shocks.
II. The Mexican Experience
The events surrounding the Mexican crises of the 1980s are by now familiar. Following a long

period of exchange stability and conservative monetary policy,                         The abundance     of

petrodollars in the late 1970s helped the stability of the reigning highly controlled float. This
remained in place until early 1981 when a swifter rate of currency depreciation against the
dollar   [8   to   10 percent per month[ was announced along with            a promise of no major sharp
adjustments. Soon afterwards, currency speculation rose, capital flight increased, and vast
amounts of money were shifted into investments and real estate in the United States. In early

1982 new credit flows         to   Mexico levelled, marking    the end   of the rapid expansion of private

and official commitments Mexico. The Mexican government was able to defend the exchange
rate until February 1982 when the government withdrew support of the peso in foreign
exchange markets. The exchange rate regime collapsed into                  a temporary float and the peso
depreciated by 67.7 percent. Though July 1982 may be                     considered the start of Mexico's


  81f shocks were assumed to be normally distributed, rather than exponentially distributed,
  the probability density function for the combined random variables would not be nearly
  as tractable. The solution would be
  ir(t)=Jt1)        f                                      (X—Z)
  The exponential distribution is also intuitively appealing since 2/2o]dXdZ.
                                                                   it highlights the potential
  for large one—sid3ed expansions of domestic credit while ruling out the unlikely
  corresponding contractions which appear under the normal distribution

rationed access to external credit, patterns of total debt service and totai new commitments

show   that   new loans directed   at sustaining the      fixed rate were scarce as early as 1980.   Total
debt service exceeded total new commitments by steadily rising amounts between 1980 and

1985. Between 1982     and   1983 new credit   to   Mexico fell by approximately 40 percent.9

          Triggered by the onset of the Mexican debt crisis, in August 1982 the government
again succumbed to market speculation and withdrew support for the peso. The collapse led
to a temporary closing of all foreign exchange markets and the implementation of a two tier

exchange system.

          The two tier system was replaced by a crawling peg in September 1983. The crawl

provided for daily peso depreciations at a rate       of   13   centavos to the dollar. In December 1984
the slippage rate was increased to 17 centavos per dollar per day. In March 1985 the slippage

rate increased once again, this time to 21 ceotavos per day. This crawl remained until July

1985 when  the government devalued the controlled rate by 16.7 perceot, before abandonniog
the crawling rate altogether in August 1985 in favor of a controlled float. The controlled float
was intended to provide for daily adjustments of the exchange rate to compensate for the

inflation differential between the United States and Mexico. In practice, the exchange regime

was similar to the crawling peg which preceded it.

          Based on this credit and currency history, the collapse model for fixed or crawling
rate systems is most appropriately applied to the            1980 to 1986 period for Mexico. Although

Mexico's externally credit constrained interval begins in 1980 and the tightly controlled
exchange regime formally ends in August 1985, results are generated for various subperiods of
the full sample. The results for 1980:12 through 1982:9 overlap with the interval studied by

Blanco and Garber using quarterly       data   11980:IV—1982:IIII.

of domestic credit and its randomness. After generating                          forecasts, a residual series

                         is constructed. This series is used for decomposing domestic credit

prediction errors by source, either:          1)   domestic monetary and fiscal authorities (internally

generated shocks); or ii) foreign creditors (externally generated shocks). Using rolling
regression over ex—post        data for the        18   quarters prior to each period t, the portion        of

domestic credit shocks attributable to the behavior of external creditors is isolated                       by

regressing      against ex—post externally supplied credit,         F. This generates an     estimate of the

component of domestic credit shocks linked in any way to the change in the supply of net
external credit to Mexico. It is interpreted as the externally induced shock and                   is formally

written as        =            The remaining portion of domestic credit shocks is interpreted as

that directly induced by domestic authorities:               by   construction these are the orthogonal
residuals, 1c =     —
                          Rolling samples of                      and    y   are analyzed to   generate the
distributions of expected externally and internally generated shocks to domestic credit. The

standard deviation of the data for            18 months, inclusive of        t, is taken to be the period
forecast   of   the standard deviation of shocks expected in t±1,                            and
Domestically induced credit variability generally increased gradually throughout the sample
with the exception of step increases in early and mid—1982, late 1983, and mid—1984.

Externally induced credit variability increased sharply in              mid— 1982,   at the time of the debt
crisis, and began     to subside in early     1984 before sharply and continually rising in the         latter
part of 1984, and again       in late 1985.

         This method of decomposition presents an interesting bias to the estimation results.
If the correlation between foreign credit contractions and domestic expansions is            positive, the
random behavior of domestic monetary authorities is biased downward. Since the positive
correlation is extremely likely, this implies an implicit upward bias on the role of external

credit shocks in Mexico's currency crises. Alternatively stated, this approach may understate
the role of domestic monetary authorities since      it conservatively estimating their contribution
to the forces which trigger speculation and   lead   to the collapse of   an exchange rate system.      Tf

the results still suggest the overwhelming importance of uncertainty attributable to domestic

monetary authorities, arguments which shift the emphasis to the actions of external creditors
would not be highly credible.

         The scale of domestic credit uncertainty surrounding domestic credit policies of

monetary authorities grew fairly steadily between 1980 and                1987,   Marked increases in
uncertainty levels are evident in early 1982, prior to the poignant currency and debt crises of
the 1982/1983 period, and in early 1985 prior to the abandonment of the crawling psg

regime. Uncertainty surrounding external credit flows was fairly stable           at low levels through
June of 1982. At the time of the debt crisis and the temporary closing of Mexico's foreign

exchange market in August 1982, uncertainty surrounding foreign credit flows substantially
rose and remained at new high levels through early              1984. A      substantial rise in the
uncertainty surrounding external credit flows to Mexico occured throughout the remainder of
1984 and peaked1° in February 1986.   A highly controlled float was        in effect   at that point.

  15The peak described is local since the uncertainty surrounding external credit flows
  declined sharply in 1986 and' early 1987 before reaching new highs in mid 1987 and 1988.

            To capture the role of departures from purchasing power parity (PPP) during crisis

periods,11 patterns of deviations from         PPP, P—S1P, are decomposed into the sum of
systematic (predictable using period     t—1   information) and random components,       1p and
            Pt/st_P.1    —       +a                                               (13)

The predictable component is used to generate forecasts of expected future deviations from

         1p1÷1, and   the residual relative price    shocks. As in the case of monetary shocks,    the
expected future distribution     of relative price   shocks can be parameterized to yield    a forecast
of    the expected standard deviation of relative price shocks, 1/w1,1.12 Evolution of the
random component of purchasing power parity deviations is illustrated by the plot of 1/1w÷1

in Figure 3. Prior to the February 1982 steep devaluation of the peso, the markets perceived

relatively low levels of risk associated with relative price movements. Due to the sharp
realignments in 1982, the risk associated with relative prices soared, peaking in mid 1982 but

remaining     at exceptionally high levels through        1984. A period   of relative price stability
occured during the crawling rate interval between mid—1984 and mid—1985. With the
abandonment of the crawl in favor of a controlled float in late                 1985,    relative price
uncertainty increased substantially but by no means approached the levels of the 1982
through early 1984 interval.

             R1+1 also must be specified before the system is estimated. While the lowest
levels of   reserves that the central bank will tolerate at any time t may be known by central

bankers, these values are unavailable publicly until the regime collapses.13 Blanco and Garber

     '1Previous empirical studies of crises did not fully capture these forces leading to
     estimation biases. While Blanco and Garber allowed for random deviations from
     purchasing power parity, Cumby and van Wijnbergen considered neither systematic or
     random departures from purchasing power parity.
     12Using the criterion of out—of—sample predictive performance, an ARMA procedure
     predicted relative price gaps with systematically smaller forecast errors than richer
     alternative approaches applied.
     3Efforts by Goldberg (1988) to pin down patterns in R using cross country analyses
     revealed only that the level is inversely related to access to international liquidity.

and vao Wijnbergen assumed the reserve floor was described by                  a uniform distribution with
an upper bound as        the current       level of reserves and the lower bound as minus                 the central
hank's     gross foreign liabilities. While    both are reasonable approaches to this          illusive statistic,

a conservative test      of   the   out—of—sample predictive performance           of this   model frames the

choice of anad hoc specification over the use of ex—post information. To highlight the
importance of the reserve floor specification for the results, all estimation results are
conducted separately for       a range      of reserve floors between R,=—$200 million and                 Si    billion

1977 US dollars. The negative reserve floors are included to capture the perception that the

central bank may have had access to emergency lines of credit for the purpose to defending
the currency. Real reserve finors are translated from dollars into nominal domestic currency

(billions of pesos) using     the   official exchange   rats and the Mexican consumer price               index.

iterative Estimation of Money Market Ecuilibrium

The next step in estimating the collapse model is to estimate money demand parameters.
Since one of the right hand side variables, the expected change in the exchange rate, is a

nonlinear function     of money demand parameters a multi—stage iterative estimation procedure
is   applied to equations Ii to      15   drawn from the model of Section II.

Step 1: Start—up values of a3, a1, and           a2   are generated by estimating the money market

equilibrium condition, omitting the currency substitution term. This system is roughly
comparable in structure to those of previous studies, except that those studies omitted the

currency substitution term.
Step 2: The first—pass values of the parameters and the start—up value for parameter              a3

are input into equations   12   through   15   to generate first pass—estimates of the post—collapse
shadow rate and the collapse probability.14 In this step the information on the composition
and distribution of shocks and data forecasts are utilized.

Step 3: The money market equilibrium condition is reestimated using shadow rate and

probability estimates from the previous pass. New parameter estimates are generated,
Step 4: New parameter estimates are used in equations              12   through 15 to generate   new

estimates of the post—collapse shadow rate and the collapse probability.

attainment of local maximum within a finite number of passes through the dataJ5


IV. Estimation Results

The model is estimated using        a range      of assumptions over     parameter stability within
intervals and a range of reserve floors. While the full sample of data spans 1980:12 to


 14S(t+1) is the announced one—period ahead exchange rate. The final results are locally
 independent of the choice of start up value for a3.
 151n practice, the system generally is estimated for up to 15 passes through the data.
 Although the parameter estimates converged to stable values in most runs, it is unknown
 whether the final values represented local or global maxima. Other estimation issues arise
 because the generated first pass estimates of a3, a1 and a2 are subject to omitted
 variables bias to the extent that the expected change in the exchange rate is correlated
 with the interest rate and income. This bias reduces to a function of the covariance of
 nominal domestic credit with nominal interest rates and real income respectively. While
 the convergence results suggest that this omitted variables bias disappears, it is unclear if
 there is any residual effect on final parameter estimates.

1986:12,16 estimation over subihtervals provides evidence         that   money demand was unstable

over   this period.   Below, results are presented for the pre—1983:10 and post 1983:9 periods.

The break point is the time of implementation of the crawling peg regime. In the early

interval, money demand shows         a positive and significant income elasticity of demand,         as

expected. The interest sensitivity and currency substitution motives for money demand

holdings are both positive and significant in this early period, with the sign reversal
contrary to expectations. In the post 1983:9 interval, the elasticity of money demand to the
interest rate was the only significant term in the money- demand equation.
           For the early interval, the higher the reserve floor the higher the prediction of a

currency collapse. The one—period—ahead collapse probability predictions are shown in

Figure 5 for the range of reserve floors        [$—100   million , $000 , $100 million, $200 million,
$300 million, and $500 million in 1977 priced.

           While runs over the different coilapse probabilities all behave qualitatively similar,

the higher reserve floor estimates,                are associated with higher predictions of
                                             as expected,

collapse probabilities and slightly different shadow exchange rate forecasts since different
money demand parameter estimates are used in generating the forecasts. Figures 5 and 6

present the estimates of one period ahead probabilities of collapse for            a range   of reserve

floors and actual exchange rates alongside predicted shadow exchange rates for the case

R=$200 million (in       1977 prices).

           Collapse probabilities were uniformly high in November 1981, but the central bank
did not experience a level of run which would cause           a currency   collapse. Since the model is
of the behavior of a representative agent, this result would imply that the agents were
confident that the central bank had access to external credit which would enable it to

  leWhile the sample estimated begins in 1980:12, the full sample of the data begins in
  1977. This data is not used in estimation since at least 36 months of observations are
  lost due to the procedures used for forecasting the various series.

withstand speculation. While skepticism remained high for many types of agents, using
reserve floors to approximate type, the shadow exchange rate results suggest that the scale
of devaluation was underpredicted by even the high reserve floor model. This steep
devaluation convinced the low reserve floor agents of the short term sustainability of the

peso, but the high floor agents were less sanguine- By April 1982, expansionary monetary

policies undermined the restored confidence in the peso leading low reserve floor agents to

predict an additional 4 percent devaluation and the high reserve floor agents to predict an
additional 16 percent devaluation. Central bank foreign exchange reserves began to fall

dramatically, although they were not instantaneously depleted. The shadow rate results

suggest that the predicted devaluation rose steadily though the course of the speculative
attack on central bank reserves in the months which followed, The devaluation predictions

rose   to the range   of 23   to   32 percent by August 1982   at which time all    agents17 predicted

the    demise of   the peso, and again to the range      of 36 and 45 percent by November. The

devaluation in December was 93 percent of the previous month's peso value.
            This major realignment temporarily satisfied the more optimistic, low reserve floor

agents, but did not satiate the more critical, high reserve floor agents who predicted that
an additional      10 percent devaluation would be needed in January 1983. This implies         that,
depending on the composition of agents in the economy, the dual exchange rate initiated at
the start   of 1983 may have been set       at overvalued levels. For all reserve   floor simulations,

the prevailing exchange rates         soon were undermined by     the quickened pace     of domestic

credit expansion and inflation.
            Interval estimates strongly suggest a structural shift in money market activity        at
around this period. This is not surprising, given the realization of the magnitude of the
debt crisis, the implications for future credit flows and the restructuring of the foreign

exchange   rate regime. While numerous estimates were conducted        over a range   of subsampels
of the full   data set, the money demand estimates    over   the   full sample 1980:12—1986:12 are

meaningless because of the structural instability and generally are uninformative for the
latter half of the sample. Therefore, below the probability of collapse figures represent
probabilities generated for the 1983:10 to 1986:12 under the assumption that the parameters
estimated for the early interval were still valid for the latter interval.

           The results suggest that the rate of crawl for the peso was inadequate at least
through August 1984. The significant increase in uncertainty surrounding money creation

appears to have dominated the ir, jump ohserved in December 1983. The subsequent
contraction of domestic credit in January 1984 lowered collapse expectations but generally

failed to restore faith in the sustainability of the existing crawl.

        The sharp rise in domestic credit creation forecasts and the high levels of
surrounding uncertainty contributed to the April 1984 predictions of a more steeply
devalued peso. As foreign exchange reserves fell sharply in that period, some measure of
confidence in the peso crawl was restored by the monetary authorities pulling in on the

reigns of domestic credit. A full scale speculative attack appears to have been averted. For
the remainder of 1984, the peso followed a rate of crawl which, according to the collapse

estimates, was sufficient to minimize currency speculation. The increase in the rate of crawl
in December 1984 was associated with an interval of peso strength in the sense of

accumulating foreign exchange reserves. The increase in uncertainty surrounding external
credit flows appreared to have little effect on shifting   ir to critically   high levels. Moreover,
the model predicts that collapse probabilities remained close to zero for the remainder of
the sample. This could suggest that confidence in the peso was restored by the successful

application of the crawl and the controlled float that followed. However, these resolts could
also reflect a problem with the application of   the collapse model to this latter interval.



                                              —17—
           Blanco and Gerber (1986) had modelled speculation against the peso using

quarterly data for the 1973:IV to         1982:111   interval, a single reserve floor and using   a more
simplified framework. While       that paper greatly      enriched our understanding of the potential

of such models, the         broader framework developted and estimated herein provides more
plausible shadow exchange rate and collapse probability values and much greater insight
into the forces driving crises in the overlapping interval.
VI. Decomposition of "Cause&        of the Currency       Crises: Simulation Results

In this section, the    set of parameter values associated with each reserve floor are used in
generating probability and shadow exchange rate values for a range of scenarios.
Specifically, the pre 1983:10 interval estimations using R values ranging from —$100
million to $500 million (in         1977    dollars) generated the sets       of   parameter estimates
presented in Table     1.

    The constant term was insignificantly different from zero             in all runs and is

These sets   of parameters are    used in simulations which generate the shadow exchange           rates
and collapse probability estimates under the assumption that these parameters values
persisted and for eaeh of the exercizes shown in Table 2. The results generated are for the

Figures 7 through 10 show probability rate estimates for                  a representative subset   of these

runs. The results shown are for the csse of R0=$100 million (1977 dollars).
           The first striking results     is   that increasing the variability     of internally generated

shocks generally decreases        rather than   increases the probability      of a speculative attack on
the peso. (See Figure 7.) Although counter—intuitive, Goldberg (1989) noted                     that this
theoretical possibility arise when      1/A11 is sufficiently     large so that further increases in the
stochastic behavior of domestic credit decrease the expectation that the shadow rate will

exceed   the controlled rate in the     following period. Consider the role of these shocks in the
1981:6 thrnugh 1983:9 interval. If the variability of internally generated shocks were halved,

currency speculation (if positively related to          ir1)   is predicted to have been even higher in
the periods preceding the February 1982 realignment and in early 1983. The model suggests
that doubling the uncertainty surrounding internal credit growth could have reduced the

probability of the bollapse by as much as 50 percent prior to February 1982 and could
have significantly reduced speculation in the months which followed.

           Decreasing the variability of external credit shocks, on the other hand, would
have reduced the probability         of collapse, but not by very large amounts. A reduction of
1/A21 to one thousandth of          its level generally reduced ir by less than 5 percent in each
period. This is a strong result. It suggests that external credit shocks contributed very little
to the currency   crises   of   Mexico in the 1980s. This result is strengthened further             if   une

considers    that the construction of 1/Afl tended to overstate rather than understate its
importance.
          The role of relative price shocks in the onset of crises varies over time.
Decreasing the variability of relative prices uniformly reduced the probability of collapse.

The significance of this effect dramatically changed prior to and following the February

1982 realignment, when 1/we rose sharply.            Pre- February   1982, reducing relative price

uncertainty would have had little effect on currency speculation. Following this period,
however, 1/we contributed greatly to speculation since, according to              the model, agents     were

reluctant to take another sharp reduction in the purchasing power of their holdings. This
force becomes even stronger as      the share of traded   goods in the home consumption bundle
rises. While the model predicts that reducing 1/w, sharply in the periods following the

realignment would have dramatically cut the speculation through July                         1982, following
Mexico's August 1982 announcements none of the agents modelled would have continued to

hold pesos even    if the expected variability   of relative prices was reduced to near zero.

            It should   be noted, however,   that the important contribution             of expected relative

price shocks again surfaces in the months beginning with December                           1982 when    the
government attempted to bring the peso under control. Consider the lr, estimates shown in
Table 3 and depicted in Figure 9.

            These simulation results are difficult to interpret since 1/wv          is    a function of past
surprise devaluations. However, 1/wv, would increase by a much smaller amount if there
were small rather than large realignments to the peso. The results suggest                         that the
speculative attacks against the peso might have been reduced, and confidence in the peso
restored in early 1983, if the government had implemented            a   series    of small realignments
rather than the     67 percent and 93 percent devaluations which occured in February and

November of 1982. Of course, the probability of collapse nonetheless rises again in the

are sustainable in the presence of other, inconsistent policy actions.

          Finally, the next set of simulations, shown in Figure                  10, derives the collapse

probabilities under the assumption that the forecast growth of domestic credit was either
halved or doubled, Collapse probabilities were              at   low levels   until November   1981, when

domestic credit jumped dramatically. By the construction of the signal extraction problem,
this increased both               and 1/Afl.     f       were halved in 1982 and 1983 (with          1[\,
unchanged), the currency speculation may have been reduced, but the dynamics of                  ,   would

have been quite similar. Yet,        if both          and 1/X, were halved, the outcome would be

quite different since 1r    is   decreasing in   1/1,. Reducing both             and   1/) by 50 percent
leads to higher collapse probabilities      that are larger than if actual values were       unchanged.

VI. Concluding Remarks
This application of a speculative attack model to Mexico's experiences in the                 1980s

suggests that domestic monetary arid fiscal policy rather than external credit shocks were
the driving forces in triggering speculative attacks on the Mexican peso in the 1980s. The

model successfully predicted the realignments        of the   peso which occured in this period, and

generated probabilities of speculative attacks        that were   conditioned on the assumed lower

limit on central hank foreign exchange reserve holdings. The simulation results suggest that

reducing domestic credit growth, increasing the uncertainty surrounding this growth, and

reducing the size and perhaps increasing the frequency of currency realignments may have

greatly reduced the amount of currency speculation against the peso in some of the crisis
periods between 1980 and 1986.

         The results also suggest that more attention be focussed on the importance of
heterogeneous agents for the timing and magnitude of speculative attacks on a currency.

Specifically,   it is   shown   that   by varying the assumed critical reserve floor, the predicted

shadow   rate and collapse probabilities also greatly change. While the crisis literature
generally models balance of payments crises using a representative agent framework, these

results suggest   that    if different agents are endowed with different perceptions   about central
bank access to hquidity, they may be triggered to speculate against the peso             at distinct
points in time.
