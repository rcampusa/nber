Using a sample of 20 emerging countries from 1880 to 1913, we study the determinants and output
effects of sudden stops in capital inflows during an era of intensified globalization. We find that higher
levels of original sin (hard currency debt to total debt) and large current account deficits associated
with reliance on foreign capital greatly increased the likelihood of experiencing a sudden stop. Trade
openness and stronger commitment to the gold standard had the opposite effect. These results are robust
for many sudden stop definitions used in the literature. Finally, we use a treatment effects model to
show that after controlling for endogeneity sudden stops have a strong negative association with growth
in per capita output. We also show that banking, currency and debt crises that were preceded by a
sudden stop have much greater negative relation with growth than in the absence of a sudden stop.

1. Introduction

      The pattern of sudden stops in capital inflows to emerging market countries in the last
30 years has great resonance to events which occurred the first era of globalization
between 1880 and 1913. This is especially so when we examine events in the late 1880s
and early 1890s. In those years many emerging countries were beset by a drastic decline
in capital flows from the core countries of Western Europe and many of these emerging
markets suffered currency, banking and debt crises. These sudden stops of capital inflows
have been at the root of volatile economic performance in many emerging markets both
today and in this previous period.
      Although capital flows declined in virtually every country in this period, the impact on
the real economy and the incidence of crises differed markedly. These differences
reflected similar factors to those stressed today: structural differences, exposure to
shocks, institutions and policies. Especially important in that era was how much of a
country’s external and internal debt was denominated and made payable in a fixed
amount of gold or other international currencies. This state has been called “original sin,”
and it is not a new problem.1 Like today, it exposed countries to the risk of balance sheet
induced financial stress and possibly crises, a phenomenon resonant to the role of liability
dollarization in the financial crises of the 1990s. Whether liability dollarization rendered
countries more financially fragile or not was related to the presence of strong institutions
and sound policy--what Caballero, Cowen and Kearns (2004) refer to as country and
currency trust. Country trust is based on sound institutions, strong rule of law and stable
political systems. Currency trust is based on the ability to adhere to a credible nominal
anchor like the gold standard in the nineteenth century, which required following stable
monetary policy and fiscal balance. 2
      This paper applies the methods of the recent empirical literature on sudden stops to the
late 19th and early 20th century experience. We provide results that are directly
comparable -and strikingly similar- to those of the more recent period which have

    See Bordo and Kydland (1996) for more on the effects of adherence to the Gold standard.

                                                                                                      2
analyzed sudden stops and financial crises.3 We study a number of determinants of
sudden stops, including the size of the trade deficit, the degree of trade openness in the
economy, the levels of both hard currency debt and total debt, the currency composition
of debt (original sin) and policy variables like the growth rate of money and reserve
ratios.
      Our results show that original sin, defined as the level of hard currency debt to total
debt, is a very robust predictor of sudden stops. This provides evidence for the
importance of balance sheet effects, with countries that owe large portions of their debt in
gold or foreign currency facing serious difficulties in repaying their debt under the
exchange rate depreciations that follow sudden stops.
      Trade deficits in countries receiving capital inflows are also strongly associated with
sudden stops. This illustrates that reliance on foreign capital may have made countries
more financially fragile. We go on to show that this may have reduced their growth
prospects because crises come along with lower growth rates of output.4
      We find that trade openness reduces the probability of sudden stops, suggesting that
the benefits of being able to quickly adjust to the current account imbalances are more
important than the threat of opening up to external shocks. Similarly, higher gold
coverage ratios (i.e., gold reserves / money in circulation) also reduce the probability of
sudden stops, a fact that reflects the importance of signaling and currency trust in the
ability to prevent crises.
      Next, we look into the relationship between sudden stops and growth. There is no
question that sudden stop events have historically been coupled with drops in output. But
are sudden stops directly responsible for a substantial drop in output, or are these drops
the result of other unobservable factors that also trigger the sudden stop itself? While
most theoretical models of sudden stops establish a direct link between the sudden stop,
balance sheet effects and drops in output, other authors like Chari et. al. (2005) present
models where the sudden stop itself is beneficial for growth because it brings about an
immediate positive increase in net exports. In this context then, the sudden stop becomes
a turning point after which output starts to improve.

    See, for example, Calvo et al. (2004)
4
    Bordo and Meissner (2007) analyze capital inflows directly and find similar results.

                                                                                                3
   To answer these questions, we empirically control for the endogeneity of sudden stops
using a treatment effects model. We conclude that sudden stops are still related to
reductions in output growth even after accounting for endogeneity. The impact appears
economically significant with drops in the growth rate averaging more than four
percentage points below the long-run average growth rates. Additionally, we also find
the impact on growth is larger when sudden stops are accompanied by financial crises.
Banking, currency or debt crises that were preceded by sudden stops had an even greater
negative impact on output growth than having a sudden stop alone.
   This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 characterizes and identifies sudden stop
events for our sample, performs a regression analysis on the determinants of the
probability of sudden stops and studies robustness using several definitions commonly
found in the literature. Section 3 considers the output effects of sudden stops and other
financial crises by using a treatments effects model to control for endogeneity. Section 4
concludes.


2. Characterizing Sudden Stops
   A sudden stop is characterized by a sharp cut-off of capital flows into a country. It
reflects an abrupt unwillingness of foreigners to continue financing the country’s current
account deficit. It is often triggered by an event such as an increase in interest rates in the
lending countries which reduces capital outflows or a sudden change in expectations
regarding debt default in the borrowing country. As soon as the sudden stop takes place,
the debtor finds it impossible any longer to finance its current account deficit. Foreign
reserves can be used for a while to delay the adjustment, but eventually the current
account deficit must be turned into a surplus with a sharp improvement in the trade
balance and a compression of domestic absorption.
   If the country is under a fixed exchange rate regime, like the gold standard which
prevailed during our period of study, the adjustment must be made via a reduction in
spending. In the face of sticky wages and prices this leads to an economic recession.
Alternatively, the government may decide to devalue (alter its gold parity) or leave the
gold standard, accelerating the real depreciation process. In theory, this could prevent a
recession altogether, but as the experience of sudden stops in many emerging countries in


                                                                                              4
the 1990s and early 2000s has shown, currency depreciations can lead to strong balance
sheet effects, bankruptcies, financial crises and drops in output.

2.1 Identifying Sudden Stops

    In this section we identify sudden stop events in our sample of 20 emerging market
countries using several identification criteria that are common in the literature.
    A sudden stop is generally defined as a large and unexpected fall in a country’s net
capital inflows, usually coupled with drops in economic activity. In theory, sudden stops
can occur without a current account reversal if foreign reserves are used to maintain the
level of the current account deficit. In practice however, reserves are seldom large
enough to be a practical or permanent solution, and eventually the current account needs
to adjust. This makes identification of sudden stops easier, given that current account (or
trade balance) data can be used, and is particularly convenient for our period of study, for
which direct capital flows data is scarce.
    Using simple balance of payment accounting identities, we first construct a proxy for
net capital inflows by subtracting the trade balance from changes in foreign reserves.5
    Next, we create several indicator variables for sudden stops. Our main indicator,
which we call “SS1”, follows Calvo et al. (2004) closely and considers a country as
having a sudden stop during a given year if there is an annual drop in net capital inflows
of at least two standard deviations below the mean of the year-to-year changes for the
period, and/or it is the first year of a drop in net capital inflows that exceeds 3 percent of
nominal GDP over a period shorter than four years, and there is a drop in real GDP (of
any magnitude) during that year or the following year. 6
    With this definition, we are requiring reversals to be sudden and large relative to the
volatility experienced by that particular country during the period. This is important,
since countries could differ substantially in the type and stability of foreign capital


5
  Balance of Payments = Current Account + Net Capital Inflows (NKI) – Change in Reserves , where
Current Account = Trade Balance + Net Factor Payment + Unilateral Transfers. Therefore NKI = Change
in Reserves – CA.
By using trade balance data, our NKI proxy includes net factor payments and unilateral transfers which,
although potentially important in magnitude for some countries in this period, are not expected to change
significantly on a yearly-basis.
6
  The specific conditions, such as the two standard deviation cutoff, are common in the literature. See
Calvo et al (2004) and Catão (2006).

                                                                                                            5
inflows and investments. Our identification strategy also allows for reversals which may
take longer to materialize but still represent a significant share of GDP. Finally, the
inclusion of the drop in output allows us to differentiate sudden stops crises from positive
terms of trade shocks which also lead to current account reversals but are coupled with
increases in GDP and real exchange rate appreciations.
    We applied these criteria to a sample of 20 emerging market countries between 1880
and 1913: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark,
Finland, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain,
Sweden and the United States.7 The data was compiled from previous work by Bordo et.
al. (2001), Bordo and Meissner (2006), Flandreau and Zúmer (2004), Mitchell (1992) and
Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), among others. See the Appendix for further details.
    The sudden stop events identified in the data are shown in Table 1. During the period
1880-1913, there were 34 sudden stops in the countries considered; 17 countries (85% of
total) were affected and 9 countries (45% of total) had two or more sudden stops.8
    Figure 1 shows the pattern of average net capital inflows to GDP and the global
number of sudden stops in each year. Capital inflows increased considerably in the early
1880s and then experienced a sharp drop in the 1890s. Sudden stops occurred every time
there was a downturn in capital inflows, but there is evidence of “bunching” around the
early 1890’s and around 1900. These are well-known periods of macroeconomic
instability in capital importing countries, as analyzed extensively in the literature on
financial crises in the late nineteenth century.9
    Sudden stops were by far the most common type of financial disruption during this
period. Figure 2 compares the frequency of sudden stops with that of other financial
crises: banking, currency and debt crises. We define frequency as the number of years a
country was in crisis divided by the total possible years of observation (excluding years
of ongoing crises). As can be seen, the probability of a sudden stop was the highest of all
events in the pre 1914 period at 5.3%. Crises were rarer events than sudden stops, with

  Following Bordo and Eichengreen we treat the US as an emerging country although in most respects it
was an advanced country with the principal exception that it was a net recipient of capital inflows until the
turn of the twentieth century and it had a relatively unstable banking system.

banking crises being the most likely at 3.5%, followed by currency crises at 3.1% and
debt crises at 1%.10
     In terms of timing, sudden stops tended to occur shortly before other financial crises.
About 40% of sudden stop events were followed by a financial crisis (either debt,
currency or banking crisis) within only three years.11 This provides some evidence for the
link between sudden stops, balance sheet effects and financial crises. In section 3 we
study in more detail the interaction between sudden stops and other financial crises
through their combined effects on output.
     Figure 3 shows discount rates for core countries (UK, Germany and France), which
were the main sources of funds for emerging economies. The years that are shaded are
those with one or more sudden stops. One of the most striking features is that during the
two most prominent periods of sudden stops, around 1890 and 1900, interest rates in the
core lending countries were raised sharply. The rise in discount rates in the years
preceding 1890, for example, reflected a reaction by the Bank of England and other
central banks to a decline in their gold reserves reflecting burgeoning capital outflows to
Latin America and other emerging regions to finance an investment boom. The boom
occurred in a period of depressed economic conditions in England and the other
European countries when low interest rates and sluggish investment made the higher rates
of return in the Americas and Australasia very attractive. The boom ended as the
European economy recovered at the end of the decade and investment opportunities
reappeared. In the face of rising aggregate demand the Bank of England raised its
discount rate from 2 ½ to 4%. This was matched by the German Reichsbank and other
central banks. This policy shock precipitated a massive slowdown in investment abroad.12
     Overall, this period experienced a pattern of events that included external shocks
coming from a tightening of monetary policy in the core, a rise in sovereign yield
spreads, a drying up of capital flows, current account reversals, a decline in nominal
exchange rates in countries with paper currencies, a decline in real output and a spate of



10
   Bordo and Meissner ( 2007) using a larger sample of 30 countries find a fairly similar pattern for the
three traditional types of crises. The probability of a banking crisis was 3.8%, of a currency crisis 2.2% and
of a debt crisis 1%.

financial crises. See Bordo (2006) for more descriptive statistics on capital flows,
exchange rates, spreads and financial crises during this period.

2.2 The Determinants of Sudden Stops

     Many factors can contribute to both the likelihood of sudden stops and their effect on
economic activity. The degree of openness can play an important but ambiguous role. It
can make a country more vulnerable to sudden stops simply because it may be more
exposed to foreign shocks. But it can also make a country less vulnerable because it can
facilitate the current account adjustment needed once a sudden stop occurs.13 For
example Calvo and Talvi (2005) demonstrate how a depreciating real exchange rate
requires a greater compression by the non-traded goods sector in the case of a relatively
closed economy.
     The extent of original sin can also seriously impact the balance sheet of firms and
especially the banking sector. Exchange rate depreciation increases the local currency
value of liabilities relative to local currency assets. This can contribute to a banking
crisis as the collateral backing bank loans deteriorates. It can also lead to a debt crisis for
governments whose debts are in hard currency and whose tax revenues are in local
currency. Both a banking crisis and the expectation of a debt crisis can generate currency
crises, as international reserves which serve to back the banking system’s liabilities as
well as the government’s balance sheet are threatened (Dooley 2000, Mishkin 2003).
     More generally, sound fiscal and monetary policies and strong institutions can help to
both prevent and stabilize the effects of sudden stops.

2.3 Regression Analysis of Determinants

     In order to study the determinants of sudden stops, we run a pooled probit regression
with heteroscedasticity robust, standard errors clustered at the country level. Our data set
is an unbalanced panel and our observational unit is the country-year.
     Our dependent variable is the indicator variable for sudden stops, SS1. We use as
independent variables several factors identified in the literature as important

13
  See, for example, Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (1998). For more on openness and sudden stops, see Cavallo
and Frankel (2004).

                                                                                                          8
determinants: the ratio of the trade balance to GDP, the degree of openness (exports plus
imports divided by GDP), the degree of “original sin” (share of total public debt
denominated in gold or foreign currency), the gold coverage ratio (reserves / money in
circulation), the ratio of gold or foreign currency debt to GDP, the ratio of total debt to
GDP and the growth rate of the money stock.14 We also control for real GDP per capita
and lag all variables one period.15 To control for time effects, we include the English
consol rate in all regressions.

2.4 Estimation results

     Our results are summarized in Table 2 where coefficients shown are average
marginal effects on the probability of a sudden stop. Model (1) is our main specification
with key explanatory variables. Most results are strong and statistically significant.
     As expected, the coefficient on trade balance to GDP is negative and statistically
significant. Sudden stops affect countries with negative trade balance to GDP ratios. The
higher this ratio, the lower the country’s dependence on foreign capital and therefore the
lower the likelihood of a sudden stop. Our estimates show that an increase of 4.7
percentage points in the trade balance to GDP ratio, which represents a one standard
deviation change for this variable in our sample, decreases the probability of a sudden
stop (conditional on keeping other variables at their means) by 0.02.16 Given that the
conditional probability of a sudden stop is only 0.02 when we evaluate all variables at
their means, this represents a 100% decrease in the predicted probability. The trade
balance to GDP is clearly a strong –though perhaps unsurprising- determinant of sudden
stops.
     We also find that higher levels of trade openness can greatly decrease the probability
of experiencing a sudden stop. An increase of 17.9 percentage points in trade openness,


14
   These variables have also been used in similar papers for more modern historical periods. See Calvo et al
(2004), Cavallo and Frankel (2006), Sturzenegger and Guidotti (2005) and Edwards (2004). Many of our
results in this section are directly comparable to those in these studies.
15
   Many papers in the literature use lagged variables to control for endogeneity, but it is not really a solution
given the high persistency in the series. We include lags to follow the literature, but show in Appendix
Table A5 that our results are robust to the removal of all lags. Other authors control for endogeneity using
instrumental variable techniques. For example, Cavallo and Frankel (2004) use gravity estimates to control
for endogeneity in the degree of trade openness. However, most of these studies find that results do not
vary significantly after controlling for endogeneity.
16
   0.047*(-0.424)= 0.02

                                                                                                               9
also a one standard deviation change in our sample, decreases the predicted conditional
probability by 0.018 or 90%. This supports the view that openness makes the adjustment
process easier (improving the trade balance is simpler if the economy is already heavily
engaged in international trade), and is in line with empirical results by Edwards (2004),
Cavallo and Frankel (2004) and Calvo et al. (2004) for the more recent historical period.
     Among policy variables, the gold coverage ratio has a significant negative effect on
the probability of a sudden stop. A one standard deviation increase, equal to 31
percentage points in our sample, decreases this probability by 0.019, or 95%. This
variable, measured by the ratio of gold reserves to money in circulation, is taken here as a
proxy for the degree of commitment to a sound monetary policy and adherence to the
gold standard.17 Our results then support the view that among emerging countries a high
gold coverage ratio signals the country’s commitment to stable exchange rates, raises
currency trust and reduces the chances of a sudden stop.
     Among the debt variables, the currency composition of debt is very important, as
shown by the positive and significant coefficients on original sin. This provides evidence
for the importance of balance sheet effects in our empirical model. The higher the debt
denominated in hard currency or gold, the higher the contractionary balance sheet effects,
and therefore the higher the chances of facing a sudden stop.18 A one standard deviation
increase of 33 percentage points increases the probability of Sudden Stops by 0.02 or
100%.
     It is important to note that our analysis does not focus on the reasons for the high
degrees of original sin in many of these countries. As Eichengreen and Hausmann (2003)
point out, creditors can be reluctant to lend in local currency because a country has weak
institutions and is prone to manipulating the value of its currency. But original sin can
also be a result of other factors and market imperfections beyond a country’s control.19
Nations with good reputations or solid fundamentals can be obliged to issue debt in hard

17
   See Figures A3 and A4 in the Appendix
18
   A related variable is the level of currency mismatch, which measures the degree by which hard currency
liabilities are offset with hard currency assets. A measure used by Bordo and Meissner (2007) is calculated
as (hard currency debt – reserves / exports). As pointed out by Goldstein and Turner (2004) and Bordo and
Meissner (2006), a country with higher currency mismatch could find it difficult to repay hard currency
debt in the event of a depreciation. We have included this variable in some model specifications (not
shown), but results are not significant for our sample in this period.
19
   See for example Bordo, Meissner and Redish (2004) and Flandreau and Sussman (2004) for discussions
on the determinants and pace of graduation from original sin.

                                                                                                         10
currency, and oppositely, reputedly poor risk countries like Russia in the late nineteenth
century and Brazil today have managed to sell a large amount of local currency debt to
international markets. Regardless of its particular causes then countries suffering from it
may be more prone to liquidity runs and balance sheet effects. Our results show that
original sin had a large influence on the probability of experiencing a sudden stop during
the 1880-1913 period possibly because of its impact on balance sheets and expectations
about balance sheets.
   In contrast to the compositional effects of debt (original sin), Table 2 shows that the
level of hard currency liabilities to GDP does not have a significant impact on
probabilities. This suggests that how much a country owed was not necessarily a
problem; what really mattered was what percentage of that debt was denominated in hard
currency. In model (2) we test for the level of total debt to GDP and find similar results.
   The coefficients for the level of real GDP per capita and the growth of money supply
have the expected signs, but are not statistically significant and model (3) shows that our
main results are robust to the removal of these control variables. Finally, although
standard in the literature, the inclusion of the trade balance to GDP variable is potentially
problematic for identification, given its importance in our definitions of sudden stops.
Nevertheless, model (4) shows that our results –particularly for original sin- are not
affected by the removal of this variable.
   Table 3 summarizes the effects of a one standard deviation change in each of the main
independent variables. Notably, all of these variables have similar impact on the
predicted probability of a sudden stop when we consider their actual volatility in our
sample. Given that the predicted conditional probability of a sudden stop when we
evaluate all variables at their means is only two percent per year across our sample, the
economic significance of these regression coefficients is very strong.




                                                                                             11
2.5 Robustness

   We now construct two alternative sudden stop indicator variables to show that our
main results are robust to the various definitions of sudden stops found in the literature.
   Our second sudden stop variable, labeled SS2, does not condition on output drops at
all. In essence this is a broader definition that focuses exclusively on large net capital
inflow reversals, regardless of the initial impact on output.
   The third sudden stop dummy, labeled SS3, requires a drop in the real output growth
rate. It is possible, given lags in the economy, that growth continues for a while even in
the presence of a sudden stop. An example would be an infrastructure investment that
takes some time to affect output, like a railroad which facilitates settlement of a remote
region. In theory though, when a sudden stop takes place there should be at least a
slowdown in the output growth rate, and that is what SS3 captures. This is also a broader
definition than SS1.
   Applying these criteria to our sample, we find 63 sudden stop crises under both SS2
and SS3, although the countries and dates differ between them (see Table A2 in the
Appendix for details). A close comparison between the three indicator variables shows
that when there is a large and sudden reversal in net capital inflows (as measured by SS2)
there may not be an immediate effect on output, but soon the growth rate slows (as
measured by SS3) and in most cases output ends up falling within two years (as measured
by SS1).
   We repeat the regression analysis using our main specification (model 1 in Table 2)
for these alternative sudden stop measures and show the results in Table 4.
   Under SS2 and SS3, trade openness changes sign but losses significance, while the
level of hard currency debt to GDP becomes a relevant predictor. However, most of our
results, including the trade balance to GDP, original sin and gold coverage ratios, remain
similar to SS1 in both magnitude and significance.




                                                                                              12
3. Sudden Stops, Financial Crises and Growth
     In this section we study the effects of sudden stops on the dynamics of output growth.
We place special interest in the way sudden stops interact with other financial crises
(currency, debt and banking crises) that may follow.
     Estimating a growth regression using a sudden stop dummy may be problematic due
to a potential endogeneity problem. Most sudden stop identification criteria involve some
sort of conditioning on output drops. Even if they do not, sudden stops are still inherently
endogenous because unobserved factors that contribute to economic downturns may also
be working to create sudden stops. Moreover, there may be reverse causality: sudden
stops affect output, but output affects sudden stops as well.
     The estimation of a continuous variable like output per capita using a potentially
endogenous binary variable can be attempted using a treatment effects regression. In
addition to controlling for the endogeneity of the sudden stop dummy, this model also
allows us to estimate the double impact of variables like trade openness on output, both
directly via its marginal effect in the growth equation and indirectly through the impact
on the probability of sudden stops.
     In these growth regressions we use the broadest definition for sudden stop, SS2, as
the dependent variable. Given that this definition includes events where output does not
drop immediately, our estimation results provide a lower bound for the negative effects
on output of sudden stops.20 Furthermore, our robustness analysis in the previous section
shows that our results on determinants are robust to the choice of the sudden stop
indicator.21




20
   Moreover, we show in Appendix Table A4 that the results in this section are robust to the use of the
narrowest sudden stop definition, SS1.
21
   We choose to use SS1 (which conditions on output drops) in the determinants analysis simply because it
is the standard definition used in the literature.

                                                                                                       13
3.1 Regression Analysis of Output Growth

     Since our main interest is to analyze the effect of a possibly endogenous binary
variable (sudden stop dummy) on growth, we use the endogenous treatment effects
model. 22 Our empirical specification starts with a growth equation:


                                    (1)    g i ,t = α + β X i ,t + δ Diss,t + µi + ε it


where g i ,t is real GDP per capita growth for country i at time t; X i ,t is a vector of

independent variables; Diss,t is a sudden stop dummy; µi are unobserved time-invariant

and country-specific effects; while α is a constant and ε i ,t is the idiosyncratic error term.

     Our sudden stop dummy Diss,t is an endogenous binary variable that depends on the

realization of an unobserved latent variable L*i ,t according to:


                                                    1 if L*i ,t > 0
                                    (2)   Diss,t = 
                                                   0 otherwise
                                    (3)   L*i ,t = aWi (.) + ξi ,t

where Wi (.) is a set of control variables and ξi ,t is a random error term.23 Under

assumptions of normality, equations (2) and (3) can be written as a probit model. The
treatment effects model simply allows for correlation between the error term in the probit
model and the growth regression.24



22
   Ranciere, Tornell and Westermann (2006) use this procedure to analyze the impact of financial
liberalization on the probability of crises and growth. Edwards (2004) and Edwards (2005) use a related
three-step mechanism to study the effects of sudden stops and current account reversals on growth.
Similarly, Razin and Rubinstein (2004) study the growth effects of exchange rate regimes and currency
crises. All of these papers focus on the recent crisis experience of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
23
   The subscript (.) means there may be different lags for different variables.
24
   Formally, the model requires the following assumptions:
                                   σ 2 π 
i) (ε , ξ ) !   N (0, Z ) where Z=  ε     and ii) (ε , ξ ) independent of X and W.
                                    π 1


                                                                                                               14
      To illustrate what our model is actually doing consider the simple two-step procedure
for estimation. First, the treatment equation for the probability of a sudden stop is
estimated using a probit regression of sudden stops on a set of independent controls Wi (.)

and a hazard is then obtained for each observation.25 Second, the growth equation (1) is
estimated including this hazard as an additional independent variable. This model is a
generalization of Heckman’s bivariate selection model to the treatment effects context
and can be also estimated in one step by maximum likelihood.26 This is the procedure we
follow.
      In the treatment regression, Wi (.) includes the same variables as our main probit in

section 2 (model 2 in Table 4), with the exception of real per capita income. Most of
these variables are strong determinants of sudden stops, but are expected not to affect
output growth directly.
      In the growth regression, X i ,t includes variables that are standard in the growth

literature: log of initial real GDP per capita, inflation, government spending to GDP
ratio, trade openness, education enrolment, population growth and the investment to GDP
ratio.
      Note that the level of trade openness is included in both the growth and treatment
regressions. This is not a problem. In fact, this model is identified even when all variables
are included in both equations (i.e. when Wi ,t = X i ,t ) due to the non-linearity of the probit

treatment equation.27 Our exclusion restriction is that all of the variables in the probit
model besides openness do not belong in the growth model. 28

25
     The hazard, also called the “Inverse Mills ratio” is defined by:
      φ (aWˆ i ,t ) / Φ(aWˆ i ,t )    if Di,tss = 1 
hi =                                                   where Φ and φ are the c.d.f and density functions of the
      −φ (aW
            ˆ i ,t ) /[1 − Φ (aW
                              ˆ i ,t )] if Di,tss = 0 
normal distribution.
26
   The Heckman model was initially developed in the wage equation context to deal with selection based on
unobservables (for example, when only wages for employed people are observed) and later generalized.
The difference between the wage equation and the treatment context is that in the latter the outcome is
observed for all units, whether “treated” or not (i.e. we observe growth both with or without a sudden stop).
27
   The model is identified even if Wi ,t = X i ,t due to the non-linearity of the probit treatment equation, but
Monte Carlo simulations have shown that in finite samples this leads to weak identification. The reason is a
high degree of collinearity between the hazard and the regressors in the outcome equation. “Exclusionary
restrictions”, variables in the treatment equation that are not in the outcome equation, provide stronger
identification.
28
   See Maddala (1983) and Woolridge (2002) for more detailed specification requirements.

                                                                                                              15
3.2 Estimation Results

      Estimation results under maximum likelihood are shown in Table 5. The bottom panel
shows results for the treatment equation while the top panel shows results for the growth
equation. It is important to note that the number of observations drops significantly as a
consequence of jointly estimating both output and treatment equations.29 This is the
reason why the treatment equation results are not identical to those of the probit
regression in section 2. We focus attention on the top panel in Table 5, which shows the
results from the growth equation.
      Model (A) is our basic growth regression with the endogenous sudden stop dummy
variable included. Sudden stops are shown to have a strong negative effect on real GDP.
Our point estimate suggests that growth is four percentage points lower when a sudden
stop occurs. The coefficient is statistically significant across all model specifications.
This provides a lower bound to the direct impact of sudden stops on output, given that we
are using our broadest indicator variable, SS2, which essentially captures sharp net
capital inflow reversals without requiring immediate drops in GDP.
      As expected, we find that inflation has a strong negative impact on growth. A one
percent increase in the inflation rate reduces the growth rate by 0.18 percentage points.
The investment to GDP ratio has a positive impact of even greater magnitude. A one
percent increase in investment to GDP leads to a 0.25 percent increase in the growth rate.
Population growth has a negative effect and its coefficient is close to one.
      Another important result is the indirect effect of sudden stops on growth through the
interaction with financial crises. As mentioned before, 40 percent of our sudden stop
events were followed by either a currency, banking or debt crisis within three years. The
specification in model (B) includes a dummy variable for financial crises, which takes a
value of one if there is any kind of financial crisis during that year and zero otherwise.
The coefficient is positive but not significantly different from zero. However, model (C)
replaces this dummy with an indicator of a financial crisis that occurs shortly after a
sudden stop (within 3 years). These are financial crises which are very likely linked to the
previous sudden stop. In this case, the negative output effect of financial crises is more


29
     The countries included are Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Spain and the US.

                                                                                                          16
than doubled and the coefficient becomes statistically significant. Financial crises which
come shortly after a sudden stop lead on average to an additional 3.6 percentage point
drop in the growth rate.
      Finally, as emphasized by Ranciere, Tornell and Westermann (2006), the treatment
effects model allows us to differentiate direct and indirect effects on growth for those
variables that are included both in the growth and treatment equations. Our results show
that trade openness has both a positive direct effect on growth and a positive indirect
effect by reducing the probability of sudden stops. We can calculate the total effect of
trade openness by using the estimated coefficients. For a given increase, we first compute
the marginal effect on the probability of a sudden stop using the probit coefficients, then
we multiply this by the estimated coefficient of sudden stops in the growth regression and
finally we add the direct effects of openness on growth. Using the estimates of model (A)
in Table 5, we find that an increase of 10 percentage points in trade openness increases
the growth rate by 1.1 percentage points. The direct effect on growth is 0.9 percentage
points while the indirect effect -via a reduction in the probability of sudden stops- is 0.2
percentage points.


4. Conclusions
      Our analysis of the determinants and output effects of sudden stops in emerging
economies, between 1870 and 1913, shows that the pattern of events was remarkably
similar to the experience of the 1990s and first years of the 21st century. Financial
globalization a century ago made many countries quite vulnerable to external shocks via
capital inflows as today.
      Among determinants, we find that low levels of original sin, high levels of trade
openness and sound monetary policies are important to reduce the probability of
experiencing a sudden stop. Other authors have shown similar results for the more recent
period.30
      Balance sheet effects, a result of the combination of high levels of original sin and
currency depreciation, may play an important role not only as a determinant of sudden

stops but also in explaining why financial crises that are triggered by sudden stops are far
worse in terms of their effect on GDP than those which are unrelated to them.
      Overall, the lessons from the long run appear to be that sound debt management and
the development of a large trade sector will allow emerging countries to escape financial
turmoil. But indeed, what emerging countries really need to do to protect themselves
from repeated episodes of sudden stops and crises is to mature and develop the sound
financial institutions of an advanced economy. Today’s emergers may wish to investigate
the historical experience of countries that were the emergers of a century ago (like the
US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries), to find out how
they learned from the experiences of their financial crises and were able to advance to
greater financial stability.31 As Caballero, Cowan and Kearns (2004) put it, many
countries have yet to develop country and currency trust. The determinants of these
deeper fundamentals remains an open question but one that needs investigation as global
capital markets become increasingly connected.
