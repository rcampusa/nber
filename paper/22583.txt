The welfare associated with public insurance is often difficult to quantify because the demand for
coverage is unobserved and thus cannot be used to analyze welfare. However, in many settings,
individuals can purchase private insurance to supplement public coverage. This paper outlines an
approach to use data and variation from private complementary insurance to quantify welfare
associated with counterfactuals related to compulsory public insurance. We then apply this
approach using administrative data on disability insurance. Our findings suggests that public
disability insurance generates substantial surplus for the sample population, and there may be
gains to increasing the generosity of coverage.

     Social insurance programs are ubiquitous and cover many of the largest risks individuals face. To deter-

mine the welfare generated by public insurance, it is important to quantify both the benefits and the costs of

this insurance. While the costs of public insurance are relatively straightforward to calculate, the benefits of

public insurance are often difficult to quantify. A fundamental difficulty is that public insurance is typically

compulsory, so the demand for this non-market good is unobserved and thus cannot be used to infer the value

individuals place on coverage. While a relatively large literature has worked to quantify welfare in private

insurance markets, this difficulty may explain why there have been far fewer studies investigating the welfare

associated with public insurance.

     Several recent studies investigate welfare within private insurance markets (e.g., Hackmann, Kolstad and

Kowalski (2015), Bundorf, Levin and Mahoney (2012), Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010)). Although recent

studies investigating welfare in private insurance settings use a range of methods, the commonality among

these studies is that they use price variation to identify the demand for insurance and thus the value individu-

als place on coverage.1 Perhaps because of the unique challenges that arise in the setting of compulsory public

insurance, a recent literature on the welfare generated by compulsory public insurance has evolved indepen-

dently of the literature on welfare in private insurance settings. A handful of recent studies have analyzed

welfare within public insurance settings, such as Medicaid (Finkelstein, Hendren and Luttmer (2015)), unem-

ployment insurance (e.g., Chetty (2008), Gruber (1997)), and disability insurance (Low and Pistaferri (2015),

Chandra and Samwick (2005)). While these studies employ a range of approaches across these settings, all of

these studies confront the fact that demand for compulsory public coverage is unobserved by making several

critical assumptions on the nature of individual utility (or marginal utility), uncertainty, and heterogeneity to

estimate welfare, often employing data on consumption or assets.2 Importantly, these studies make several

assumptions that can meaningfully affect the resulting analysis and are often difficult to empirically validate.

     In this paper, we propose a complementary approach to analyzing the welfare associated with public in-

surance that leverages the fact that individuals can often purchase supplemental private insurance to top-up

the benefits of compulsory public insurance. The basic idea behind this approach is simple: The existence of

complementary private insurance allows us to extend standard willingness-to-pay approaches used in private

insurance settings and apply these to welfare questions associated with compulsory public insurance. Rela-

tive to other approaches to value compulsory public insurance, the approach outlined in this paper requires

minimal assumptions and can be implemented using commonly available data and straightforward variation.

     While the existence of parallel private and public insurance is a necessary condition to implement this

analysis in compulsory public insurance settings.




                                                                      1
approach, it turns out that this is a common feature of many social insurance programs in the United States

and abroad.3 Some of the largest social insurance programs in the United States have this feature including

Medicare (private Medigap insurance), Social Security disability insurance (private long-term disability insur-

ance), and Social Security retirement benefits (private annuities). The model of complementary public and

private insurance is also very common outside of the United States, particularly in the context of universal

public health insurance. Many countries that provide universal public health insurance also allow individuals

to purchase complementary private health insurance coverage to top-up the incomplete public health insur-

ance benefits including France, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Switzerland, New Zealand, Italy,

England, Norway, and Sweden.4

     Intuitively, in settings in which individuals can purchase private complementary insurance, coverage

decisions individuals make in the private supplemental insurance market can inform us about individuals’

willingness-to-pay for extending the generosity of the compulsory coverage to include the benefits of supple-

mental insurance, and, in some settings, these decisions can inform us about individuals’ underlying valuation

of the inframarginal compulsory public coverage. Formalizing this intuition, this paper begins by outlining a

framework which illustrates that data and variation from the market for supplemental insurance can be used

to quantify welfare associated with several policy-relevant counterfactuals related to compulsory public in-

surance. We then apply this framework to the context of disability insurance using administrative data on

enrollment and claims from one large employer that provides its employees long-term disability insurance

that supplements the wage replacement benefits of public disability insurance.

     Our modeling approach builds upon prior work by Einav and Finkelstein (2011) and Einav, Finkelstein and

Cullen (2010). The key empirical inputs into the welfare analysis are the demand and cost curves associated

with the private supplemental insurance market. We describe how these demand and costs curves can be used

to evaluate marginal counterfactuals related to the incremental coverage sold in the existing market for sup-

plemental insurance and to bound the surplus provided by the inframarginal compulsory public insurance.

For instance, consider the welfare associated with extending the generosity of compulsory public insurance

to include the coverage provided by private supplemental insurance. The existence of a private supplemental

insurance market provides the opportunity to study the welfare from extending the generosity of public insur-

ance to incorporate the coverage provided by supplemental insurance because we effectively observe a market
   3 Despite that fact that private insurance is often available to top-up compulsory public insurance, most of the prior literature on welfare

analysis in compulsory public insurance settings abstracts from opportunities individuals have to purchase private complementary cover-
age. A notable exception is Chetty and Saez (2010) who characterize the impact of endogenous private insurance on the welfare associated
with government intervention under a range of different modeling assumptions. In addition, a few recent papers have characterized the
welfare associated with top-up supplemental insurance, including Cabral and Mahoney (2014) in the setting of Medigap coverage and
Einav, Finkelstein and Williams (2016) in the setting of coverage for alternative options for breast cancer treatment.
   4 In some of these countries, private supplemental insurance covers the cost-sharing associated with services partially covered by

the compulsory public insurance; in other countries, private supplemental insurance covers complementary services not covered by the
compulsory public insurance (e.g., drugs, dental, out-of-network doctors/hospitals). For a detailed overview of parallel public and private
health insurance internationally, see Thomson et al. (2013).




                                                                      2
for the extension of this public coverage. Thus, we illustrate how a simple, straightforward extension of the

Einav and Finkelstein (2011) framework can be used to investigate the welfare associated with an expansion of

the generosity of compulsory public insurance, where we incorporate key features that can matter in this set-

ting such as externalities induced by the supplemental insurance and crowd-out of the private supplemental

insurance market.

   Beyond examining a marginal extension of public insurance, we also outline an approach to study the

total welfare generated by compulsory public insurance, which relies on the demand and cost curves asso-

ciated with supplemental insurance (the same objects required to implement the marginal welfare analysis

described above). Looking toward the empirical application to disability insurance, we focus attention on the

case where public and private insurance provide coverage that is linear in the insured loss. We then derive

a lower bound on the total surplus generated by the inframarginal compulsory public insurance coverage in

terms of the demand and cost curves that can be estimated within the supplemental insurance market. This

derivation relies on minimal assumptions on the nature of individual preferences, and we provide a simple

and intuitive sufficient condition applicable when preferences are represented by a univariate utility function:

utility exhibits non-increasing absolute risk aversion. Using a numerical example, we discuss the central trade-

off between this bounding approach and a more structural approach to analyzing the welfare associated with

the compulsory inframarginal public insurance. The bounding approach we outline is more robust in terms

of perturbations in the underlying utility, risk distribution, and liquidity; however, this robustness comes at

the cost of obtaining a lower bound on welfare rather than a precise welfare number. We note that in some

applications this cost may be considerable if the lower bound is too loose to provide valuable insights.

   Using administrative data from one large firm on employee long-term disability (LTD) insurance, we then

apply this approach empirically to quantify the value of the wage replacement benefits of disability insurance

among this population. Disability insurance is a particularly important setting in which to understand the

welfare associated with insurance, as the threat of a career-ending disability is one of the largest financial

risks many individuals face, and the public Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program is one of the

largest social insurance programs in the United States. In 2014, approximately 9 million disabled workers

received SSDI benefits, and the total SSDI benefits paid exceeded $140 billion.5 Despite the large size of this

social insurance program, there has been very little research quantifying the welfare provided by disability

insurance.6,7 In addition to the coverage available to workers through SSDI, 34% of US workers have the

opportunity to purchase private supplemental LTD coverage through their employer to top-up the benefits of

SSDI.8 A typical empirical challenge to investigating the welfare associated with public SSDI coverage (relative

to other social insurance programs) is that it is a national program with little variation in coverage across

workers. Thus, disability insurance is a natural context to apply the framework described above as it allows us

to use variation within employer-provided private supplemental LTD insurance to overcome this key empirical

challenge and analyze the welfare associated with disability insurance.

     We apply the welfare framework by leveraging premium variation and the subsequent decisions employ-

ees make in the context of LTD insurance at one large firm, Alcoa, Inc. There are several nice features of the

setting of this empirical application. First, the firm offers salaried employees three vertically differentiated

plans with wage replacement rates of 50%, 60%, and 70% in the event of disability. Second, the basic 50%

replacement rate plan is free for employees. This is convenient as no one opts out of the plans, and thus claims

data is available for all employees in the estimation population. Third, there is variation over time in the in-

cremental premium for the highest generosity plan. This variation allows us to trace out the relative demand

curves for an incremental 10% replacement rate, starting from a baseline 60% replacement rate. Fourth, the ad-

ministrative data include information on disability claims in addition to disability insurance enrollment, so the

demand estimates can be paired with cost data to evaluate welfare. Lastly, the firm’s disability plans explicitly

require workers to apply to SSDI and, if approved, SSDI benefits crowd-out LTD benefits dollar for dollar. In

this way, the LTD plans at this firm top-up the compulsory public insurance, providing a natural interpretation

to our estimates.

     Using premium variation among the LTD policies available to employees, we find that the demand for

supplemental disability coverage is price-sensitive. Our baseline estimates indicate that if the premium for

the most generous LTD plan increases by 0.1% of annual earnings, enrollment would decline by 7 percentage

points. This is precisely estimated and robust to controlling for time trends and individual fixed-effects. Based

on our estimates, the implied mean willingness-to-pay for the incremental 10% replacement rate (starting from
    6 While there has been limited research on the consumption-smoothing benefits of disability insurance, there are a small number of

recent related studies. A few recent papers document consumption changes in response to disability onset or major health shocks: Meyer
and Mok (2013) document changes in consumption and income that follow a change in self-reported disability status using PSID data;
Kostol and Mogstad (2015) document changes in income and consumption among denied and approved disability insurance applicants in
Norway; Dobkin et al. (2017) document consumption changes following major hospitalizations, providing indirect evidence on individu-
als’ exposure to disability-induced earnings losses. In addition, a few papers have investigated the ex ante welfare provided by disability
insurance using calibrated life-cycle models (see Low and Pistaferri (2015), Chandra and Samwick (2005)). In another recent study, Autor
et al. (2017) employ a structural model along with earnings and consumption data to estimate Norwegian disability insurance applicants’
implied willingness-to-pay to be approved for disability insurance. In contrast to these few related papers which rely on consumption
data and/or calibrated life-cycle models to infer the value of disability insurance, the approach in the present paper employs data and
variation from the market for supplemental disability coverage to directly investigate the willingness-to-pay for disability insurance and
the welfare associated with this coverage.
    7 While there has been relatively little research on the welfare associated with disability insurance, there has been extensive research on

the causes and consequences of the vast growth in disability insurance rolls over time. See Autor and Duggan (2006) and Liebman (2015)
for a review of this literature.

                                                                      4
the baseline of 60% wage replacement) is roughly 0.31% of annual earnings, or $202 annually for a worker

earning $65K a year (roughly the mean annual earnings in the estimation population). Based on these esti-

mates, the total surplus generated by public insurance is at least 0.68% of annual earnings, or $440 annually

for a worker with annual earnings of $65K. This bound is meaningful, as it indicates that the value individu-

als place on the compulsory public coverage is more than 2.5 times the cost of providing this coverage. It is

important to emphasize that these estimates come from a particular population that is not representative of a

broader set of workers. However, based on these estimates, compulsory public disability insurance is associ-

ated with benefits that far exceed the costs of this coverage for this employee population, and, for a plausible

range of moral hazard elasticities, extending the generosity of compulsory public coverage would result in

substantial welfare gains for these employees if they would not otherwise have access to employer-provided

supplemental disability coverage. We demonstrate that these results are robust to a wide range of alternative

specifications.

    While the empirical results are specific to the population we examine, our analysis also highlights some

general strengths of this approach for evaluating the welfare generated by compulsory public insurance. First,

this method requires straightforward variation and limited data to be implemented empirically. Implement-

ing this approach simply requires sufficient variation in the price of supplemental coverage to estimate the

demand curve for supplemental coverage and standard data on prices, insurance enrollment, and costs. In

contrast, other approaches to valuing public insurance often require isolating random (or like-random) assign-

ment of benefits within the compulsory public insurance program and often require data on consumption or

assets. Second, this approach does not require us to specify many of the underlying primitives of individuals’

decisions, in contrast to other approaches of valuing compulsory public coverage which typically rely on fully

specifying individual utility (or marginal utility), obtaining data on all the inputs in the utility (or marginal

utility), specifying the uncertainty individuals face, and/or assumptions on the nature of individuals’ opti-

mization. Third, this approach can accommodate features of complementary public and private insurance

in a range of settings. In settings with linear coverage, this approach can also be used to bound the welfare

generated by the inframarginal compulsory public coverage under minimal assumptions.

    Of course, this approach is not without limitations. A primary limitation of this approach is that it can only

be applied in settings in which individuals are permitted to buy supplemental insurance coverage. While there

are many public insurance settings in which individuals can buy complementary coverage (e.g., disability in-

surance, universal health insurance settings such as Medicare, etc.), there are some public insurance settings in

which no complementary coverage is typically available (e.g., unemployment insurance, means-tested public

insurance such as Medicaid), and in these settings this approach does not provide a constructive alternative




                                                        5
to existing approaches for valuing compulsory public insurance.9 Further, this approach is subject to the same

challenges and limitations of welfare analysis based on revealed preference in private insurance markets more

broadly. For instance, this approach relies on the notion of revealed preference to use demand estimates to

conduct welfare analysis, which is subject to potential criticisms related to behavioral biases or information

frictions. Moreover, empirical implementation of this approach requires isolating credible price variation and

requires making some parametric assumptions when there is not sufficient price variation to estimate demand

non-parametrically.10

      The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 describes the framework for evaluating welfare.

Section 2 describes the background and data for the empirical application. Section 3 describes the empirical

strategy, and Section 4 presents the demand estimates and welfare analysis. Lastly, Section 5 concludes.


1      Framework

1.1     Model

Setup and Notation The setup of our framework draws heavily upon prior work by Einav and Finkelstein

(2011) and Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010). Suppose there is a population of heterogeneous individuals,

indexed by ϕ. Let G(ϕ) represent the distribution of the population. An important aspect of this approach is

that heterogeneity across individuals is unrestricted. Importantly, this means ϕ may be multi-dimensional to

include variation in preferences and risk, and there are no restrictions on G.

      Individuals each face some continuous downside risk, where this absolute disposable income risk can vary

arbitrarily across individuals.11 Let w represent an individual’s baseline income, which can also vary arbitrar-

ily across individuals. Looking forward to our empirical application, let us consider linear insurance products

where the generosity of insurance is indexed by the fraction of the risk covered by the insurance, so that a θ

generosity policy covers θ% of the continuous underlying risk.12 Specifically, consider a supplemental insur-

ance product that provides δ generosity coverage on top of baseline public compulsory insurance coverage of

generosity α, so that an individual who holds both the baseline and supplemental insurance has total coverage

of generosity α + δ. Let π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) represent an individual’s willingness-to-pay for coverage of generosity θ

relative to the outside option of coverage of generosity γ. In this notation, we can represent the willingness-

to-pay for supplemental coverage (π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ)) and the willingness-to-pay for the compulsory baseline
    9 While supplemental insurance to top-up the benefits of compulsory public unemployment insurance is uncommon, supplemental

unemployment insurance exists in Sweden and thus a similar approach to analyzing welfare could be useful in that setting.
   10 Section 1.3 discusses the advantages and limitations of this approach in greater detail.
   11 Our empirical application focuses on insurance for lost earnings due to disability, which represents a continuous downside disposable

income risk. Disability is a continuous risk because disability shocks can vary in severity in terms of the duration of time that an individual
is unable to work. Some disability spells are relatively short-lived (e.g., 2-3 years), while many disability spells are of a much longer
duration often representing an absorbing state.
   12 While the framework is described in terms of linear contracts, all of the counterfactual welfare analysis related to the marginal coverage

sold in the supplemental insurance market can easily be extended to non-linear insurance settings as discussed further below.



                                                                       6
coverage (π(w, α, 0|ϕ)). Throughout, we suppose that the underlying primatives are such that π(w, θ, 0|ϕ) is

continuous and differentiable with respect to θ for all ϕ. Let c(w, θ, γ|ϕ) represent the expected cost borne by

insurance providers for an individual with coverage of generosity θ relative to coverage of generosity γ. In

this notation, we can describe the expected cost associated with an individual buying supplemental coverage

as the sum of two components,

                                   c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) = cS (w, α + δ, α|ϕ) + cP (w, α + δ, α|ϕ),                                            (1)

where cS (w, α + δ, α|ϕ) is the expected cost to the supplemental insurer for providing this incremental cov-

erage of generosity δ to the individual, and cP (w, α + δ, α|ϕ) is the expected external cost associated with the

individual having this incremental coverage which are borne by the primary insurer.13 In the special case

where the supplemental coverage is not associated with an externality on the primary insurer (with linear con-

tracts, this is equivalent to the case of no moral hazard), then there is no external cost for the primary insurer,

cP (w, α + δ, α|ϕ) = 0, and thus the total expected cost is simply the expected cost to the supplemental insurer,

c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) = cS (w, α + δ, α|ϕ). As will become clear, the framework outlined below accommodates ex post

moral hazard that arises after the purchase of supplemental insurance. Importantly, we abstract from moral

hazard that takes place prior to the supplemental insurance market decision.14

Supplemental Insurance Market: Demand, Costs, and Equilibrium Suppose each individual makes a dis-

crete choice whether to buy supplemental insurance of generosity δ for (relative) price p or go with the outside

option of the basic compulsory insurance of generosity α. Define the demand curve for this supplemental

coverage as follows:
                                                            Z
                                                                1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) ≥ p dG(ϕ),
                                                                                            
                                       D(p|α + δ, α) =                                                                                    (2)

where we assume the underlying primitives in the population are such that demand is decreasing, continuous,

and differentiable. Throughout we ignore income effects associated with changes in the price of supplemental

insurance.15 As will become clear, the theoretical framework explicitly accommodates income effects associ-

ated with a change in the generosity of the inframarginal coverage.

     Define the social marginal cost and social average cost curve for an insurance product that provides δ

generosity coverage on top of a baseline coverage of generosity α as follows:

                          M C(p|α + δ, α) = E[c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ)|π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) = p]                                                      (3)
                                            Z
                                              c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ)1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) ≥ p dG(ϕ)
                                                                                     
                           AC(p|α + δ, α) =                                                                                               (4)

where the cost curves M C(p|α + δ, α) and AC(p|α + δ, α) represent the costs inclusive of those incurred by both
  13 Throughout the discussion, the cost of insuring an individual is treated as invariant to the insurer’s identity. The model could easily

be extended to incorporate systematic cost differences across insurers.
  14 For example, in the empirical application to employer-provided disability insurance, this would rule out that the existence of disability

insurance may cause individuals to work in more risky occupations.
  15 Ignoring income effects from supplemental insurance premium variation allows us to use estimates of the Marshallian demand curve

for supplemental insurance in the welfare analysis that follows. Abstracting from income effects may be reasonable in settings where the
variation in premiums for supplemental insurance is small relative to income (as is the case in our empirical application).




                                                                      7
the supplemental insurer and the primary insurer. We can also define the marginal and average cost curves for

the supplemental insurer, who is only responsible for the incremental coverage:

      Consider the benchmark case of perfect competition, where we define the equilibrium price P CE , such that

supplemental insurers break even on average,

                                  P CE (α + δ, α) = min{p : p = AC S (p|α + δ, α)}.                             (7)

1.2     Welfare Measures

Next, we apply the framework above to analyze welfare. First, we consider the welfare associated with the

marginal coverage sold in the existing market for supplemental insurance and marginal counterfactuals in-

volving extensions of the compulsory insurance to include this incremental coverage. We illustrate how a

simple, straightforward extension of the Einav and Finkelstein (2011) framework can be used to investigate

the welfare associated with an expansion of compulsory insurance, where we incorporate key features that

can matter in the presence of parallel public and private insurance such as externalities induced by the sup-

plemental insurance and crowd-out of the private supplemental insurance market. Second, we consider the

welfare associated with the inframarginal coverage provided by the compulsory public insurance.

1.2.1   Marginal Coverage: Welfare From Extending the Generosity of Compulsory Public Insurance

A basic policy-relevant parameter of interest in social insurance settings is the value of extending the generosity

of compulsory public insurance. In a setting in which the only insurance available is the baseline compulsory

insurance of generosity α, the welfare from extending the generosity of the compulsory insurance coverage

can be described using the notation above as,
                             Z 
                                  ∂                                   
                                    π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) − c(w, θ, γ|ϕ)          dG(ϕ).                             (8)
                                 ∂θ                              θ,γ=α
    In settings where individuals have access to complementary insurance, there is a direct empirical analogue

to the objects in the expression above. Notice that the surplus generated by supplemental insurance for an indi-
                                                                                ∂
                                                                                                              
vidual, π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) − c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ), is simply a discretized version of ∂θ π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) − c(w, θ, γ|ϕ)  .
                                                                                                            γ,θ=α
In other words, relative to a benchmark of only compulsory insurance of generosity α, the social surplus as-

sociated with increasing the generosity of the compulsory coverage by δ for an individual is simply the social

surplus associated with that individual purchasing supplemental insurance, π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) − c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ).

      Note that equation 8 measures the welfare associated with a marginal extension of compulsory coverage

relative to a benchmark scenario where only compulsory coverage exists (i.e., a world with no private sup-

plemental insurance market). More generally, we may be interested in measuring the effect of extending the

generosity of compulsory coverage relative to a benchmark scenario in which individuals are able to pur-



                                                         8
chase private supplemental insurance themselves. This alternative benchmark scenario is of particular interest

because a necessary condition for empirically implementing this approach is the existence of a private supple-

mental insurance market.

    Let W elf are Extn(p|α + δ, α) represent the per-capita welfare associated with extending compulsory cov-

erage to include the supplemental coverage relative to a benchmark scenario where private supplemental

coverage is available for price p:
                                         Z
                                             π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) − c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) 1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) < p dG(ϕ). (9)
                                                                                                      
    W elf are Extn(p|α + δ, α)       =

In words, the above expression for welfare tells us that the value of extending compulsory public insurance

comes from aggregating individual values among people who would not have otherwise bought the private

supplemental coverage. There are a few important points to highlight about the above expression. First,

this expression nests the case in which no supplemental insurance is available (where effectively the price for

supplemental insurance is infinite),
                                                     Z
                                                                                            
                W elf are Extn(∞|α + δ, α)       =       π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) − c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) dG(ϕ).           (10)

Second, this expression provides an intuitive way to characterize how crowd-out affects the value of extending

the generosity of public coverage. To see this, note that we can decompose this expression as follows:

    W elf are Extn(p|α + δ, α)       = W elf are Extn(∞|α + δ, α)                                           (11)
                                       Z
                                          π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) − c(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) 1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) ≥ p dG(ϕ),
                                                                                                   
                                     −

where the first term represents the value of the extension if there were no private market available to crowd-

out, and the second term represents crowd-out of the voluntary private market for supplemental insurance

that would have existed in the absence of the compulsory public insurance extension.

Graphical Illustration We build intuition further through a graphical example in the spirit of Einav and

Finkelstein (2011). For the moment let us abstract from moral hazard, meaning that the social and private

cost curves are one and the same. Figure 1 Panel (A) plots the demand, marginal cost, and average cost

curves where the horizontal axis represents the fraction with supplemental insurance, and the vertical axis is

measured in dollars. For the purposes of this example, let us consider a private supplemental insurance market

that is characterized by competitive average-cost pricing, and let us assume the market is adversely selected

(as depicted in the figure by the downward sloping cost curves). In the absence of moral hazard, full insurance

is optimal if individuals are risk averse and administrative costs are negligible.

    Consider an extension of the compulsory coverage to include the benefits of the supplemental insur-

ance coverage. It is straightforward to measure the objects of interest in the context of this example. Rel-

ative to a benchmark where no supplemental coverage is available, the welfare generated by this exten-

sion is: W elf are Extn(∞|α + δ, α) = Area ABCD − Area EFCD. Relative to a benchmark of a compet-

itive private supplemental insurance market, the welfare generated by extending compulsory coverage is:


                                                          9
W elf are Extn(P CE |α + δ, α) = W elf are Extn(∞|α + δ, α) − Area AHIE, where this expression makes clear

that the term (Area AHIE) represents crowd-out of the private supplemental market that otherwise would

have existed.

    There are several additional counterfactual scenarios one can consider within this graphical example. For

instance, fixing the level of compulsory public coverage, the welfare associated with allowing a private sup-

plemental insurance market relative to banning supplemental coverage is represented by the trapezoid AHIE.

Relative to the first-best efficient allocation, a private competitive market for supplemental coverage is associ-

ated with welfare losses due to adverse selection represented by the trapezoid HBFI. It is also straightforward

to generalize this graphical example along several dimensions. For instance, Figure 1 Panel (B) illustrates a

setting with moral hazard, in which the supplemental insurer does not internalize the full cost of the incre-

mental insurance it provides. Thus, a supplemental insurer’s cost curves lie below the social cost curves for

the incremental coverage, where the vertical distance between these curves represents the externality associ-

ated with the supplemental coverage. While the optimal allocation is different than in the situation with no

moral hazard, the points have been re-labeled to emphasize that the analogous welfare measures associated

with extending the generosity of compulsory insurance are represented as in the discussion above.

1.2.2   Inframarginal Coverage: Welfare Generated by Compulsory Public Insurance

Beyond estimating the welfare associated with extending the generosity of compulsory public insurance, we

may also be interested in estimating the welfare associated with the inframarginal compulsory public coverage.

Below, we derive a lower bound on the total surplus generated by compulsory public insurance relative to the

absence of insurance for this risk using data and variation from supplemental private insurance.16

    Once again, consider a setting in which compulsory public insurance provides coverage α and supplemen-

tal coverage of generosity δ is available for price p. Our primary focus is to investigate the welfare provided

by the baseline compulsory coverage relative to a world with no insurance for this risk:
                                   Z n
                                       π(w, α, 0|ϕ) − c(w, α, 0|ϕ) 1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) < p
                                                                                        
  W elf are Baseline(p|α + δ, α) =
                                                     α                                         o
                                                        c(w, α + δ, 0|ϕ) 1 π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) ≥ p dG(ϕ). (12)
                                                                        

                                                  α+δ
    The first term in the expression above captures the value of compulsory public coverage among individ-
   16 In the interest of investigating counterfactuals requiring minimal assumptions, our primary focus is to investigate welfare provided by

the baseline compulsory coverage relative to a world with no insurance for this risk. Note that this welfare measure does not necessarily
represent the value of compulsory public insurance relative to a world without this compulsory insurance, as it could be the case that
alternative private insurance or alternative public programs providing coverage for this risk would exist in the absence of compulsory
public insurance. The welfare measure we focus on may characterize the welfare associated with compulsory public insurance more
generally in insurance settings in which there is a large degree of private information, in which we might expect complete (or nearly
complete) unraveling of private insurance in the absence of public coverage. For instance, this is arguably the relevant case for disability
insurance and long-term care insurance, as Hendren (2013) argues that the large degree of asymmetric information in these settings can
explain the almost complete unraveling of private, non-group insurance for these risks. Because nothing about the observed supplemental
insurance market can reveal what private or public coverage might exist in the absence of the compulsory public insurance, we avoid
making arbitrary assumptions about such a counterfactual and focus instead on the surplus generated by the inframarignal compulsory
public insurance relative to a world with no insurance for this risk.




                                                                     10
uals who do not buy supplemental insurance, and the second term captures the value of compulsory pub-

lic coverage among individuals who purchase supplemental insurance at price p.17 Note that it is relatively

straightforward to estimate costs in the expression above. The observed claim costs for those with and with-

out insurance could be used to estimate costs for this bound under the status quo allocation of supplemental

insurance (Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010)). If one wanted to estimate the bound under a counterfactual

allocation of supplemental insurance, one would need to predict costs leveraging an estimate of (or assumption

regarding) moral hazard. The key challenge to estimating the equality above is the fact that the willingness-to-

pay for the baseline coverage, π(w, α, 0|ϕ), is unobserved. To be able to empirically use this measure of welfare,

we need to have a way to connect what we can estimate in the data to the objects in the above expression. The

proposition below helps us do this.

Proposition 1. For an individual represented by ϕ, define the demand for insurance generosity on the intensive
                           ∂
margin: v(w, θ|ϕ) ≡        ∂θ π(w, θ, 0|ϕ).   Suppose that (i) v(w, θ|ϕ) is weakly decreasing in θ, and (ii) v(w, θ|ϕ) is

weakly decreasing in w. Then,
                                                                   α
                                                π(w, α, 0|ϕ) ≥       π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ).                                                (13)
                                                                   δ
Proof. Note that π(w − π(w, α, 0|ϕ), α + δ, α|ϕ) ≡ π(w, α + δ, 0|ϕ) − π(w, α, 0|ϕ).18 Under the assumptions in

the proposition, we get

                                                       =                                    ≥                  ,
                                                                            δ                         δ
where the first two inequalities follow from assumption (i) and it is straightforward to show the final inequality

follows from additionally assuming (ii) holds.

    Proposition 1 provides us a way to empirically bound the welfare provided by the inframarginal coverage.

To see this, note that the left-hand-side of inequality 13 is the key unknown in equation 12 , while the right-

hand-side of this inequality is a linear transformation of the willingness-to-pay for supplemental coverage,

π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ), an object whose distribution one can estimate with sufficient data and variation from the

private supplemental insurance market. To make this result concrete, consider the following example: Suppose

that compulsory public insurance covers 60% of some risk and supplemental insurance covers an additional

10% of the risk. Applying Proposition 1, we get that an individual’s willingness-to-pay for compulsory public
  17 Note that one could use a broader measure of welfare associated with public insurance if one accounted for the indirect value of

public insurance through allowing for a supplemental market in which individuals may buy supplemental coverage (as the existence of
the supplemental market is an indirect consequence of the public coverage).
  18 The willingness-to-pay for supplemental coverage is implicitly defined as the difference between the willingness-to-pay for α + δ

coverage and the willingness-to-pay for α coverage, with an appropriate shift in the income at which these expressions are evaluated:
π(w − π(w, α, 0|ϕ), α + δ, α|ϕ) ≡ π(w, α + δ, 0|ϕ) − π(w, α, 0|ϕ). Intuitively, this definition follows from the fact that the willingness-
to-pay for α + δ coverage (π(w, α + δ, 0|ϕ)), is the sum of the willingness-to-pay for α coverage (π(w, α, 0|ϕ)) and the willingness-to-pay
for the incremental coverage at a lower effective income (π(w − π(w, α, 0|ϕ), α + δ, α|ϕ)). By ruling out large income effects that operate
in the direction of undermining the bounding strategy, assumption (ii) allows us to connect the willingness-to-pay for the supplemental
coverage to the marginal willingness-to-pay for the baseline coverage.


                                                                    11
insurance is at least six times his/her willingness-to-pay for the incremental coverage sold in the supplemental

market. More generally, we get the following natural corollary defining a population-level bound on the

welfare provided by the compulsory baseline coverage:

     The assumptions behind Proposition 1 have a simple intuitive basis and are related to concepts in the prior

theoretical literature related to decisions under uncertainty.19 The first assumption states that an individual’s

demand for insurance generosity is weakly downward sloping. The second assumption says that an individ-

ual’s demand for insurance generosity for a fixed risk is weakly declining with his/her baseline income. In

the case that preferences can be represented by a univariate utility function, we obtain an alternative sufficient

condition in terms of utility for applying this bound:

Proposition 2. Suppose an individual’s utility can be represented by the increasing, thrice differentiable func-

tion u(c). Define π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) as: E[u(w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ))] = E[u(w + (1 − γ)x)], where θ > γ and the

expectation is taken over x ≤ 0, representing the uncertain losses the individual faces. Additionally, suppose

the individual is risk averse and his/her utility exhibits weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion. Then,
                                                       α
                                       π(w, α, 0|ϕ) ≥ π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ).                                    (15)
                                                        δ
and thus we obtain the bound in Corollary 1.

Proof. See Appendix A.

     The propositions above give us two alternative conditions under which we can apply a simple method

to bound the welfare generated by compulsory public insurance using information from the associated pri-

vate supplemental insurance market. There are a few important points to note. First, the key assumption

within Proposition 2 is weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion, which is satisfied by most of the common

utility functions used by empiricists, including Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA), Constant Relative

   19 Perhaps because it is so intuitive that an individual’s willingness-to-pay to avoid taking on risk should scale with the size of the risk,

prior theoretical papers have worked to derive sufficient conditions on utility functions such that the underlying preferences satisfy similar
properties to the properties we study here. See Eeckhoudt and Gollier (2001) and Menezes and Hanson (1970) for examples. While much
of the related theoretical literature focuses on risks with both positive and negative realizations (as is applicable in a finance setting), we
show that in the context of an insurance problem (where all realizations of risk are non-positive), we obtain a simple sufficient condition
for the assumptions within Proposition 1 when preferences can be represented by a univariate utility function (see Proposition 2).
   20 The general version of the HARA family is characterized by a utility function of the following form: u(c) = ξ(ν + c )1−γ . The absolute
                                                                                                                          γ
risk aversion for this family is then equal to rA = (ν + γc )−1 , which is clearly weakly decreasing in c for all parameter values for which
the individual is risk averse over the entire range of possible consumption values. Note the values for which the individual is risk averse
are those that satisfy: ξ(1 − γ)γ −1 (ν + γc )−γ−1 ≥ 0, ∀c ≥ 0.


                                                                      12
argument. Most of the theory surrounding decisions under uncertainty is developed within the setting of uni-

variate utility, and Proposition 2 follows in this spirit. In situations in which consumers face more complicated

optimization problems with utility defined over multiple goods, as is the case in insurance models with moral

hazard, one would want to directly rely on the assumptions on the demand for insurance within Proposition 1

to obtain the lower bound on the welfare provided by the inframarginal coverage.

    Regardless of whether one relies on the conditions within Proposition 1 or Proposition 2 to implement

the welfare bound, it is important to emphasize that this bounding approach does not require specifying par-

ticular individual utility/demand functions or restricting heterogeneity across individuals. In other words,

each individual may have his/her own distinct utility/demand function that varies arbitrarily throughout the

population, so long as each individual’s preferences exhibit weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion (or more

generally, satisfy the conditions on demand for insurance generosity within Proposition 1), the lower bound

on welfare described in Corollary 1 above is applicable.

Graphical Illustration Figure 2 illustrates Proposition 1 graphically. Consider a fixed individual indexed

by ϕ. This figure displays the individual’s demand for insurance on the intensive margin (e.g., the marginal
                             ∂
valuation v(w, θ|ϕ) =        ∂θ π(w, θ, 0|ϕ)),     where the horizontal axis represents the generosity of insurance (θ) and

the vertical axis is measured in dollars. As in Proposition 1, suppose that (i) v(w, θ|ϕ) is weakly decreasing in

θ, and (ii) v(w, θ|ϕ) is weakly decreasing in w. Recall, our goal is to use the observed data to investigate the
                                                                                 Rα
willingness-to-pay for the inframarginal compulsory coverage: π(w, α, 0|ϕ) = 0 v(w, θ|ϕ)dθ.

dividual’s willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ). Under assumptions (i) and (ii), the
                                                                                                                               π(w,α+δ,α|ϕ)
willingness-to-pay for supplemental coverage scaled by the amount of supplemental coverage,                                         δ       ,

provides an (under)estimate of the mean value of v(w, θ|ϕ) for θ ∈ [α, α + δ], represented by point A in Figure

2. While we have an estimate for point A, we cannot identify the function representing the individual’s demand

for insurance, v(w, θ|ϕ), without further assumptions, as the true function could be v1 (w, θ|ϕ) or v2 (w, θ|ϕ) or

any other function that passes through point A. However, as long as the individual’s demand for coverage is

downward sloping, we obtain the lower bound on the individual’s willingness-to-pay for the inframarginal

    To fully evaluate the net welfare from the inframarginal coverage for this individual, we must consider the

costs associated with this coverage accounting for any moral hazard induced by this coverage. Figure 2 repre-

efficient generosity level is represented by the intersection of the demand and marginal cost curves. The ex-

pected cost associated with the compulsory inframarginal coverage for this individual will depend on whether

LKMC). Thus, the net welfare associated with the baseline coverage for this individual would be bounded be-
                                                                                      α

low by Area DEJL if the individual has no supplemental coverage or Area DEBC− α+δ       (Area LKMC) if the

individual does have supplemental insurance.

     Figure 2 also illustrates that the tightness of the bound on the surplus associated with the inframarginal

coverage will depend on several factors. First, fixing the observed willingness-to-pay for supplemental in-

surance, the tightness of the bound will depend on the individual’s unobserved demand for insurance. For

instance, in the graphical illustration the bound would be tighter if the individuals true underlying demand

was represented by v2 (w, θ|ϕ) (where π(w, α, 0|ϕ) = Area FHBC) than if his/her demand was as in v1 (w, θ|ϕ)

(where π(w, α, 0|ϕ) = Area IGBC). Second, fixing the unobserved demand for insurance, the figure illustrates

that the lower bound is tight for low values of α and becomes very loose as α approaches the efficient gen-

erosity level (which is 100% absent moral hazard, but lower otherwise).22 An implication of this is that, all

else equal, we would expect to obtain a tighter lower bound in settings where supplemental insurance tops up

very incomplete compulsory insurance than in settings where supplemental insurance tops up very generous

compulsory insurance. We present a numerical example below that illustrates how the tightness of this bound

can vary under a range of assumptions on the underlying utility and decision environment.

Numerical Example              Next, we consider a numerical example to compare the bounding approach to a more

structural approach that specifies all the underlying primitives to illustrate the trade-offs between these com-

plementary approaches more concretely. Consider an individual indexed by ϕ who faces some potential loss

and has compulsory public insurance that covers 60% of this risk. Further, suppose the individual has the

option to purchase private supplemental insurance to cover an additional 10% of the risk on top of the public

insurance. Supposing that the conditions within Proposition 1 hold, the individual’s willingness-to-pay for the

infrmarginal coverage is at least six times his/her willingness-to-pay for the supplemental coverage, and thus

the individual’s surplus associated with the inframarginal coverage is at least six times the surplus associated
  22 To   more precisely characterize the tightness of the bound in our discussion below, we define the surplus ratio as: surplus ratio=
    π(w,α,0|ϕ)−c(w,α,0|ϕ)       . The surplus ratio describes how tight the lower bound is under a given set of assumptions, with a smaller
 Bound π(w,α,0|ϕ)−c(w,α,0|ϕ)
ratio indicating a tighter bound. As can be seen in Figure 2, the surplus ratio will be close to 1 for small values of α and will be very
large as α approaches the efficient generosity level. In the special case of linear demand for insurance generosity and no moral hazard,
the surplus ratio is monotonically increasing in α. The surplus ratio need not be monotonically increasing in α for a downward sloping
demand function more generally, though we find that the surplus ratio is monotonically increasing in α under the range of assumptions
analyzed within the numerical example below (see Appendix Figure A1). In the special case that the demand for insurance generosity is
                                                                      2−α
linear and there is no moral hazard, the surplus ratio is equal to (2−δ)−2ζ  , when α represents the compulsory insurance generosity and
the willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance is measured over the range of coverage (ζ, ζ + δ). The surplus ratio in the special case
with linear demand and no moral hazard is equal to 2.4 for (α, ζ, δ) = (0.34, 0.60, 0.10), which is the relevant range for the empirical
application. Thus, if the demand for insurance generosity were linear and there were no moral hazard, then the lower bound we estimate
would capture roughly 40% of the welfare associated with the inframarginal compulsory coverage. While the key advantage of the
bounding approach is that we do not need to specify the functional form of the demand for insurance on the intensive margin, this
suggests our estimated bound may be fairly conservative.


                                                                     14
with the supplemental coverage. This bound is applicable regardless of the distribution of uncertainty, the

specific form of utility, and access to liquidity.

    Suppose we observe (or have a reliable estimate for) an individual’s willingness-to-pay for supplemental

insurance and the expected cost associated with this insurance. For a given willingness-to-pay for supplemen-

tal insurance, Table 1 reports the calibrated value of the inframarginal coverage under various assumptions

on the underlying utility function, liquidity, and risk. For each scenario considered, the table also displays

the surplus ratio, which we define as the ratio of the surplus from the inframarginal coverage under the stated

assumptions to the lower bound on surplus from the inframarginal coverage derived under Proposition 1 (sur-
                 π(w,α,0|ϕ)−c(w,α,0|ϕ)
plus ratio=                              ). The surplus ratio describes how tight the lower bound is under a
             Bound π(w,α,0|ϕ)−c(w,α,0|ϕ)
given set of assumptions, with a smaller ratio indicating a tighter bound. To ease comparisons across the sets

of assumptions, each distribution of risk we consider has the same expected cost: $8 for each 1 percentage

point of insurance coverage.

    Fixing the willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance at $100, Figure 3 displays the numerical ana-

logue of Figure 2 under the range of assumptions considered in Table 1. Specifically, this figure displays the

marginal cost and marginal valuation of insurance generosity on the intensive margin, where units are scaled

to represent dollars per 1 percentage point of insurance coverage. Given a willingness-to-pay for supplemental

insurance of $100, an (under)estimate of the individual’s mean marginal valuation of insurance for a 1 percent-

age point increase in coverage is $10 over the range θ ∈[0.6, 0.7]. Based on Proposition 1, the lower bound on
                                                                                                          
the individual’s valuation of the inframarginal 60% coverage is $600 π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ) ≥ 6 × π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) and

the lower bound on the net surplus from the inframarginal coverage is $120 (Area ABCD in Figure 3). For each

of the considered sets of assumptions in Table 1 and the associated calibrated parameters, this figure displays

the implied marginal willingness-to-pay for insurance on the intensive margin.

    Figure 3 and Table 1 illustrate two important points. First, the precise implied valuation for the infra-

marginal public coverage is very sensitive to the underlying assumptions on the form of the utility, liquid-

ity, and the nature of uncertainty. Comparing the associated values in Table 1 columns (2) and (3) when

π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) = $100, we see that the implied net surplus from public coverage is 40% higher under the

CRRA specification than under the CARA specification, with the same assumed risk and benchmark income.

Comparing Table 1 columns (2), (4), (6), and (8), we see that the implied net surplus from public coverage

varies greatly with changes in the assumed risk distribution, even conditional on specifying the same form

of utility, benchmark income, and expected cost. A comparison of columns (2), (10) and (11) reveals that

the implied valuation of public coverage is very sensitive to the benchmark income; in this example, when

π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) = $100, the implied net surplus from public coverage based on CRRA utility increases 71%

when the benchmark income is cut by $14.5K. Second, the lower bound can be quite conservative, and the



                                                      15
tightness of the lower bound depends on the underlying risk, utility, and liquidity. Across all the considered

scenarios, we see that the implied surplus associated with inframarginal public coverage ranges from 1.79 to

6.29 times the lower bound.23 This highlights an important limitation of the bounding approach: it provides

less precise information about welfare than an approach that fully specifies the underlying primitives.

     In summary, this numerical example highlights the central trade-off between these complementary ap-

proaches to quantifying welfare. The bounding approach is more robust than a more structural approach in

terms of perturbations in the underlying utility, risk distribution, and liquidity; however, this robustness comes

at the cost of obtaining a lower bound on welfare rather than a precise welfare number. In some applications,

this cost may be considerable if the lower bound is too loose to provide valuable insights.

Empirical Implementation While the propositions above provide a lower bound on the surplus from the

inframarginal coverage for a given individual, we empirically implement the population-level bound in Corol-

lary 1 which aggregates across individuals. The key empirical inputs for the population-level welfare bound

are: (i) the mean willingness-to-pay for the supplemental coverage and (ii) the mean expected costs associated

with the inframarginal coverage given the status quo allocation of supplemental insurance. To estimate (i), we

estimate the demand for supplemental insurance and integrate under this demand curve. In settings with rich

enough price variation, the demand for supplemental insurance could be estimated non-parametrically. In

practice, there is typically a limited range of price variation available, and thus applying either the bounding

approach or a more structural approach to quantify the welfare associated with the inframarginal coverage

would typically require some extrapolation from the identifying variation to estimate the demand for supple-

mental insurance. However, in contrast to more structural approach, the bounding approach requires minimal

restrictions on the demand for insurance generosity for a given individual to relate the willingness-to-pay for sup-

plemental insurance to the willingness-to-pay for the inframaringal coverage.

     Following the empirical insurance literature, one can use ex post realized costs to estimate (ii). Note that

the observed realized costs are inclusive of any moral hazard induced by the status quo allocation of insurance

coverage, meaning that the bound estimated with these observed costs trades off the value associated with

the inframarginal coverage and the costs of this coverage inclusive of moral hazard induced by the observed

coverage.24 Putting this all together, empirical implementation of the population-level bound requires lever-
  23 Appendix Figure A1 depicts how the surplus ratio varies with the generosity of the baseline coverage, fixing the underlying utility

parameters as calibrated under the assumptions analyzed in Figure 3.
  24 More generally, one might be interested in applying this bounding approach in settings with a counterfactual allocation of supple-

mental insurance that departs from the observed allocation, and thus rely on the degree to which claims respond as one increases (or
decreases) coverage relative to the observed allocation. To do this extrapolation, one would need an estimate of moral hazard induced
by marginal coverage changes. To obtain such an estimate, one could either look to the prior literature for an estimate of moral hazard
or one could estimate moral hazard in the empirical application itself. In theory, a feature of this approach is that the claims data and
price variation required to implement this approach may be sufficient for estimating moral hazard as well. In practice, some empirical
applications will provide sufficient power to estimate demand but insufficient power to obtain precise estimates of moral hazard, as is the
case in our empirical application to disability insurance. We illustrate how one could proceed if this practical difficulty arises through our
approach to incorporating moral hazard in the empirical application.




                                                                     16
aging plausibly exogenous variation in premiums to estimate the demand curve for supplemental coverage

and standard data on prices, insurance enrollment, and costs.

1.3     Comparison to Alternative Methods

Below, we discuss how the willingness-to-pay approach we outline compares to other approaches used in the

prior literature to analyze the welfare associated with compulsory public insurance. There are a few notable

strengths of the willingness-to-pay approach. First, this method requires straightforward variation and limited

data to be implemented empirically. To estimate all of the inputs of the marginal and inframarginal welfare

analysis discussed above, one simply needs sufficient variation in the price of supplemental coverage to es-

timate the demand curve for supplemental coverage and standard data on prices, insurance enrollment, and

costs. In contrast, other approaches to valuing compulsory public insurance often require isolating random

(or like-random) variation in compulsory public insurance (which by virtue of the program being compulsory

is often difficult to do). In addition, alternative approaches often require data on consumption or assets, data

which is often not available and can suffer from considerable measurement error when it is available.

      Second, an advantage of this approach is that it allows us to remain largely agnostic as to the underly-

ing primitives of individuals’ decisions (similar to Einav and Finkelstein (2011)). It is possible to investigate

a wide range of marginal welfare questions (welfare analysis in the spirit of the sufficient statistics literature

on social insurance (e.g., Chetty, 2008)) without making restrictions on the form of individual utility or indi-

viduals’ underlying optimization problem. In settings with linear insurance coverage, going beyond marginal

welfare questions and bounding the welfare provided by the compulsory inframarginal coverage requires only

minimal assumptions on individual preferences. Further, because the framework does not restrict heterogene-

ity across individuals, this approach could be applied without restricting heterogeneity in settings with rich

enough variation to estimate demand non-parametrically.25 The fact that this approach requires few assump-

tions is in contrast to other approaches of valuing compulsory public coverage which rely on fully specifying

utility (or marginal utility), specifying the nature of uncertainty individuals face, restricting heterogeneity

across individuals, obtaining data on all the inputs in the utility (or marginal utility), and/or assumptions on

the nature of the individual’s optimization.

      Third, this approach can accommodate features of complementary public and private insurance in a range

of settings. It is straightforward to show that this approach can accommodate features that may be present
   25 Other approaches in the prior literature analyzing welfare associated with compulsory public insurance often require making assump-

tions to extrapolate along two margins: (i) extrapolate from a LATE estimate to a broader population by making parametric restrictions
on heterogeneity (similar in spirit to the parametric demand extrapolation in our application) and (ii) extrapolate to connect the estimated
elasticities to an expression for welfare through specifying underlying primitives (e.g., an optimization model for decision-making, bud-
get constraint, marginal utility, etc). In theory, if there were rich enough variation that one could estimate demand non-parametrically,
the approach we outline would not require much extrapolation on either margin. In practice, given the typical scope of variation avail-
able to estimate demand, the approach we outline will often require parametric extrapolation along margin (i), but will require minimal
assumptions to connect the parametric demand estimates to welfare (i.e., no substantial extrapolation on margin (ii)).




                                                                    17
in the supplemental insurance market, such as imperfect competition, administrative costs, multiple contract

options, and pricing regulations. Importantly, while the framework above is discussed in the context of linear

insurance (which is the relevant case in the empirical application that follows), the general approach to valuing

a marginal extension of compulsory coverage to include benefits covered by supplemental insurance can be

applied to any setting with complementary private insurance provided sufficient data and variation exist, even

settings with highly non-linear coverage. For example, if compulsory public insurance includes a deductible

and supplemental insurance fills in this deductible, an individual’s willingness-to-pay for supplemental in-

surance reveals his/her valuation of extending public insurance to fill in this deductible.26 In settings with

linear coverage, this approach can be used to go beyond marginal welfare questions and bound the welfare

generated by the inframarginal compulsory coverage under minimal assumptions.

    Of course, an important limitation of this approach is that it can only be applied in settings in which indi-

viduals can purchase complementary private insurance to top-up the compulsory public coverage. While there

are many public insurance settings in which individuals can buy complementary coverage (e.g., disability in-

surance, universal health insurance settings such as Medicare, etc.), there are some public insurance settings in

which no complementary coverage is typically available (e.g., unemployment insurance, means-tested public

insurance such as Medicaid), and in these settings this approach does not provide an alternative to existing

approaches to valuing public insurance. In addition, applying the inframarignal welfare bound requires that

the public and private insurance provide linear coverage for the same financial risk. Implicit in this require-

ment is that the public and private insurance be of the same quality aside from the definition of generosity.27

In settings where this additional requirement is not met, the applicable analysis would be limited to analyzing

marginal extensions of the compulsory public insurance to include coverage comparable to that offered by the

supplemental insurance.

    It is also important to note the interpretation of the welfare analysis discussed above. Because this ap-

proach draws upon the demand for supplemental insurance, any information realized before the purchase of

supplemental insurance is considered pre-determined at the time of evaluating welfare. In this way, the welfare

from public coverage discussed above is the welfare of this coverage based on the information known at the

point in time of the observed supplemental insurance market decisions. Thus, the lower bound on the value

of public coverage described above may be conservative from the perspective of ex ante welfare as it does not

capture any additional welfare from insurance against risk type revelation over time before the supplemental
   26 Or alternatively, in the setting of health insurance, if private supplemental insurance improves upon basic compulsory public insur-

ance by providing access to a broader group of health care providers, an individual’s willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance re-
veals his/her valuation of an extension of the compulsory public insurance coverage to include this broader group of health care providers.
To the extent that the available supplemental insurance fills the obvious gaps in the compulsory public insurance coverage in a given set-
ting, expanding compulsory public coverage to include the benefits of supplemental insurance may be one of the most policy-relevant
marginal expansions to consider.
   27 There may be instances where supplemental insurance is of higher or lower quality than the compulsory public coverage. In such

cases, the public and private insurance may be covering slightly different financial risks, and thus the linear insurance assumption fails
and the inframarginal welfare bound is not applicable.


                                                                    18
insurance purchase decision.28

      More broadly, this approach is subject to the same limitations and challenges of welfare analysis in private

insurance markets. For instance, this approach relies on the notion that individuals’ decisions to buy or forgo

insurance can be used within a revealed preference framework to do welfare analysis. While this is a common

approach to evaluating welfare in private insurance settings, there are potential criticisms and drawbacks to

relying on revealed preference as individuals may suffer from behavioral biases or may face informational fric-

tions. Additionally, as in typical analyses within private insurance markets, this approach relies on estimating

demand, which requires isolating price variation that is plausibly exogenous and typically requires making

parametric assumptions when there is not sufficient price variation to estimate demand non-parametrically.29

Despite the non-trivial challenges associated with using revealed preference for welfare analysis, researchers

conducting welfare analysis in private insurance settings typically opt to employ demand estimates and rely

on revealed preference (as opposed to employing methods similar to those used in the prior compulsory public

insurance literature). In this way, the framework described above provides a constructive illustration of how to

extend this revealed preference style analysis often employed in settings with private insurance to investigate

questions related to compulsory public insurance.


2      Empirical Application: Background and Data Description
The remainder of the paper applies the framework discussed in the prior section to evaluate welfare in the

context of public and private disability insurance. Specifically, we leverage price variation in the private sup-

plemental long-term disability (LTD) policies offered by one large employer to quantify the value of disability

insurance among workers in this population. While the empirical setting is interesting in its own right, the

empirical application also illustrates some of the strengths and challenges associated with this willingness-to-

pay approach for analyzing the welfare associated with compulsory public insurance. This section begins by

briefly describing some relevant background on public and private disability coverage. We then proceed to

discuss the data and identifying variation.

2.1     Brief Background on Public and Private Disability Coverage

In the United States, the public disability insurance program, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), is one

of the largest social insurance programs. In 2014, approximately 9 million disabled workers received SSDI ben-
   28 While much of the literature analyzing welfare in private insurance markets follows a similar approach taking heterogeneity under-

lying the demand for insurance as pre-determined, there are some notable recent exceptions that consider broader ex ante measures of
welfare. Hendren (2017) describes a method to estimate the ex ante value of insurance behind the veil of ignorance before individual
risk types are realized. His approach similarly draws on estimated demand and cost curves from an existing private insurance market.
Similar issues regarding a divergence between the point in time at which demand and welfare are measured arise in Handel, Hendel and
Whinston (2015) and Einav, Finkelstein and Williams (2016).
   29 As discussed above, most empirical applications of this approach will require some parametric extrapolation to identify the demand

curve across the population because a key input in the welfare analysis described above is an estimate of the mean willingness-to-pay for
the supplemental coverage (i.e., the integral under the demand curve across the population).



                                                                   19
efits, and the total SSDI benefits paid exceeded $140 billion.30 . Eligible workers may apply for public disability

insurance benefits in the event of a disability. The applicant then goes through an evaluation of his/her case

that includes an assessment of the severity of his/her disability and an assessment of his/her residual work

capacity.31 If an individual’s SSDI case is approved, the individual receives a monthly benefit that is a function

of his/her prior earnings history. In particular, the Social Security Administration (SSA) calculates the individ-

ual’s Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), which is defined as the average inflation-adjusted monthly

earnings in the individual’s 35 highest earning years of employment (or all years of employment if the ben-

eficiary has worked fewer than 35 years).32 The monthly benefit for the beneficiary, the Primary Insurance

Amount (PIA), is then determined by a piece-wise linear function of the AIME. Since SSDI pays a benefit for

each month the individual is out of the labor force due to disability, from an individual’s perspective SSDI in-

surance provides coverage that is linear in the risk (lost wages due to time out of work with disability), where

the effective replacement rate for individual i in the event that he becomes disabled in terms of his/her current

annual earnings, wi , is: γi = Annual SSDI
                                       wi
                                           Benefiti , where Annual SSDI Benefit = 12×P IA(AIM E ). Among
                                                                               i               i

US workers, the mean pre-tax replacement rate for public disability insurance through SSDI is roughly 45%.33

Throughout the following discussion, we focus on the welfare generated by the primary wage-replacement

benefits of SSDI abstracting from additional benefits associated with the SSDI program (e.g., Medicare cover-

age, survivor benefits, etc).34

    Many employers offer LTD insurance to supplement the wage replacement benefits of SSDI. Approxi-

mately 34% of all workers have the option to buy LTD coverage through their employer to top-up the coverage

from SSDI.35 While on average 34% of all workers have access to LTD coverage, the percent of workers with

access to LTD is much higher among particular subgroups: 44% of full-time workers, 53% of managerial and

professional workers, and 57% high income workers (workers in the top 25% of earners). The median replace-

ment rate of employer-provided LTD coverage is 60%, with only 1% of plans providing coverage in excess of

67% and 24% of plans providing coverage less than 60%.36

  33 This statistic is based on authors’ calculations using employees in the CPS, as described in Table 3. Note this replacement rate is

calculated before considering the tax treatment of wages and SSDI benefits.
  34 Some SSDI beneficiaries have access to additional benefits beyond the wage-replacement benefits described above. For example, after

two years of SSDI coverage, beneficiaries receive health insurance through Medicare. Additionally, in some circumstances, SSDI provides
additional financial benefits to beneficiary dependents (i.e., young children or elderly spouses). Throughout the following discussion, we
focus on the welfare generated by the primary wage-replacement benefits of SSDI abstracting from these additional features. Note that
the estimated lower bound on the welfare provided by the SSDI wage replacement benefits would be a conservative characterization of
welfare of the entire SSDI program to the extent that these additional features generate positive surplus.

2.2     Data Description and Identifying Variation

In this paper, we use data from one large employer that offers LTD coverage. The data comes from Alcoa,

Inc., a large, multinational manufacturing firm that annually employed roughly 48,000 employees within the

United States residing within 24 different states during our sample period. Approximately half of the the

firm’s employees are offered LTD benefits. The data include information on LTD benefit menus, enrollment

decisions, wages, employment status, basic demographics, and LTD claim payments.

      As is typical with employer-provided LTD policies, the policies offered by this employer guarantee a stated

replacement rate in terms of annual earnings, with the explicit stipulation that LTD claimants must apply for

SSDI, and, if approved, SSDI benefits crowd-out LTD benefits dollar-for-dollar.37 The LTD policies at this firm

insure relatively long duration disability spells, as workers cannot place an LTD claim until he/she has been

disabled for at least six months.38 In this way, LTD policies at this firm largely operate as a means to top-

up the replacement rate of the public program. For the remainder of the empirical application, we make the

simplifying assumption that the LTD plans provide pure top-up insurance for SSDI. While this simplification

is helpful in interpreting the lower bound on the value of the inframarignal coverage, the simplification is not

necessary to have a meaningful interpretation of the marginal coverage welfare analysis.39

Estimation Setting For the empirical application, we focus on employees offered the most common LTD

benefit menu containing three vertically differentiated plans with replacement rates of 50%, 60%, and 70%,

which we denote as Plan L, Plan M, and Plan H, respectively. We focus on the years in which this menu is

consistently available, 2003-2006. Employees choose a LTD plan during the annual open enrollment period

in November.40 The selected plan is effective for the following calendar year, where disabilities that originate

within that calendar year are covered if the disability results in time out of work in excess of six months.
   37 Based on notes in the LTD claims data regarding SSDI application status, the requirement to apply to SSDI seems to be enforced.

The crowd-out of SSDI benefits is in terms of pre-tax monetary benefits (not post-tax benefits), which is an important consideration when
incorporating the differential tax treatment of LTD benefits and SSDI benefits. We discuss this further in the robustness analysis in Section
4.
   38 This required period of disability before applying for benefits is often referred to as the “elimination period”. Autor, Duggan and

Gruber (2012) analyze data from a large LTD insurer covering policies offered by nearly ten thousand unique employers, and they report
that nearly two-thirds of beneficiaries have LTD insurance with a shorter elimination period than the firm we study, with the most common
elimination period being 90 days.
   39 In our empirical context, the LTD plans offered by the firm only vary with respect to the replacement rate. Since the identification

relies on comparing different LTD plans, the comparability of LTD and SSDI coverage in terms of quality is not important for identification.
Though LTD and SSDI appear to be of similar quality in this setting, it is important to think about how any differences in quality would
affect the interpretation of our analysis. The interpretation of some of our welfare analysis is largely unchanged by the comparability of
SSDI and LTD coverage. For instance, our estimate of the welfare associated with the observed market for a 70% LTD plan relative to
a 60% LTD plan (in Table 6 Panel A row 1) is the same regardless of the degree of comparability. However, if LTD and SSDI coverage
are not comparable, we would need to interpret the inframarginal welfare bound as more narrowly representing a bound on the value
of inframarginal disability coverage of quality comparable to LTD insurance. Similarly, if LTD and SSDI coverage are not comparable,
we would want to interpret our analysis of counterfactuals related to extending the generosity of disability insurance as more narrowly
applying to an insurance extension of comparable quality to LTD coverage (e.g., mandating the purchase of the marginal LTD coverage).
   40 In the event that an employee does not actively select a LTD plan, the employee is assigned to a default level of coverage. Plan M

is the default coverage for new employees, and the default for continuing employees is their coverage choice from the previous year.
Importantly, individuals in plans consistent with these default options could have actively chosen these plans. In Section 4, we analyze
the robustness of our results to excluding individuals who appear to not be active choosers based on their insurance allocations across the
range of employee benefits offered by this firm.




                                                                     21
    Table 2 describes the menu of LTD policies offered during our sample period, displaying the plan pre-

miums by year both in levels and relative to the plan of adjacent quality. In this setting, both benefits and

premiums are described in terms of an individual’s annual earnings. To ease interpretation, Table 2 also dis-

plays the premiums scaled by $60K, which is roughly the median annual earnings in the estimation sample.

From this table, one can see that there are several nice properties of the data for this empirical application.

First, the basic 50% replacement rate plan is free for all employees. This is convenient as no one opts out of the

plans, and thus claims data are available for all employees in the sample. Second, there is variation over time

in the incremental premium for the highest generosity coverage. For a worker with earnings of $60K annually,

the premium for Plan H (relative to Plan M) falls by $33 on a baseline of $98, representing a one third price

decline relative to the baseline premium. Thus, while the Plan H relative price change is modest in absolute

terms, it is fairly large in relative terms.41

    In this setting with vertically differentiated plans, the demand for a plan is determined by the premium

relative to the premiums for the adjacent plans, provided that no plans are dominated in the observed range of

premiums. Consistent with this intuition, the bottom panel of Table 2 illustrates that the decline in the Plan H

premium between 2003 and 2004 is associated with a sharp increase in Plan H enrollment and a sharp decline

in Plan M enrollment, while Plan L enrollment is largely unaffected. The primary estimation focuses on the

demand and costs associated with the incremental 10% replacement rate moving from Plan M to Plan H. That

is, the estimation focuses on estimating the demand for a 10 percentage point increase in the replacement rate

starting from a baseline replacement rate of 60%. Although there is a small amount of variation in the Plan

M premium that could be used to investigate the demand for Plan M (relative to Plan L), there are two key

reasons why we focus on the Plan H demand for our baseline estimation. First, from inspecting Table 2, one

can see that the relative premium for Plan H (compared to Plan M) varies more than five times as much as the

relative premium for Plan M (compared to Plan L) varies; thus, we obtain more precise estimates by focusing

on the demand for Plan H coverage. Second, under the assumptions used to derive the bound in Section 1,

focusing on the demand for Plan H provides a more conservative lower bound on the welfare provided by

public insurance.42

Measuring Variables for Analysis The primary data needed for the analysis are cost data, premium data,

and coverage data. While measuring premiums and coverage are straightforward, there are a few subtle is-

sues that arise when measuring costs in this setting. The ideal cost data would follow all realized disability

spells through their entire duration to calculate the cost measures used in the welfare analysis. Because the dis-
  41 Another way to benchmark the price change is to compare it to the mean insurer costs for this coverage. In these terms, the magnitude

of the Plan H relative price drop is 35% of the mean cost for the incremental coverage among those enrolled in Plan H.
  42 Appendix C provides suggestive evidence on the validity of the assumptions used to derive the bound by comparing the baseline

Plan H demand estimates to Plan M demand estimates that we obtain by leveraging the modest amount of available variation in the price
for Plan M (relative to Plan L).




                                                                   22
ability spells we focus on originated relatively recently (our sample period is 2003-2006), many of the disability

spells are still unfinished, and thus, this ideal information following each spell through its entire duration is

not available.43 In practice, we have data on LTD claims paid through 2011, which means that all disability

spells originating during the period of coverage (2003-2006) are observed through at least the first five years

of the spell. Although complete data is not available for censored spells, we can construct proxies for the total

realized costs using the data that is available. In our baseline analysis, we use a conservative measure of costs

where we calculate the maximum potential costs by extending those spells truncated at five years to their max-

imum possible duration and imputing the lost wages.44 Because our aim is to estimate a lower bound on the

welfare provided by disability insurance, this conservative measure is appropriate. However, we also repeat

the welfare analysis with alternative (less conservative) cost measures and display the results in Appendix D

for comparison. The primary cost measure used in the welfare analysis is the mean present discounted value

of the realized costs relative to annual earnings associated with the incremental 10 percentage point increase

in the replacement rate. The baseline cost measure is constructed using an interest rate of 4%, and additional

analysis in Appendix D illustrates that the results are robust to a range of alternative interest rates.

     One aim of the welfare analysis is to estimate a lower bound on the wage replacement benefits of public

disability insurance. In this analysis, we focus on bounding the surplus generated by compulsory disability

insurance coverage of generosity equal to the mean SSDI replacement rate in the estimation sample, where we

calculate an individual’s SSDI replacement rate using the SSA formula replacing the AIME with the monthly

wage rate according to the firm’s human resources records. We note this is an imperfect calculation because

the data does not contain each worker’s full work history which would be needed to precisely calculate the

AIME following the SSA formula.

Summary Statistics and Identifying Variation The estimation sample is restricted to salaried employees

who are actively employed in the previous calendar year, who are subject to the relevant LTD benefit menu,

and who have an SSDI replacement rate less than 50%.45 This final restriction ensures that for all the employees

in the sample, the LTD plans offered by the firm all provide coverage that goes beyond SSDI’s coverage. To

ensure the workers in the estimation sample are comparable over time, we exclude workers at job sites that

open or close during the period of analysis (2003-2006), and we exclude workers at job sites that experience

very large fluctuations in employment during the period of analysis (job sites at which the percent change in
   43 Notice that this is not just a data availability issue. Many of the disability spells originating during the period of coverage (2003-2006)

are currently still unfinished. Thus, even with the most up-to-date data available to claims administrators, there would still be a censoring
issue.
   44 Specifically, regardless of when the disability spell originated, we use the cost data to measure the length of the spell over the first

five years and extend spells that continue through the end of this five year window to their maximum possible duration. The maximum
possible duration of benefits is set by the LTD insurance policies and depends on the age at disability. For those disabled before age 60,
benefits may be paid until the individual turns age 65. For those disabled after age 60, the benefits may continue for a maximum of five
years.
   45 The restriction that workers be “actively employed” means that the workers were employed continuously at the firm and were not on

leave, paid or unpaid, during the previous calendar year.



                                                                       23
employment from the minimum to the maximum employment year exceeded 75%).46

    Figure 4 describes the public and top-up private disability coverage available to employees at the firm.

The horizontal axis displays the monthly earnings, and the right vertical axis displays the associated pre-tax

monthly potential disability benefit. The solid line displays the SSDI public disability benefit formula for the

year 2003 (the first year of our sample), while the remaining three lines display the benefit formula for those

who have one of the firm’s three available top-up private LTD plans in addition to SSDI public disability

insurance. The estimation sample focuses on individuals with an SSDI replacement rate less than 50% (the

Plan L replacement rate). In terms of this figure, these are the individuals whose monthly earnings lie to the

right of the intersection of the “with Plan L top-up” line and the “SSDI” line. This level of monthly earnings

based on the 2003 benefit formula is roughly $2,020 which is indicated in the figure by the vertical reference

line. In addition to displaying the public and private potential disability benefits, this figure also displays a

histogram of the monthly earnings for all salaried employees.47 As can be seen in this figure, the vast majority

of salaried employees at the firm have high enough earnings that their implied SSDI replacement rate lies

below the 50% threshold used to define the estimation sample.

    Table 3 compares employees in the estimation sample (column 3) to the entire employee population at the

firm (column 1) and to all salaried employees at the firm (column 2). From inspecting Table 3, one can see that

the mean employee tenure is approximately 13 years. The majority of employees are male, and the median

age is 45. The estimation sample contains roughly 23% of the overall employee population. Those in the

estimation sample differ from the wider employee population at the firm along a couple of dimensions: those

in the estimation sample are salaried employees (as opposed to hourly employees) and earn higher wages on

average. The median wage is roughly $60K in the estimation sample, while the median wage is approximately

$36.5K across the entire firm. Along several other dimensions such race, age, sex, and company tenure, the

estimation sample and the overall employee population look quite similar.

    For comparison, Table 3 columns (4) through (7) report analogous summary statistics for employees in

the Current Population Survey (CPS), pooling data across 2004-2007. Comparing columns (1) and (4), we see

that employees in the firm and a nationally representative sample of employees in the CPS appear broadly

similar in terms of mean age and mean annual earnings, but quite different in terms of gender composition.

The difference in gender composition can be explained by industry, as the employees at the firm (column 1)

and manufacturing employees in the CPS (column 5) look very similar along this dimension. Examining the

table further, we can see that the salaried employees at the firm (column 2) look similar in terms of observable

characteristics to manufacturing employees in the CPS with white collar occupations (column 6).48 Lastly,
  46 Because the identification strategy leverages over time variation, we make this restriction to ensure the sample is relatively homoge-

neous year-to-year.
  47 In this figure, monthly earnings are censored at ($200,000/12).
  48 The definition of white collar occupations used here encompasses individuals who report professional or managerial occupations.




                                                                    24
comparing the estimation sample (column 3) to the sample in the CPS that meets an analogous selection criteria

(column 7), one can see that they look broadly similar on observables such as age, gender, race, and annual

earnings. Overall, it is important to emphasize that neither the firm’s overall employee population nor the

estimation sample are representative of employees in the United States as a whole, so one should exercise

appropriate caution in interpreting the estimates. That being said, along the lines of observable attributes, the

employees in the estimation sample look similar to manufacturing, white collar employees more broadly.

    To identify the demand for Plan H, we utilize a straightforward over-time identification strategy exploiting

the sharp decrease in Plan H premiums between 2003 and 2004. Importantly, we have three years of data after

the price change to trace out any underlying time trends. The key identification assumption is that absent

the price change, the take-up of Plan H would not have changed discontinuously between 2003 and 2004.

While we cannot test this assumption directly, we can provide several pieces of evidence in support of this

assumption. First, the aggregates reported in Table 2 provide some support for this assumption. We see that

coincident with the sharp drop in premiums between 2003 and 2004 there is a sharp increase in the take-up of

Plan H, and this increase in Plan H market share comes at the expense of Plan M, as expected if the change in

market share was due to the relative price change. Moreover, we see that both the Plan H market share and the

relative premium for Plan H are stable thereafter, from 2004 to 2006. Second, as we discuss further below, our

analysis in Table 4 indicates that the identifying variation is unrelated to observable employee characteristics

that may be important determinants of the demand for disability insurance. Third, we demonstrate that the

welfare analysis is robust to the inclusion/exclusion of covariates in the demand estimation (e.g., a time trend,

demographic controls, individual fixed effects, etc.).

    Table 4 explores whether the identifying variation is related to observable characteristics of employees.

Since the identifying variation stems from a sharp change in premiums between 2003 and 2004, it is important

to demonstrate that the estimation sample is comparable across years in all other ways. Column (1) summa-

rizes demographic information for employees in the sample during 2003 (the year in which the relative price

for Plan H was the highest), while columns (2) through (4) display summary statistics for the subsequent three

years, during which the relative price for Plan H was lower and quite stable. Across these columns, the table

summarizes observable employee information by year, along with the overall mean predicted probability of the

worker claiming LTD based on the worker’s observable characteristics (denoted by “predicted LTD claims”).

This predicted probability is simply the fitted value from regressing an indicator for having a disability claim

on all the observable attributes summarized in Table 4, where we control flexibly for age and wage using indi-

cators for deciles of these distributions. Inspecting this table, we see the sample looks very similar across the

four years in terms of age, job tenure, fraction male, earnings, and predicted LTD claims. In particular, there

is no evidence of a problematic break in observables coincident with the Plan H price decrease between 2003



                                                         25
and 2004. We also investigate this in a slightly different way, relating the continuous (relative) price for Plan

H to each of these worker characteristics including a time trend. The coefficients and p-values associated with

these pair-wise regressions, reported in columns (5) and (6), collectively illustrate that the identifying variation

is unrelated to the observable characteristics. In addition, we cannot reject that all of these observables are

jointly unrelated to the premium variation (p-value 0.34). Overall, the evidence from Table 4 illustrates that

the identifying premium variation is unrelated to observable characteristics.


3    Empirical Strategy and Connection to Welfare Framework
Applying Framework To apply the framework outlined in Section 1, we make the following assumption:

Assumption 1. For an individual represented by ϕ, define the demand for insurance generosity: v(w, θ|ϕ) ≡
∂
∂θ π(w, θ, 0|ϕ).   For all individuals (i.e., for all ϕ), suppose that (i) v(w, θ|ϕ) is weakly decreasing in θ , and (ii)

v(w, θ|ϕ) is weakly decreasing in w .

    We implement this analysis by estimating the demand and costs associated with a 10 percentage point

increase in the replacement rate starting from a baseline of 60% wage replacement in the event of disability

(moving from Plan M to Plan H among the plans offered by the firm). Thus, the empirical application departs

from the initial basic framework in Section 1 in that there is a wedge between the willingness-to-pay we esti-

mate (moving from a 60% to 70% replacement rate) and the replacement rate of compulsory public insurance

(on average 34% in our estimation sample). Under Assumption 1, π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) is decreasing in α, and we

apply Proposition 1 to obtain a lower bound (analogous to that in Corollary 1) on the welfare associated with

compulsory disability insurance of generosity αP ublic relative to no insurance coverage in the presence of the

status quo allocation of supplemental insurance:
                      Z
                                                                     
  W elf are P ublic =     π(w, αP ublic , 0|ϕ) − c(w, αP ublic , 0|ϕ) dG(ϕ)
                                            Z n
                                                 αP ublic                    αP ublic                    
                                         ≥                π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ) −          c(w, αobs (ϕ), 0|ϕ) dG(ϕ), (16)
                                                    δ                        αobs (ϕ)
    where αobs (ϕ) is the observed aggregate replacement rate across public and supplemental insurance for

individual ϕ.49 In addition to calculating this bound, we also analyze the welfare generated by the marginal

coverage moving from a 60% to a 70% replacement rate. Under the assumption used to calculate the infra-

marginal welfare bound (Assumption 1), the value of the incremental coverage, W elf are Extn(∞|α + 0.1, α),

is decreasing in the baseline coverage α. Thus, under Assumption 1, we can interpret the welfare associated

with the marginal coverage as a lower bound on the welfare obtained by a 10 percentage point increase in the

replacement rate, starting from the lower replacement rate of public disability coverage.
  49 Because the counterfactuals we consider allow for moral hazard, we leverage Proposition 1 to derive the population-level bound we

implement rather than Proposition 2. See Section 1 for further comparison of these propositions.




                                                                 26
Demand To analyze welfare, we estimate the demand for supplemental coverage. In the disability insurance

setting, an individual’s coverage and an individual’s premium are defined relative to the individual’s annual

earnings, and the variation used to identify the demand curve is in the relative premium for supplemental

coverage. Thus, we estimate the demand curve in relative terms and then discuss how this demand curve is

used in the welfare analysis below. Let pH       M
                                         it and pit represent the premium (relative to annual earnings) faced
                                                                                                     π(w,θ,γ|ϕ)
by individual i in year t for Plan H and Plan M, respectively. Let rπ (θ, γ|ϕ) =                         w        denote the relative

willingness to pay for generosity θ coverage over the outside option of γ coverage. The focus of the empirical

analysis is on estimating demand for Plan H relative to Plan M: the distribution of rπ (0.7, 0.6|ϕ). To recover

this relative demand curve from the empirical setting, we assume that none of these vertically differentiated

products are dominated in the ranges of prices observed in the data, so that the relevant price for tracing out

the relative demand curve for a product is the price compared to that of the adjacent products. Under this

assumption, we can use variation in the relative price for Plan H over Plan M, (pH     M
                                                                                 it − pit ), to trace out the

distribution of rπ (0.7, 0.6|ϕ).

    Given rich enough variation in relative prices, one could in principle estimate a nonparametric demand

curve for the incremental coverage, giving one an almost fully nonparametric bound on welfare generated by

the compulsory insurance (under the minimal conditions within Assumption 1 above). Though we leverage a

fairly large relative price change for Plan H compared to Plan M, this price variation translates into a modest

change in the quantity of individuals insured through Plan H, moving the share insured under Plan H from

60% to 64% of employees. Given a primary aim of our analysis is to estimate the mean willingness-to-pay for

the incremental coverage (i.e., the integral under the demand curve across the population), we must rely on a

parametric specification of demand. In the face of these practical constraints, we conduct our baseline welfare

analysis leveraging a linear demand specification and then show the key findings from the welfare analysis are

robust to several alternative demand specifications.50 In our baseline specification, we estimate the demand

for Plan H coverage using the following estimation equation:

                      P lanHit = I(rπ (0.7, 0.6|ϕ) ≥ pH     M                H     M
                                                      it − pit ) = α0 + α1 (pit − pit ) + ρXit + it ,                               (17)

where P lanHi indicates if individual i selected Plan H and (pH     M
                                                              it − pit ) is the price of Plan H relative to Plan

M. The baseline demand estimation includes a time trend to control for any unrelated trends in insurance en-

rollment that may be correlated with the identifying variation. Further analysis presented in Section 4 demon-

strates that the welfare analysis is robust to several other alternative specifications of demand, including alter-

native included/excluded covariates (e.g., no controls, individual fixed effects, etc.) and alternative demand

forms (e.g., probit demand, logit demand, linear-log demand, log-log demand, etc.).
  50 Although the shape of the demand curve certainly varies across alternative functional form extrapolations, the implied mean

willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance is less sensitive to the specific extrapolation. Thus, the resulting lower bound on the
value of the inframarignal coverage is in the same general range across the functional form extrapolations for demand that we investigate.
See Table 7 for this robustness analysis.



                                                                   27
Costs While cost data is not necessary to measure the willingness-to-pay for disability insurance, to fully

evaluate welfare it is necessary to have data on costs. We use individual-level data on disability claims to

analyze costs, where we use realized costs as a proxy for expected costs. As is the case with demand, costs

are measured relative to annual earnings. Let cit represent the present discounted value of the realized costs

relative to annual earnings associated with providing individual i in year t an incremental 10% replacement

rate paid in the event of disability. We use an interest rate of 4% in the baseline estimation.51 Our focus

throughout is on the wage replacement costs for disability insurance, abstracting from administrative costs.52

      With regard to analyzing costs, the empirical environment has both strengths and weaknesses. A strength

of the empirical environment is that there is individual-level administrative cost data. While in principle one

could use the very same price variation used to estimate the demand curves to estimate moral hazard and

selection, a practical limitation is that it is difficult to obtain precise estimates of selection and moral hazard

within the context of disability insurance because realized costs are noisy proxies for expected costs given the

low incidence of disability.53 In the face of these strengths and weaknesses, we take the following approach.

First, our baseline welfare analysis focuses on estimating welfare in the status quo allocation of insurance. Since

this estimation draws on observed realized costs, this analysis fully incorporates moral hazard and selection

within the status quo insurance allocation. Second, we analyze welfare within counterfactuals that depart

from the status quo allocation of insurance under a wide range of assumptions on the moral hazard elasticity.54

Overall, we find that the key lessons of the counterfactual welfare analysis are not very sensitive to the amount

of incremental moral hazard within a plausible range of elasticities.


4      Empirical Application: Estimates and Welfare Analysis
Estimates Table 5 displays the demand and cost estimates. Panel A columns (1) and (2) display linear de-

mand estimates for Plan H coverage, without individual fixed effects (column 1) and with individual fixed

effects (column 2). Across these specifications, we see that an increase in the relative premium for Plan H is

associated with a statistically significant decline in the share of individuals with this disability plan. Drawing

on the estimates from column (1), the magnitude implies that an increase in the premium for Plan H by 0.1%

of annual earnings would lead the share of individuals enrolled in Plan H to decline by 7 percentage points (or

11% of the mean value). Table 5 Panel A also displays the mean implied willingness-to-pay for the incremental

coverage based on these regression estimates, along with the associated bootstrapped standard error. Using
    51 Additionalanalysis presented in Appendix D illustrates that our results are robust to a range of alternative interest rates.
    52 While we have no data on administrative costs and thus abstract from such costs here, it would be straightforward to calculate
alternative welfare measures incorporating administrative costs. Because the welfare analysis discussed below illustrates that the marginal
disability coverage generates substantial surplus, incorporating even quite large administrative costs would not affect the qualitative
findings.
   53 While our baseline welfare analysis does not depend on estimating moral hazard or selection, we exploit the available price variation

to investigate these and report the results in Appendix B. As noted in the text, this analysis has limited statistical power due to the low
incidence of disability claims.
   54 As will become clear, the counterfactuals we focus on do not require estimating the degree of selection.




                                                                    28
these estimates from column (1), the implied annual mean willingness-to-pay for the incremental coverage

provided by Plan H is 0.31% of annual earnings, or $202 for an individual earning $65K annually (roughly the

mean annual earnings in the sample population). The 95% confidence interval allows us to rule out estimates

less than 0.25% of annual earnings or more than 0.37% of annual earnings.55 The implied valuation of the

incremental coverage is similar when employing estimates from a specification with individual fixed effects

(column 2). Table 5 Panel B displays the mean observed costs scaled to represent a 10% replacement rate for all

and separately for those who do and those who do not purchase supplemental coverage. Comparing Panels

A and B, the mean willingness-to-pay for incremental coverage in the population is large relative to the mean

observed costs among the insured or among the sample population overall.

Implied Welfare Analysis Next, we present the welfare analysis based on these estimates. For each sce-

nario considered, Table 6 reports the mean willingness-to-pay and welfare per dollar of annual earnings using

the demand estimates from Table 5 column 1. The table reports the associated bootstrapped standard errors,

and reported per-capita mean values are evaluated over the entire sample population.56 In addition, we also

present two scaled versions of these measures to ease interpretation. The table reports the mean willingness-

to-pay and welfare as a percent of the mean per-capita cost associated with the counterfactual. To contextualize

the relative estimates in terms of dollars, the table also reports the mean willingness-to-pay and welfare mea-

sures scaled by $65K, approximately the mean annual earnings in the sample. Note that scaling the estimates

by the mean annual earnings provides an unbiased estimate of these welfare measures in dollar terms if earn-

ings are uncorrelated with the relative willingness-to-pay for disability coverage.57

     Table 6 Panel A presents our baseline welfare analysis analyzing the welfare associated with the marginal

and inframarginal coverage under the observed allocation of supplemental insurance in the status quo. Row

(1) displays welfare associated with the incremental coverage evaluated at the mean observed allocation of

supplemental coverage. Because the mean observed allocation of the incremental coverage is very close to the

allocation under a competitive equilibrium for this coverage, these welfare measures approximate the welfare

associated with a competitive market for the incremental coverage.58 The per-capita mean willingness-to-pay

associated with the observed market for the incremental coverage is 0.36% of annual earnings, or $233 annually

when scaled by $65K. The implied per-capita welfare associated with the market for incremental coverage is

0.26% of annual earnings, or $170 annually when scaled by $65K. Row (2) presents the implied lower bound on
  55 This confidence interval is based on the bootstrapped standard error on the mean willingness-to-pay reported in Table 5, where we

utilize 10,000 bootstrap samples.
  56 The bootstrapped standard errors are calculated using 10,000 bootstrap samples.
  57 Note that this scaling will underestimate the value of disability coverage in dollar terms if instead the relative surplus from disability

coverage is positively correlated with annual earnings.
  58 Comparing the estimates within Table 5 Panel B, the mean relative price for the incremental Plan H coverage is very close to the

average cost of those individuals willing to pay for the incremental coverage. In other words, the predicted competitive equilibrium in
the market for the incremental coverage would be close to the observed pair of average prices and quantities regardless of the shape of
the average and marginal cost curves far outside of the variation in the data. Thus, we can think of the mean observed allocation as an
approximation of the competitive equilibrium. See Appendix B for more details.



                                                                      29
the welfare associated with the inframarginal disability insurance providing a 34% replacement rate, the mean

public disability replacement rate among individuals in the sample. The mean willingness-to-pay for public

disability coverage is at least 1.05% of annual earnings, or 279% of the per-capita cost of this coverage. The

implied per-capita welfare of this coverage is at least 0.68% of annual earnings, or $440 when scaled by $65K.

Overall, there are two key findings. First, the observed market for supplemental insurance coverage gener-

ates substantial surplus. Second, the observed demand and costs within the supplemental insurance market

provide a meaningful lower bound on the value of the inframarginal public disability insurance coverage,

indicating that individuals highly value the public coverage relative to the costs of providing it.

    It is important to emphasize that our baseline welfare measures in Table 6 Panel A fully incorporate moral

hazard, and thus implicitly the trade-off between risk protection and moral hazard (e.g, Chetty (2008), Baily

(1978)). To see this, note that the observed costs in the supplemental insurance market are inclusive of any

moral hazard induced by the status quo allocation of insurance coverage. This means that the observed costs

are the relevant costs for calculating the welfare associated with the observed supplemental insurance market

and the lower bound on the welfare associated with the inframarginal public coverage in the presence of the

observed supplemental insurance market. Thus, the lower bound in Row (2) Panel A indicates that public

disability coverage is highly valued relative to the costs of this coverage inclusive of moral hazard induced by

the public coverage and the observed allocation of LTD supplemental coverage.

    Next, we consider welfare under counterfactual allocations of insurance that depart from the observed

allocation. To evaluate welfare under these counterfactual insurance allocations, we will need an estimate

of moral hazard—-the degree to which costs respond as one increases or decreases coverage relative to the

observed allocation. In theory, an advantage of this general approach is that the same data and variation

used to estimate demand could be used to explore moral hazard. In practice, there is limited power to detect

moral hazard in our empirical setting given the observed range of variation and the low incidence of disability

claims.59 Thus, we analyze welfare in counterfactual allocations of insurance under a range of moral hazard

elasticities to illustrate how these welfare estimates vary with the degree of moral hazard.

    Table 6 Panel B presents estimates of welfare under a hypothetical compulsory insurance extension from

a baseline 60% replacement rate to a 70% replacement rate relative to a setting where individuals do not have

access to this incremental coverage.60 Each column displays these estimates under the stated assumed moral

hazard semi-elasticity: the percentage change in the PDV of lost earnings due to disability with respect to a

change in the replacement rate. There are a few key take-aways from this additional analysis. First, the in-
   59 Appendix B exploits the available price variation to investigate moral hazard in this setting. As noted in the text, this analysis has

limited statistical power due to the low incidence of disability claims.
   60 For employees on Plan H, we observe costs inclusive of any moral hazard associated with the incremental coverage. However, for

individuals on Plan M and Plan L we need to project what their costs would have been under Plan H. If there is no moral hazard, this
is simply the costs associated with a 10% replacement rate applied to their observed mean per-unit of coverage costs. If there is moral
hazard, we inflate these costs by the appropriate moral hazard semi-elasticity in the calculations in Table 6.



                                                                    30
cremental disability coverage is associated with substantial surplus if moral hazard is in the range of prior

estimates. Prior studies in other disability settings have found that a 10 percentage point increase in the re-

placement rate leads to approximately an 8-10% increase in disability (e.g., Gruber (2000), Autor, Duggan and

Gruber (2012)).61 If the moral hazard elasticity is in the range of these prior estimates, the net welfare from ex-

tending the generosity of disability insurance is at least 78% of the cost of providing this coverage. Second, the

incremental disability coverage is associated with positive surplus for a much broader range of moral hazard

elasticities; in this population, the incremental disability coverage is associated with positive surplus provided

that a 10 percentage point increase in the replacement rate leads to less than a 38% increase in lost earnings due

to disability. Third, comparing Panel A and Panel B, we see that mandating the incremental coverage does not

increase surplus relative to a private voluntary market for this coverage.

     It is important to emphasize that the estimates come from a particular population that is not representative

of workers more broadly. However, based on these estimates, workers in this population seem to highly value

the inframarginal disability coverage offered by public disability insurance, and, if it were not for the fact

that this firm offers fairly priced supplemental coverage, there would likely be significant welfare gains from

extending the generosity of public coverage for these workers. Below, we demonstrate that the key findings

are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications. The general qualitative result— that individuals highly

value disability insurance on the margin— is in line with the findings from prior studies related to disability

insurance. Prior studies by Low and Pistaferri (2015) and Chandra and Samwick (2005) employ calibrated life-

cycle models to quantify the welfare associated with disability insurance. While the approach in these studies

is quite different from our willingness-to-pay approach, these calibration studies provide similar qualitative

findings as they predict that extending the generosity of SSDI would improve welfare.62

Robustness Next, we illustrate the robustness of the welfare analysis to a variety of alternative specifications.

In the interest of brevity, the discussion focuses on the robustness of the estimated lower bound on the value

of public coverage. For each alternative specification considered, Table 7 Panel A displays the implied lower

bound on the mean willingness-to-pay and welfare generated by public insurance, and Table 7 Panel B displays

the underlying parameter estimates corresponding to each alternative specification. The first rows of each

panel of Table 7 display the baseline welfare measures and linear demand estimates for reference.

     Because the welfare analysis requires us to extrapolate outside the empirical variation in premiums, the
  61 Gruber (2000) estimates the effect of benefit generosity on labor force participation using variation in public disability insurance

generosity in Canada. Autor, Duggan and Gruber (2012) estimate the effect of benefit generosity on the probability of claiming LTD using
variation across employers in LTD offerings, focusing on plans that typically have much shorter elimination periods than the plans in our
setting. Though these prior studies estimate slightly different elasticities than the elasticity of interest in the present setting, we use these
prior estimates to contextualize the results in Table 6 Panel B.
  62 Given the large stakes associated with disability risk and the incomplete coverage available from other sources, it is perhaps not

surprising that individuals would highly value an incremental increase in coverage for this risk. The threat of a career-ending disability is
arguably the largest adverse financial shock faced by many individuals. Prior work by Dobkin et al. (2017) has found that while individuals
tend to have close to complete coverage for the medical costs associated with health shocks, individuals have relatively little coverage for
the earnings losses associated with severe health shocks.



                                                                       31
functional form of the demand curve could meaningfully influence the welfare estimates. Thus, we assess the

robustness of our findings by considering alternative demand forms. Rows (2) and (3) present estimates from

alternative probit and logit demand specifications, respectively. An undesirable property of the linear demand

estimates is that the implied willingness-to-pay for those with the lowest willingness-to-pay is below zero. To

address this concern, we consider several additional alternative specifications. Row (4) displays alternative

welfare measures based on the baseline linear demand curve truncated at an implied valuation of zero. Row

(5) displays a linear-log specification, while Row (6) displays a log-log specification where both quantity and

premiums enter in logs. Because unconstrained linear-log and log-log specifications yield somewhat unreal-

istically high valuations of LTD in the upper tail and our aim is to obtain a lower bound, we constrain the

estimated demand curves in Rows (5) and (6) such that the maximum willingness-to-pay for Plan H incremen-

tal coverage is 1% of annual earnings. Overall, we obtain a meaningful lower bound on the value of public

coverage across all of these demand specifications, ranging from 0.5% to 0.9% of annual earnings.

    Next, we consider the robustness of the analysis with respect to the variation used to estimate demand.

Because the identification relies on over-time variation, it is important that individuals in the sample in differ-

ent years are comparable to one another. In addition to the evidence in Table 4 that observable characteristics

look similar across time, we illustrate that our results are robust to the inclusion/exclusion of a wide range of

controls. The baseline specification estimates Equation 17 where we include a time trend to control for any un-

related trends in coverage that could be correlated with the identifying variation. Row (7) displays the results

associated with estimating Equation 17 with no controls, and Row (8) displays the results associated with esti-

mating Equation 17 with additional controls for demographic characteristics.63 Row (9) displays the results of

the individual fixed effects specification, and Row (10) displays the results from a propensity score re-weighted

regression, where observations are re-weighted to look demographically alike to individuals in the first year

of the sample. Taken together, the results in Table 7 rows (7) through (10) illustrate that the welfare bounds are

qualitatively and quantitatively similar with the inclusion of more or fewer controls.

    We also consider robustness with respect to the tax treatment of premiums and benefits. For the LTD plans

offered at this employer, premiums are paid by employees with pre-tax dollars, and the benefits individuals

receive from their LTD policy in the event of a disability are taxable. In contrast, SSDI benefits are largely

exempt from tax.64 Because it is not clear that employees know the differential tax treatment of each of these,

premiums and the benefits are treated symmetrically in the baseline specification. Row (11) reports the results

from an alternative specification that reflects the tax treatment of premiums and benefits, where we assume

LTD premiums are paid with pre-tax dollars, LTD benefits individuals receive are taxable, and public SSDI

benefits are not taxable (effectively raising the mean SSDI replacement rate from 34% to 52%). For simplicity,
 63 Specifically, the demographic covariates included in this specification are age, sex, and race.
 64 See   this SSA website describing the tax treatment of SSDI benefits: https://www.ssa.gov/planners/taxes.html.



                                                              32
we assume that the same marginal tax rate is applicable to premiums and benefits, and we use a marginal tax

rate of 35%, roughly the average marginal tax rate among individuals in this sample accounting for state and

federal income taxes. While accounting for the tax treatment of LTD premiums and benefits leads to a lower

implied surplus for a fixed extension of LTD coverage, accounting for the tax treatment of public SSDI benefits

(and the effectively higher after-tax replacement rate) exactly offsets this giving us the same lower bound on

the welfare of public disability insurance as in the baseline specification.65

      Lastly, drawing upon a strategy in prior work by Einav et al. (2012), we analyze the robustness of our results

to excluding employees who appear to be “passive” choosers.66 Row (12) reports the demand estimates and

associated welfare measures excluding the roughly 13% of employees in our sample who appear to be passive

choosers, where we characterize an individual as a passive chooser if at any point during the sample period

his/her insurance selections are completely consistent with all the default options across the range of employee

benefits offered by the firm including health insurance, prescription drug insurance, dental insurance, and

disability insurance.67 The results for the sub-sample of individuals who appear to be active choosers in each

year are very similar and statistically indistinguishable from the results for the baseline sample.


5       Conclusion
This paper outlined an approach to analyze welfare associated with compulsory public insurance relying on

data and variation from the private market for complementary insurance. This approach has several nice

properties as it requires straightforward variation, commonly available data, and minimal assumptions to

evaluate a wide range of welfare questions. Specifically, we described how the demand curve and costs from

the private market for complementary insurance can be used to investigate counterfactuals associated with

a marginal extension of the compulsory public coverage (a counterfactual that is within the set of observed

contracts), as well as estimate a lower bound on the welfare provided by compulsory public insurance.

      We illustrated this framework by applying it to the setting of disability insurance, employing administra-

tive data from one large employer. Based on our estimates, compulsory public disability insurance is associ-

ated with benefits that far exceed the costs of this coverage for this employee population, and, for a plausible

range of moral hazard elasticities, extending the generosity of compulsory public coverage would result in

substantial welfare gains for these employees if they would not otherwise have access to employer-provided

supplemental disability coverage. While one should exercise caution in extrapolating from the specific esti-

mates, the fact that some workers highly value disability insurance beyond the incomplete compulsory public

coverage is interesting given that only a third of workers nationwide have access to employer-provided sup-
    65 SeeAppendix E for a more detailed description.
    66 Asshown by Handel (2013), inertia can bias the results of welfare analysis based on estimated demand curves.
   67 We create the individual-level measures of passive choice by comparing insurance selections to defaults for the range of employee ben-

efits from 2004-2006, the time period for which we know the default options across all the other employee benefits (e.g., dental insurance,
health insurance, prescription drug insurance, etc).


                                                                    33

supplemental coverage can provide useful insights into the value of compulsory public insurance.

Notes: The above figure illustrates the welfare counterfactuals related to the incremental coverage sold in the existing market for supplemental insurance. Panel (A)
displays the case where there is no moral hazard and considers a competitive equilibrium as the relevant benchmark against which to measure the welfare associated
with a public insurance extension. Panel (B) displays the case where there is moral hazard such that the incremental coverage exerts a negative externality on the
primary insurer which is not internalized by the supplemental insurer when setting prices in the benchmark perfectly competitive private supplemental insurance
market.

Notes: Fixing the willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance at $100, this figure displays the numerical analogue of Figure 2 under the range of assumptions
considered in Table 1. Specifically, this figure considers an individual indexed by ϕ and displays the individual’s marginal cost and marginal valuation of insurance
generosity on the intensive margin, where units are scaled to represents dollars per 1 percentage point of insurance coverage. Given the willingness-to-pay for
supplemental insurance is $100, an (under)estimate of the individual’s mean marginal valuation of insurance for a 1 percentage point increase in coverage is $10 over
the range θ ∈[0.6, 0.7]. Based on Proposition 1, the lower bound on the individual’s valuation of the coverage is $600 (π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ) ≥ 6 × π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ)) and
the lower bound on the net surplus from the inframarginal coverage is $120 (Area ABCD in this figure). Under each of the considered sets of assumptions in Table 1,
this figure displays the implied marginal willingness-to-pay for insurance on the intensive margin based on the parameters calibrated to match the willingness-to-pay
for supplemental insurance.

Notes: This figure displays both: (i) the potential monthly disability benefit for public and private insurance for each level of monthly earnings (on the right vertical
axis), and (ii) a histogram of the monthly earnings among salaried employees at the firm (on the left vertical axis). Referencing the right vertical axis, the solid line
displays the SSDI public disability benefit formula for the year 2003 (the first year of our sample). The remaining three lines display the benefit formula for those who
have one of the firm’s three available top-up private LTD plans in addition to SSDI public disability insurance. As described in the main text, the estimation sample
focuses on individuals with SSDI replacement rate less than the replacement rate of Plan L of 50%. In terms of this figure, these are the individuals whose monthly
income lies to the right of the intersection of the “with Plan L top-up” line and the “SSDI” line. This level of monthly earnings based on the 2003 benefit formula is
roughly $2,020 and this is indicated in the figure by the vertical reference line. In addition to displaying the public and private potential disability benefits, this figure
also displays a histogram of the monthly earnings for all salaried employees (censored at $200,000/12). As can be seen in this figure, the vast majority of salaried
employees at the firm have high enough earnings that their implied SSDI replacement rate lies below the 50% threshold used to define the estimation sample.

     Notes: The above table describes a numerical example which compares the bounding approach described in the text to a more structural analysis that defines a particular utility function and distribution of risk.
     Consider an individual indexed by ϕ who faces some potential loss and has compulsory public insurance that covers 60% of this risk. Further, suppose the individual has the option to purchase private supplemental
     insurance to cover an additional 10% of the risk on top of the public insurance. Following the definitions in the text, let π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ) represent the individual’s willingness-to-pay for compulsory public insurance
     relative to no insurance, and let π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) represent the individual’s willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance to top-up the compulsory public insurance. Suppose the individual’s demand/preferences
     satisfy the sufficient condition in either Proposition 1 or 2, we get a lower bound on π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ) for any given observed π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ). This bound is applicable regardless of the distribution of uncertainty
     the individual faces and regardless of what form the utility takes. To contrast this bound with an approach that specifies more of the underlying primitives, the table displays the implied value of π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ)
     given a value of π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) under various assumptions. Specifically, for each set of assumptions and each value of the willingness-to-pay for supplemental coverage (π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ)), Table 1 reports the
     calibrated utility parameters to match this willingness-to-pay for supplemental insurance and the implied willingness-to-pay for the inframarginal coverage, π(w, 0.6, 0|ϕ), based on these calibrated parameters.
     For each scenario considered, the table also displays the surplus ratio, which we define as the ratio of the surplus from the inframarginal coverage under the stated assumptions to the lower bound on surplus from
                                                                                      π(w,0.6,0|ϕ)−c(w,0.6,0|ϕ)
     the inframarginal coverage derived under Proposition 1 (surplus ratio=                                           ). The surplus ratio describes how tight the lower bound is under a given set of assumptions, with a
                                                                                  Bound π(w,0.6,0|ϕ)−c(w,0.6,0|ϕ)
     smaller ratio indicating a tighter bound. Taking the case of π(w, 0.7, 0.6|ϕ) = $100, Figure 3 plots numerical analogue of Figure 2 under the sets of assumptions described in this table.

Notes: This table describes the three long-term disability plans available on the menu of plans offered to employees in the estimation sample. In the
context of disability, both benefits and costs are stated in relative terms, relative to the annual earnings. The replacement rate for each plan describes
the fraction of annual earnings paid out in the case of disability. In this table, premiums are stated as a fraction of annual earnings, and scaled by
$60K, roughly the median annual earnings in the estimation sample.

Notes: This table displays summary statistics for employees in the data. All dollar quantities are inflation adjusted to 2005 dollars using the CPI-U.
Column (1) displays summary statistics for all employees from the firm, column (2) displays summary statistics for all salary employees at the firm,
and column (3) displays summary statistics for employees in the estimation sample. The estimation sample is restricted to salary employees who
have the relevant menu of LTD plans offered to them, who have annual earnings less than $200,000, and who have an SSDI replacement rate less than
50%. Columns (4) through (7) display summary statistics for employees from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) for the corresponding
years, 2004-2007 (which describe labor market outcomes from 2003-2006). Column (4) displays the summary statistics for all employees in the CPS,
while column (5) displays summary statistics for all manufacturing employees in the CPS. Column (6) displays summary statistics for manufacturing
employees in white collar occupations, where occupations are classified as white collar if they are managerial or professional occupations. Column
(7) displays summary statistics for manufacturing employees with white collar occupations who have implied SSDI replacement rates less than 50%
(using their reported monthly earnings as a proxy for their AIME) and annual earnings less than $200,000. As described in the text, the table reports
the mean pre-tax SSDI replacement rate for workers in the sample using the SSA formula replacing the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME)
with an individual’s monthly earnings according to the firm’s human resources records (or mean reported monthly earnings in the CPS in columns
(4) through (7)). We note this is an imperfect calculation because we don’t have data on each worker’s full work history which would be needed to
precisely calculate the AIME following the SSA formula.

        Notes: The above table displays the demand and cost estimates. Panel A columns (1) and (2) display the results of estimating a linear demand
        specification for Plan H coverage, without individual fixed-effects (column 1) and with individual fixed-effects (column 2). The bootstrapped
        standard error on the mean implied willingness-to-pay for the incremental coverage (relative to annual earnings) is calculated using 10,000 bootstrap
        samples. Panel B displays the mean cost estimates for everyone and separately for those who do and do not purchase Plan H. As discussed in Section
        4, the mean cost reported here is the mean present discounted value of disability claim costs relative to annual earnings scaled to represent a 10%
        replacement rate. For reference, the relative premium for Plan H is listed below the mean cost estimates.

 Notes: This table displays the implied welfare measures using demand estimates from Table 5 column (1). Panel A presents our baseline welfare analysis
 analyzing the welfare associated with the marginal and inframarginal coverage under the observed allocation of insurance in the status quo. Row (1) displays
 welfare associated with the incremental coverage evaluated the mean observed allocation of supplemental coverage. As discussed in the text, the mean
 observed allocation of the incremental coverage is very close to the allocation under a competitive equilibrium for this coverage, so we think about these
 welfare measures as approximating the welfare associated with a competitive market for the incremental coverage. Row (2) presents the a lower bound
 on the welfare associated with the inframarginal disability insurance providing a 34% replacement rate, the mean public disability replacement rate among
 individuals in the sample. Panel B presents estimates of welfare under a hypothetical compulsory insurance extension from a baseline 60% replacement
 rate to a 70% replacement rate, relative to a scenario in which no one has this incremental coverage. Each column displays these estimates under the stated
 assumed moral hazard semi-elasticity: the percentage change in the PDV of lost earnings due to disability with respect to a change in the replacement rate.
 The bootstrapped standard errors on the mean willingness-to-pay and welfare estimates are calculated using 10,000 bootstrap samples.

Notes: This table illustrates that the main results are similar when using alternative functional forms for demand, using alternative controls isolat-
ing slightly different variation, accounting for the tax treatment of premiums and benefits, and focusing on employees who appear to be “active
choosers”. Panel A displays the implied lower bound on the value of public coverage based on the alternative specifications (analogous to that
reported in Table 6 Panel A row 2); Panel B displays the underlying demand and mean cost estimates. As discussed in Section 4, the mean cost
reported here is the mean present discounted value of disability claim costs relative to annual earnings scaled to represent a 10% replacement rate.
Panel A reports bootstrapped standard errors using 10,000 bootstrap samples. Each row represents the results of a distinct specification. For refer-
ence, row (1) displays the baseline estimates (from Table 5 column 1) and implied welfare bounds (from Table 6 Panel A row 2). Rows (2) through (6)
display the estimates and implied welfare bounds using alternative specifications of the demand curve. Row (5) reports the results for a linear-log
specification where the dependent variable is P lanHit and the main independent variable is ln(pH             M
                                                                                                       it − pit ); the log-log specification in Row (6)
reports results for a specification with the dependent variable ln(P lanHit +1) and the main independent variable ln(pH          M
                                                                                                                           it −pit ). Rows (7) through
(10) display the estimates and implied welfare bounds concentrating on slightly different aspects of the identifying variation by including alternative
sets of controls. Row (11) displays the estimates and implied welfare bounds accounting for the tax treatment of LTD premiums, LTD benefits, and
SSDI benefits. In this specification, we make these adjustments assuming a constant marginal tax rate in this population of 35% (roughly the average
marginal tax rate based on the observables we have in the data). Row (12) displays the results for an alternative sample excluding the roughly 13%
of employees who appear to be “passive” choosers at some point during the sample period. We designate an employee as a “passive” chooser if
his/her insurance selections in any year during our sample period are completely consistent with all the various default options across the range of
employee benefits offered by the firm including health insurance, prescription drug insurance, dental insurance, and disability insurance.

A     Proof of Proposition 2
Proposition 2. Suppose an individual’s utility can be represented by the increasing, thrice differentiable func-
tion u(c). Define π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) as: E[u(w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ))] = E[u(w + (1 − γ)x)], where θ > γ and the
expectation is taken over x ≤ 0, representing the uncertain losses the individual faces. Additionally, suppose
the individual is risk averse and his/her utility exhibits weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion. Then,
                                                                   α
                                                 π(w, α, 0|ϕ) ≥      π(w, α + δ, α|ϕ).                                                (18)
                                                                   δ
and thus we obtain the bound in Corollary 1.
                                                                                                         ∂    π(w,θ,γ|ϕ) 
Proof. Based on Lemma 1 below, we complete the proof by demonstrating: (i)                               ∂θ      θ−γ         ≤ 0, and (ii)
 ∂ π(w,θ,γ|ϕ)
              
∂γ     θ−γ      ≤ 0.

proof of (i):
    Let z ≡ w + (1 − γ)x and y ≡ −π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) − (θ − γ)x. Define a function F (β) = Eu(z + βy) − Eu(z).68
Obviously, F (0) = 0. By definition of π(w, θ, γ|ϕ), we know that F (1) = 0.
We want to show that
                                               ∂ π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) 
                                                                ≤ 0.                                 (19)
                                              ∂θ      θ−γ
Note that this is equivalent to,

                           π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)   ∂                 −Exu0 (w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ))
                                        ≥    π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) =                                     .                                     (20)
                             θ−γ          ∂θ                 Eu0 (w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ))

    Re-writing this condition we get:
                         h                                                       i
                       E π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) + (θ − γ)x u0 (w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)) ≥ 0.
                                                
                                                                                                                                      (21)

    Substituting in the definitions above we get:

                                                   E[−yu0 (z + y)] = −F 0 (1) ≥ 0.                                                    (22)
                                                                                                     0
Under risk aversion, F is concave. Because F (0) = F (1) = 0, we know that F (1) ≤ 0, and thus the above
condition holds.

proof of (ii):
    Let z ≡ w + (1 − γ)x − (θ − γ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) and y ≡ π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) + (θ − γ)x. Define a function F (β) =
Eu(z + βy) − Eu(z). Obviously, F (0) = 0. By definition of π(w, θ, γ|ϕ), we know that F (1) = 0.
We want to show that:                                      
                                           ∂ π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)
                                                              ≤ 0.                                        (23)
                                          ∂γ       θ−γ
Note that this is equivalent to,

                            π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)    ∂                     −Exu0 (w + (1 − γ)x)
                                         ≤ − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ) =                                   .                                       (24)

 68 The   technique used for this part of the proof draws upon a similar technique used in Eeckhoudt and Gollier (2001).

   Let us re-write this as follows:

                π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)Eu0 (w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)) + (θ − γ)Exu0 (w + (1 − γ)x) ≤ 0.                (25)

    Because the individual’s utility exhibits weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion, we know by Lemma 2
below that: Eu0 (w + (1 − γ)x) ≥ Eu0 (w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)). So, the LHS of the above is bounded above

                                                                                                                 

Proof. Under the assumptions, we get the following:

                               π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)   π(w, θ + , γ|ϕ)   π(w, θ + , γ + µ|ϕ)

where the first inequality follows from assumption (i) and the second from assumption (ii). This holds for all
µ,  ≥ 0. Evaluating this at µ = θ − γ, θ = α, γ = 0, and  = δ gives result [a] and result [b].
Lemma 2. If u(c) exhibits weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion, then Eu0 (w + (1 − γ)x) ≥ Eu0 (w + (1 −

Proof. Weakly decreasing absolute risk aversion means,

   This is equivalent to,

                                 u0
   Multiplying both sides by     u00   (≤ 0) and rearranging terms we get:

Notice that v = −u0 is a valid utility function as it is increasing in c. Since we know this holds for all c,
−u0 is more risk averse than u, and thus we can represent −u0 as an increasing concave transformation of u:
−u0 = φ(u).
    The result then follows from showing that the distribution of u(w + (1 − θ)x − π(w, θ, γ|ϕ)) second order
stochastically dominates the distribution of u(w + (1 − γ)x) (and thus every concave utility function, including
φ, prefers it). Consider two distributions, FA (z) and FB (z) with the same mean. Suppose these distributions
are defined over a finite domain [z, z], where FA (z) = FB (z) = 0 and FA (z) = FB (z) = 1. Showing FA (z)
second order stochastically dominates FB (z) is equivalent to showing:

     Thus, we know that z [Fx ( u (z)−w+π(w,θ,γ|ϕ)

B     Moral Hazard and Selection: Estimates and Robustness
As discussed in Section 3, the data and environment has both strengths and weaknesses in terms of capturing
the costs associated with disability. A strength of the empirical environment is that there is individual-level
administrative cost data. While in principle one could use the very same price variation used to estimate the
demand curves to estimate moral hazard and selection, a practical limitation is that it is difficult to obtain
precise estimates of selection and moral hazard within the context of disability insurance because realized
costs are noisy proxies for expected costs given the low incidence of disability. In the face of these strengths
and weaknesses, we take the following approach. First, our baseline welfare analysis focuses on estimating
welfare in the status quo allocation of insurance. Since this estimation draws on observed realized costs, this
analysis fully incorporates moral hazard and selection within the status quo insurance allocation. Second, we
analyze welfare within counterfactuals that depart from the status quo allocation of insurance under a wide
range of assumptions on the moral hazard elasticity. As will become clear, the counterfactuals we focus on
do not require estimating the degree of selection. Overall, we find that the key lessons of the counterfactual
welfare analysis are not very sensitive to the amount of incremental moral hazard within a plausible range of
elasticities.
    While our baseline welfare analysis does not depend on estimating moral hazard or selection, here we
present estimates of moral hazard and selection leveraging the available price variation. As noted in the text,
there is limited statistical power for these analyses, so they should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.
Moral Hazard Let cit represent the present discounted value of the realized costs relative to annual earnings
associated with providing individual i in year t an incremental 10% replacement rate paid in the event of
disability.69 We investigate the possibility of moral hazard by estimating the following reduced form equation:

                                                 cit = β0 + β1 (pH     M          M
                                                                 it − pit ) + β2 pit + λXit + it ,                         (35)

where (pH       M         M
          it − pit ) and pit are the relative prices of Plan H and Plan M, respectively. The demand results
reveal that the demand for Plan H coverage and Plan M coverage are both responsive to the respective relative
prices. Thus, the test for moral hazard is then a test on whether lower relative prices (and thus more people
on more generous coverage) lead to higher claims. In addition to estimating the reduced form specification
described above, we also estimate the analogous instrumental variables (IV) specification where we estimate
the relationship between costs and the share of people with Plan H and Plan M coverage, instrumenting these
shares with the variation in relative prices.
    Table A1 Panel A displays these estimates. Across all the specifications, the estimates are statistically
indistinguishable from zero, consistent with the incremental disability coverage inducing no moral hazard in
 69 Recall   that we use an interest rate of 4% in the baseline estimation.
                                                                                                       Appendix


this setting. Note that while the estimates are consistent with no moral hazard associated with the incremental
coverage, the estimates are not very precise. This lack of precision is not surprising, given the low incidence of
disability claims and the range of variation exploited in this IV strategy.
Selection As discussed in Section 4, our baseline analysis investigates welfare under the status quo allocation
of insurance and thus does not require estimating the degree of selection. Additionally, the counterfactual
analysis considers an extension of the compulsory insurance to include the supplemental coverage relative to
a setting in which no one has the supplemental coverage, which again does not require estimating the degree
of selection. Nevertheless, below we investigate selection in this setting for completeness.
     Table 5 Panel B in the text displays the mean cost scaled to represent a 10% replacement rate (the mean
value of cit ) for everyone in the estimation sample and separately for those who do and do not purchase the
incremental coverage. Note that the mean relative price for Plan H is very close to the average cost of those
individuals willing to pay for the incremental coverage. In other words, the predicted competitive equilibrium
in the market for the incremental coverage would be close to the observed pair of average prices and quantities
regardless of the shape of the average and marginal cost curves far outside of the variation in the data. Thus,
we can think of the observed mean (relative) costs of the insured and quantity of individuals insured as an
approximation of the competitive equilibrium for the incremental coverage, which allows us to interpret the
welfare measures describing the status quo allocation of supplemental insurance as approximating that of a
competitive equilibrium for supplemental insurance.
     While mean costs in the status quo are an approximation of the costs in a competitive equilibrium, we
can use alternative methods to predict counterfactual mean costs in a competitive market and demonstrate
that these yield similar estimates. For instance, one way to measure selection in this setting is to use the price
variation used to estimate demand to trace out the marginal and average cost curves of the insurer, using the
Einav and Finkelstein (2011) approach. Alternatively, another way one could measure selection in this setting
would be to assume there is no moral hazard and thus bring in another moment on the cost curve, the average
costs of insuring everyone under Plan H (the mean value of cit for the population if there is no moral hazard).
Comparing these approaches, the former approach leverages variation in costs among those marginal to the
price variation in the data, while the latter approach provides a measure of global selection in this population.
Figure A2 plots the average and marginal costs curves obtained from each of these approaches. (Table A1 Panel
B column (1) reports the underlying point estimates for the approach leveraging the marginal price variation.)
There are at least two things to note in this figure. First, we obtain very similar cost curves representing
selection regardless of which method we use to measure selection in this setting. Second, regardless of the
shape of the average and marginal cost curves far outside of the variation in the data, the observed average
price and quantity across the sample period are close to the predicted competitive equilibrium using either set
of cost curves.

C    Additional Demand Estimates
As discussed in Section 2, the main estimation focuses on the demand for Plan H over Plan M because most of
the premium variation in this context is in the relative premium for Plan H over Plan M. However, in addition
to our main estimates on the demand for Plan H relative to Plan M, we also investigate the demand for Plan M
relative to Plan L coverage to provide suggestive evidence on the validity of Assumption 1. To do this, we use
the limited variation in the (relative) premium for Plan M compared to Plan L to estimate the demand for Plan
M coverage. Specifically, we estimate the relative demand for Plan M by estimating the following equation:

                       P lanM orHit = I(rπ (0.6, 0.5|ϕ) ≥ pM               M
                                                           it ) = θ0 + θ1 pit + φXit + eit ,                  (36)

where P lanM orHi indicates that the individual chose Plan H or Plan M coverage and pM it is the price of Plan
M relative to Plan L (as pL
                          it = 0).
    Table A2 displays the Plan M demand estimates as well as the baseline Plan H demand estimates for ref-
erence. There are two important things to note about the Plan M demand estimates as compared to analogous
estimates for Plan H coverage. First, while the negative premium coefficient estimates in Panel A columns
(3) and (4) suggest that the demand for the incremental coverage provided by Plan M is price-sensitive, the
coefficient estimates and the corresponding mean implied willingness-to-pay for coverage are much less pre-
cisely estimated than the analogous estimates for Plan H coverage. The difference in precision across these
estimates is not surprising given the limited variation in Plan M premiums during the sample period relative
to the variation in the Plan H premium (see Table 2). Second, though the Plan M demand estimates are statis-
                                                                                                                          Appendix


tically imprecise, the general pattern of the mean implied willingness-to-pay estimates is consistent with the
assumption we use to derive a lower bound on the total welfare (Assumption 1). Assumption 1 implies that an
individual’s willingness-to-pay for incremental coverage is decreasing in the replacement rate of the baseline
coverage, and thus an individual’s willingness-to-pay for Plan M is weakly greater than his/her willingness-
to-pay for Plan H.70 Consistent with this assumption, the estimate for the mean willingness-to-pay for Plan
M coverage is higher than the estimated mean willingness-to-pay for Plan H coverage, though the Plan M
estimates are imprecise enough that these estimates are not statistically distinct. While the baseline welfare
analysis in the text uses the more precise (and more conservative) Plan H demand estimates, Appendix D
reports the analogous welfare measures based on the Plan M demand estimates for comparison.

D     Additional Robustness Analysis
In addition to the robustness analysis presented in the text, we examine the robustness of the results to addi-
tional alternative specifications. Table A3 displays the results of this additional analysis. Panel A displays the
implied lower bound on the value of public coverage based on the alternative specifications, and Panel B dis-
plays the underlying regression estimates for the alternative specifications. Each row represents the results of a
distinct specification. For reference, row (1) displays the baseline estimates and implied welfare bounds (based
on Table 5 Panel A column (1)). Rows (2) through (4) display the estimates and implied welfare bounds using
alternative specifications of the cost measures. The baseline analysis uses the present discounted value of costs
using an interest rate of 4%, where we use the maximum potential duration for spells censored at five years (as
described in the text, Section 2). Row (2) displays an alternative specification where costs are measured only
through the first five years following the year of disability onset (the years for which we have complete claims
data). This specification yields a less conservative bound than the baseline analysis. Rows (3) and (4) display
specifications where costs are defined as the present discounted value of the maximum potential duration for
truncated spells, using alternative interest rates to calculate the present discounted value. Comparing these
specifications to the baseline estimates, we see that the analysis is not very sensitive to the chosen discount rate
within a range of reasonable interest rates.
    The baseline welfare analysis utilizes the demand for Plan H, estimated based on the variation described
in Table 2. Leveraging the modest amount of variation in Plan M premiums, we can repeat the welfare analysis
using the implied Plan M demand curve. Table A3 row (5) displays an alternative specification that relies on
the Plan M demand estimates. As discussed above, the implied mean valuation of Plan M exceeds that of
Plan H, so this alternative specification provides a less conservative lower bound on the value of disability
coverage. However, as discussed above, the relatively small amount of variation in Plan M premiums limits
the statistical precision of welfare analysis based on the Plan M estimates as compared to the baseline welfare
analysis which leverages the Plan H estimates.

E    Tax Treatment of Premiums and Benefits
For the LTD plans offered at this employer, premiums are paid by employees with pre-tax dollars, and the
benefits individuals receive from their LTD policy in the event of a disability are taxable. In contrast, SSDI
benefits are largely exempt from tax. Because it is not clear that employees know the differential tax treatment
of each of these, premiums and the benefits are treated symmetrically in the baseline specification. Robust-
ness analysis reported in the text explores an alternative specification that reflects the tax treatment of premi-
ums and benefits, where we assume LTD premiums are paid with pre-tax dollars, LTD benefits individuals
receive are taxable, and public SSDI benefits are not taxable (effectively raising the mean SSDI replacement
rate from 34% to 52%). For simplicity, we assume that the same marginal tax rate is applicable to premiums
and benefits, and we use a marginal tax rate of 35%, roughly the average marginal tax rate among individ-
uals in this sample accounting for state and federal income taxes. While accounting for the tax treatment
of LTD premiums and benefits leads to a lower implied surplus for a fixed extension of LTD coverage, ac-
counting for the tax treatment of public SSDI benefits (and the effectively higher after-tax replacement rate)
exactly offsets this giving us the same lower bound on the welfare of public disability insurance as in the
baseline specification. To see this, suppose that individuals face a constant marginal tax rate τ . In addi-
tion, suppose that compulsory public insurance benefits are not taxable and LTD benefits are taxable. Let
W elf areExtnτ (10 × (1 − τ )) denote the estimated welfare associated with a (10 × (1 − τ )) percentage point
increase in the disability replacement rate of compulsory government insurance (relative to no incremental

coverage) given that LTD premiums are paid with pre-tax dollars and the marginal tax rate is τ . To account
for the tax treatment of premiums, the mean willingness-to-pay should be scaled down by (1 − τ ) relative to
the baseline estimates if the tax treatment is salient to consumers, and the baseline estimates for the govern-
ment’s costs should be symmetrically scaled down by (1 − τ ) to reflect costs associated with the incremental
coverage net of tax revenue. Thus, it is easy to see that accounting for taxation leads the welfare associated
with a (10 × (1 − τ )) percentage point extension of the replacement rate of government provided disability
coverage to be a scaled version of the baseline estimates of an extension not accounting for the tax treatment:
W elf areExtnτ (10 × (1 − τ )) = (1 − τ )W elf areExtn0 (10). The lower bound on the value of government
provided coverage is unchanged. To see this, let W elf areP ublic(α, τ ) represent the welfare associated with
the inframarginal public coverage accounting for the tax rate τ and the public insurance is of generosity α.
Assuming public benefits are tax-exempt, it is easy to show that the lower bound on welfare is invariant
to accounting for the tax treatment: {Lower bound on W elf areP ublic(α, τ )} = α W elf areExtn   τ (10×(1−τ ))

Notes: This table displays linear cost curves associated with Plan H coverage, where the curves are inferred using two different
methods. The first method for estimating the average and marginal cost curves follows Einav and Finkelstein (2011) and uses variation
in prices and the induced variation in the fraction of the population with Plan H coverage to trace out how the average expected cost
of those on Plan H varies. The second method for inferring the average and marginal cost curves is to assume there is no moral hazard
and interpolate between the average cost if the whole population were insured and the average cost of the actual insured population.
These approaches are represented in the figure by the gray and blue lines, respectively. The gray circles represent the mean costs by
year for those with Plan H coverage; the black triangles represent the mean costs of those with Plan H and everyone in the population,
pooling data across the entire sample period. The blue diamonds represent the observed pairs of Plan H premium and enrollment by
year (the variation used to estimate demand).

Notes: This table displays the moral hazard and selection estimates which leverage the premium variation for LTD plans. Panel
A displays the results related to moral hazard, where columns (1) through (4) display the IV results and columns (5) through (8)
display the reduced form results. Panel B displays the selection estimates, where columns (1) through (4) focus on selection into Plan
H. In addition, columns (5) through (8) focus on selection into at least Plan M coverage (relative to Plan L) leveraging the modest
amount of variation Plan M premiums. The outcome variables considered in these regressions are two different cost measures: the
present discounted value of costs (relative to annual earnings) incurred using the maximum potential duration for truncated spells as
described in the text (“Costs”, the baseline cost measure used in the text), and an indicator for having any LTD claim (“I(LTD Claim)”).

Notes: The above table displays the demand and cost estimates. Panel A columns (1) and (2) display the results of estimating a linear demand
specification for Plan H coverage, without individual fixed-effects (column 1) and with individual fixed-effects (column 2). For comparison, Panel A
columns (3) and (4) display estimates of the demand for Plan M coverage (relative to Plan L coverage). The bootstrapped standard error on the mean
implied willingness-to-pay for the incremental coverage (relative to annual earnings) is calculated using 10,000 bootstrap samples. Panel B displays
the mean cost estimates for everyone and separately for those who do and do not purchase the plan corresponding to each column. As discussed in
Section 4, the mean cost reported here is the mean present discounted value of disability claim costs relative to annual earnings scaled to represent
a 10% replacement rate. For reference, the relative premium for the plan corresponding to each column is listed below the mean cost estimates.

     Notes: This table displays additional robustness analysis (beyond that displayed in Table 7). Panel A displays the implied lower bound
     on the value of public coverage based on the alternative specifications (analogous to that reported in Table 6 Panel A row 2); Panel B
     displays the underlying demand and mean cost estimates. As discussed in Section 4, the mean cost reported here is the mean present
     discounted value of disability claim costs relative to annual earnings scaled to represent a 10% replacement rate. Panel A reports
     bootstrapped standard errors using 10,000 bootstrap samples. Each row represents the results of a distinct specification. For reference,
     row (1) displays the baseline estimates (from Table 5 column 1) and implied welfare bounds (from Table 6 Panel A row 2). Rows
     (2) through (4) display the estimates and implied welfare bounds using alternative specifications of the cost measure. The baseline
     analysis uses the present discounted value of costs using a 4% interest rate in this discounting, where we use the maximum potential
     duration for spells censored at five years (as described in the text, Section 2). Row (2) displays an alternative specification where costs
     are measured only through the first five years (the years for which we have claims data); rows (3) and (4) display specifications where
     costs are defined as the present discounted value of the maximum potential duration for truncated spells, using alternative discount
     rates. Row (5) displays an alternative specification that relies on the less precise Plan M demand estimates (rather than the baseline
     Plan H demand estimates) to value disability insurance.
