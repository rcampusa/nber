           Consumption Risk and International Asset Returns:

                        Some Empirical Evidence




                               ABSTRACT




The paper examines if real stock returns in four countries are consis-
tent with consumption—based models of international asset pricing. The
paper finds that ex—ante real stock returns exhibit statistically sig-
nificant fluctuations over time and that these fluctuations cannot be
explained by consumption—based models when the conditional covariances
between real stock returns and the rate of change of consumption are
assumed to be constant over time. These conditional covariances are then
modeled and the paper finds that they too exhibit statisitcally sig-
nificant fluctuations over time. However, even        when     conditional
covariances are allowed to change over time, the paper finds that the
consumption—based models do not fully explain real stock returns.

      The bulk of empirical analysis of international asset returns has

explored returns to speculation in the forward foreign exchange market

or the expected rate of return differential between nominal deposits

demoninated in different currencies. Considerably less work has examined

stock returns internationally.1 This paper departs from the practice of

focusing exclusively on the behavior of returns on forward speculation

or nominal assets and to exmaine the behavior of international stock

market returns.     In particular the paper asks if observed returns are

consistent with the predictions of consumption—based models of interna-

tional asset pricing.

      The paper proceeds as follows. In section 1 the implications of the

consumption—based international asset pricing model are described and

tests of the restrictions on equilibrium expected real returns along the

lines suggested by Hansen and Hodrick (1983) and Gibbons and Ferson

(1985) are implemented. These tests require that the conditional

covariances between real returns and the rate of change of consumption

be proportional across all assets. In section II the estimation of these

conditional covariances is discussed and a test of their proportionality

across assets is implemented. In addition, a test of the consumption—

based international asset pricing model that allows for changing condi-

tional covariances is implemented.

      In addition, much of the existing work analyzing equilibrium models
      of international asset returns such as Solnik (1974) and Stehie
      (1977) is a decade old. Problems with the tests in these papers are
      discussed in Adler and Dumas (1983).

      I. Testing the Consumption—Based International Asset Pricing Model



      In this section we develop and implement a test of the consumption—

based international asset pricing model proposed by Stulz             (1981) using

aggregate indexes from the stock markets of the major industrial

countries. For convenience throughout we will examine equilibrium real

returns from the point of view of a reprensetative investor in the U.S.,

which is taken to be the home country. We begin by defining some nota-

tion. Let P be the dollar price of the jth asset at the end of period

t. Next, let                   be the dollar value of the ith assets dividend or

interest payments from the end of period t to the end of period t+k. The

real rate of return earned on asset j from the end of period t to the

end of period t+k, rt3k is defined by,

        1 +          =             +                 +
(1)
              rt,k        [(Pt+k       t,kPTI(1
where     1Ttk is the rate of inflation from the end of period t to the end

of period t+k for a representative domestic investor. Stulz                 (1981),

following Breeden (1979), derives a continuous time model of equilbrium

returns. The assumption that trading takes place continuously allows him

to move to the limit of continuous time and derive an equilibrium

relationship             between       asset returns.2 A discrete—time conditional

consumption—based asset pricing model for a representative domestic

consumer—investor can be obtained using the results in Hansen and

Richard (1987), where a "generic" conditional asset pricing model                is




  2
       Grossman and Shiller (1982) show how a consumption beta model can be
       derived from the discrete time first—order conditions of a repre-
       sentative consumer—investor's utility maximization problem by taking
       the limit as the trading interval goes to zero. They point out that
       distributional assumptions or assumptions about the functional form
       of the utility function are alternatives to the use of continuous
       time analysis.

examined.                    While restrictions on equilibrium returns may be obtained in

this way, the means by which Stulzs results on aggregation across

countries can be obtained in                                           a conditional discrete—time framework

remains unknown. All that we require here, however, is that                                                a

consumption—based capital asset pricing model exist for a representative

domestic consumer—investor. In Stulz's model, expected real returns will

real rate of return on a portfolio whose real return is conditinalily

uncorrelated with domestic real consumption growth, and                                               is the

"consumption beta" of asset j from the point of view of a representative

domestic investor.

      A problem encountered when implementing tests of the consumption—beta

model is that the benchmark portfolio is unobserved as is the portfolio

whose return is uncorrelated with consumption. As a result, the two

by    following the suggestion of Gibbons and Ferson (1985). Since (2)

      As Hansen and Richard (1987) point out, the consumption—based capi-
      tal asset pricing model implies that the benchmark return in their
      analysis is the return on the aggregate consumption portfolio.

      Gibbons and Ferson (1985) propose the tests to be described as a
      means of testing the Sharpe—Lintner version of the CAPM. Extension
      to the case of consumption beta models involves no problems provided
      we are willing to make assumptions about the constancy of relative
      consumption betas over time. This assumption will be discussed
      below. The tests may be thought of as tests of any single—beta asset
      pricing model.

Next, we can divide this difference by the difference between expected

return on an arbitrarily chosen reference asset,                  1,   and the expected

return an asset s. We then find that we have eliminated the unobserved

returns.

                   rt,k)/Et(rt,k
In order to simplify notation, we will supress the terms involving rk

and will refer to the difference between rk and rk simply as rk.

      Next, we must model the expected returns as they too are unobserv-

able. We assume the econometrician observes some data                     that are in-

cluded in the time—t information set of agents and consider the projec-

tion of expected real profits onto X.

where uk is the projection equation error, which is orthogonal to

by construction. Since ex—ante returns are unobservable we work with

observable realized profits, which can be decomposed into expected

profits and a forecast error,

(4') r =                  +   Uk + E,k = Xtaj         +


The key assumption that allows us to make inferences about the behavior

of ex—ante returns based on the observed behavior of realized returns is

the assumption that expectations are rational. That is we assume that

forecast errors are unforecastable given information available at the

time the forecast is made. Since                           is assumed to be in the time t

information set of agents, Ek is orthogonal to X. In addition, Uk

is orthogonal to X by construction so that the composite error term is

orthogonal to Xr Estimating equation (4') by OLS thus produces consis—

tent estimates of the projection equation m's under the appropriate

regularity conditions.5 In order to test hypotheses concerning the m's,

we must have a consistent estimate of their covariance matrix. In the

empirical work carried out in this paper, k3, and tt3 is not realized

until t+3. Thus                    will follow a second—order moving average process

(IIA(2}). In addition, Uk does not have to be serially uncorrelated so

that the composite error will be serially correlated. Consistent es-

timates of the variance—covarjance matrix of m. are calculated with a

method outlined by Hansen (1982) and Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983)

that allow both for serial correlation and for conditional heteroscedas—

ticity in the residuals. This is an attractive feature of this technique

since an assumption of conditional homoscedasticity of asset returns is
                                     6
unlikely to be satisfied.

     If we combine (3) with the projection equations, (4) and (4'), that

the econometrician uses to estimate conditional expectations based on

the observable data                we obtain,
         j                     1         1

Thus   m =      r      a .   Gibbons and Ferson (1985) show that if we assume that
                    .,t 1

             the ratio of the consumption betas, is constant over time (or,

equivalently, the conditional covariances between asset returns and the

rate of change of real consumption are proportional across assets) a

test of the asset pricing model (3) can be carried out by estimating a

     Cumby and Obstfeld (1984), Hodrick and Srivastava (1984), and
     Giovannini and Jorion (1987) all find evidence of conditional
     heteroscedasticity in speculative returns in the foreign exchange
     market. Giovannini and Jorion also find similar conditional heteros—
     cedasticity in U.S. stock market returns.

system of projection equations and testing the hypothesis that the

coefficients in each equation are proportional to the coefficients in

the first equation.7 If there are N assets and k regressors in each of

the projection equations, there will be Nk regressors in the system but

only k + (N—i) parameters when the proportionality restrictions are

imposed. There are thus Nk — (k+N—1) parameter restrictions that can be

tested. If the model is correct and if the auxiliary assumptions con-

cerning the constancy of the relative consumption betas and the

rationality of expectations are correct, these parameter restrictions

should be satisfied by the data.

     Estimation of the restricted system of equations and testing o the

parameter restrictions can be carried out using Hansen's (1982) general-

ized method of moments (6MM) procedure. pplication of the 6MM procedure

begins by noting that each element of                   is orthogonal to T1k,   for       all


j.    Thus there are Nk orthogonality conditions in the projection equa-

tions for the real returns. The 6MM estimator is obtained by choosing

the parameters of the system so as to make the sample versions of the

orthogonality conditions as close to their population value of zero as

possible by minimizing a quadratic form in the sample orthogonality

conditions. In this case where there are Nk orthogonality conditions and

k +   N   —   1   parameters, there are k + N —     1    first—order conditions for the

                                                                                 N    —     1
minizmiation of the quadratic form and thus we can only set k +

linear combinations of the sample orthogonality conditions to zero.

Hansen (1982) notes that if the constraints of the model are true, the

additional Nk —            (k   + N —   1) sample orthogonality conditions should be

close to zero as well. However if the constraints are not satisfied, the



      The assumption that the conditional covariances are proportional
      across assets is tested below.
                                   —7—


additional sample orthogonality conditions should not be close to zero

and thus the value of the criterion function, which is a quadratic form

in these orthogonality conditions, should be large. Hansen (1982) proves

that under the null hypothesis that the constraints are satisfied the

criterion function is distrubuted as     with degrees freedom equal to

the number of parameter restrictions. Thus, estimation and testing may

be carried out quite simply by using the appropriate 6MM estimator.

   Hansen and Hodrick (1983) test the restricitions implied by a single—

beta CAPM model of the foreign exchange risk premium. The test they

carry out is equivalent to the Gibbons—Ferson test. Perhaps this is not

surprising since both are tests of single—beta asset pricing models. The

fact that the two tests are identical is obscured somewhat by dif-

ferences in interpretation in the motivation of the tests. Hansen and

Hodrick assume that the betas are constant and treat the expected return

on the benchmark portfolio as an unobserved latent variable assumed to

be linearly related to some data X. Since the expected return on the

benchmark portfolio enters the equilibrium condition for returns to

speculation in each currency, they obtain a set of proportionality

restrictions on a system of equations. Gibbons and Ferson, on the other

hand substitute out the expected benchmark return by using an ar-

bitrarily chosen reference asset and derive a set of proportionality

restrictions that are identical to those obtained by Hansen and Hodrick.

   We now turn to the results from estimating the projection equations

describing the behavior of real stock returns and the tests of the

consumption beta model. We consider the returns on the aggregate market

indexes in four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, West

Germany, and Japan taken from Morgan Stanleys Capital International

Perspective. Together, these four represent 84 of the capitalized value
                                     -8—


of the Capital International world index. A sample of January 1974 to

December 1986 is chosen to coincide with the period of floating exchange

rates. Three—month holding period returns measured in U.S. dollars are

calculated for each of the aggregate portfolios. We take rk to be the

real return on a safe nominal dollar deposit and thus subtract the real

three—month eurodollar deposit rate from each.8

      In estimating the projection equations (4), we need to consider what

      variables to use in the regressions. In principle any variables in

the information set are reasonable candidates. The              used in the

projections are the dividend yield on each of the national market

portfolios, the rate of change of consumption (ct+3/ct — 1) lagged 3

months, terms of trade (TOT) for each country, and inflation in each

country lagged three months (1T.?3). There are thus fourteen variables

in ' including      a constant term. Consumption and the terms of trade

are employed since various models suggest that these should affect

savings and investment decisions and therefore affect equilibrium ex-

pected returns. Inflation is also included in         since several studies

have pointed to a systematic relationship between stock returns and
              10
inflation.

       Exchange rates are end of month rates taken from International
       Financial Statistics. The three—month eurodollar rate is from Morgan
       Guarantys World Financial Markets. U.S. inflation is calculated
       using the CFl—U, which is taken from the Survey of Current Business.

       The consumption data are real spending an nondurables and services
       per capita, taken from the Survey of Current Business. The terms of
       trade are calculated as the ratio of the unit value of exports to
       the unit value of imports, which are obtained from International
       Fiancial Statistics, as are the CPI data for all countries but the
       U.S.

       Solnik (1983) and Gultekin (1983) present international evidence on
       this relationship. Stulz (1986) presents an equilibrium model in
       which expected real stock retruns are related to expected inflation.

     The autocorrelations of the residuals from the projections are
     generally consistent with a second—order moving average as would be
     expected if the projection error component of the composite error is
     small relative to the forecast error component, indicating that a

     Estimation requires the inversion of a matrix that is Nk x Nk, which
     is in this case 56 x 56. Attempts to compute this inversion proved
     unsuccessful. If the restrictions are rejected by the data, the use
     of the three smaller systems does not present any problems in inter-
     preting the test results since the full system test would simply

rejected at standard significance levels in two of the three cases.



II. Modeling Conditional Covariances



      The behavior of the conditional covariance between asset returns and

the rate of change of consumption plays a central role in consumption—

based models asset pricing. In this section we discuss modeling this

conditional covariance with two goals in mind. First, it may be possible

that the restrictions implied by the consumption—beta model are rejected

due to time varying relative consumption betas. If the conditional

covariances can be modeled, the constancy of the relative consumption

betas can be tested. Second, if we find that the relative consumption

betas change over time, we want to determine if the movement they ex-

hibit can account for ex—ante real stock returns.

  The estimation of the conditional covariance may be carried out by

extending the results of Amemiya (1977) and Hasbrouck (1985) who con-

sider a regression model in which the variance of the disturbance term

is linearly related to a set of observable data and derive the large

sample distribution of estimators of the parameters of the linear

variance function.14 The extension to the case at hand is derived in

Cumby (1986).

      We are interested in estimating the conditional covariance between

the rate of change of consumption and real aggregate stock returns.




 14
      Hasbrouck (1985) extends the results in Amemiya (1977) in several
      important directions. Most importantly, he allows the regressors to
      be stochastic, does not require that the regression disturbance be
      normal, and allows the addition of a stochastic disturbance to the
      linear variance function.

and        asymptotically normal with a covariance matrix that can be consis-

tently estimated using the techniques described in Hansen (1982) and

      Once a consistent estimate of 8 and its asymptotic covariance matrix

are obtained, we can test hypotheses about the conditional covariance of




          It should be pointed out that since we are examininq the conditional
      covariances of the         and not the conditional covariances of the c,
      the covariances we estimate are the sum of the covariances of the
      projection errors and the covariances real returns and real consump-
      tion. Therefore any inference about the movement of the conditional
      covariance of rca] returns and real consumption over time based on
      the evidence presented here is conditional on assumptions we make
      concerning the movements of covariance of the projection errors over
      time. If the data do a good job of describing the movements cf real
      returns so that the proiection errors are small, we may reasonably
      assume that the covariance of projection errors is small. The es-
      timates will then be dominated by movements in the conditional
      covariances of real returns and real consumption.

real consumption and real stock returns. The first of these hypotheses

is the constancy of this conditional covariance. This hypothesis is the

hypothesis that all elements of 8. are zero except for the constant

term. Next,               if the hypothesis of a constant conditional covariance is

rejected, we need to determine if the comovements of the conditional

covariance and real stock returns are consistent with the consumption—

based international asset pricing model. We proceed in two steps. First,

we can test the assumption of constant relative consumption betas re-

quired for the Gibbons—Ferson test by using the projection equations

(5). If relative consumption betas are constant over time, the condi-

tional covariances must all move together over time. The hypothesis that

the the conditional covariances move together can be tested by determin-

ing if the coefficients in the projection equations (5) are proportional

across assets. This test can be carried out in the manner described

above.

      The second step is to determine if observed returns are consistent

with the consumption—based international asset pricing model when we

allow for variation over time in the conditional covariances. In order

to see how we can do this, rewrite (3), using the definition of the

consumption betas to obtain,

(3d)                                =
        E(r,k)IEt(r,fr)
Next, substitute realized real returns less a forecast error for the
expected returns and impound the forecast errors into the error term.

                                         —13—


arise when estimating the parameters of (13). First, the realized real

return on the right hand side of                (13) will be correlated with the

forecast error,           We therefore need to use and instrumental vari-

ables procedure to obtain consistent estimates of a and b. Second, since

the left—hand—side variable uses the fitted values from the projections

rather than the true conditional covariances and expected return, an

additional component arises in the error term. This additional component

may introduce both heterscedasticity and serial correlation to the error

in    (6)    that we need to take into account in estimation. Instrumental

variables estimation of (6) taking account of possible heteroscedastic

and serially correlated errors can be carried out using the two—step

two—stage least squares technique of Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld

(1983). The choice of instruments is straightforward since the variables

      used in the real return projection equations will be uncorrelated

with the error term. Since the serial correlation in the error term is

of unknown order, the spectral estimator of the covariance matrix of the

parameters of (6) is used.

     In     estimating   and   testing     hypotheses about the conditional

covariances, the choice of the data to include in           must again be made.

It seems natural to use the same information to estimate the behavior of

conditional first moments and conditional second moments so the same set

of        as is used above will again be employed. Prior to proceeding with

estimation, a problem with consumption data should be confronted. Pub-

lished data measure consumption over an interval rather than at a point

in time. Using the results in Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1986),

it can be shown that if monthly data sampled quarterly are used and if

the covariance between real returns and real consumption growth is

constant, the estimate of the covariance obtained using interval con—
                                    —14—


sumption data will understate the true "spot" covariance by twenty

percent.   In order to correct for this bias the dependent variables in

the projections (12) could be multiplied by 1.2 prior to estimation.

Doing so would, of course, leave the test statistics unchanged. Since

such a correction would also leave relative consumption betas unchanged,

this correction is pursued here.

   The results of estimating the conditional covariances can be found in
                     2
Table 3, where the       statistic; for testing the the constancy of condi-

tional covariances are reported along with their probability values and

the R' from each projection. In all cases but the West German market

index, the hypothesis of constant conditional covariances can be

rejected at standard significance levels. In the West German case rejec-

tion is at the eleven percent level.

   Given that the covariances change over time, do they do so in a way

that explains the behavior of ex—ante real returns? Table 3 also con-

tains the results of the tests of proportionality of the conditional

covariances for the three pairs of assets examined above. The tests are

carried out using the GMM procedure used in carrying out the Gibbons—

Ferson tests. Again there are 28 orthogonality conditions in the each

system and 15 parameters to be estimated in each so that each system has

13 restrictions to be tested. The table reports the 2(13) statistics

for the hypothesis that the conditional covariances are proportional

along with the corresponding probability values. We can see that the

proportionality constraints are rejected at the six percent level for

the U.S., Japan combination, and at the 12 percent level for the U.S.,

U.K. combination. There is no evidence that the constraints do not hold

for the U.S. , West Germany combination. Thus a violation of the assump-

tion of proportional conditional covariances may account for the reiec—
                                     —15-


tion   of the restrictions implied by the single—beta model with constant

relative betas for the U.S. and Japan, but is unlikely to account for

the rejection for the U.S. and the U.K. Since the single—beta model with

constant relative betas is not rejected for the U.S. and Germany, fail-

ing to reject the proportionality of conditional covariances is reassur-

ing.

   Table 4 contains the results of the tests of the consumption—based

model of international asset pricing with conditional covariances that

are allowed to vary over time. Recall that under the null hypothesis we

expect to find a slope of one and an intercept of zero. In all three

cases we find that while the slope coefficients are positive, they are

less than one. The largest slope coefficient (approximately .5) is found

in the U.S. — Japan         combination, the combination that exhibited the

strongest evidence against the hypothesis of constant relative consump-

tion betas. The hypothesis that the slope coefficient is one is rejected

at reasonable significance levels in all cases. Although movements in

relative consumption betas and relative returns are positively corre-

lated as the consumption—based model predicts, rejection of the null

hypothesis that the slope coefficients are one implies that even when

conditional   covariances     are   allowed    to change over time, the

consumption—based international asset pricing model falls short of    fully
explaining observed real stock returns.

  Since evidence against the model is found only when U.K. and Japanese

returns are examined, barriers to international investment may be behind

the results. Capital controls were in place in the U.K. until October

1979 and restrictions on capital movements in Japan were not eased until

after 1980.   An attempt to carry out the tests using data only from the

latter part of the sample was made. However, the sample turned out to be
                                  —16—


too short to obtain reliable estimates.



                        III. Concluding remarks



The paper examines if real stock returns is four countries are consis-

tent with consumption—based models of international asset pricing. Tests

such as those suggested by Gibbons and Ferson (1985) are considered

first. These tests require that we assume that the           conditional

covariance of real stock returns and the rate of change of real consump-

tion move together over time for all assets. The restrictions implied by

the consumption—based model assuming the proportionality of the condi-

tional covariances are rejected by the data when combinations of the

U.S. and the U.K and the U.S. and Japan are examined. No evidence

against the restrictions is found when the U.S. and Germany are con-

sidered. Next, estimates of these conditional covariances are presented

and the evidence shows that, like the ex—ante real stock returns, they

exhibit statistically significant fluctuations over time. The assumption

of proportonal conditional covariances necessary for implementation of

the Gibbons—Ferson test is also tested and is rejected in the two cases

in wh3ch the model is rejected by the Gibbons—Ferson test. This raises

the possibility that the rejections may be ue to the auxiliary assump-

tion of constant relative consumption betas rather than a failure of the

model itself. A final set of tests is carried out in which conditional

covariances are allowed to change over time and the results indicate

that   observed   real stock returns cannot be explained fully by

consumption—based models of international asset pricing.
