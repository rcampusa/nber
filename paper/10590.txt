                                       ABSTRACT

In countries where wages are primarily set by collective bargaining, the effects on unemployment

of changes in the economic environment depend crucially on the speed of learning of unions. This

speed of learning is likely to depend in turn on the quality of the dialogue that unions have with

firms, on what can more generally be called the quality of labor relations. In this paper, we examine

the role this quality of labor relations has played in the evolution of unemployment across European

countries over the last 30 years. We conclude that it has played an important role: Countries with

worse labor relations have experienced higher unemployment. This conclusion remains even after

controlling for labor institutions.

1     Introduction
In countries where wages are primarily set by collective bargaining, the
effects on unemployment of changes in the economic environment are likely
to depend crucially on the speed of learning of unions.

This speed of learning is likely to depend in turn on the quality of the
dialogue that unions have with firms, on what can more generally be called
the quality of labor relations.

In this paper, we examine the role this quality of labor relations has played
in the evolution of unemployment across European countries over the last
30 years. We conclude that it has played an important role.

We start, in Section 1, with a “case study”, that of the Netherlands. After
increasing to 11% in the early 1980s, Dutch unemployment turned around,
reaching a low of 2% in the early 2000s. This turnaround is directly trace-
able to wage moderation. This wage moderation appears directly traceable
in turn to the dialogue between unions and firms, and to the unions’ com-
mitment to reestablish sufficient profit margins so as to increase capital
accumulation and employment.

We then present, in Section 2, a simple model of wage determination and
unemployment. We show how the effects on unemployment of different
changes in the economic environment depend crucially on the perceptions
of unions and their speed of learning.

We then turn, in Section 3, to the cross country evidence. We construct
two measures of the quality of labor relations, the first based on strike
intensity in the 1960s, the other based on surveys of managers in the 1990s.
We show that countries with worse labor relations have experienced higher
and longer-lasting unemployment. We show that the effect remains even
after controlling for labor market institutions.

2     The Netherlands
The evolution of unemployment in the Netherlands since the early 1980s is
often called the “Dutch unemployment miracle”.1 After increasing from 2%
in 1970 to 11% in 1983, the unemployment rate turned around, decreasing
steadily to reach a low of 2% in 2001. Today, it has increased back to 6%,
but most of the increase since 2001 appears to be cyclical.

The focus on the unemployment rate is not misleading. It is sometimes
argued that the increase in employment has come from job sharing, from
an increase in part-time employment. This is not correct: The increase in
part-time employment, which has indeed been substantial, has been more
than matched by an increase in the participation rate, in particular by
an increase in the participation rate of women. It is also argued that the
decrease in unemployment hides a high number of workers on disability.
While it is true that disability rolls are still very high, they have decreased
with unemployment, and thus cannot account for the decrease in unem-
ployment.

There is general agreement that the proximate source of the turnaround
in unemployment is wage moderation. This can be seen in Figure 1, which
plots the unemployment rate and the (log) wage in efficiency units. The
wage (or more precisely the labor cost, as the measure includes both the
wage and non-wage benefits) in efficiency units is constructed under the
assumption of Harrod neutral technological progress, following Blanchard
[1997]; it is normalized to equal zero in 1970-71. On a balanced growth
path with constant unemployment, the wage in efficiency units should be
constant. Thus, one can think of decreases in this wage measure as reflecting
wage moderation. As Figure 1 indicates, the wage in efficiency units has
indeed decreased steadily since the early 1980s, standing in 2001 at 83% of
its 1970 value; this decrease is substantially larger than the decrease of the

same variable for the European Union as a whole. This wage moderation
has led to an increase in profit, which has led to an increase in capital
accumulation, and an increase in employment over time.

Netherlands, 1970-2002.


There is also general agreement that the start of this wage moderation can
be traced to a particular event, the “Wassenaar Accord,” signed at the
end of 1982 between unions, business organizations and the government.
At that time, unemployment had increased very quickly, and profit and
investment rates had collapsed. Unions, explicitly recognizing the need to
reestablish profit margins, agreed to wage moderation. Despite tensions
along the way, this commitment to wage moderation has remained to this
day.

This short description may give the impression of a process smoother than
it actually was. The Wassenaar Accord was preceded by nine attempts and
nine failures in the previous nine years. The Accord itself was a complex
agreement, with much give and take, including a commitment by firms to
consider decreasing working time (at the same wage per hour). Yet, it re-
mains the case that the turnaround in wage setting happened earlier in
the Netherlands than in other European countries, and observers credit it
and its subsequent follow-through to a long-standing tradition of dialogue
between unions and firms. Katzenstein [1985] for example attributes it to
“corporatism,” which he defines as “an ideology of partnership, expressed
at the national level ( ); and voluntary and informal coordination of con-
flicting objectives through continuing bargaining between interest groups,
state bureaucracy, and political parties.”

An important question, in light of the research on the causes of unem-
ployment, is how much of the decrease in Dutch unemployment can be

                                                                        4

institutions, and how much can be attributed to reforms of these labor
market institutions. The question goes beyond the scope of this paper (see
Nickell and Van Ours [2000] for an exploration, Schettkat [2003] for a care-
ful characterization of institutions and institutional change), but one can
make the following remarks:

The period since 1982 has seen a number of reforms of the Dutch labor
market. These reforms have however taken place in the late 1980s and the
1990s, thus some time after the start of wage moderation and the start of
the decline in unemployment. The reforms have typically not been radical;
rather, they have reduced some of the distortions associated with a given
level of social insurance, rather than decreased that level. A decrease in
replacement rates, and the conditioning of benefits on the acceptance of
“suitable jobs” have decreased the incentives to remain unemployed. Expe-
rience rating of firms according to their history of worker disabilities have
decreased the incentives for firms and workers to use disability programs
as alternatives to unemployment. In general, however, the Dutch system
of social insurance remains more generous than the EU average, indeed
more generous than the average of the four largest EU countries—France,
Germany, Spain, and Italy—that today have much higher unemployment
than the Netherlands.




3     Shocks, learning, and unemployment
The purpose of this section is to show that the effects of shocks on unem-
ployment depend very much on whether and how fast they are perceived
by unions. The model we present makes no claim to generality; its goal
is to introduce some of the major shocks which are typically thought to
have been behind movements in unemployment in Europe over the last 30


                                                                           5
years, and show how, in each case, the response of unemployment depends
crucially on union’s perceptions.

•    Assume an aggregate production function of the form:

                                    y = min(k, an)

     where y, k, n are output, capital, and employment respectively, and a
     captures Harrod neutral technological change. The profit rate is then
     given by:
                                     y − wn     w
                             π=             =1−
                                        k       a

•    Assume that the supply of capital is given by:

                              k = a(1 + θ(π − r))

     where r is the user cost faced by firms, and the parameter θ measures
     the response of the supply of capital to net profit—the profit rate net
     of the user cost. The presence of a on the right hand side is to insure
     the existence of a balanced growth path, where capital and output
     increase at the same rate.
     The first two assumptions together imply a labor demand schedule
     given by:

                        k                           w
                   n=     = 1 + θ(π − r) = 1 + θ(1 − − r)               (1)
                        a                           a


•    Assume an economy wide union, acting as a monopoly union, and
     maximizing the wage bill, wn, subject to the perceived labor demand
     schedule:                           µ              ¶
                                              w
                             n = 1 + θ̂ 1 −      − r̂
                                              â


                                                                          6
     Note that we allow union perceptions of θ, a, and r, all denoted by
     hats, to differ from the actual values of these three parameters.
     The assumption that the union chooses the wage unilaterally, subject
     to the perceived labor demand, is not particularly realistic. It is how-
     ever convenient, and allows us to avoid an interesting but difficult
     issue, the nature of bargaining when the two sides (the firms and the
     union) differ in their perceptions. Here, only the union’s perceptions
     matter for the choice of the wage.

•    The wage implied by this maximization is given by:
                                      µ              ¶
                                    â          1
                               w=      1 − r̂ +                            (2)
                                    2           θ̂

     and employment is given by equation (1) (firms are assumed to know
     the true parameters).
     If perceptions are correct, employment is given by:

                                      1 + θ(1 − r)
                                n=                                         (3)
                                           2

     Keeping θ and r constant, the economy follows a balanced growth
     path, where capital, output, and real wages grow with a, and where
     employment remains constant.
Now consider three types of shocks.

•    Suppose there is a slowdown in productivity growth, a decrease in
     the rate of growth of a, as was indeed the case in Europe starting in
     the mid-1970s.
     If perceptions are correct, so â remains equal to a, wages adjust in line
     with a, and, as equation (3) indicates, employment remains constant.
     If however perceptions do not fully adjust, so â exceeds a for some
     time, employment will be lower until â converges back to a.


                                                                             7
•     Suppose there is a sharp increase in the real interest rate, as was
      indeed the case in the 1980s and early 1990s in most European coun-
      tries. Even if perceptions are correct, so r̂ remains equal to r, em-
      ployment will decrease as unions prefer to cut both the wage and
      employment. If perceptions do not adjust however, the wage does
      not change, and the decrease in employment will be larger.

•     Suppose, last, that there is an increase in capital mobility, an increase
      in θ. This evolution has been less studied than the previous two, but
      has clearly taken place in Europe over the last 30 years, and may be
      quite relevant: The elimination of capital controls and the reduction
      of other barriers to capital movements have surely increased the elas-
      ticity of capital to its rate of return. So has the widespread process
      of privatization: Private owners are typically much more sensitive to
      the rate of return than the state.
      Under the assumption that perceptions are correct, such an increase
      in θ leads to an increase in employment: The higher elasticity of cap-
      ital to the profit rate, and by implication the higher elasticity of em-
      ployment to the wage, lead the union to moderate its wage demands,
      and thus lead to an increase in employment. If perceptions do not
      change however, wages do not adjust, and employment may actually
      decrease. This depends on whether, initially, firms were making pos-
      itive or negative net profits. If net profits, 1 − w/a − r were initially
      negative, employment will initially decrease, as capital moves out.
      Only over time, as perceptions and wages adjust, will employment
      recover and end up ultimately higher.
In all these cases, the specific dynamics of adjustment will depend on the
speed at which unions learn and adjust wages. The speed of learning is likely
to depend in turn on how easy these changes in the economic environment
are to identify. Productivity growth, measured, say, by TFP growth, has
a large transitory component from year to year. It clearly took a while for

                                                                             8
the slowdown of the mid 1970s to be fully perceived (not only by unions,
but by economists and policy makers as well); for some time, the slowdown
was largely hidden from view by the effects of the two oil price increases.
Changes in interest rates should be easier to observe, although unions may
not fully perceive the implications for investment and ultimately for em-
ployment. Increases in capital mobility may also be hard to assess. Indeed,
some unions in Europe still speak as if profits were largely rents to be ap-
propriated by workers, without implications for employment. While such
rhetoric may have been appropriate in some parts of the economy in the
past, it is surely not a good assumption about capital mobility today.

Formally introducing uncertainty and learning raises a number of concep-
tual issues. First, firms, under the maintained assumption that they per-
ceive the changes accurately, may want to be strategic, for example cut-
ting employment more than implied by the static labor demand in order
to convince unions that the world has changed. Second, unions may want
to experiment, to move the wage in order to learn faster about the relevant
parameters. We leave both of these issues aside, and focus on what strikes
us as the main effect of uncertainty and learning, namely that it takes some
time for unions to learn, and thus to adjust the wage.

So assume that labor demand is still given by equation (1) (so firms are
not strategic), and that unions maximize the expected wage bill period by
period (so they have no incentive to experiment2 ).

Consider the case where only productivity a is stochastic, and assume that
it follows:


              log(at ) = log(a∗t ) + ²t ,     log(a∗t ) = log(a∗t−1 ) + g̃

2. In fact, for the case we consider below, namely uncertainty about productivity a,
unions have no incentive to experiment since the signal to noise ratio does not depend
on the wage they set. This is no longer the case when unions are uncertain about the
elasticity of capital supply, θ.

                                                                                    9
where ²t is i.i.d. normal, and g̃ can take one of two values, g̃ = g or g̃ = 0. In
words, actual productivity is equal to underlying productivity plus white
noise. Underlying productivity growth is either positive or zero.

To capture what happened in the mid 1970s, suppose that underlying pro-
ductivity growth decreases from g to 0. Unions will learn and adjust wages
at a rate which will depend on the tightness of their prior and the standard
deviation of the transitory component. Figure 2 shows such a path, both
for the wage in efficiency units wt /at and for employment (which is the
mirror image of the wage), based on an initial subjective probability that
g̃ = g equal to 0.98, a standard deviation of the transitory shock of 2%,
and a value of g of 1% (the derivation of the path is given in the appendix.)


Figure 2. The response of wages in efficiency units to a decrease
in productivity growth.


The main feature of Figure 2 is the hump shaped response of the wage
in efficiency units, which, given the static labor demand function, implies
a hump shaped response of employment and of unemployment. As pro-
ductivity growth slows down, wage growth also decreases but still exceeds
productivity growth for some time. This leads to an increase in the wage
in efficiency units for some time, until it turns around and returns to its
steady state value. For the parameters we have chosen, this leads to an
increase in wages in efficiency units of about 5% at the peak, an increase
roughly consistent what is observed in the data at the end of the 1970s for
the European Union as a whole.

Similar dynamics can be derived with respect to the other shocks, be it an
increase in interest rates, or an increase in capital mobility. An increase in
capital mobility, even if it ultimately leads to an increase in employment,
may well also generate a hump shape response of unemployment, with an
initial increase, followed by a larger decrease later on.

4     Learning, the quality of labor relations, and
      unemployment
What might lead to different speeds of learning and adjustment by unions?
Bayesian learning points to differences in the tightness of priors, and the
informativeness of signals. More generally, it points to differences in ideol-
ogy, and differences in the quality of labor relations: The more unions and
firms share a common economic model, or the more they discuss the eco-
nomic implications of different shocks, the faster learning and adjustment
is likely to be.


4.1   Quality of labor relations and unemployment

With this motivation in mind, we construct and study the effects of two
measures of the quality of labor relations across OECD countries.
•     The first is a measure of strike intensity, from 1960 to 1967. The
      motivation for looking at strike activity is a simple one: most of the
      theoretical and empirical work on strikes suggests that the quality
      of labor relations is an important determinant of strike activity (see,
      for example, Hibbs [1987].) The motivation for choosing the period
      1960 to 1967 is that this predates the increase in unemployment that
      we want to explain. The reason for stopping in 1967 rather than, say,
      1970, is that, in the late 1960s, many European countries, especially
      France, Germany, and Italy, were affected by social and political un-
      rest, for reasons largely unrelated to the quality of labor relations.
      Two measures of strike activity are available for the 1960s for most
      OECD countries. The first is a measure of days lost in strikes (DL),
      the second a measure of workers involved in strikes (WI). We express
      both as ratios to employment. When needed, we combine them in one
      measure, STRIKE, which we define by the maximum of normalized




                                                                           11
    days lost and normalized workers involved:
                                     ½                     ¾
                                   DLi     W Ii
                   STRIKEi = max        ,
                                 std(DL) std(W I)

    The standard deviations are the cross country standard deviations.
    The motivation for using the max specification is that not all strikes
    are recorded, while all recorded strikes actually happened, so both
    measures are likely to be lower bounds on strike activity.
    As an explanatory variable, this measure presents two problems. The
    first is that, in the 1960s, two OECD countries, Spain and Portugal,
    were dictatorships, where strike activity was illegal. We have no other
    choice, when using this measure, than to drop these two countries
    from the sample. The second is that strike activity depends on other
    variables than the quality of labor relations, some of them observable
    (such as unemployment during the period), some of them unobserv-
    able. This implies that using strike activity as a proxy for quality in
    a regression entails measurement error. We shall return to the issue
    below.
•   The second measure is a direct, survey, measure. In 1999, the World
    Economic Forum asked the following question to managers of firms
    in a large number of countries: “Are labor relations in your firm
    cooperative?”. The answer was given on a scale from 0 to 7. We use
    the country mean response as our second measure of the quality of
    labor relations, and denote it by “COOP”.
    Clearly, this second variable is closer to what we want to capture
    than the first. It suffers however from an obvious problem of poten-
    tial reverse causality, as perceptions of the quality of labor relations
    by firms in 1999 may well reflect in part the evolution of unemploy-
    ment since the 1960s. (A similar question was asked in 1993. This is
    however also quite late in the period, and the 1993 and 1999 measures
    are very highly correlated).

                                                                         12
If we think of the quality of labor relations as a stable feature of an econ-
omy, a natural question is how correlated the two measures of quality are.
The answer is given in Figure 3, which plots COOP against STRIKE, for
the 18 OECD countries for which both measures exist. As can be seen,
there is a strong negative relation between the two (The R2 of the regres-
sion of COOP on STRIKE is equal to 0.62, the t-statistic on the coefficient
on STRIKE is equal to -5.0). This is good news for our implicit main-
tained hypothesis that the quality of labor relations is a relatively stable
characteristic of countries over time.


Figure 3. Cooperation in 1999 versus Strikes in 1960-1967


We can then turn to the relation between unemployment and the quality
of labor relations over time. To do so, we divide the period 1965-2002
into decades (more specifically 1965-1974, 1975-1984, 1985-1994, and 1995-
2002), and for each decade, we regress:

                   uit = at + bt (quality measurei ) + eit ,               (4)

where uit is the mean unemployment rate in decade t in country i. For
each t, the coefficient at captures the common evolution of unemployment
across countries during the decade. Our interest is in the coefficient bt ,
which captures the extent to which differences in the quality measure can
explain differences in unemployment across countries during the decade.

Note: Cooperation in labor relation is, from 1999 survey of managers, the answer to question: "Are
labor relations in your firm cooperative?". Strike activity per employee from 1960 to 1967 is a
composite measure based on employees involved and days lost. Last regression (IV) uses days lost
and employees involved in strikes in the 1960's to instrument for 1999 survey measure.
their standard deviation, so the coefficients are directly comparable.) For
reasons discussed earlier, both of these regressions suffer from potential
bias, measurement error for the first, simultaneity bias for the second. Thus,
in the third line, we report the results of estimation, using days lost per
employee and workers involved as instruments for COOP. If, as plausible,
the measurement error in using the strike measure is uncorrelated with the
disturbance term in the above regression, this yields consistent estimates
of the effect of the quality of labor relations on unemployment for each
decade.

All three regressions suggest a strong and significant effect of the quality
of labor relations on unemployment. The magnitudes are largely similar
across the two measures, and across OLS and IV estimation. Countries
with one-standard deviation better quality had about 1% less unemploy-
ment than the average OECD country in 1965-1974, about 1.5 to 2% less
unemployment in 1975-1984, about 2 to 2.5% in 1985-1994, and 1995-2002.
To give a better sense of the results, Figure 4 plots the unemployment rate
against COOP, and the OLS regression line for each of the four decades.
The relation is quite striking, especially in the last two periods.

Figure 4. The quality of labor relations and unemployment rates,
by decade

Standard checks suggests that this relation is robust. Figure 4 makes clear
that the results are not driven by any single country. Using the underlying
components DL and WI separately rather than combined in CONF makes
little difference to the results. So does the use of the 1993 answers instead of
the 1999 answers to the World Economic Forum survey. So does controlling
for the average unemployment rate in 1960-1967. Estimating equation (4)
using annual unemployment rather than decadal averages) yields a time
series for estimated bˆt which is hump shaped, reaching a peak in the mid
1980s, and decreasing at the very end of the sample.

4.2   The quality of labor relations, Institutions, and
      unemployment

An obvious question at this point is whether the quality of labor rela-
tions affects unemployment directly, i.e. given labor market institutions,
or through these institutions themselves. The earlier description of the
Netherlands suggests the presence of at least some direct effect: Institu-
tions were reformed only after wage moderation started. We now look at
the cross country evidence.

A natural starting point is to use a specification which allows for an effect
of institutions on unemployment, and then add our measure of quality.
Such a specification was suggested and explored in earlier work by one of
the two authors [Blanchard and Wolfers 2000]. We use that specification
as a benchmark and estimate:


                                                        X
  uit = (1 + d65−74 + d75−84 + d85−94 + d95−03 ) (α +       βj Xij ) + εit   (5)
                                                        j


We divide time in 4 decades: 1965-74, 1975-84, 1985-94, 1995-2003 (We
use decades to make the results more comparable to the results presented
earlier. Using half decades as in Blanchard and Wolfers makes little differ-
ence to the results.) uit is unemployment in country i and decade t, and
Xij is a measure of institution j in country i. This specification allows for
the impact of the common (unobservable) aggregate shock dt to depend
on a linear combination of the different measures of institutions. The in-
stitutions (described in Blanchard and Wolfers) are the replacement rate,
an index of the length of time for which unemployment benefits are paid,
union coverage, an index of employment protection, an index of active la-
bor market policies, union density, a measure of the tax wedge between
the cost of labor to firms and take-home pay by workers, and a measure of


                                                                             15
coordination of bargaining.


Table 2: Shocks and institutions revisited


Results of estimation of this non-linear specification are given in Table 2.

The first column uses only COOP, instrumented by STRIKE. This spec-
ification can be thought as the same as equation (4), with the additional
constraint across time periods that bt /at = constant. This additional con-
straint is close to being satisfied by the unconstrained regressions, so the
results are very similar, and our measure of labor quality is, as in Table 1,
very significant.

The second column uses only the variables in Blanchard and Wolfers, and
the results are, in general, similar to theirs. Institutions are defined so that
their expected sign on unemployment is positive; all coefficients turn out
to have the expected sign, although only the last 4 are significant.

The third column uses both institutions and our measure of quality. The
coefficient on the measure of quality decreases from -0.927 to -0.638, but
remains very significant. Interestingly, the coefficients on most institutions
become more significant than in column 2. One might have expected the
“coordination” variable and our quality variable to capture similar dimen-
sions of labor relations and be very collinear; this is not the case (the
correlation between the two is 0.42), and both dimensions are strongly
significant.

Column 4 excludes labor market institutions that were not significant in
column 3. The estimated coefficient for the quality of labor relations goes
up to -0.834, and is just as significant as in column 1.

Institutional variables (from Replacement Rate to Coordination of Bargaining) are from Blanchard and Wolfers, 2002. They are defined such that expected sign is
positive. Spain, Portugal and Greece are excluded from regression due to lack of meaningful strikes data in the 1960's.
5     Conclusions and open issues
We see the point of our paper as arguing that, in addition to formal in-
stitutions, the quality of labor relations matters in the determination of
unemployment. Faced with adverse shocks, such as those Europe has faced
in the last three to four decades, countries with better relations appear to
have been better able to limit the rise of unemployment and to turnaround
faster thereafter.

This is both good and bad news for those who want to achieve lower unem-
ployment in Europe. The good news is that, while institutional reform is
clearly important, good labor relations, by themselves, go a long way. The
bad news is that, based on the informal evidence as well as the correlation
between our two measures of quality for the 1960s and the late 1990s, the
quality of labor relations appears slow to change over time, if at all.

This last remark points to the obvious limit of our paper, namely the lack
of a theory for what determines the quality of labor relations, and whether
and how it can be improved over time. This is a large and difficult topic,
and we shall limit ourselves to a few remarks3 .

The quality of labor relations is clearly correlated with a number of union
or country characteristics. The attitude of unions with respect to the profit
rate of firms clearly differs between communist, socialist, and social-democratic
unions. Most socialist and social-democratic unions now recognize the need
for firms to maintain an adequate profit rate. The rhetoric of many com-
munist unions, on the other hand, remains largely similar to what it was
30 years ago. The same holds not only for unions, but also for political par-

3. Müller and Philippon [2004] study the link between labor relations and the control
of firms. They find that, across countries, bad labor relations are associated with more
family control, while good labor relations are associated with more dispersed ownership
of shares. They argue that bad labor relations and tight family control reinforce each
other. This may explain the persistence of bad and good relations that we see in the
data.


                                                                                     17
ties.4 Our quality measure is indeed strongly correlated with the number
of communist votes in elections in the 1960s. Whether this should be taken
as correlation, or as a proximate cause for the quality of labor relations, is
still unclear.

Some evidence suggests, however, that the quality of labor relations can
change over time. The example of the UK appears relevant here. Unions
were surely made weaker by the policies of Margaret Thatcher; but there
is wide agreement that they have also changed their attitude (although the
improvement in the quality of labor relations is not visible in our Figure 3,
where the UK is right on the regression line...)




4. Indeed, the best known early statement of the need for “a partnership between capital
and labor” is by Helmut Schmidt, then the Social Democratic Chancellor of Germany,
in 1976: “The profits of entreprises today are the investments of tomorrow, and the
investments of tomorrow are the jobs of the day after”.

Appendix. Derivation of the wage under learning.

Let pt be the subjective probability held by the union at time t that g̃ = g,
and let p0 be the prior. From the realized employment nt , the union can
extract at but not a∗t . The information set at the end of period t is therefore
Ωt = {a0 , a1 , .., at }.

Under the assumption that the union sets the wage one period in advance,
to maximize the expected wage bill


                              ŵt+1 = arg max Et [wt+1 nt+1 ]
                                                wt+1


the wage is given by:

                                                                           σ2
                                            φ                     φe−       2
                            ŵt+1 =     h         i =             h¡        ¢−1 i
                                      Et a−1
                                          t+1               Et      a∗t+1


              1−r+ θ1
where φ ≡       2       .

Bayesian learning in turn implies

       pt = prob (g̃ = g | Ωt−1 , at )

                  prob (at | Ωt−1 , g̃ = g) prob (g̃ = g | Ωt−1 )
             =
                                prob (at | Ωt−1 )

                                                        pt−1
             =                                   ³          ³                                 ´´
                  pt−1 + (1 − pt−1 ) exp              1
                                                     2σ 2
                                                                (log at − gt)2 − (log at )2


Along the path where ε = 0 and g̃ = 0, we have

                                                     pt−1
                            pt =                                       ³           ´
                                                                           (gt)2
                                   pt−1 + (1 − pt−1 ) exp                   2σ 2


                                                                                                   19
where we see that pt decreases toward 0. Along this path, the wage is

                                         σ2
                                     φe− 2
                        ŵt =
                              pt−1 e−gt + 1 − pt−1

and employment is
                         nt = 1 + θ (1 − ŵt − r)

The values used to derive the path in Figure 2 are p(0) = 0.98, g = .01,
σ = .02, r = .1 and θ = 1.
