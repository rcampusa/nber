Stagnation and Scientific Incentives

                                          ABSTRACT

New ideas no longer fuel economic growth the way they once did. A popular explanation for
stagnation is that good ideas are harder to find, rendering slowdown inevitable. We present a
simple model of the lifecycle of scientific ideas that points to changes in scientist incentives as
the cause of scientific stagnation. Over the last five decades, citations have become the dominant
way to evaluate scientific contributions and scientists. This emphasis on citations in the
measurement of scientific productivity shifted scientist rewards and behavior on the margin
toward incremental science and away from exploratory projects that are more likely to fail, but
which are the fuel for future breakthroughs. As attention given to new ideas decreased, science
stagnated. We also explore ways to broaden how scientific productivity is measured and
rewarded, involving both academic search engines such as Google Scholar measuring which
contributions explore newer ideas and university administrators and funding agencies utilizing
these new metrics in research evaluation. We demonstrate empirically that measures of novelty
are correlated with but distinct from measures of scientific impact, which suggests that if also
novelty metrics were utilized in scientist evaluation, scientists might pursue more innovative,
riskier, projects.

1. Introduction

Economic progress in the advanced world has stagnated in recent decades. As recently as
the 1980s, GDP growth rates of four percent or higher were the standard for success.
Today, a country that experiences a three percent growth rate in GDP has achieved great
success. Real growth rates of one or two percent are the norm when a country is not
experiencing a recession. Even many previously fast-developing poorer countries are now
experiencing slowing GDP growth rates and diminished expectations for the future. While
economists are still debating the causes of this global slowdown in GDP and productivity
growth, most now seem to agree that part of the reason must include a slowdown in the
rate of discovery of practical new scientific ideas and the development of new technologies
that those ideas support.1
        It is fair to ask whether science is actually stagnating. Are we not confronted with
evidence to the contrary daily? For example, in biomedicine, we are (once again) seemingly
on the cusp of revolutionary technologies that will ultimately (we hope) enable doctors to
cure cancer and extend life well into our second century. Moreover, the past two decades
have seen astrophysicists train telescopes on black holes and planets orbiting other stars.
The recent past has offered us also some very practical advances. For example, the
development of techniques to miniaturize semiconductors has provided the engine
underlying Moore’s law, which predicts that the number of transistors in an integrated
circuit will double every two years. These developments have led to computational devices
with almost unimaginable power in our pockets.
        Systematic evidence, however, points to a decline in scientific productivity. While
there are many times more scientists today than in the past, today’s advances do not
compare favorably to past breakthroughs. In areas where scientific progress is still as
robust as in the past, today’s discoveries take many times more research effort than did
past discoveries. The cost of developing new drugs, for example, now doubles every nine

years. This empirical regularity has been referred to as Eroom’s law, representing the idea
that the forces that govern scientific progress today are in many ways a mirror image of the
forces that were at play at the time while Gordon Moore conceived his law. In other
scientific areas, such as physics, the decline in scientific productivity appears to be
absolute; many physicists themselves view current breakthroughs as less significant than
past ones, despite the larger investment in these scientific areas.2 Even economics, a
quantitative social science, has not been immune to concerns about stagnation.3
        A common explanation for this scientific stagnation is that finding good new ideas
has simply gotten harder. Having picked all the low-hanging fruit, the secrets that are still
there for scientists to unlock are fewer and harder to find.4 While this explanation is
convenient as it absolves scientists, institutions, and analysts from any responsibility for
the slowdown, it is likely wrong. One problem is that this explanation is not unique to our
era. This view was common before the scientific revolution, as well as during the late
nineteenth century. After the successful extension of classical physical ideas to electricity,
magnetism, light, and heat, many physicists argued that physicists had solved physics. On
the verge of two great revolutions in physical thinking (relativity and quantum mechanics),
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Albert Michelson—one of the duo of physicists who earlier
debunked the theory of ether—said in an 1894 speech dedicating the Ryerson Laboratory
at the University of Chicago that:

         "The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all
         been discovered, and these are now so firmly established that the possibility

  ​Caballero (2010) laments the state of macroeconomics and implores researchers to address the pretense of
knowledge syndrome by shifting to broad exploration mode. Romer (2015, 2016) argues that
macroeconomics has gone backwards, as a culture of deference to authority has led to careless formalism and
abandonment of empirical evidence as the coordination device. Heckman and Moktan (2019) worry that the
obsession with publishing in high-impact journals incentivizes careerism over creativity, as innovative papers
and exploratory odd-ball ideas are unlikely to survive these journals’ refereeing practices. Akerlof (2019) and
Ruhm (2019) argue that economics excessively favors work where precise results can be produced over work
that examines more important questions but yields imprecise results, biasing the profession against new
ideas as they tend to be initially poorly understood and formulated. Frey (2003) argues that in economics
new ideas are rejected for lack of rigor as they are by necessity less well formulated than well-established
ideas, and that this has inundated economics with boring and irrelevant papers.

(2011) and Bloom et al. (2019).


                                                                                                             2
         of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is
         exceedingly remote.”5

        In stark contrast with this dark but once again popular view that we are entering an
era of vanishing secrets and diminished expectations for the future, our explanation for the
slowdown in research productivity has nothing to do with the paucity of good ideas. On the
contrary, we believe that an abundance of ideas remains to be uncovered, ideas that—if
given proper attention by the community of scientists—will produce unparalleled
breakthroughs.
        In this paper, we argue that the root of the slowdown in scientific progress lies in
the more quotidian fact that scientific work on truly novel ideas that have the potential to
develop into groundbreaking advances is no longer rewarded in the same way it once was.
Because scientists respond to incentives just as everyone else does, the reduction in the
reward for novel, exploratory, work has reduced the effort devoted to it in favor of
pursuing more incremental science which seeks to advance established ideas. Furthermore,
as ideas are not born as breakthroughs—they need the attention and revision of a
community of scientists to be developed into transformative discoveries—this decrease in
scientists’ willingness to engage in an exploration of new ideas has meant that fewer new
ideas have developed into breakthrough ideas. The underlying change in scientist
incentives in turn has been driven by the shift toward evaluating each scientist based on
how popular their published work is in the scientific community, with popularity measured
by the number of times their work is cited by other scientists. We call this shift the ‘citation
revolution’. This citation revolution has offered a useful way to identify and reward

  Michelson (1903, pp. 23-24). On the lack of belief in discovery before the scientific revolution, see Wootton
(2015). More recent reincarnations of this view include Glass (1971), Horgan (1996), Cowen (2011), Gordon
(2016) and Bloom et al. (2019). Silverstein (1999) lists further examples from different fields. Betz (2017)
reviews other prominent stagnation theories including increased regulation and risk-aversion. Another
problem with the vanishing secrets theory of stagnation is its self-fulfilling nature. Should scientists
increasingly give up on the prospect of uncovering important secrets, it would become even harder for those
few who still pursue broad exploration to get funding as their work would then be perceived to be even less
feasible than today. See Thiel (2014) and Diamond (2019) for related analyses. The vanishing secrets theory
of stagnation also runs against the idea that the arrival of new ideas leads to a combinatorial explosion in the
number of possible combinations of ideas and an accompanying increase in available combinations lead to
breakthroughs. On combinatorial explosion, see Romer (2019). Stagnation is consistent with combinatorial
explosion if scientists at the same time become less willing to try out combinations that involve new ideas.

breakthrough science, contributions that have had a large influence on the scientific
community.6 However, it has also dramatically tilted incentives in favor of incremental
me-too science (as work in crowded areas tends to gather many citations) over exploration
and scientific play, which tends to gather fewer citations but which lays the necessary
groundwork for subsequent breakthroughs. The fixation with citations—which popular
academic search engines such as Google Scholar solidify today—and the associated shift in
scientist incentives and behavior have thus ultimately led to fewer breakthroughs.7
        The role that exploration and scientific play have in developing new ideas gradually
from their infancy to breakthroughs forms a central part of our argument. Accordingly, we
present a simple model of the lifecycle of a scientific idea to capture this aspect of scientific
production. The model links scientific effort on an idea and the scientific impact of the idea
in the three phases of the lifecycle of an idea: exploration, breakthrough, and incremental
advance. Since ideas develop slowly in their infancy, early explorative work on an idea
typically—and in our model—has little scientific impact. Nevertheless, such work is crucial
because it lays the necessary groundwork for the later work on the idea, work that yields
the breakthrough.
        The model is inspired by prominent examples of scientific breakthroughs in
biomedicine. For instance, consider CRISPR—a recent breakthrough in biomedicine and
one with the potential for substantial practical patient care benefits. The scientists now
predicted to win Nobel Prizes for CRISPR began their first work on the idea after 20 years
of exploration and scientific play by other scientists with the ideas that underlie it. This
initial work gradually advanced the understanding by biomedical scientists of CRISPR’s
existence, properties, purpose, and potential uses.
        Given this crucial aspect of scientific production—that early exploration is
indispensable but typically has little impact on the wider scientific community—an
excessive reliance on citations in the evaluation of scientists effectively punishes the

                                                                                                        4
exploration of new ideas. The incentives created by the focus on citations leads researchers
to pursue more established research paths, with stagnant science as the by-product. Our
simple model highlights this tension between the exploration of new ideas and
citation-based research evaluation. Our analysis also clarifies who exactly stands on the
shoulders of giants in science (those who make breakthrough discoveries) and who are the
giants (those contemporaries and predecessors who engaged in the early exploration of
new ideas). The latter group often has little recognition in the wider scientific community
but facilitate the subsequent breakthroughs.
       Unlike the “vanishing secrets” theory of stagnation, ​our incentive-based theory of
stagnation suggests that ​continued stagnation need not be inevitable​. Changing scientist
incentives by broadening how scientific productivity is measured and evaluated, in
particular by rewarding both scientific impact and novelty, could encourage more
exploration and scientific play.
       The balance of the paper proceeds as follows. In the first half, we delineate the link
between stagnation and citation-driven science. We first discuss the dominant position that
citation counts have come to hold in the evaluation of scientific contributions and
scientists. Next, we present a simple model of the lifecycle of a scientific idea that
distinguishes the special role that exploration and scientific play have in the development
of scientific ideas from their infancy to breakthroughs. The model conveys a rationale to
reward both exploration and impact. We then revisit the citation revolution in light of our
model, focusing on how the citation revolution shifted scientist incentives and behavior
away from exploration and toward incremental science.
       In the second half, we examine how changes in the measurement of scientific
productivity to emphasize ​both ​novelty and impact might reverse the decline in
exploration. We first discuss how academic search engines such as Google Scholar solidify
the fixation with citations. We explain how these services could also measure other aspects
of scientific productivity, such as the propensity to explore new ideas. We then present a
constructive way to measure such scientific novelty in practice and show that measures of




                                                                                                5
novelty and scientific influence are empirically distinct. The final section describes several
potential future paths for the process of scientific discovery.



2. Today’s One-Dimensional Evaluation of Scientific Contributions


Scientists are measured by concrete metrics that are intended to capture the breadth of
their contributions to the scientific enterprise. The rule for research scientists, at least
those working in university settings, used to be “publish or perish.” This idea, first
articulated in the 1940s, implicitly assumes that a productive scientist publishes many
papers while an unproductive scientist publishes few.8 A variant of this rule involves
counting the number of papers published in the most prestigious scientific journals.
           While useful, in recent decades, the importance of this simple volume metric has
faded as another metric focused on measuring how popular a scientist’s published papers
are in the scientific community has risen in importance. The popularity of a given paper, in
turn, is measured by the number of times other scientific papers cite that paper. Scientific
journals are now also ranked largely based on their “impact factor,” which is a function of
the number of citations that papers published by the journal have attracted. An impactful
scientist has come to mean a scientist who publishes popular, highly cited papers.
           Some modern metrics such as the “h-index,” developed by physicist Jorge Hirsh,
combine volume and popularity into a single score that is a function of both. The h-index is
as important to scientists today as a batting average or slugging percentage is to a
professional baseball player, and in a directly analogous way. Success as a scientist,
including tenure, promotion, and pay, often depend crucially on this number.
           A key criticism that raw citation counts, the h-index, and other measures
constructed from citation data have faced in recent years is that they reduce scientific
contributions to a number. Even an editorial in Science—the most highly cited scientific
journal—concurs.9 The author laments the prevailing ‘impact factor mania,’ and the

                                                                                                 6
increasing tendency of scientists to work in well-populated research areas and on me-too
science. Our concern with citations is a bit different, as we believe that advocates of
citation-based metrics are right in arguing that highly cited discoveries are worth
celebrating. The issue with citations is not that they reduce scientific contributions to a
number.
       Rather, our main concern with citations is that they reduce scientific progress to a
set of numbers that capture just one important dimension of scientific productivity. While
breakthrough advances are worth celebrating, such contributions are not the only
discoveries worth celebrating. Scientific progress depends on a steady flow of exploration
and experiments with new ideas. When first hatched, new ideas are risky for scientists to
work on in the sense that, at the outset, it is hard to distinguish between the ideas that are
likely to be good if properly developed and the ideas that will never amount to much.
Moreover, transformative discoveries—breakthroughs—depend on the base of knowledge
created by this sort of scientific play with risky new ideas.
       Because citation-based metrics cannot capture distinctions between scientific
exploration of new ideas and incremental work on mature, well-established, ideas, they
distort research evaluation and shift scientist incentives away from such exploration and
toward incremental science. The resulting decline in exploration and scientific play leads to
fewer ideas that are developed into breakthroughs, rendering science less vibrant.



3. The Importance of Scientific Exploration and Play


Crucially, not all eureka moments in science were recognized as such at first. Instead, the
ideas only became transformative ideas after other scientists developed them further.
Examples from every scientific discipline abound. One particularly instructive example
comes from biochemistry.
       In 1967, biologists playing around near a Yellowstone National Park hot spring
isolated the bacteria that they found thriving there. What drew their interest was the fact
that bacteria could survive at such high temperatures. All living organisms require DNA to


                                                                                                 7
reproduce, and the key enzyme that enables the copying of DNA is called DNA polymerase.
One reason why most bacteria die at high temperatures, such as those found in hot springs,
is that excessive heat deactivates DNA polymerase. Unlike other organisms, however,
exposure to high heat does not harm the hot springs bacteria. The researchers noticed that
one particular bacterium survived in higher temperatures than previously thought
possible, and named this bacterium Thermus aquaticus (“hot water”). This curious new fact
was published in the ​Journal of Bacteriology​ and generated a few citations but did not
attract the attention of the wider community of biologists. A decade later, in 1976, other
scientists isolated the DNA polymerase—a key enzyme that all living cells use to copy
DNA—of the Thermus aquaticus bacterium. This finding too was published in the ​Journal of
Bacteriology​ and had a similarly limited scientific impact.10
           In the 1980s, biochemist Kary Mullis dreamed up the idea of applying a cell’s
capacity to copy DNA over and over again on a particular strand of DNA.11 First, there
would be two copies, then four, then eight, and so on. After enough replications, there
might be millions of copies of the desired DNA segment. The technology, called polymerase
chain reaction (“PCR”), later won Mullis the Nobel prize and revolutionized biomedicine.
Without PCR, the human genome project would have been impossible. The earliest versions
of this technology required the repetitive heating and cooling of the DNA sample and the
continual reintroduction of new DNA polymerase into the solution. This unfortunate fact
rendered the technology impractical for widespread use. The key breakthrough happened
a few years later when scientists (including Mullis himself) playing with Mullis’ idea,
learned about the earlier work on the hot springs bacterium and its unique heat resistant
DNA polymerase. With this tweak—and no need to repetitively reintroduce DNA
polymerase at every replication—PCR was automated so that a machine could run the
procedure cheaply. Today PCR is used as an essential tool in every field where analysis of
DNA plays a role. But this advance would never have happened without support for the
biologists to play around near the Yellowstone geysers and hot springs.

        The history of CRISPR, a more recent breakthrough in biomedicine, offers a second
illustration of the importance of scientific play and how ideas gradually develop into
breakthroughs. In 1987, scientists first noticed ​clustered repeated regularly interspaced
short repeats​ (CRISPR) in genetic material. During the 20 years that followed, work by
dozens of scientists demonstrated the presence of CRISPR in different organisms and
explored its properties, though in the initial years after its discovery, the biological purpose
of CRISPR remained mysterious. By 2007, though, scientists had discovered CRISPR’s
evolutionary purpose as an adaptive immune system. Cells use these DNA segments as a
library of foreign DNA to help immune cells fight off future assaults.
        Despite these breakthroughs, CRISPR had yet to influence the wider scientific
community. The early work did not receive many citations, and even as late as 2012,
leading journals rejected contributions that are now considered key advances. In 2011, it
was not clear that CRISPR was the best technology for genome editing; scientists who chose
to explore it considered the choice risky. In 2007, the scientists now predicted to win Nobel
Prizes for their CRISPR-enabled discoveries had not yet begun their work on it.
        Nevertheless, the early work on CRISPR—the two decades of scientific exploration
and play by many scientists in relative obscurity—had gradually advanced the
understanding of CRISPR’s existence, properties, purpose, and potential uses within
biomedicine. This knowledge served as the basis for a flurry of scientific activity in the late
2000s and early 2010s that culminated in CRISPR being successfully used for mammalian
genome editing in 2012, with considerable scientific influence and potential practical
benefits.12
        There are several key lessons to draw from the stories of PCR and CRISPR. First, it is
exceedingly difficult to anticipate which particular advances in science are likely to prove
useful for future breakthroughs; it takes a long time for the scientific community to come to



12
   ​For the history of CRISPR, see ​Yoshizumi et al. (2018), ​Mojica and Montoliu (2016), ​Doudna and Sternberg
(2017) and Lander (2016) (the last reference is controversial not for its emphasis on the key role that
exploration and scientific play had in terms of facilitating the widely celebrated later breakthroughs but for
its emphasis on senior scientists over graduate students and postdocs and for its emphasis on some senior
scientists over others as well as for its lack of acknowledgement of a potential conflict of interest relating to a
patent dispute).


                                                                                                                  9
understand the properties of each new idea. There is thus a great long run benefit to
supporting the exploration of ideas that, at the time, do not have an immediate and
apparent application.13
        The second lesson is that breakthroughs often cannot take place without prior
high-risk work. When Isaac Newton—a revolutionary scientist if there ever was one—said
that he was “standing on the shoulders of giants,” this was not merely false humility. His
work built on the foundation of the scientific play of his contemporaries and predecessors,
even if nearly everyone today (barring historians of science) would face insuperable
difficulties in naming them all or their contributions to physics. It is no accident that
Gottfried Leibniz discovered calculus at nearly the same time as Newton—they both
benefited from the same scientific community of contemporaries and predecessors; they
were both standing on the shoulders of the same giants.14
        The third lesson derives from thinking about all the scientific play that does not
ultimately prove useful. Most scientific work with new ideas falls into this category, as most
new ideas fail in the sense that they do not develop into breakthroughs. While early
exploratory work is crucial for subsequent breakthroughs, it is rare for scientists to reward
such work with many contemporaneous (or even delayed) citations. Despite the difficulty
of distinguishing ultimately useful scientific play from less useful play at the time when this
exploration takes place, such work is valuable nonetheless and worthy of support even


13
   ​The discovery of the DNA double helix provides another illustration of how raw ideas are when they are
first born. The initial response to the discovery was muted in part due to lack of evidentiary support on
several dimensions—even Watson and Crick acknowledged the speculative nature of their initial discovery.
Subsequent work by many scientists who were willing to explore the new hypothesis in the subsequent years
soon filled those gaps. See Olby (2003). The events leading up to the discovery of the double helix by Watson
and Crick provide a further illustration of the importance of exploration by a broader scientific community in
fueling breakthrough discoveries. See Watson (1968)
14
    ​The discovery by eventual Nobel winners Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of the role of Helicobacter
pylori in pectic ulcers provides another illustration of the value of exploration for later discoveries. Marshall
and Warren benefited from 90 years of prior exploration on bacteria that can survive in stomach acid. By the
time Warren turned to the topic, the scientific community had largely forgotten the initial exploratory work
on the topic. Warren at first faced considerable resistance to his hypothesis, but further experiments by
Marshall and Warren—including Marshall drinking a slurry of the bacteria and causing himself an ulcer—and
by others finally convinced the larger scientific community that their idea was right, and led to a flurry of
research to use the finding in clinical practice. The abovementioned work on hot springs bacteria played a
role too—it helped change the previous consensus that bacteria do not survive harsh environments such as in
stomach acid or hot springs. See Marshall (2005, 2016) and Warren (2005).


                                                                                                              10
given its high rate of failure.15 Scientists who spend their lives on such play need rewards
commensurate with the value of their work, which is considerable, even if most of their
publications do not generate much attention in the form of citations from other scientists.
        In the next section, we develop a simple model that captures these key
characteristics of how ideas develop and highlights how citation-based evaluation weakens
the incentive to explore new ideas. Before proceeding, it bears mentioning that the
distortion of incentives influences not only what scientists do but also who becomes a
scientist in the first place.16 The tilt in incentives drives away those who would prefer to
pursue risky exploration in their work. The eccentric scientist type—the introverts who
prefer to work apart from the crowds—has a weakened incentive to enter science.
Gradually in science, such individuals will be replaced with people who work well in teams
but conform more easily to prevailing scientific norms, researchers who tend to eschew
exploration in new areas of investigation and instead work in more crowded research
areas. To be sure, both types of scientists are valuable. Science needs scientists who
develop maturing research areas ​and​ science needs scientists who explore the unknown in
search of establishing new areas of investigation.



4. The Lifecycle of a Scientific Idea


We now present a simple model of scientific production that describes the lifecycle of an
idea. The framework abstracts away many important aspects of the scientific endeavor but
highlights the natural history of the development of scientific ideas. At the heart of this
model is a division of scientific activity on each scientific idea into three phases:
exploration, breakthrough, and incremental advance. Figure 1 illustrates these three
phases. Since work on an idea in the latter phases builds on earlier work on the idea, we
call this framework the “shoulders of giants” model.


15
   ​Working scientists often view failure to be common and even as a precursor to success, see Livio (2013),
Firestein (2015), Popovian (2016) and Zaringhalam (2016).
16
    On how scientist evaluation mechanisms influence who becomes a scientist, see Osterloh and Frey (2013).


                                                                                                          11
    Figure 1. The relationship between scientific effort on an idea and the scientific
    impact of the idea. The horizontal axis captures the three phases of our model:
    exploration, breakthrough, and incremental advance. The vertical axis captures the
    influence of the idea on the scientific community. Work done during the
    exploration phase has little observed impact but lays the necessary groundwork for
    the later breakthroughs.


       In this model of scientific production, new ideas occur to scientists all the time
during the conduct of their work. These new ideas all share the feature that when they first
arrive, they are in an embryonic form that generates no scientific impact whatsoever. Good
but yet untested and unexplored ideas are, by themselves, cheap in science and convince no
one of anything. Most new scientific ideas die there, with even the scientist who had the
original idea giving up on it shortly after it arrives.
       On the other hand, one or maybe a few scientists might see promise in a new idea
and deem it worthy of further exploration. The idea may even entice a broader group of
scientists to engage. This early work on the idea initiates the exploration phase. The
importance of such attention by a community of scholars in the development of each new


                                                                                            12
idea into a mature advance is neither new nor controversial. However, in citation-based
empirical analyses of scientific productivity, this aspect is often forgotten; the analyses
focus instead on identifying great scientists without regard for the scientific community
that was integral to their success.17
        During the exploration phase, scientists try out the new idea in different settings
and different ways, looking to see what does not work and what looks promising, looking
for applications and combinations with other ideas where the new idea might prove useful.
Over time and with considerable effort, the cohort of scientists working on the new idea
builds up a body of knowledge about it and its usefulness. We label work during the
exploration phase “edge science,” since researchers work with relatively unknown and
untested ideas that are near the edge of the scientific frontier.
        Often little of the body of knowledge uncovered during the exploration phase will
end up in the published literature since much of it consists of negative results about
contexts in which the idea does not work. When a scientist submits a paper for publication
describing a positive result or files a grant application to garner financial support for
further exploration, the typical reaction of peer reviewers not involved in the exploration
of the idea is skepticism and rejection. When a paper about the new idea is accepted, it will
typically attract only a small audience of scientists who cite it.
        These properties of scientific work on new ideas are modeled in Figure 1 by the long
flat portion of the exploration phase. This work generates little scientific impact (in the
sense of cited publications) as a return for the considerable effort that takes place during
this early work on an idea. Nevertheless, this work is invaluable as the knowledge gained
from such scientific play facilitates the breakthrough phase.
        Most scientific ideas never make it to the breakthrough phase, but those that do
make scientific careers. The exploration phase has finally produced a promising application



17
  Kuhn (1962, 1977) emphasized that ideas are poorly understood when they are first born and need the
attention and debate of a community of scientists to be developed into useful advances. For formal theoretical
analyses of scientific communities, see Bramoulle and Saint-Paul (2010), Besancenot and Vranceanu (2015)
and Akerlof and Michaillat (2019). Foster (1986) used an S-curve to describe the link between effort and
performance in technological innovation. The raw nature of new ideas in technological innovation was
emphasized by Marshall (1920) and Usher (1929).


                                                                                                           13
of the idea or a fruitful line of experiments that make clear to the scientific community that
the new idea is worth its attention. A broader set of researchers start to use the idea in
their own work, and someone (not necessarily from the cohort involved during the
exploration phase) publishes a paper about the idea in a high-profile scientific journal. A
flood of new scientists are drawn to the now better understood and newly popular idea,
and a series of high-profile papers are published, and grants awarded to members of this
newly enlarged cohort of experts on the idea. The impact of the idea on science from this
work is enormous and is modeled in Figure 1 by a sharp rise in the curve during this
breakthrough phase. If the idea is important enough or fruitful enough, it may eventually
generate a prestigious prize for a scientist publishing about the idea during this phase.
       Research conducted during the breakthrough phase is not synonymous with
revolutionary research in the sense implied by Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientific
Revolutions. Revolutionary ideas fundamentally upend the assumptions on which a
scientific discipline operates, relegating much previous research (even breakthrough
research) to the status of historical interest only. Hence, for example, the theory of
Ptolemaic epicycles plays almost no role in modern astrophysics since the Copernican
scientific revolution supplanted it. Though Ptolemy’s system was a breakthrough idea in its
time, it was supplanted by later developments. Only a select few breakthrough ideas are
truly revolutionary in the Kuhnian sense; these are only a small fraction of the ideas that
arrive at the breakthrough phase.
       Breakthrough science in the context of the shoulders of giants model is also not
synonymous with the ideas being capital-T true. As many scientists have evaluated the idea
by the time it hits the breakthrough phase, such ideas are more likely to be True than ideas
that die in the exploration phase. But even large groups of smart and dedicated people can
be wrong about many things. This fact is one reason why scientific influence in our model is
not exactly equal to the practical benefit of these ideas, even though in some scientific areas
such as biomedicine, the two can be linked quite closely.
       Finally, in the incremental advance phase, the idea has matured. There is still
considerable work left for scientists to do to work out details that were set aside during the



                                                                                              14
heady days of the breakthrough phase. These details are still scientifically important and
will generate further scientific impact and practical applications, but the ratio of scientific
advance to total scientific effort on the idea has decreased considerably. As a general rule,
uncertainty about what a scientist is likely to find from putting further effort into this idea
has also decreased considerably from the exploration days. Consequently, funding agencies
may be eager to award grants to scientists working on the subject. Peer reviewers—a
conservative lot if there ever was one—abet this tendency since grant applicants can
credibly reassure them the proposed work is likely to produce visible, if marginal,
successes.
       When the idea has reached near the summit of its potential, further scientific work
on it produces little scientific impact. We model this fact in Figure 1 with a flat curve during
much of the incremental advance phase. The idea has enriched the work of many scientists,
but most gradually recognize that it is time to move on to the next one. The idea has been
absorbed into the thinking of the scientific community so thoroughly that few researchers
who use the idea bother to cite the scientists who conducted the earlier work. For example,
a vanishingly small fraction of published biochemical papers today that involve DNA cite
the seminal paper by James Watson and Francis Crick on its molecular structure. Hence,
while citations are a useful tool for measuring scientific influence in the short run, the only
hope for measuring the long-term impact of an idea is through an analysis of the scientific
vocabulary.
       Up to now, we have focused on the development and lifecycle of a very successful
idea. However, most new ideas will never—even if properly developed and explored—turn
into significant breakthroughs. Figure 2 illustrates this variability in the quality of new
ideas; it shows the differing potential of four different ideas, imaginatively titled A, B, C, &
D. Idea A, if pursued by the scientific community, would result in a ground-shattering
breakthrough. Idea B, if pursued, would also produce a nice result, though perhaps not of
fundamental significance. By contrast, ideas C & D, no matter how much effort scientists
pour into them, would not result in much of anything.




                                                                                               15
    Figure 2. The relationship between scientific effort and scientific impact on four
    ideas with different potential. Ideas A and B are highly successful if properly
    developed, whereas ideas C and D do not amount to much, even if properly
    developed. Ideas that lead to failure in this sense are much more common than
    successful ideas.


       Nevertheless, the early exploration of all the ideas A, B, C, and D, is invaluable.
During the early days of scientific investigation of an idea, it is often impossible for
scientists to distinguish good ideas from the bad—that is, to distinguish ideas A and B from
ideas C and D. It takes some work by scientists to uncover whether an idea is likely to be
ultimately fruitful or barren.
       Furthermore, even the scientists who work on idea A in its exploratory phase do not
generate much immediate scientific impact. Rather, they are the giants upon whose
shoulders the later breakthrough phase scientists stand since their work enables the later
ground-breaking discoveries. The designation of “giant” extends to all the scientists
working in the exploration phase, whether they work on ideas A, B, C, or D; they all advance
science whether their results turn out positive or negative by guiding the thinking and


                                                                                             16
actions of future scientists. To further highlight this point, Figure 3 shows the model
together with the separate designation of scientific work conducted by giants and work
conducted by scientists standing on the shoulders of giants.




    Figure 3. The delineation of scientific effort as giants and as standing on the
    shoulders of giants. Giants are not only those who work on the idea during the
    breakthrough phase but also those who investigated and developed the idea during
    the exploration phase. Furthermore, the status of giant does not depend on
    whether the idea is ultimately successful.


       Figures 2 and 3 together imply a rationale for measuring and rewarding exploration
phase work by scientists, even if the idea does not develop into a meaningful advance. First,
rewarding exploration promotes those scientific giants who set the groundwork for future
breakthroughs. Second, and just as importantly, such a policy would reward fruitful
scientific failures. Of course, this is valuable because, at the time of exploration, there is



                                                                                                 17
often considerable uncertainty about whether a particular idea is a good one. It is only by
trying out the idea that we gain knowledge about which new ideas are the best new ideas.
Without rewards for work on ideas that fail, such an exploration of new ideas is too risky
for most scientists to undertake.
       It is natural to ask which scientist played in retrospect the most important role in
the development of a mature and successful scientific idea. There are several plausible
candidates, including the scientist who first conceived the idea, the cohort of scientists who
played with the idea during its exploration phase, and the scientists who published the
most prominent papers during the breakthrough phase. In our view, there is no need to
decide who was most important since they were all important.
       Crucially, though, in today’s science, those who work on the idea during the
breakthrough phase will reap the lion’s share of the rewards since they are the ones
publishing the papers that generate the most citations. Yet their work would have been
impossible without the edge science done by scientists during the exploration phase, work
that is unlikely to be measured as high impact since it generally does not garner a
substantial number of citations.
       Furthermore, even work pursued during the incremental advance phase often
receives far more citations than comparable work done on the idea during the exploration
phase. As a consequence, scientists who work on an important idea after it has matured to
the incremental advance phase are usually considerably better rewarded than scientists
who worked on the idea during its exploration phase (not to mention scientists who
explored ideas that failed). As the idea matures, the relative certainty of making
discoveries—however incremental—attracts more and more scientists to the area. As a
result, while the scientific impact of work on mature ideas is not necessarily any greater
than the scientific impact of work during the exploration phase, there are often many times
more scientists working on the idea during the mature phase than during the exploration
phase. Because so many are working on the idea, the work will tend to receive many
citations, which will attract even more scientists. This cycle leads to an amplified
divergence between citations and scientific impact. Thus, the incentive to continue working



                                                                                              18
on the idea is considerable long after the additional value of contributions on it has greatly
diminished.
       The model thus helps bring to focus a key disconnect: while rewarding exploratory
phase science is important for scientific progress, the current practice in science evaluation
favors breakthrough and incremental science over exploration. Furthermore, as citation
measurement is a valuable tool for rewarding scientists who work during the breakthrough
phase, the main issue with citation-based evaluation is that citation counts do not
distinguish between early, exploratory, work on an idea and later, incremental, work on an
idea. The reliance on citation counts tends to encourage incremental science at the expense
of the exploration of new ideas.
       The model also points to how we could increase the incentive to pursue exploration.
If we can construct a metric that identifies which scientific contributions represent edge
science, we could use that metric to reward scientists who direct their time and effort to
the trying out of new ideas. Before discussing how edge science contributions can be
identified in practice (section 7), we next discuss in more detail the rise of citations and its
impact on science.



5. As Citations Became Prominent, Science Became More
Conservative


Evaluating scientific contributions and scientists was not the original purpose of citation
indices. Instead, they were first built to help scientists process the rapidly growing
scientific literature. But soon after their introduction, scientific administrators and funders
noticed that these indices could also be used to identify influential scientific contributions,
influential journals, and influential scientists. A natural consequence of this development
was that citations quickly gained a prominent role in determining rewards in science.
       Ironically, Eugene Garfield—the scientist primarily responsible for developing the
idea of using citations as a measure of scientific productivity in the 1950s—had



                                                                                              19
considerable reservations about their use to evaluate scientific productivity. His obituary,
published in ​Nature​, reported that:

        “Garfield came to see the impact factor as a mixed blessing, ‘like nuclear
        energy.’ Although he felt that citation indexing and the impact factor could be
        remedies for the limitations of peer review, he was uncomfortable with their
        misuse as performance indicators.”18


        The citation revolution started to gather steam in the 1970s. Scientists, university
administrators, and funding agencies increasingly focused their attention on citations. In
1983, Eugene Garfield noted how commonplace citation analysis had become in research
assessment, and emphasized that he had not advocated using citation analyses in
evaluating individual scientists. At that point, he felt obliged to give guidance to
administrators on how to use citations responsibly in tenure and promotion decisions.
Observing the popularity of citation metrics in research evaluation, later
commentators—usually focusing on the misuse of journal impact factors rather than
citations in general—have often raised the issues in starker terms, even characterizing the
situation as “tyranny”, “mania” and “obsession”.19
        As citations gained prominence in research evaluation, this tilted incentives in favor
of incremental science at the expense of more innovative science.20 Increased competition
for resources has further exacerbated these distortions.21 It is thus not surprising that
science has become more conservative in the decades that span the citation revolution:
quantitative evidence from biomedicine shows that scientists are now less likely to try out
new ideas in their work. For instance, University of Chicago biologist Andrey Rzhetsky and
his colleagues, writing in the ​Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences​ report that

18
   ​For the obituary, see Wouters (2017). Garfield (1955, 1972) was tenacious with developing and
disseminating citation metrics but was not the first to introduce the idea of using citations to rank papers and
journals, as the idea had been previously explored by Gross and Gross (1927) and Fussler (1949).
19
    ​See e.g. Seglen (1997), Lawrence (2003, 2007), Calquhoun (2003), Alberts (2013), Scheckman and
Patterson (2013) and Berenbaum (2019).
20
     ​The recent decade has seen many attempts at alleviating these distortions (see footnote 26).
21
      ​On increased competition in science, see e.g. Edwards and Roy (2017) who argue that in the last 50 years
incentives in science have changed dramatically for the worse as a result of increased competition and
emphasis on quantitative metrics. In contrast with our analysis, they do not explicitly tie these developments
to novelty of research and stagnation in scientific progress.


                                                                                                             20
“the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine...
generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around
important molecules. These choices [have] become more conservative over time.”22
Another paper in the ​American Sociological Review ​by the same team (led this time by UCLA
sociologist Jacob Foster) reports even more bluntly that:

        “High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on
        established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve
        high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not
        compensate for the risk of failing to publish.”23


        In recent decades the largest scientific funding agency, the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), has also become less likely to support novel work despite its best efforts to
the contrary.24 The NIH’s failure to foster more innovative science in biomedicine is not
surprising. Its own funding structures appear to stifle scientific creativity both in terms of
novelty and impact.25 Furthermore, beyond NIH’s control, impact factors still dominate the
assessment of scientific contributions in hiring, promotion, and salary decisions. And while
the NIH strives to evaluate the innovativeness of research proposals separately, it too
currently lacks access to metrics to evaluate the innovativeness of researchers’ existing
contributions and is thus forced to rely largely on impact factors and citation counts in any
quantitative evaluation of scientists or grant programs.
        Given the changes in incentives toward more conservative science, these
developments are not surprising. ​Without proper incentives to explore and build on new
ideas, we should not expect scientists to try to unlock their mysteries to the same extent
that they once did. Moreover, given the decline in exploration and how ideas develop
through sustained exploration by a community of scientists, neither is it ​surprising that
also research productivity in science has decreased (as discussed in the introduction). This
decline is most apparent in areas such as biomedicine, where direct measures of the

23
     ​Foster et al. (2015).
24
   ​On increased conservatism in NIH funded research, see Packalen and Bhattacharya (2018).
25
      ​Azoulay et al. (2011) show that recipients of grants from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute that tolerate
early failure better than NIH grants have higher productivity in terms of novelty and impact.


                                                                                                               21
practical benefits of science are available. It is also not surprising that science no longer
fuels technological innovations at the same robust rate as during earlier eras, as evidenced
by the ongoing slowdowns in productivity growth and economic progress.
       While others have attributed this stagnation to science getting harder due to the
gradual vanishing of valuable secrets and the associated diminishing of research
opportunities, we see this change as an unintended consequence of the citation revolution.
That science no longer produces breakthroughs comparable to those in the (now quite
distant) past is an expected consequence of the shifting of reward structures and research
priorities in science in favoring incremental work.
       Figure 4 conceptually illustrates the shift in the distribution of scientists’ research
priorities away from exploration phase science. Before the citation obsession (left panel), a
healthy proportion of scientists was willing to engage in true exploration and scientific play
with new ideas. Today (right panel), after the shift to the single-minded celebration of
high-impact science, scientists are less willing to engage in true exploration. This shift in
the distribution of scientists’ effort away from exploration and toward incremental science
has been costly; as attention to novel ideas has decreased, science has stagnated.




                                                                                                 22
    Figure 4. The shift in scientists’ effort away from exploration and toward
    incremental science. Before citations came to dominate research evaluation, more
    scientists were willing to engage in risky exploration that laid the groundwork for
    later breakthroughs (left panel). The citation revolution led to a decline in
    exploration in favor of incremental science. The decline in exploration eventually
    also decreased opportunities for breakthrough science (right panel).



6. Academic Search Engines Solidify the Citation Obsession


Today, the fixation with scientific impact, as measured by citations, is on full display on all
popular academic search engines such as Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Web of
Science. While these services provide a valuable function in that they help researchers
identify related works, at the same time, they reduce the value of each scientific
contribution to only the citations it has received, and they reduce the worth of each
scientist to an index that captures how many citations the scientist’s works have generated
to date. In Google Scholar, for example, the default view for each scientist shows how many
citations the scientist’s papers have received (summarized by the total citation count and
the h-index) and lists the scientist’s papers in a descending order based on the number of
citations to them. The alternative view panel, which can be seen by the press of a button,
lists the scientist’s most recent research papers first. By contrast, information on what kind
of science each paper represents—whether the research is exploratory or whether it
advances well-established ideas—is not readily available. Nor does Google Scholar show a
measure of a scientist’s proclivity to engage in the exploration of new ideas.
       By presenting information only on scientific influence, popular academic search
engines Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, as well as their new
competitors such as Dimensions and Semantic Scholar, tilt scientists’ incentives toward
incremental science. Rather than helping scientists “stand on the shoulders of giants”
(which is Google Scholar’s motto) or promoting science conducted by exploratory phase
giants, these services in their current form end up diminishing the exploration upon which
groundbreaking discoveries build. The decreased incentive to explore shifts scientists
toward incremental work, which in turn causes breakthroughs to become rarer. Thus,


                                                                                              23
while the stated purpose of academic search engines is to accelerate scientific discovery,
these services in their current form run the risk of hindering scientific progress.
        Because citation-focused approaches distort scientist incentives in this way, simply
counting papers rather than citations might lead to a more innovative scientific ecosystem.
However, simply counting papers creates its own distortions in incentives by rewarding
volume alone and not quality. In any case, given the widespread and easy availability of
citation-based metrics and their correlation with scientific impact and contribution quality,
it is unlikely that the scientific community would accept a return to a volume-based
measure alone.
        More exploration could be encouraged by measuring it directly. Since scientists and
scientific administrators pay attention to the metrics presented at these sites, if academic
search engines were to include paper-level measures that capture whether a contribution
represents work that tries out new ideas and scientist-level assessments that capture to
what extent each scientist engages in exploration versus incremental science, scientist
incentives to pursue innovative research directions would increase.
        Our analysis of the state of affairs in science is different from the argument the key
distortions in scientist incentives stem from either excessive reliance on metrics or from
the focus on journal-level rather than article-level citation counts.26 As we have emphasized
repeatedly, in our view measuring scientific influence is useful. It is only the focus on
influence alone that ultimately leads to stagnant science. The alternative approach is to
evaluate scientific contributions and scientists on multiple dimensions, including volume,
impact, ​and novelty​. This approach would be more balanced than the present situation,
because the kind of science a scientist pursues is as important as how influential or prolific
the scientist is. Curiously, as it currently stands, even baseball players are evaluated on
many more dimensions than scientists. Yet this comparison is useful for just as



26
  ​See e.g. Cagan et al. (2013), Hicks et al. (2015) and Hutchins et al (2016). As we discuss in the concluding
section, attempts to move away from the quantification of scientific contributions are likely to be unfruitful.
We also suspect that a shift toward emphasizing article-level measures of impact even more than today would
have adverse effects in terms of novelty of science—unless we start measuring also article-level novelty—as
researchers who are successful in publishing novel but less cited work in high-impact journals would then
receive less credit for their work than they currently do.


                                                                                                            24
sabermetrics serves a useful purpose in baseball, so can a broad enough suite of measures
of scientific production help guide scientists, university administrators, and funding
agencies.



7. Measuring Exploration in Science


While others have suggested that economic and scientific stagnation is an inevitable
consequence of diminished scientific opportunities, our message is a constructive one. We
believe that a decline in scientists’ incentives to pursue exploratory phase science drives
stagnation. If that is right, then rewarding scientific novelty in addition to influence can
reignite science. Because scientists, like all people, respond to incentives, increasing
rewards for novel work will induce scientists once again to pursue exploratory phase
research directions more often. Of course, to reward scientific novelty, we must first
measure it.
       Measuring any aspect of scientific activity is not a simple task. For example, it is
well-known that citations are an imperfect and noisy way to measure scientific influence,
and yet, citations are a useful measure of scientific influence. Accurately measuring the
scientific novelty of a contribution is similarly difficult. Recent advances, though, have
rendered the measurement of scientific novelty no more difficult or flawed than the
measurement of scientific influence.
       Our preferred approach to measuring scientific novelty is based on a textual
analysis of research publications. The underlying premise of this approach is three-fold.
First, each scientific contribution builds on and advances many ideas. By using an idea and
further elaborating on it, scientific work advances our understanding of the idea. Second,
the text of a scientific contribution reveals many of the important ideas that the work
builds upon and advances. Third, new ideas in science often manifest themselves as new
words and word sequences.
       Combining these premises, we arrive at the following idea: by indexing the words
and word sequences that appear in each scientific paper, we can construct first a list of the


                                                                                               25
ideas that each scientific contribution builds upon and advances. The vintage of each idea
can then be determined based on how long ago the idea first appeared in the literature.
Having determined the ideas that appear in each paper and the vintage of each idea, we can
then identify which research papers try out and advance relatively new ideas.
Contributions that build on relatively recent ideas represent novel science, whereas
contributions that only build on well-established ideas represent more conventional
science. In our prior published research work, we have implemented this idea to measure
scientific novelty.27
           Thus, a simple approach already exists for identifying ideas used by scientists and
the vintage of those ideas, an approach that allows us to distinguish which papers
represent edge science and which do not. Paper-level measures of novelty can then be used
to calculate, for example, scientist-level and journal-level tendencies to pursue and
promote novel science. Calculating such “edge factors” that capture the average tendency to
use novel ideas is analogous to calculating “impact factors” that capture the average
tendency to publish influential research papers and which today is commonly used to
evaluate scientists, scientific journals, and research institutions.
           While the impact factor and edge factors measures are related, they capture two
distinct aspects of science. Conceptually, Figure 5 illustrates this point. Impact factors are
useful for rewarding work done during the breakthrough phase and during the early part
of the incremental advance phase. Impact factors, however, cannot be used to encourage
more exploration in science. Edge factors, by contrast, are useful for rewarding work done
during the exploration phase. It is thus necessary to have both measures at hand to provide
scientists incentives that properly balance the rewards that accrue to those who engage in
an exploration of new ideas in their work and the rewards that accrue to those who pursue
work that builds on more mature ideas.

     See, for instance, Packalen and Bhattacharya (2011, 2012, 2015a, 2015b, 2017, 2018, 2019).


                                                                                                  26
    Figure 5. The impact factor and the edge factor capture distinct aspects of science.
    The impact factor (citation counts) identifies contributions, journals, and scientists
    that had a large influence on the scientific community. The edge factor identifies
    contributions, journals, and scientists that explore and develop new ideas,
    contributions that tend to receive fewer citations but are novel and upon which
    breakthroughs are built. Rewarding also scientific novelty as opposed to only
    scientific influence could encourage more scientists to again engage in risky
    exploration, resulting in healthier science.



       Figure 6 illustrates a further fundamental difference between impact and edge
factors. While impact factors are mainly useful for rewarding high-impact work on
successful ideas, edge factors are useful for rewarding early exploratory work both on




                                                                                             27
successful ideas (ideas A and B) and on ideas that ultimately fail (ideas C and D).




    Figure 6. The impact factor and the edge factor for four ideas. The impact factor
    (citation counts at journal-, scientist-, or article-level) rewards only high-impact
    work on ideas that succeed. The edge factor rewards early exploratory work on
    successful ideas (A and B) and on ideas that ultimately fail (C and D). Increasing the
    tolerance for failure is one key rationale for measuring and rewarding scientific
    novelty separately from scientific impact.


       This ability to increase scientists’ tolerance for failure is one key objective of
measuring and rewarding explorative work on new ideas. Of course, no scientist will
purposefully choose to explore an idea that she deems more likely to fail than other
available new ideas. The human capital accumulated during explorative work on an idea is
more useful for the scientist if the idea is successful. A scientist who embarks on
exploratory work thus has an incentive to select the new idea she believes is the most likely
to work.




                                                                                             28
       Empirically, measures of novelty are correlated with but distinct from measures of
scientific influence. We next illustrate this with data on biomedical research papers. In this
analysis, we rely on an analysis of the textual content of every published biomedical
research paper indexed in the comprehensive PubMed database. Using the method we
describe above, we identify every idea input employed in each paper, and then we
determine the vintage of each idea. Using this information, we determine the novelty of the
idea inputs for every published peer-reviewed paper in PubMed. We then rank papers by
the novelty of their idea inputs. We designate papers that contain newer ideas at the time
of publication (within the top 20% of idea vintage recency) as relying on particularly novel
ideas and construct an indicator variable of novelty on this paper. We also observe the
number of citations each paper received since publication through 2015, which is a
measure of the scientific influence of each paper. We then rank papers by their received
citation counts and determine the citation percentile of each paper. Finally, we calculate for
each citation percentile group what share of papers are novel and what share of papers
build on more mature ideas.
       Figure 7 depicts the resulting empirical link between citations and novelty. In this
figure, the horizontal axis captures the citation percentile, where we group papers to
twenty groups that range from the bottom 5% least cited to the top 5% most cited. The
vertical axis in turn captures the novelty status of each research paper. The figure
illustrates that while novelty rank (edge science) and the citation count rank (scientific
influence) are positively correlated, the two measures are distinct. Research evaluation
that focuses on scientific influence will mainly reward papers in region 1 as these papers
receive the bulk of citations. By contrast, research evaluation that measures and also
rewards novelty will also reward papers in region 2, which includes novel, high-impact
papers as well as novel, low-impact papers.




                                                                                              29
    Figure 7. Empirical link between a measure of novelty and a measure of scientific
    influence. The horizontal axis captures the citation percentile of a research paper.
    The vertical axis captures whether a research paper is in the top 20% in terms of
    novelty of idea inputs. We calculate novelty status and citation percentile for
    191,354 biomedical papers published in 2001 (PubMed/Web of Science data).


       Novelty and scientific influence are empirically distinct for two reasons. First,
science that builds on mature ideas does sometimes lead to high-impact contributions,
even breakthroughs. This fact underlines the point that incremental science is not useless.
The danger with incremental science is not that it serves no purpose; rather, the danger
with incremental science is that there is too much of it, that not enough attention is given to
new ideas when incentives are tilted too much in favor of incremental science. Second,
novel science is not synonymous with breakthrough science. On the contrary, it often leads
to failure. This failure comes in many forms, including a lack of publishable work. Even
when work on a novel idea results in a publication, other scientists often do not find the



                                                                                             30
idea worthy of pursuit. Alternatively, the idea may not yet be mature enough to have much
scientific influence.
         Research evaluation that measures and rewards edge science thus increases the
incentive to pursue work that results in both potential breakthrough successes and
unproductive failures. While rewarding edge science will increase the tolerance for these
types of failures in science, it does not mean fetishizing failure. Such incentives will not
induce scientists to try out new ideas that they know will certainly fail. As long as research
evaluation also rewards scientific impact, the incentive to pursue early work on ultimately
successful ideas will still be considerably higher than the incentive to pursue early work on
ideas that fail merely for the sake of trying something new. Relative to the status quo,
scientists will have a greater incentive to work on those new ideas that they perceive to
have the best chance of ultimately leading to transformative discoveries.
         As with citation-based measures of scientific influence, the text-based measures of
novelty too can have unintended consequences. For example, scientists and journals may
be tempted merely to mention new ideas rather than actually incorporate them into their
work. For most individuals and journals, the potential reputational costs from writing and
publishing frivolously should prevent this sort of gaming. Moreover, future researchers will
develop algorithms to detect such behavior, as will new, more robust versions of the edge
science measure. These developments will mirror the proliferation of various
citation-based indices that have improved on the initial impact measures introduced years
ago.28
         Synonyms can also pose a potential threat to the measurement scheme we propose
since this approach treats every unique word or phrase in the text of scientific publications
as representing a unique idea. The simple approach we outline above then will work fine as
long as two distinct words or phrases never mean the same thing, but we know from
common English that that is not the case, and the same holds for scientific and technical
vocabularies. In biomedicine, for example, synonyms abound as can be seen from medical


28
  Recent work aimed at improving citation-based measures of scientific influence include Valenzuela et al.
(2015), Catalini et al. (2015) and Gerow et al. (2018). That citations are yet a very flawed measure of
knowledge flows extends to patent citations, as demonstrated by Arora et al. (2018).


                                                                                                             31
vocabularies, and they certainly have the potential to cause problems for using text to
identify edge science.
       Fortunately, however, there is a simple solution to this problem, namely the medical
thesaurus itself. In particular, the National Library of Medicine in the U.S. compiles a
particularly comprehensive medical dictionary that maps millions of biomedical terms
together based on whether they refer to the same concept. This metathesaurus, called the
Unified Medical Language System (“UMLS”), is collated by professional medical librarians
and other experts who scour and combine other medical vocabularies to identify new
concepts and place them in their proper place. In our past work, for example, we have
taken advantage of this incredible project to inoculate our edge science measure against
the problems caused by synonyms. A further advantage is that, since they link each concept
to a concept category, the UMLS thesaurus allows us to categorize each idea in each paper
based on the new ideas they represent. The UMLS, for instance, enables us to identify
papers that explore and develop a recently discovered gene and papers that use a recently
introduced research tool.
       Thus, one approach for handling synonyms is developing and utilizing large-scale
controlled vocabularies. Another option for handling synonyms involves applying recently
developed machine learning methods. These methods embed each word and phrase into a
vector space, in which “distance” between words and phrases can be measured based upon
how often two words or phrases appear near each other in the published literature. To the
extent that synonyms are interchangeable, their vector space positions will be nearly
identical. The distance of any two words or phrases in the vector space can thus be used to
determine which terms are nearly synonymous with one another.
       Furthermore, there are fewer synonyms for biomedical terms than one might
expect. Indeed, as the purpose of language is communication, it is inefficient to have
multiple words and phrases with the same meaning. This fact limits the number of
synonyms in natural languages, especially after a word has acquired a well-established,
widely used, meaning. Words that represent a scientific idea are thus more likely to change
when the underlying idea is still relatively novel. For example, the acronym CRISPR and the



                                                                                           32
corresponding term were invented in 2002 to unify the terminology used until then. This
terminological unification happened fifteen years after the first papers on CRISPR had been
published and after it had already become an emerging area of investigation, but before its
purpose and potential uses had been discovered, and well before the scientists who are
now predicted to win Nobel Prizes for CRISPR had begun their work on the idea.
        While above we introduced to the reader one particular way of measuring which
papers pursue more explorative research directions, this specific approach is not the main
thrust of our argument. Rather, our main point is that there is a rationale for measuring
also exploration in science and that there already exist ways of doing so.29 Of course, we are
confident that future analysts will develop better ways of measuring edge science. Indeed,
should Google Scholar and other academic search engines start including measures of
exploration on them, there will be a strong incentive to further improve upon these metrics
just as there is now a strong incentive to continuously improve citation-based measures of
scientific influence.



8. Conclusion


An influential essay written by engineer and science administrator Vannevar Bush in 1945
put forward a grand vision for post-war science. A central focus of this vision was the need
to facilitate exploration in science:

         “Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free
         intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated
         by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.”30




29
   Other approaches to measuring novelty include Jones et al. (2008), Azoulay et al. (2011), Kelly et al. (2018),
Iaria et al. (2018), Lee et al. (2015), Wang et al. (2016), Jones and Weinberg (2010), Youn et al. (2015), Uzzi et
al. (2013) and Boudreau et al. (2016). For the Doc2Vec algorithm, see Le and Mikolov (2014). Giorcelli et al.
(2018) utilize a related Word2Vec algorithm to study the flow of new ideas from science to culture. Our own
work on measuring new ideas and novelty include Bhattacharya and Packalen (2011), Packalen and
Bhattacharya (2012, 2015ab, 2017, 2018, 2019) and Packalen (2018).

The impetus for this emphasis was that academic freedom had in many ways been lost
during the war, as scientific endeavors were redirected to support the needs of the military.
This emphasis on scientific play stands in stark contrast with a common refrain about
modern science according to which scientists today have gone too far in terms of following
their own whims in search of the unknown at the expense of work that places more
emphasis on potential practical societal benefits.31
        Our analysis in this paper, however, indicates that the issue with modern science is
more likely the opposite of this common refrain. Scientists now engage in true scientific
exploration much less than once envisioned by Vannevar Bush. The rise of citation metrics
to prominence in research evaluation shifted scientists’ incentives away from the
exploration of new ideas and toward incremental science. Because scientists are like
everyone else in that they respond to incentives, this shift induced scientists to increasingly
pursue research that closely follows well-established research paths and generates only
incremental advances, at the expense of the kind of exploration emphasized by Bush. The
decreased attention to exploring and nurturing new ideas has meant that fewer new ideas
have had the opportunity to be developed into breakthroughs, resulting in more stagnant
science.32
        Broadly, we see three potential paths forward for science. Along the first path,
science continues on the current citation-focused path that heavily favors incremental
work over true exploration. Choosing this route means accepting diminished hopes for the
future of scientific and technological progress.
        Along the second path, we stop measuring scientific impact. To us, this path seems
infeasible; it stretches credulity that in today’s era of relentless quantification, scientists
could successfully insist that anything but their own activities can be usefully measured.
Moreover, when used properly, quantified measures of research productivity—including



31
  On science as an ivory tower in this sense, see Sarewitz (2016).
32
  To the extent that it was the citation revolution that led to the decline of free play in science and thus to the
betrayal of Vannevar Bush’s grand vision, this development is somewhat ironic since another Vannevar Bush
essay—written that same year—inspired the birth of citation indices. For this essay, see Bush (1945b). For
how the essay influenced the development of citation metrics, see Brynko (2007) and Tutterow and Evans
(2016).


                                                                                                                34
citations—can serve a useful purpose in efficiently allocating limited research dollars. The
issue with using citations and with measuring scientific impact, in general, is not that
impact is unimportant. Rather, the issue is that scientific impact has gradually become the
only dimension on which scientific research and scientists are evaluated.
       The third possible path forward could put science back on the path envisioned by
Vannevar Bush by broadening how scientific productivity is measured and evaluated. On
this path, in addition to scientific impact, we start measuring and evaluating research based
on what kind of science it represents—whether the work is novel in that it tries out new
ideas or more conventional in that it seeks to advance well-established ideas.
       Academic search engines like Google Scholar could end their exclusive focus on
citations and scientific influence when summarizing the contributions of scientists,
journals, and academic institutions, and calculate and report also measures that capture
the novelty of scientific papers. This change can be implemented relatively quickly. As we
explained in the previous section, measuring novelty is no more difficult or flawed than is
measuring scientific impact. University administrators and funding agencies could also
shift reward structures toward a model in which rewards depend on both the number
citations and on the extent to which the work represents true scientific exploration of the
unknown. Journal editors might also start offering more space for novel contributions as
they too will no longer compete only on the scientific influence of the papers that they
publish.
       Together, changes like these could enable scientists to pursue exploration of the
unknown without fear of penalty. First, the changes in incentives would encourage some
current scientists to change their research focus toward more exploration. Second, the
changes would encourage some adventurous people, who now choose to stay out of
academia for fear that true exploration is no longer appreciated in science, to become
scientists in the first place. Third, by encouraging and rewarding exploration, changes like
these could increase the tolerance for failure and make it considerably easier to establish
new scientific communities that explore and develop new areas of investigation. The birth
of such communities, and the debate and scientific play that they facilitate, is a key



                                                                                              35
component of a fruitful scientific enterprise. However, because new areas of investigation
are usually small in terms of the number of scientists working in them, the current practice
of research evaluation that focuses on scientific impact alone severely punishes scientists
working in communities focused on new ideas.
       Measuring and evaluating science and scientists in a more balanced way than is
currently done does not involve allocating any more funds for science but it could
jumpstart a new era of true exploration in science and this exploration would serve as a
springboard for new scientific breakthroughs. This could have the follow-on consequence
of reversing the longstanding slowdown in productivity growth, which many believe has
been driven in part by the scientific stagnation. However, we do not want to overpromise;
we, of course, do not know what kind of breakthroughs we will get from this different,
novelty-driven science; they might not come with practical benefits that would also reignite
economic growth. We are certain however that, since people respond to incentives,
rewarding scientific novelty as well as scientific impact will ultimately alter the behavior of
scientists to focus more on exploratory phase science and ultimately reignite science.
