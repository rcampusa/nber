Credit Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations in an Economy with Production Heterogeneity

                                               ABSTRACT

We study the cyclical implications of credit market imperfections in a calibrated dynamic, stochastic
general equilibrium model wherein firms face persistent shocks to aggregate and individual productivity.
In our model economy, optimal capital reallocation is distorted by two frictions: collateralized borrowing
and partial capital irreversibility yielding (S,s) firm-level investment policies.

In the presence of persistent heterogeneity in capital, debt and total factor productivity, the effects
of a financial shock are amplified and propagated through large and long-lived disruptions to the distribution
of capital that, in turn, imply large and persistent reductions in aggregate total factor productivity.
We find that an unanticipated tightening in borrowing conditions can, on its own, generate a large
recession far more persistent than the financial shock itself. This recession, and the subsequent recovery,
is distinguished both quantitatively and qualitatively from that driven by exogenous shocks to total
factor productivity.

1        Introduction

          Can a large shock to an economy’s financial sector produce a large and lasting recession?
Can it amplify and propagate the eﬀects of a real shock suﬃciently to transform recession into
depression? Over the past few years, events in the real and financial sectors of the U.S. and
other large, developed economies have been diﬃcult to disentangle. If these conditions have
reawakened interest in business cycle research, they have also raised concerns about our existing
macroeconomic models’ ability to address such topics.
        In this paper, we develop a quantitative, dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium model to
explore how real and financial shocks interact in determining the size and frequency of aggregate
fluctuations. In our model, firms experience persistent shocks to both aggregate and individual
productivity, while credit market frictions interact with real frictions to yield persistent disruptions
to the eﬃcient allocation of capital across them, and thus persistent reductions in endogenous
aggregate productivity. Calibrating our model to aggregate and firm-level data, we use it as a
laboratory in which to obtain answers to the questions raised above.
        Considering the matter from the perspective of a representative agent model, one might expect
that the reductions in aggregate capital implied by a temporary tightening in credit markets could
not yield sizeable or long-lived real aggregate eﬀects, since investment is a small fraction of GDP.
However, disaggregated data reveals that there is substantial heterogeneity across firms in their
individual productivity levels, and that there are real frictions limiting the reallocation of capital
across them.1 Indeed, these elements are essential to understanding microeconomic investment
patterns. In light of the first fact, a reduction in credit may sharply reduce aggregate total factor
productivity by distorting the allocation of production away from the eﬃcient one, placing too
little capital in a subset of firms with relatively high productivities.2 To the extent that real
frictions slow the reversal of such an allocative disruption, the second fact compounds the first,
propagating shocks to the provision of credit.
        As mentioned above, capital reallocation is distorted by two frictions in our model, one finan-

(2005) and the empirical studies cited therein. Elsewhere, Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) find it is impossible to
reproduce microeconomic investment patterns without both large idiosyncratic shocks and adjustment costs limiting
capital reallocation.

     Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) show that this endogenous TFP eﬀect is an important component in explaining
cross-country per-capita GDP diﬀerences.

cial and one real. First, collateralized borrowing constraints limit the investment undertaken by
small firms. Second, specificity in capital implies partial investment irreversibilities that lead firms
to pursue (S,s) rules with respect to their capital adjustments. The second friction further tilts
the distribution of production towards larger firms, further reducing endogenous aggregate total
factor productivity. This added element of realism in our setting relative to existing DSGE finan-
cial frictions models may be quite important to the transmission and propagation of a financial
shock, as we discuss below.
   The inclusion of the real friction hindering capital reallocation makes our model diﬃcult to
solve and analyze, in that it implies a distribution of firms distinguished by three individual
state variables: productivity, debt and capital. While it would be more convenient to omit the
partial irreversibility of investment and track firms entirely by their productivity and net worth,
we see its presence as essential to the proper calibration of the model along the dimensions that
matter most. Capital reallocation is at the heart of what is new in our model’s mechanics. As
such, it is important that we ensure reasonable agreement there between our model economy and
microeconomic evidence from the actual economy it is intended to emulate.
   The extent to which changes in the availability of credit disrupt real economic activity depends
upon the amount of capital reallocation that would otherwise occur. Alternatively, the response
to a credit shock hinges on the initial shape of the cross-sectional distribution of firms, as well as
its elasticity with respect to the shock. Both aspects of our model are crucially aﬀected by the
volatility and persistence of firm-level productivity shocks. As such, these parameters must be
chosen to ensure that the reallocation it predicts in a typical data is plausible relative to what we
see in the data. We measure our model’s fit in this respect using observations on establishment
investment rates drawn from U.S. data. Certainly, the idiosyncratic productivity parameters can
be selected so that the model reproduces the mean and standard deviation of establishment-level
investment rates. However, unless we include some real friction inhibiting reallocation alongside
our calibrated financial friction, no plausible idiosyncratic productivity process can overcome our
model’s counterfactual tendency for negative serial correlation in firms’ investment rates. Thus,
we introduce a partial irreversibility in investment and calibrate this jointly with the firm-level
productivity process to ensure the microeconomic predictions of our model regarding capital
reallocation are sensible before turning to its predictions regarding macroeconomic time series.
   When calibrated to the microeconomic evidence on capital reallocation, our model gives rise to



                                                   2
a rich distribution. Within this distribution, a subset of firms have investment curtailed by their
current ability to borrow, while a second subset have suﬃcient resources as to have permanently
outgrown the implications of collateral constraints. Most firms fall into a third class, one where
borrowing constraints do not currently bind, but the prospect that they may bind in future
aﬀects current decisions. In the aggregate, revenues net of labor costs exceed total investment.
Thus, our model is consistent with evidence from the U.S. Flow of Funds that the average firm
can has suﬃcient funds to internally finance investment. Nonetheless, because individual firms
have diﬀering credit needs and access, a change in financial conditions can aﬀect the level of real
economic activity.
   Our primary question in this study is whether a temporary crisis in financial markets can
generate a large and persistent drop in aggregate productivity by disrupting the distribution
of capital further from that implied by firms’ relative productivities, thereby further distorting
the distribution of production. We are to our knowledge the first to explore this endogenous
TFP channel in a quantitative DSGE setting where real frictions slow the reallocation of capital
across firms, and where that reallocation is essential in determining the marginal product of
the aggregate stock.   In keeping with previous results in the literature, we find that aggregate
responses to real shocks are largely unaﬀected by the presence of financial frictions.      However,
changes in the distribution of capital can have large and long-lived eﬀects in our model economy.
Because there are substantial and protracted changes in this distribution when individual firms
encounter unexpectedly tight collateralized borrowing limits, and because these changes in turn
imply persistent reductions in aggregate productivity, we find that an unanticipated disruption
to the availability of credit can, on its own, generate a large and protracted recession.
   We also find that the response to a credit shock is qualitatively diﬀerent from that following a
real shock, both at its impact and in the recovery episode. Unlike the response to a productivity
shock, the greatest declines in output, employment and investment do not occur at the onset
of a credit crisis, and consumption does not fall immediately. Moreover, once credit conditions
return to normal, our model predicts the subsequent recovery will be slow, and it will be led by
employment and business fixed investment, rather than household consumption spending.
   Given the widely-held view that crises in financial markets had a large role in the most recent
U.S. recession, we are led to compare the changes in our model following a credit shock to those
observed in the data after 2007Q4.     Ohanian (2009) has argued that, in comparison to other



                                                 3
episodes over the postwar period, this recession is particularly diﬃcult to explain using a standard
equilibrium business cycle model driven by exogenous shocks to total factor productivity. When
driven by such shocks, our own model behaves similarly to that standard representative firm
model.   As such, when we introduce TFP shocks suﬃcient to generate the observed decline in
GDP, we find that the resulting declines in employment, investment, and lending are far weaker
than those in the data. Moreover, the changes in TFP required to generate the empirical decline
in total production are sharply overstated relative to the observed changes in measured TFP.
   When we instead consider a temporary shock aﬀecting individual firms’ access to credit in our
model, we find the aggregate changes it predicts resemble those from the 2007 U.S. recession in
several respects. It delivers a gradual deterioration of GDP, an initial rise in consumption, and
an unusually steep decline in investment. It also succeeds in capturing the magnitudes of decline
in GDP and investment, and it generates equilibrium reductions in total lending consistent with
several measures from the aggregate data. Further, our credit shock leads to shifts in the distri-
bution of production across firms that produce endogenous changes in total factor productivity
consistent with those measured from the aggregate data. Tighter borrowing limits worsen the
allocation of capital and increase the dispersion in the returns to investment. This is consistent
with the finding of Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006) that the benefits to capital reallocation rise in
recessions.
   We argue that our analytical framework captures real and financial frictions that are vital in
explaining actual microeconomic reallocation and that thus have the potential to shape macro-
economic outcomes.     As such, our findings here are suggestive that changes in firms’ access to
credit are important in understanding the recent US recession.      With this said, we would not
suggest that our model explains the recent U.S. recession. Our recession is generated by an unan-
ticipated one-time tightening of collateral constraints that persists for several periods, while the
recovery that follows is initiated by the instantaneous return of lending conditions to normal.
This simple exercise cannot, in itself, explain the U.S. recovery that began in the second half of
2009. Most notably, while its GDP recovery is gradual, even more so than in the data, the model
cannot simultaneously account for the growth in consumption alongside much weaker growth in
employment and investment.
   The solution method we use to derive competitive equilibrium in our model may be of inde-
pendent interest. As noted above, firms diﬀer in their total factor productivity, capital and debt,



                                                 4
and the partial irreversibility of investment implies that firms’ net worth is insuﬃcient to describe
the endogenous component of their individual state. Beyond this, our collateral constraints and
our investment irreversibility together lead to nonlinear firm-level decision rules that preclude a
solution based on linear approximation.
    To solve for dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, with firms’ decision rules evolving in
response to firm-specific shocks, their existing capital and debt, and the aggregate state of the
economy, we use nonlinear methods, alongside aggregate state space approximation.             Beyond
these elements, our solution method relies on identifying a set of firms that have accumulated
suﬃcient real and/or financial assets such that collateralized borrowing limits will never again
aﬀect their choice of capital. We characterize the behavior of these firms, including both their
physical investment in capital and their savings in financial assets. This provides the starting
point to solve for the decision rules of all other firms in the economy.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the literature
most closely related to our work. Next, in section 3, we present our model economy. Section 4
provides some analysis useful in developing a numerical algorithm capable of its solution. In
section 5, we describe our calibration to moments drawn from postwar U.S. aggregate and firm-
level data and also explain our numerical approach. Section 6 presents results. There, we begin by
exploring the mechanics of our model in its deterministic steady state. Next we consider business
cycles in our model driven by shocks to the exogenous component of total factor productivity,
contrasting the results to those obtained from a reference model without financial frictions as well
as a frictionless benchmark with neither real nor financial frictions. Thereafter, we explore the
eﬀects of a credit shock. Finally, section 7 concludes.


2    Related literature

     Until recently, there has been little quantitative research examining the channels through
which changes in the availability of credit influence macroeconomic series like business investment,
employment and production in well-articulated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium settings.
There is a large related literature exploring how financial frictions influence the aggregate response
to non-financial shocks. Leading this literature, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) develop a model
of credit cycles and show that collateral constraints can have a large role in amplifying and




                                                  5
propagating shocks to the value of collateral.3 Our own work follows in the spirit of Kiyotaki
and Moore in that the financial frictions we explore are collateralized borrowing constraints. We
adopt this approach in part because collateral appears to have an important role in loan contracts
and in part for computational tractability in our heterogeneous firm DSGE setting.
       While we assume that firms face collateral constraints, there are well-known alternative ap-
proaches. Cooley, Marimon and Quadrini (2004) study constrained-optimal dynamic contracts
under limited enforceability.4 Elsewhere, a large literature examines agency costs as the source of
financial frictions.5 However, these papers do not consider financial shocks as such. Moreover,
they abstract from potentially important heterogeneity across firms under which the allocation of
capital, and thus credit, becomes relevant.
       Over the past few years, several studies have begun exploring how financial shocks aﬀect
aggregate fluctuations. A leading example is Jermann and Quadrini (2010), which examines a
representative firm model wherein investment is financed using both debt and equity, while costs
of adjusting dividends prevent the avoidance of financial frictions. These frictions stem from
limited enforceability of intra-temporal debt contracts, which gives rise to endogenous borrowing
limits. Specifically, the firm retains its working capital under default, but the lender is able to
recover a fraction of the firm’s future value. Shocks to the fraction that the lender can confiscate
alter the severity of borrowing limits. Measuring these credit shocks, Jermann and Quadrini find
that they have been an important source of business cycles.6                 In contrast to the Jermann and
Quadrini model, the financial frictions in our setting do not significantly dampen the response
of the aggregate economy to non-financial shocks. We also introduce a real friction in the form
of capital specificity.7      Because this hinders the reallocation of capital across firms, it leads to
   3
       Cordoba and Ripoll (2004) and Kocherlakota (2000) argue that these eﬀects are quantitatively minor in cali-
brated versions of the model.
   4
     Firm-level dynamics in our model have some similarities to those in models with contrained optimal dynamic
contracts. For example, because our borrowing and investment decisions are inter-related, young firms grow as their
ability to borrow rises and mean growth rates fall with age and size. Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004) derive
these regularities in a model with limited enforceability, while Clementi and Hopenhayn (2006) derive them under
private information. However, in contrast to these papers, our firm-level debt is not contingent.

     Jermann and Quadrini (2009) adapt this model to address the evolving variability of real and financial variables
in the past 25 years. In a related setting, Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2009) study a New Keynesian model
with lending subject to agency costs; they too find that financial shocks are an important source of economic
fluctuations.

a more gradual evolution of our distribution of firms that, in itself, both dampens and protracts
the real eﬀects of credit shocks.
    Our emphasis on firm-level productivity dispersion is shared by Arellano, Bai and Kehoe
(2010), who examine the role of uncertainty shocks in a model with non-contingent debt and
equilibrium default. Gomes and Schmid (2009) also develop a model with endogenous default,
where firms vary with respect to their leverage, and study the implication for credit spreads.8 In
contrast to these papers, we study firm-level capital reallocation and the aggregate response to
credit shocks. We find that credit shocks can generate recessions through reductions in aggregate
TFP that, in turn, have sharp implications for investment and employment. In emphasizing the
endogenous TFP channel, our study is also related to Buera and Shin (2007). They examine the
eﬀect of collateral constraints on economic development and show that these frictions can protract
the transition to the balanced growth path if capital is initially misallocated.


3     Model

      In our model economy, firms face both partial capital fixity and collateralized borrowing lim-
its, which together compound the eﬀects of persistent diﬀerences in their total factor productivities
to yield substantial heterogeneity in production. We begin our description of the economy with
an initial look at the optimization problem facing each firm, then follow with a brief discussion
of households and equilibrium. Next, in section 4, we will use a simple implication of equilibrium
alongside some immediate observations about firms’ optimal allocation of profits across dividends
and retained earnings to characterize the capital adjustment decisions of our firms. This analysis
will show how we derive a convenient, computationally tractable algorithm to solve for equilibrium
allocations in our model, despite its three-dimensional heterogeneity in production.

from his by general equilibrium analysis, partial reversibility in investment, and frictionless within-period borrowing.

       Because our interest is in understanding how financial constraints interact with the specificity
of capital in shaping the investment decisions taken by firms in our economy, we must prevent
firms growing so large that none will never again experience a binding borrowing limit. To ensure
this does not occur, we impose exit and entry in the model. In particular, we assume that each
firm faces a fixed probability,   ∈ (0 1), that it will be forced to exit the economy following
production in any given period. Within a period, prior to investment, firms learn whether they
will survive to produce in the next period. Exiting firms are replaced by an equal number of new
firms whose initial state will be described below.
       At the beginning of each period, a firm is defined by its predetermined stock of capital,
 ∈ K⊂R+ , by the level of one-period debt it incurred in the previous period,  ∈ B⊂R, and by
its current idiosyncratic productivity level,  ∈ {1       }. Immediately thereafter, the firm
learns whether it will survive to produce in the next period.9 Given this individual state, and
having observed the current aggregate state, the firm then takes a series of actions to maximize
the expected discounted value of dividends returned to its shareholders, the households in our
economy. First, it chooses its current level of employment, undertakes production, and pays
its wage bill. Thereafter, it repays its existing debt and, conditional on survival, it chooses its
investment, , current dividends, and the level of debt with which it will enter into the next period,
0 . For each unit of debt it incurs for the next period, a firm receives  units of output that it
can use toward paying current dividends or investing in its future capital. The relative price −1
reflecting the interest rate at which firms can borrow and lend is a function of the economy’s
aggregate state, as is the wage rate  paid to workers. For expositional convenience, we suppress
the arguments of these equilibrium price functions until we have described the model further.
       In contrast to the typical setting with firm-level capital adjustment frictions, and unlike a
   9
       We have adopted this timing to ensure there is no equilibrium default in our model, so that all firms borrow
at a common real interest rate. Because the only firms borrowing are those that will produce in the next period,
and the debt they take on is limited by a collateral constraint, firms are always able to repay their debt in the
quantatitative exercises to follow.

typical environment with financial frictions, real and financial frictions are allowed to interact
in our model economy. Our firms’ borrowing and investment decisions are inter-related, because
each firm faces a collateralized borrowing constraint inside of any period. This constraint takes
the form: 0 ≤   . Two external forces together determine what fraction of its capital stock
a firm can borrow against - the degree of specificity in capital and enforceability of financial
arrangements. Here, we simply impose both, deferring the question of their foundations for a
future study. In particular, we assume that  ∈ [0 1] is a parameter determining what fraction
of a firm’s capital stock survives when it is uninstalled and moved to another firm, and  ∈ R+
is the fraction of that collateral firms can borrow against.10 A financial shock in our model is
represented by an unanticipated change in the collateral term,  .
       If a firm undertakes any nonnegative level of investment, then its capital stock at the start of
the next period is determined by a familiar accumulation equation,

                                             0 = (1 − )  +  for  ≥ 0,

where  ∈ (0 1) is the rate of capital depreciation, and primes indicate one-period-ahead values.
Because there is some degree of specificity in capital, the same equation does not apply when the
firm undertakes negative investment. In this case, the eﬀective relative price of investment is  
rather than 1, so the accumulation equation is instead:

                                          0 =  (1 − )  +  for   0.

       In the analysis section to follow, we will show how the asymmetry that firms face in the cost
of capital adjustment naturally gives rise to two-sided ( ) investment decision rules. Firms
have nonzero investment only when their capital falls outside a range of inactivity.11 In contrast
to a nonconvexity in the capital adjustment technology, this type of adjustment friction implies
not only investment inaction among firms within their ( ) adjustment bands, but also some
inertia among firms outside of their ( ) bands. Because there are no increasing returns in the
adjustment technology, and there is instead a linear penalty for negative adjustments, a firm
finding itself with an unacceptably high capital stock (given its current productivity) will reduce
  10
       Throughout our numerical exercises in section 6, we assume that the degree of capital irreversibility, 1 −  , is
a fixed technological parameter. In ordinary times when aggregate fluctuations arise from changes in productivity
alone,  is also a fixed parameter. However, we allow for an unanticipated change in  when we consider the
aggregate implications of a credit shock in section 6.3.
  11
     The problem of costly investment reversibility was originally solved by Abel and Eberly (1996).


                                                             9
its stock only to the upper bound of its ( ) inactivity range. Similarly, a firm with too little
capital recognizes that it will incur a linear penalty should it later need to shed capital, so it
invests only to the lower bound of its inactivity range.
       It should be clear from the discussion above that, alongside its current productivity, a firm’s
capital adjustment may also be influenced by its ability to borrow (now and in the future). This
is in turn aﬀected by the capital (collateral) it currently holds. Note also that the firm’s current
investment decision may influence the level of debt it carries into the next period. These obser-
vations imply that we must monitor the distinguishing features of firms along three dimensions:
their capital, , their debt, , and their idiosyncratic productivity, . Thus, in contrast to models
with loan market frictions, but without irreversible investment, a firm’s net worth is an insuﬃcient
description of its state; capital and debt are distinct state variables.
       We summarize the distribution of firms over (  ) using the probability measure  defined
on the Borel algebra, S, generated by the open subsets of the product space, S = K × B × E.
The aggregate state of the economy is then described by ( ), and the distribution of firms
evolves over time according to a mapping, Γ, from the current aggregate state; 0 = Γ ( ).
The evolution of the firm distribution is determined in part by the actions of continuing firms
and in part by entry and exit. As already mentioned, fraction   of firms exit the economy
after production in each period. These firms invest negatively to shed their remaining capital,
returning the proceeds to households, and are replaced by the same number of new firms. Each
new firm has zero debt and productivity 0 ∈ E drawn from an initial distribution (0 ), and
each enters with an initial capital stock 0 ∈ K.12
       We now turn to the problem solved by each firm in our economy. Let 0 (   ;   ) repre-
sent the expected discounted value of a firm that enters the period with ( ) and firm-specific
productivity  , when the aggregate state of the economy is (  ), just before it learns whether
it will survive into the next period. We state the firm’s dynamic optimization problem using a
functional equation defined by (1) - (4) below.

                    0 (   ;   ) =   max[   ( ) −  (  )  +  (1 − )  − ]              (1)

                                         + (1 −   ) (   ;   )

       After the start of the period, the firm knows which line of (1) will prevail. If it is not continuing
  12
       We select 0 below so that each entrant’s capital is  fraction of the typical stock held across all firms in the
long-run of our economy.

beyond the period, the firm simply chooses labor to maximize its current dividend payment to
shareholders. Because it will carry no capital or debt into the future, an exiting firm’s dividends
are its output, less wage payments and debt repayment, together with the remaining capital it can
successfully uninstall at the end of the period. The problem conditional on continuation is more
involved, because a continuing firm must choose its current labor and dividends alongside its future
capital and debt. For expositional convenience, given the partial irreversibility in investment, we
begin to describe this problem by defining the firm’s value as the result of a binary choice between
upward versus downward capital adjustment in (2), then proceed to identify the value associated
with each option in (3) and (4).
                                                n                                                 o

   Assume that  (  ) is the discount factor applied by firms to their next-period expected
value if aggregate productivity at that time is  and the current aggregate state is (  ).
Taking as given the evolution of  and  according to the transition probabilities specified above,
and given the evolution of the firm distribution, 0 = Γ ( ), the firm solves the following
two optimization problems to determine its values conditional on (weakly) positive and negative
capital adjustment. In each case, the firm selects its current employment and production, alongside
the debt and capital with which it will enter into next period and its current dividends, , to
maximize its expected discounted dividends. As above, dividends are determined by the firm’s
budget constraint as the residual of its current production and borrowing after its wage bill and
debt repayment have been covered, net of its investment expenditures.
   Conditional on an upward capital adjustment, the firm solves the following problem con-
strained by (i) the fact that investment must be non-negative, (ii) a borrowing limit determined
by its collateral, and (iii)-(iv) the requirements that dividends be non-negative and satisfy the
firm’s budget constraint.

       Notice that there is no friction associated with the firm’s employment choice, since the firm
pays its current wage bill after production takes place, and its capital choice for next period
also has no implications for current production. Thus, irrespective of their current debt or their
continuation into the next period, all firms sharing in common the same ( ) combination select
the same employment, which we will denote by  ( ;  ), and hence have common production,
( ;  ).13 The same cannot be said for the intertemporal decisions of continuing firms, given
the presence of both borrowing limits and irreversibilities. Let  (  ;  ) and  (  ;  )
represent the choices of next-period capital and debt, respectively, made by firms sharing in
common a complete individual type (  ). We will characterize these decision rules below in
section 4.


3.2       Households

        The economy is populated by a unit measure of identical households. Household wealth is
held as one-period shares in firms, which we identify using the measure .14 Given the prices
they receive for their current shares, 0 (  ;  ), and the real wage they receive for their labor
eﬀort,  ( ), households determine their current consumption, , hours worked,  , as well
as the numbers of new shares, 0 ( 0  0  0 ), to purchase at prices 1 ( 0  0  0 ;  ). The lifetime
  13
       Here forward, except where necessary for clarity, we suppress the indices for current aggregate and firm pro-
ductivity,  and , respectively.
  14
     Households also have access to a complete set of state-contingent claims. However, as there is no heterogeneity
across households, these assets are in zero net supply in equilibrium. Thus, for sake of brevity, we do not explicitly
model them here.

We compute equilibrium by solving the firm-level optimization problem with these implications
of household utility maximization imposed, thereby eﬀectively subsuming households’ decisions
into the problems faced by firms.
   Without loss of generality, we assign ( ) as an output price at which firms value cur-
rent dividends and payments and correspondingly assume that firms discount their future values
by the household subjective discount factor. Given this alternative means of expressing firms’
discounting, the following three conditions ensure all markets clear in our economy.

Our reformulation of (1) - (4) below yields an equivalent description of the firm-level problem
where each firm’s value is measured in units of marginal utility, rather than output, with no change
in the resulting decision rules. Suppressing the arguments of the price functions, exploiting the
fact that the choice of  is independent of the  0 and 0 choices, and using the indicator function
J () = {1 if  ≥ 0 ;  if   0} to distinguish the relative price of nonnegative versus negative
investment, we have:

4         Analysis

          The problem listed in equations (9) - (12) forms the basis for solving equilibrium allocations in
our economy, so long as the prices   and  taken as given by our firms satisfy the restrictions in
(6) - (8) above.15 From here, we begin to characterize the decision rules arising from this problem.
Each firm chooses its labor  =  ( ;  ) to solve 2  ( ) = , which immediately returns
its current production,  ( ) =  (  ( ;  )). Let  (  ) represent the earnings of a
firm of type (  ) net of labor costs and debt.

                           (    ) ≡  (  ( ;  )) −  ( ;  ) −                         (13)

         The challenging objects to determine are   0 and 0 for continuing firms. Turning to these,
we will use a simple observation about the implications of borrowing constraints for the value a
firm places on retained earnings versus dividends. If the firm places non-zero probability weight
on encountering a future state in which its borrowing constraint will bind, the shadow value
of retained earnings (which includes the discounted sequence of multipliers on future borrowing
constraints) will necessarily exceed the shadow value of current dividends, .16 This means that
it will set  = 0. In this case, the binding budget constraint from equation 11 establishes that
the firm’s choice of 0 directly implies the level of debt with which it will enter into the next
period. We refer to any such firm as a constrained firm. To be clear, a constrained firm need not
currently face a binding borrowing constraint; our definition includes any firm that can now or
in future encounter a binding constraint. We will return to the problem solved by a constrained
firm below. It is useful to first characterize the decisions of a firm whose capital choices are never
aﬀected by borrowing limits.
    15
         Here, and in many instances below, we suppress the   arguments of price functions, decision rules and
firm-level state vectors to reduce notation.
   16
      This is easily proved using a sequence approach with explicit multipliers on each constraint; see Caggese (2007).



                                                              15
4.1    Decisions among unconstrained firms

      Consider a firm that has accumulated suﬃcient wealth (via   0 or   0) such that
collateral constraints will never again aﬀect its investment activities. In this case, the sequence of
multipliers on all possible future borrowing constraints are zero, and the firm is indiﬀerent between
allocating earnings to savings versus paying dividends. We refer to any such firm as unconstrained.
Importantly, as it is indiﬀerent between savings and paying dividends, an unconstrained firm’s
marginal value of retained earnings is equal to that of households.
   Let 0 represent the beginning-of-period expected value of an unconstrained firm and  its
value if it will continue beyond the current period. These functions are analogous to those defined
for any firm in (1).
                                        h                            i
          0 (   ;   ) =     (   ) +  (1 − )  + (1 −   ) (   ;   ) .   (14)

As in (2), a continuing unconstrained firm has a binary choice involving capital adjustment. Let
  (   ;  ) represent its value it chooses to undertake an upward capital adjustment, and
  (   ;   ) its value conditional on a downward capital adjustment.

                    (   ;   ) = max{  (   ;   )    (   ;   )}           (15)

   An unconstrained firm must never again experience a binding borrowing constraint (in any
conceivable future state). We assign any such indiﬀerent firm a savings policy just ensuring that,
under all possible future paths of ( ), it will have suﬃcient wealth to implement its optimal
investment plan while borrowing more that is permitted by (12).                       Below, we will define this
minimum savings policy. While an unconstrained firm’s minimum savings policy is aﬀected by its
capital choice, its capital choice is independent of its savings or debt, . Thus, before we derive
the savings policy for unconstrained firms, we characterize their capital adjustment.
   By construction, an unconstrained firm has the same marginal valuation of savings as a house-
hold. It then follows from equation 13 that, if such a firm enters a period with any non-zero debt
or savings, , its value is aﬀected only through the change in current earnings. As current earnings
are valued by , we can express the value of a continuing unconstrained firm of type (  ) as
 ( ) − , where  ( ) ≡  ( 0 ). The firm’s beginning-of-period expected value inherits
the same property; 0 (   ;   ) = 0 ( ) − , where 0 ( ) ≡ 0 ( 0 ). Given these

where (13) defines (  ), and 0 = Γ( ).                  In the above,   and   are both strictly
increasing in . This in turn implies that  and 0 are increasing functions of the unconstrained
firm’s capital, as are the  and 0 functions defined above.
   We may characterize the capital decision rule for an unconstrained firm by reference to two
target capital stocks, the upward and downward adjustment targets that would solve the problems
in (16) and (17), respectively, were there no sign restrictions on investment. Define the upward
target, ∗ , as the capital a firm would choose given a unit relative price of investment, and define
the downward target, ∗ , as the capital a firm would choose given a relative price at  .

Notice that each target is independent of current capital and depends only on the aggregate state
and the firm’s current . As such, all unconstrained firms that share in common the same current
productivity  have the same upward and downward target capitals. Note also that, because
  1 (and because the value function 0 is strictly increasing in ), the upward adjustment
target necessarily lies below the downward target: ∗  ∗ .
   We are now in a convenient position to retrieve the unconstrained firm’s capital decision rule.
Given a constant price associated with raising (lowering) its capital stock, and because 0 is
increasing in , the firm selects a future capital as close to the upward (downward) target as
its constraint set allows. Thus, the firm’s decision rules conditional on upward adjustment and
downward adjustment are as follow.

                () = max {(1 − )  ∗ ()} and  () = min {(1 − )  ∗ ()}

                                                           17
Given these conditional adjustment rules, we know that an unconstrained firm of type (  )
selects one of three future capital levels, 0 ∈ {∗ ()  ∗ ()  (1 − ) }. Which one it selects
depends only on where its current capital lies in relation to its two targets.                                Recalling that
∗ ()  ∗ (), it is straightforward to obtain the following decision rule for an unconstrained
firm.                                         ⎧                                        ∗

       Unconstrained firms maintain suﬃcient assets to prevent borrowing limits aﬀecting their fu-
ture investment. In this sense, they accumulate precautionary savings. Given the decision rule
for capital, we isolate a minimum level of financial savings that insures that an unconstrained firm
of type ( ) will never be aﬀected by borrowing constraints across all possible future (0 ;  0  0 ).
Any such firm that maintains a level of debt not exceeding the threshold defined by the minimum
savings policy will be indiﬀerent to paying additional revenues in the form of dividends, or accu-
mulating further savings. This, in turn, implies that the firm is willing to follow the minimum
savings policy.17

       In equation 21,   ( ;  ) is derived as the maximum level of debt with which the firm
can exit this period and be certain to remain unconstrained next period, given that it adopts the
unconstrained capital decision rule. Next, (22) defines the beginning of period maximum debt
level under which a firm can adopt the unconstrained capital rule and debt not exceeding that

       In eﬀect, our minimum savings policy maximizes the dividends paid by unconstrained firms each period. We
adopt this policy rather than the natural alternative minimizing unconstrained firms’ period-by-period dividends
so as to bound the   0 levels carried by firms that can with positive probability outlive any set finite age we
consider.

the definition of an unconstrained firm.

outstanding debt. The minimum operator imposes the borrowing constraint; if the firm does not
have suﬃcient collateral to borrow to   , it can still be unconstrained if it has entered this period
with suﬃcient savings to finance its investment.
   Given the decision rule for capital and the minimum savings policy, we can now retrieve
unconstrained firms’ dividend payments.

4.2    Decisions among constrained firms

      We now consider the decisions made by a firm that has, until now, been constrained. We
begin by evaluating whether or not the firm has crossed the relevant wealth threshold to become
unconstrained. If it has, the decision rules described above apply. If it has not, the collateralized
borrowing constraint will continue to influence its investment decisions, and its choice of capital
and debt will remain intertwined.
   To ascertain whether a firm of type (  ) has become unconstrained, we need only consider
whether it is feasible for the firm to adopt the capital rule   ( ) and a level of debt not
exceeding that implied by the rule   ( ), while maintaining non-negative dividends in the
current period. If the firm of type (  ) is able to adopt the decision rules in (20) and (21)
without violating the non—negativity of dividends, then it achieves the value given by (24), and
it exits the period indistinguishable from any other unconstrained firm that entered the period




                                                         19
with ( ).

                        (  ;  ) =  (  ;  ) iﬀ  (  ;  ) ≥ 0                                (25)

                                         =   (  ;  ) otherwise

   Any constrained firm that can adopt the decision rules of an unconstrained firm will always
choose to do so, since  ≤  . However, when the inequality in the top line of (25) is not satisfied,
the firm remains constrained, with value   (  ;  ).
   We approach a continuing constrained firm’s problem as follows. First, given its ( ), we
isolate a cutoﬀ debt level under which non-negative investment is a feasible option. The lowest
level of 0 associated with non-negative investment is (1 − ) . If this choice is not aﬀordable
given the firm’s borrowing constraint in (12), it cannot undertake even a trivial upward capital
adjustment. Using (11), it follows that, among any group of firms sharing a common ( ), only
those with  ≤    +  (  ( )) −  ( ) can consider an upward capital adjustment.
Firms with higher levels of debt must choose a downward capital adjustment and repay debt by
selling capital.
   We identify the maximum capital stocks permitted by the borrowing constraint under upward
and downward capital adjustment.
                                                      h                     i

                                                      
Next we determine the associated choice sets for upward and downward capital adjustment.

                         Λ (  ) = [(1 − )    (  )]

Using these results and recalling 0 in equation (9), we may express a continuing constrained
firm’s value as follows.

4.3    Numerical Method

      The numerical algorithm we use to solve our model builds on that described in Khan
and Thomas (2003, 2008) using the analysis above. However, the discrete choices and three-
dimensional heterogeneity arising here from the presence of investment irreversibility and collat-
eralized borrowing, alongside the firm-level productivity shocks, necessitate a nonlinear solution
method that is more involved than that used in these papers.
   We compute equilibrium by solving the problems of unconstrained and constrained firms in a
setting where prices are consistent with market-clearing. Because the distribution in the model’s
aggregate state is a high-dimensional object, we approximate it with the first-moment of the
distribution of capital, applying the algorithm of Krusell and Smith (1998). More specifically, we
assume that agents perceive ( ) as the economy’s aggregate state (rather than ( )), where
 represents the unconditional mean of the distribution of capital across firms.
   We replace Γ with a forecasting rule 0 = Γ ( , ),  = 1      (). The solution method
iterates over forecasting rules,  = 1 2     until they converge. In each iteration, given the 
set of forecasting rules, we solve the unconstrained and constrained firm value functions, thereby
obtaining their decision rules. In this first step of the iteration, firms forecast the prices, , ,
and  as functions of  and .        Next, we run a  period simulation, determining equilibrium
prices and aggregate quantities at each date of the simulation given the true aggregate state, the


                                                            21
forecasting rule Γ ( , ), and firms’ decision rules. Thereafter, we use the simulation data to
update the forecasting rules using ordinary least squares regressions.
       In the first step of each iteration, where value functions are solved, firms assume that prices
are given by log-linear functions of  and ,  (  ) and  (  ).18 Given these forecasting
rules for prices and the forecasting rule for the future state, Γ , we solve for unconstrained firms’
value  using (14) - (17) and  (   ;   ) =  ( ) − . In doing so, we obtain the decision
rules   ,   , and  from (20) - (23), which serve as inputs for solving the constrained firm
value function. Next, we solve for the constrained firm value function using (25) - (28) with (9),
with 0 serving as the initial guess for 0 . In each case, we solve for firm values at a set of points
from the firm-level state vector; then we use non-linear multivariate piecewise polynomial spline
interpolation to approximate the firm value function consistent with these data. When solving
                                                                                ¡                 ¢
the constrained firm problem, we find it useful to solve for a value function b     ;   rather
than the primitive  (   ;  ); this lets us restrict the points where values are solved to avoid
irrelevant areas of insolvency where firm debt is so high relative to productivity and capital that
it cannot be repaid.
       In the second step of each iteration, we simulate the model for 5041 periods. The exact length
of our simulation is chosen to best fit our parallel computing environment.19                   We draw a fixed
vector of aggregate shock levels, { }=1 ,  = 5041, and assume an initial distribution of firms
that is equal to that obtained in the steady state of the model. This distribution over (  ) is
stored using a fine grid of values. As in the value function solution step, however, firms’ decisions
are not restricted to these grid points. Rather, when determining the future state, their choices
are allocated across the nearest pair of grid points using a weighting scheme that, in expectation,
yields the selected value.
       At each date of the simulation, the distribution  implied by the previous date’s equilibrium
decisions is used to compute  . Based on this, alongside  , firms use  , b and Γ to forecast
their future values associated with any choice of  0 and 0 . This lets them select their optimal
production, debt, and investment in response to any given set of prices (  ). We solve for the
  18
       The utility function we assume below implies that the real wage is determined by , so a separate forecasting
rule for it is unnecessary.
  19
     We solve the model using MPI with 71 computational cores in a Beowulf Cluster. Parallel methods are required,
despite our use of the Krusell Smith algorithm, because constrained firms’ decisions depend on their productivity,
debt and capital, implying a computationally intensive numerical algorithm.

equilibrium (     ) so that the market-clearing conditions (iv) - (v) in section 3.3 are satisfied
and asset markets clear. This give us +1 , the distribution of firms at the start of the next
period. After we have completed the simulation, we derive { }=1 from { }=1 and estimate
new forecasting rules.    The resulting rules for our baseline calibrated model, where  = 135,
are listed in Table 5. Despite the rich distribution of firms in our economy, we find that agents
are quite successful in forecasting the aggregate state with no more information on the current
distribution than the mean capital stock. The results presented in section 6.2 below will show
that this is because changes in  have little eﬀect on the shape of the distribution.


5     Calibration

      The data on establishment-level investment dynamics are reported annually. As the mechan-
ics of the reallocation of capital across firms are at the core of our model, we reproduce salient
empirical regularities from this data. Accordingly, we set the length of a period to one year.
    In the section to follow, we will consider how the mechanics of our model with real and financial
frictions compare to those in two relevant reference models - one where there are no borrowing
limits and one where there are neither financial nor real frictions ( = 1). These two reference
models will help us to isolate how much the interaction between credit constraints and micro-level
capital rigidities influences our economy’s aggregate dynamics. Aside from the values of  and
 , all three models share a common parameter set that is selected in our full model to best
match moments drawn from postwar U.S. aggregate and firm-level data. However, as the average
capital-to-output ratio and hours worked vary little across the three models, the results to follow
are unaﬀected by our decision to maintain a fixed parameter set.
    Across our model economies, we assume that the representative household’s period utility is
the result of indivisible labor (Rogerson (1988)): ( ) = log  + . The firm-level production
function is Cobb-Douglas:  ( ) =   . The initial capital stock of each entering firm is
a fixed  fraction of the typical stock held across all firms in the long-run of our full economy;

5.1    Aggregate data

      We determine the values of , , , ,  and  using moments from the aggregate data
as follows. First, we set the household discount factor, , to imply an average real interest rate


                                                   23
of 4 percent, consistent with recent findings by Gomme, Ravikumar and Rupert (2008). Next,
the production parameter  is set to yield an average labor share of income at 060 (Cooley and
Prescott (1995)). The depreciation rate, , is taken to imply an average investment-to-capital ratio
of roughly 0069, which corresponds to the average value for the private capital stock between 1954
and 2002 in the U.S. Fixed Asset Tables, controlling for growth. Given this value, we determine
capital’s share, , so that our model matches the average private capital-to-output ratio over the
same period, at 23, and we set the parameter governing the preference for leisure, , to imply an
average of one-third of available time is spent in market work.
   We calibrate our model to reproduce an aggregate measure of the indebtedness of firms in
the U.S. economy. Specifically, we set the parameter determining our collateral constraint,  ,
to imply an average debt-to-assets ratio at 0366, which matches that of nonfarm nonfinancial
businesses over 1952-05 in the Flow of Funds. The extent to which the resulting financial frictions
aﬀect firm-level and aggregate outcomes depends on the productivity process individual firms
face, as well as the extent of investment irreversibility. We will determine these aspects of the
model using firm-level data below.
   Exact aggregation obtains in the reference model without real or financial frictions; in par-
ticular, it has an aggregate production function.       We use this reference model to estimate an
exogenous stochastic process for aggregate productivity.    We begin by assuming a continuous
                                                                                          ³        ´
shock following a mean zero AR(1) process in logs: log  0 =  log  +  0 with  0 ∼  0  2 .
Next, we estimate the values of  and   from Solow residuals measured using NIPA data on
US real GDP and private capital, together with the total employment hours series constructed by
Prescott, Ueberfeldt, and Cociuba (2005) from CPS household survey data, over the years 1959-
2002, and we discretize the resulting productivity process using a grid with 3 shock realizations
( = 3) to obtain ( ) and (  ). We apply this exogenous shock process across all three models;
as we will see below, there are no changes in the endogenous component of aggregate total factor
productivity in our full model with both real and financial frictions when aggregate fluctuations
are driven by exogenous shocks to aggregate TFP.


5.2    Firm-level data

      The costly reversibility of investment and the dispersion of firm-level total factor productivity
are calibrated to reproduce microeconomic evidence on establishment-level investment dynamics.



                                                  24
We begin by assuming that firm-specific productivity follows an AR(1) log-normal process, log 0 =
                             ¡       ¢
 log  +  0 , with  0 ∼  0  2 . Next we choose  ,  and   jointly to reproduce three aspects
of establishment-level investment data documented by Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) based on a
17-year sample drawn from the Longitudinal Research Database. These targets are (i) the average
mean investment rate () across establishments: 0122, (ii) the average standard deviation of
investment rates: 0337, and (iii) the average serial correlation of investment rates: 0058.20
       While our model has life-cycle aspects aﬀecting firms’ investments, the Cooper and Halti-
wanger (2006) dataset includes only large manufacturing establishments that remain in operation
throughout their sample period, Thus, in undertaking this part of our calibration, we must select
an appropriate model-generated sample for comparability with their sample. This we do by simu-
lating a large number of firms for 30 years, retaining only those firms that survive throughout, and
then restricting the dates over which investment rates are measured to eliminate life-cycle eﬀects.
This restricts attention to firms whose investment decisions are unaﬀected by their borrowing
limits. In implementing this algorithm, we discretize firms’ log-normal productivity process using
7 values ( = 7) to obtain { }             
                                 =1 and (  )=1 .

       The idiosyncratic shock process we calibrate has a persistence of 0653 and a standard deviation
of innovations of 0135. As firms in the model sample are unaﬀected by borrowing constraints,
their investments would respond immediately to changes in their total factor productivities in the
absence of costs of uninstalling capital.          This implies a negative autocorrelation in investment
rates, since capital is determined by lagged investment. The costly reversibility of capital is
then essential in reproducing the investment moments reported above, and we set  = 095 to
reproduce the serial correlation of investment rates in the data.
       If we eliminate the real friction, firm-level capital reallocation dramatically increases. Main-
taining our idiosyncratic shock process but setting  = 1, the mean and standard deviation of
firm-level investment rates rises to 031 and 085, respectively, while the serial correlation falls to
                                                                                                        
−016. Alternatively, if we reset (   ) to match the mean and standard deviation of                   in the
data, the serial correlation falls to −02. When we impose a cost of uninstalling capital, firms
become unresponsive to moderate changes in . This reduces the variability of their investment,
and increases its persistence.
  20
       While not a target in the calibration, our model also closely matches a fourth moment drawn from the Cooper
and Haltiwanger study, the fraction of establishment-year observations wherein a positive investment spike ( 
020) occurs: 0186.



                                                         25
         Finally, we choose the exit rate,   , and the fraction of the steady-state aggregate capital stock
held by each entering firm, . We set   at 010, so that 10 percent of firms enter and exit the
economy each year. Next, we set  = 010 so that, in an average date, each entering firm begins
with an initial capital that is one-tenth the size of the aggregate stock. If we had assumed constant
returns to scale in production, this would imply an employment size of entering firms averaging
one-tenth the size of the typical firm in our economy, matching the Davis and Haltiwanger (1992)
data. In our model economy, where returns to scale is 087, the relative employment size of a new
firm is 21 percent. In this sense, our choice of 0 is conservative.21
         The table below lists the parameter set obtained from our calibration.

                                                                                           

Note that these parameters imply only a 5 percent loss incurred in uninstalling capital, and a
moderate degree of financial frictions, with firms able to take on debt up to 135 percent of the
value of their tangible assets. Also note that firm-level shocks are far more volatile and less
persistent than aggregate shocks. Given these aspects of the calibration, our model gives rise to a
stationary distribution of firms over (  ) wherein roughly 86 percent of firms are constrained
when one applies the definition from section 4 above. By contrast, the fraction of firms facing a
currently binding borrowing limit is 27 percent.


6         Results

6.1         Steady state

          We begin by considering the implications of borrowing limits and irreversibilities for the
typical decisions made in our economy. Figure 1 overviews the stationary distribution of firms
in the baseline case of our full model, presenting three slices of the full distribution. In the
top panel, we see the distribution of firms over capital and debt-to-capital levels at the lowest
firm-level productivity, while the middle and bottom present the counterparts at the median and
highest levels of productivity.
    21
         To match the Davis and Haltiwanger relative employment size of an entrant in our setting, firms would have
to enter with only 33 percent the capital of the typical firm. In that case, firms would take far longer to mature,
amplifying the eﬀects of financial frictions as well as the eﬀect of a credit shock increasing those frictions.



                                                          26
   Each panel of Figure 1 contains what are essentially two separate distributions. The first, in
the foreground, has a distinctly curved shape that reflects an inverse relation between firms’ capital
stocks and their savings rates. This corresponds to older, wealthier firms that are unconstrained
and following the minimum savings policy described in section 4. Such firms have higher capital
and higher savings relative to constrained firms, which are distributed near the back of each
panel.    As would be expected, the mean capital among constrained firms rises with firm-level
productivity, and the same is true for unconstrained firms.
   The 10 percent of firms newly entering the economy each period are scattered across each 
level according to the ergodic productivity distribution. These firms enter with zero debt and
low initial capital (roughly 014), and are found in a large spike near the left edge of each panel
in Figure 1.    After its first date in production, each new firm begins to take on debt in eﬀort
to build up its capital. In the absence of the collateralized borrowing limits, young firms would
immediately take on a large, temporary debt that would allow them to jump to the capital stock
selected by unconstrained firms with the same current productivity level. Here, however, firms
with little collateral have a relatively limited ability to borrow, so their capital accumulation is
necessarily gradual. As a result, ripples of these entering firms slowly move into higher ranges
of  and  as they age.      In the figure, the youngest firms are found along the back edge of
each panel; as they mature, they steadily raise their capital while maintaining a roughly constant
borrowing rate typically below the maximum permitted. Those firms that survive long enough
eventually reach a level of capital such that they can adopt the unconstrained capital choices
consistent with their current productivity while beginning to reduce their debt. Those surviving
longer still will, at some point, attain a level of capital and savings such that their investment
decisions become impervious to borrowing limits.        At this point, they join the distribution of
unconstrained firms.
   The life-cycle aspects of our model described above may be seen from Figure 2. There we
display the average capital and debt choices within a cohort of (initially) 25 000 firms as they
age.     Notice that the typical firm raises its capital and debt over its first six periods of life.
Thereafter, starting in period 7, it begins to reduce its debt and finances the remaining rise in
its capital stock fully out of earnings. By age 16, the typical firm has become a net saver, and
thereafter joins the distribution of permanently unconstrained firms.
   We next consider how the predicted relation between firm size and leverage ratios in our model



                                                  27
compares with the data. Empirical evidence presented by Fama and French (2002) and Rajan
and Zingales (1995) indicates that leverage ratios rise with size. Reexamining the finding using
a panel of nonfinancial firms in the Compustat, Rampini and Viswanathan (2011) argue that the
positive relation between size (book value of assets) and leverage disappears when one accounts
for an often overlooked form of leverage heavily used by small firms, the rental of capital.
   Figure 2 does not imply that our model generates a strong negative relation between size and
leverage. Recall that this figure is not drawn from a balanced panel of firms. Given the constant
exit rate, there are fewer firms in the right half of the figure than there are on the left where
leverage is roughly constant.      For this reason, when we draw a large random sample of firms
from our stationary distribution, we find that the sample correlation between size and leverage
is −022, far less negative than Figure 2 would suggest. Note also that, because our model has
no theory of firm ownership, all leverage in our model is associated with investment loans. By
contrast, the data reflects not only borrowing for investment activities, but other activities such
as restructuring and mergers and acquisitions.        Indeed, Ivashina and Scharfstein (2009) report
that two-thirds of syndicated loans in 2007 were associated with these other activities.
   Extensions of our model allowing for diﬀerent borrowing constraints across firms could elim-
inate the small negative correlation between size and leverage, and even make it positive. For
example, consider a version of the model with two types of firms distinguished by diﬀerent levels
of  ,  =  , with    . If  was suﬃciently large, firms of type  reaching the unconstrained
financial status and hence adopting the minimum savings policy described in section 4 would hold
substantial debt. This would imply leverage ratios rising with size among type  firms. Since our
existing model has a correlation between size and leverage near 0, the fraction type  firms need
not be large to deliver an overall positive correlation in this example. Considering the response to
a credit shock yielding large reductions in each  in this setting, we expect that the real eﬀects
following a credit shock would be amplified relative to the results we present below, since large
firms would, in that case, have high levels of debt at the onset of the shock.
   While relatively simple in its microeconomic elements, our existing model is consistent with
various aspects of firm-level behavior observed in the data. For example, our unconditional sta-
tionary firm size distribution is right-skewed, firm employment growth is negatively correlated
with age (Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1989)), and larger and older firms pay more dividends




                                                    28
(Fama and French (2001)).22 Moreover, we remind the reader that the model is calibrated delib-
erately to reproduce the aspects of firm behavior most crucial in aﬀecting the core misallocation
mechanism therein. Specifically, our model matches the mean, variability and autocorrelation of
microeconomic investment rates.
      Figure 3 is the no-financial frictions counterpart to Figure 2, depicting the average capital
among the same cohort of firms in a version of our model where the collateral constraint is
removed, so that debt becomes irrelevant to investment. As in the previous figure, the cohort
enters the economy with low initial capital. However, in this case, young firms can immediately
reach their unconstrained capital targets for the start of the next period. Thus, we see a much
larger initial rise in capital between dates 1 and 2 relative to Figure 2.     Notice, however, that
the elimination of financial frictions does not entirely eliminate life-cycle aspects from our model.
Firms still face a real friction that causes bands of inaction in investment. Thus, as a firm transits
from one  to a lower one nearby, it will at times choose not to lower its capital stock, given the
forfeit of 5 percent of any capital uninstalled. Likewise, when a firm’s relative productivity rises,
it is slow to respond fully to that rise given the partial irreversibility in investment. As a result,
we see the average capital stock of the cohort gradually continuing to rise from age 2 to age
7. Nonetheless, this rise is quite modest relative to that between age 1 and 2; after taking into
account the implications of irreversibility, all but the newest firms operate at a scale appropriate
to their productivity. The quantitative impact of the more eﬃcient allocation of production this
implies is that steady state output rises by 4 percent relative to our full economy, with measured
TFP rising roughly 1 percent.
      Returning to our full model economy with both frictions in place, Figure 4 illustrates the pure
eﬀects of the irreversibility in cases where it does not interact with the financial friction in our
economy. It summarizes the capital choices made by unconstrained firms entering the period with
various levels of capital (measured on the x-axis) and debt (measured on the y-axis), conditional
on a current productivity draw. The top panel depicts firms entering with the lowest productivity
value, the middle panel shows those with the median value, and the bottom panel shows those the
highest productivity. The z-axis in each panel reports an indicator variable that takes on a value of
1 for unconstrained firms that invest positively to the upward target capital consistent with their
current productivity, a value of 2 for those investing negatively to the relevant downward target,

                                                  29
and a value of 5 for those that remain inactive with respect to their capital, setting investment
to zero. (The right, rear areas with a zero indicator value are combinations of ( ) where firms
are not unconstrained.)
   The region of ( ) where firms invest to their upward target capital expands into higher cur-
rent capital levels as one looks from the top panel downward, since rises in current productivity
predict higher marginal product of capital schedules next period. To the left of these regions
are the areas with zero investment induced by the irreversibility in capital. While the loss as-
sociated with uninstalling capital in our economy is only 5 percent, it nonetheless makes some
firms reluctant to shed capital. Those with higher current productivities are more so, given the
persistence in  alongside depreciation. As such, the inactivity region expands to higher capital
levels as productivity rises, while the region associated with downward investment shrinks, finally
disappearing from view by the bottom panel.           On balance, of the 14 percent of firms in our
stationary distribution that are (permanently) unconstrained, 36 percent adjust to the upward
targets consistent with their productivities, 50 percent are inactive with respect to their capital,
while 14 percent undertake negative investment.
   Figure 5 is analogous to Figure 4. Again conditional on currently productivity, it illustrates
the capital decisions taken by firms, this time considering those that are aﬀected by both the real
friction in our economy and the financial one. Such firms represent 86 percent of the population in
our model’s steady state, and are located in regions of the ( ) space to the right and back where
capital is low and/or debt is high. (Foreground areas where the indicator is zero are combinations
of ( ) where firms are unconstrained.)
   Because constrained firms’ capital choices are largely determined by life-cycle factors stemming
from the collateral constraints, they tend to avoid negative investment. Those investing positively
to the maximum capital permitted by their ability to borrow are reflected by a value of 3 on
the z-axis.   These are firms with higher current productivity, comparatively low capital, and
comparatively high debt. They make up 32 percent of constrained firms in our model’s steady
state and are the only firms facing a currently binding borrowing limit.       Looking just left and
in front of that region, firms with slightly higher capital (or slightly lower debt) adjust to their
upward capital targets. This region, reflected by a value of 1 on the z-axis, expands into higher
values of capital as  rises, since the target itself rises. In the stationary distribution, roughly
29 percent of constrained firms are of this type. Finally, looking further left in each panel, we have



                                                 30
firms selecting inaction with respect to investment due to the irreversibility (with a z-axis value of
5), and thereafter those whose capital is suﬃciently high relative to their productivity that they
disinvest (with a z-value of 2). These categories represent 32 and 7 percent of constrained firms
in our model’s stationary distribution.
   A comparison of Figure 5 to the preceding figure summarizing the capital decision rules of
permanently financially unconstrained firms suggests that, for a large fraction of our economy’s
firms, financial considerations interfere with the optimal firm-level investment responses to infor-
mation about the future marginal product of capital conveyed current productivity draws. Even
in ordinary times, this generates a misallocation of production across firms. One indication of
this is the fact that the average capital stock among unconstrained firms in our model’s stationary
distribution is 214, while the average stock of constrained firms is 119. As such, the typical old
firm in our economy has far more capital than the typical young firm, despite the fact that each
group draws from the same productivity distribution.
   Old firms in our economy do not carry excess capital; the ineﬃciency lies in the fact that
young, small firms carry too little. This is clarified by Figure 6, which again examines a cohort
of (initially) 25 000 firms, this time focusing on the expected discounted return to investment
for a cohort as it ages over time.    Absent real or financial frictions, firms would always select
investment to equate this return to the unit purchase price of investment goods. In that case, the
mean investment return across firms in the top panel of our figure would be constant at 1, and
the coeﬃcient of variation in this return in the bottom panel would always be 0. By contrast, in
our model, the mean expected discounted return to investment is 112 for a cohort as it ends its
first year of production, and the coeﬃcient of variation in this return is 40. Thereafter, over each
subsequent year of life, we see ever less dispersion in the return to investment across surviving
members of the cohort, and the mean expected return falling towards 1
   After a certain age, surviving members of the cohort have suﬃcient assets that financial
frictions no longer aﬀect their investment decisions. Thus, we see the mean expected investment
return for the cohort ultimately reach a value around 1. Even then, there remains some variation
in the expected return, and its mean is not precisely 1, given the 5 percent irreversibility of capital
in our economy. Recall the capital decision rules of unconstrained firms summarized in Figure 4.




                                                  31
6.2       Business Cycles

        We begin to examine business cycle results by first considering the eﬀect each friction in our
economy has on its typical business cycle. Table 1 presents some commonly reported business
cycle statistics derived from an HP-filtered 5041 period simulation of our model economy under
the assumption that aggregate productivity shocks are the only source of aggregate fluctuations,
Table 2 presents the corresponding moments when we eliminate financial frictions, and Table 3
is the same economy with neither collateral constraints nor capital specificity. As expected, each
friction acts to reduce the average levels of output, capital, and consumption over our simulation.
Most notably, average output rises by roughly 41 percent when financial frictions are stripped
away, then another 23 percent when the irreversibility is also eliminated.
       Moving to consider second moments, there are some small diﬀerences across the three tables.
Output volatility rises between our full economy and the counterpart model without limits to bor-
rowing, and it rises again between that model and the one with no frictions. Despite this, as each
friction is lifted, the representative household grows more eﬀective in smoothing its consumption.
As the contemporaneous correlation between consumption and production is slightly weakened
from one table to the next, consumption’s standard deviation (raw and relative) falls. Elsewhere,
the volatility of hours worked rises steadily, and the hours series is marginally more correlated
with output as each friction is eliminated. The same monotone pattern does not follow for invest-
ment expenditures, however. There, the relative standard deviation falls from 383 percent to 377
percent as the financial friction is stripped away, allowing the inertia associated with irreversibility
more prominence, while it rises to 404 percent when the irreversibility is eliminated.23
       While we have mentioned some minor diﬀerences in the business cycle moments across Tables
1 through 3, two points are surely more important. The first is that the business cycle moments
drawn from our full model in Table 1 are similar to those of a typical real business cycle model
without its complications. Output volatility is roughly 2 percent, consumption is about half
as volatile as output, and investment roughly four times as volatile as output. We also see the
customary strong positive contemporaneous correlations with output in consumption, investment,
and total hours worked. While the usual diﬃculties of excessive investment volatility and weak
hours volatility are a bit more pronounced here relative to some representative firm real business
  23
       This evidence that firm-level capital irreversibilities dampen changes in aggregate investment is consistent with
earlier findings by Bertola and Caballero (1994).




                                                           32
cycle models, these distinctions come from our diﬀering returns to scale in production rather than
either friction we mean to study; the same features are present in Table 3 with both removed.
       This brings us to our second point. Despite the diﬀerences noted above, the second moments
across all three tables are quite similar on the whole. Comparing Table 1 to Table 2, in particular,
it appears that the typical business cycle in our economy is relatively impervious to some ordinary,
ongoing degree of financial frictions. This observation is reinforced by Figure 7, which presents our
full model economy’s impulse responses following a persistent negative shock to the exogenous
component of total factor productivity.                As may be seen from the close match between the
exogenous and measured TFP series in the top panel, a persistent real shock has inconsequential
implications for the endogenous component of aggregate productivity. Thus, examining output,
consumption, employment and investment, we see impulse responses closely resembling those of a
counterpart economy without real or financial frictions, such as that summarized in Table 3. Just
as in a frictionless business cycle model, there are immediate declines in all four series. Further,
aside from the customary U-shaped consumption response, we see the largest declines at the
impact of the shock, with each series thereafter monotonically reverting toward its long-run level.
Note also that the largest percent drop in hours worked is half that of GDP, while investment’s
greatest drop is roughly 35 times that in GDP.
       When driven solely by exogenous changes to total factor productivity, we have seen that our
model economy closely resembles a standard frictionless business cycle economy. This, in turn,
implies a failure to capture some key aspects of the latest U.S. recession, dated by the NBER as
2007Q4 - 2009Q2.            Figure 8 reports the recent movements in GDP, consumption, investment,
employment hours and measured TFP, plotting each series’ percent deviations relative to their
2007Q4 levels.24         While the figure includes data over 2009Q3 - 2010Q4, we defer discussion of
the recovery period for now and focus here on the economic downturn within the NBER recession
dates.
       Figure 8 reveals that the initial response in GDP was negligible, while real personal consump-
tion expenditure actually rose by roughly 1 percent and stayed high until 2008Q4. Moreover, the
immediate declines in investment were modest relative to what came later. While total private
  24
       Our hours series extends through 2010Q4 the Cociuba et. al (2009) series representing total civilian and military
hours worked per noninstitutional population aged 16 to 64. The results presented here change in no notable way
if we omit the military component from this series. Our measured TFP series is a direct Solow Residual calculation
based on the productive shares of labor and capital to which our model is calibrated.



                                                            33
investment fell immediately, this was initially driven by housing. Non-residential investment did
not begin to fall until 2008Q3, at which point it began to drop oﬀ sharply relative to the more
gradual declines in GDP and consumption. Measured TFP falls until the first quarter of 2009,
where it is 16 percent below its initial level. Elsewhere, the greatest declines in all other series
in this figure do not occur until 2009Q2 or later.            As of 2009Q2, GDP was roughly 4 percent
below its initial level, total hours had declined 17 times as much as GDP, while the investment
drop was five to six times that in GDP.25
       On balance, the recent U.S. economic downturn presents several challenges for any equilibrium
business cycle model driven by shocks to technology. First, it shows an initial rise in consumption
where the model would predict a clear decline.               Next, the ultimate losses in employment and
investment by the end of the recession are far greater than in the model. The magnitudes of
change in these series relative to output are also several times larger than predicted.


6.3       A Credit Crisis

        Clearly, the challenges regarding the latest U.S. recession apply not only to a standard busi-
ness cycle model but also to our model, so long as its aggregate fluctuations arise solely from
changes in exogenous productivity. However, our focus is on understanding what happens when
the extent of financial frictions suddenly and unexpectedly grows more severe than is normal.
Given its assumption of a representative firm, the standard business cycle model is unaﬀected by
such events. We now explore their eﬀect in our model where firms have diﬀerent access to, and
need for, credit.
       Before continuing, we discuss the evidence for an exogenous shock to the availability of credit
that, in our model, corresponds to an unanticipated decline in  . As is now well understood, it is
hard to find conclusive evidence that the U.S. has experienced an exogenous reduction in lending
to businesses. In an early exploration of this issue, Chari et al. (2008) argued there was little
evidence that the financial crisis had aﬀected lending to nonfinancial firms. Examining the Flow
of Funds, they found that the stock of commercial and industrial loans across regulated banks
had actually risen as of the third quarter of 2008.
       Chari et al. (2008) also argue that, in the aggregate, business fixed investment is less than
  25
       Ohanian (2010) presents evidence that the magnitudes of these declines in investment and hours relative to
GDP are dramatic in comparison with those seen in pevious postwar U.S. recessions, as well as other G7 countries’
2007-9 recesssions.


                                                        34
firms’ revenues net of labor costs; that is, the mean firm can self-finance investment. It is
worth noting that our calibrated model is consistent with this observation in the aggregate data.
Nonetheless, borrowing limits bind for some smaller firms, and this leads to insuﬃcient capital in
those firms, reducing both aggregate TFP and GDP.
   Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010) re-examine the issue of lending over the financial crisis. They
study Reuters DealScan data on syndicated loans, which captures new lending to large corpo-
rations. While these loans originate with banks, the pool of lenders, which includes non-bank
financial institutions, is larger. Moreover, the data on syndicated lending covers new loans, as
opposed to the stock of outstanding debt that is reported in the Flow of Funds. Ivashina and
Scharfstein find strong evidence of a reduction in lending. Between 2007 and 2008, total syndi-
cated lending fell 54 percent, while loans used to fund investment in equipment and structures
fell 48 percent.
   Koepke and Thomson (2011) examine loans from FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings
institutions. They find that total lending declined between 2008 and 2009 and since then has not
recovered to its pre-recession level. Importantly, commercial and industrial loans, which are an
important source of borrowing for small and medium-sized businesses, fell 18.7 percent between
2008Q4 and 2009Q4. These loans continued to fall through 2010Q2, when they were 19.1 percent
below their level at the start of the recession, in 2007Q4.
   While these papers provide evidence that there has been a reduction in lending to nonfinancial
firms, they do not establish whether this represents an exogenous reduction in credit or instead
an equilibrium response to reductions in business fixed investment. However, both Almeida et
al. (2009) and Duchin et al. (2010) provide support for a credit shock interpretation. Controlling
for firm characteristics using a matching estimator, Almeida et al. study the investment behavior
of firms that, given their existing loan maturity structures, needed to refinance a substantial
fraction of their long-term debt over the year following August 2007, the onset of the financial
crisis. They find that investment spending among such firms fell by one-third.         By contrast,
other firms with similar characteristics, but without a large refinancing in the period following
the start of the financial crisis, showed no investment reduction. Since the fraction of long-term
debt maturing after August 2007 is likely exogenous to the financial crisis, this suggests that there
was an exogenous reduction in the supply of credit. Duchin et al. (2010) compare the behavior
of firms that were carrying more cash prior to the onset of the crisis with that of firms carrying



                                                 35
less cash. Using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence approach, they find that firms with less liquid assets
before the financial crisis exhibited a larger reduction in investment.
       Given this evidence that the recent recession involved an exogenous reduction in lending, we
now examine a credit shock in our model economy. Figure 9 depicts our economy’s response
to a financial crisis, absent any technology shock. More specifically, it is the response to a 55
percentage point drop in the value of firms’ collateral, as generated by a reduction in  , which we
will see below implies an eventual 23 percent reduction in debt. This reduction is not implausibly
large relative to the actual declines in various measures of lending since the onset of the 2007
credit crisis, as discussed above. While it is slightly larger than the reduction in the commercial
and industrial loans of regulated banks, it is substantially smaller than the fall in syndicated loans
used to finance investment.
       >From the first date of the credit shock onwards, we assume that households and firms expect
an eventual return to normal financial conditions. Each period, they place 40 percent probability
on a full financial recovery in the subsequent period. Thus, when the shock occurs in period
1, they expect it will persist for 25 years.26 However, we begin by focusing on the downturn
following a credit shock. Thus we omit the actual recovery from this figure.
       Although the distribution of capital is predetermined when the financial shock hits in year 1,
the top left panel of Figure 9 reveals that aggregate production immediately falls by about 15
percent (relative to its simulated mean in normal financial times). This is, of course, a direct
consequence of the 24 percent fall in the labor input (top right panel), which is, in turn, a
reaction to the reduced expected return to investment (bottom right panel). With the sudden
reduction in credit, there is a drop in the fraction of firms that are financially unconstrained and
a sharp rise in the fraction of firms facing currently binding borrowing limits. Underlying these
changes, young firms are now far more hindered in their investment activities relative to the pre-
shock economy, and thus will take considerably longer to outgrow financial frictions and begin
producing at a scale consistent with their productivities. If these financial conditions persisted, the
resulting stationary distribution would have 51 percent of firms constrained in their current upward
capital adjustments and 1 percent of firms forced to undertake some negative investment to repay
outstanding debt. In ordinary financial times, these percentages are 27 and 0, respectively. In the
meantime, firms that are unconstrained after the financial shock must increase their precautionary
  26
       This represents an average of 2 and 3 years it took GDP and consumption to recover, respectively, took to their
2007Q4 level.


                                                           36
savings to remain so. As a result, aggregate savings among firms that are not borrowers rises
roughly 30 percent at the date of the shock; thereafter, while the stock of debt declines, this series
slowly falls toward its initial level, reaching about 10 percent above normal by date 4 (Figure
available on request.)
       Unlike the response that would follow a negative productivity shock, consumption does not
immediately fall when the financial shock hits our economy. Anticipating a more distorted distri-
bution of production over coming years, and thus unusually low endogenous total factor produc-
tivity (in the lower right panel), the representative household in our economy expects a lowered
return to saving.       This leads to a 05 percent rise in consumption at the impact of the shock, and
also a rise in leisure. This eﬀect of reduced future TFP is compounded by the fact that the initial
aggregate capital stock is roughly 9 percent above that consistent with the tighter borrowing
conditions, which further encourages consumption and leisure.27 The fall in investment (at lower
left) does not support consumption for long, however; consumption falls to its pre-shock level
by year 3, then steadily declines for roughly 8 more years before it levels oﬀ. Elsewhere, labor
falls at the impact of the shock as described above. Thereafter, given the severe misallocation of
capital at the start of date 2, alongside reductions in the total capital stock, the marginal product
of labor drops, yielding further large reductions in employment. By year 3, employment is 39
percent below its pre-shock level, and it does not rise back to the level consistent with the new
financial setting until around period 15. This long adjustment period is a reflection of the time
that it takes for the capital distribution to settle, as may be inferred from the measured TFP
response in the lower right panel.
       Figure 10 illustrates how the unanticipated tightening of credit distorts the allocation of pro-
duction in our economy, giving rise to the initial aggregate changes in the previous figure. The
top panel plots the distribution of firms over capital and productivity that is in place in date
1 when the shock occurs.            The lower panel shows the same distribution at the start of date
2, once the tightened borrowing conditions have begun aﬀecting firm-level investment activities.
Comparing these two panels, we see a noticeable rise in dispersion within just one period of the
shock. The mass of firms with capital stocks between 1.5 and 3 in the top panel is considerably
  27
       Fernald and Matoba (2009) argue that utilization-adjusted total factor productivity rose over the recent U.S.
recession. The counterpart to their series in our model, the exogenous component of TFP, is held constant over our
credit shock exercise. A positive shock to this series could be introduced, provided the credit shock was adjusted
so that measured TFP still fell as in the data.



                                                          37
reduced, with much of that mass pushed into lower regions of capital by date 2. In other words,
the shock creates fewer medium-sized firms and more small firms. At the same time, we see a
few firms, the very largest, growing larger.28
       Given a heightened misallocation of production coming in date 2, the largest firms that are
otherwise unaﬀected by credit concerns respond to the reduced real interest rate by expanding in
size. Such firms adopt the eﬃcient capital levels dictated by their (S,s) investment policies, given
the productivities and real interest rate they face. The increased ineﬃciency that reduces TFP
arises because small firms, now facing more severe collateral requirements, see the gap between
their expected discounted return to capital and the real rate widen.
       Figure 11 shows that these problems do not abate in nearby dates, in that dispersion continues
to rise. The top panel shows that the mean of the (ex-post) marginal product of capital moves
further above its pre-crisis value (0134) during the first 8 periods over which the overall stock
of capital is being reduced. The lower panel plots the coeﬃcient of variation in firms’ marginal
products. This measure of dispersion rises over the first several dates of the financial crisis, and
then begins to return toward its pre-crisis level (0537). That initial level is never fully recovered
in this figure, however, because financial conditions do not improve.
       Critically, the increase in the mean marginal product of capital coincides with a fall in the
ex-post real interest rate. The marginal product of capital across large, unconstrained firms falls,
with the contrasting rise in the economywide average driven entirely by tighter borrowing limits
for other firms. Capital falls in these firms over time, so their marginal product of capital rises.
With the increased dispersion in the returns to capital, the coeﬃcient of variation is seen to rise.
These results in our model following a credit shock are reminiscent of empirical results in Eisfeldt
and Rampini (2006), who show that the benefits of capital reallocation rise in recessions while
the level of reallocation falls. In our model, both forces operate.
       On balance, we take the following observations from Figures 9 - 11. A tightening of collateral
constraints alone, a purely financial shock, drives large and persistent real eﬀects in our model
economy. It does so because it increases the dispersion in firm-level capital further away from
  28
       Using BEDS data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Gilchrist (2011) compares average employment growth
for firms with more than 500 employees to average employment growth rate of firms with less than 500 employees
and finds that, after 2007, small firms reduced employment more rapidly than large firms. More generally, our
increased dispersion in production is consistent with evidence from Bloom et al (2009) that various measures of
firm-level dispersion rise during recessions.




                                                       38
the eﬃcient level consistent with productivity dispersion (and capital specificity) and it allocates
insuﬃcient capital to an expanded group of small firms, putting downward pressure on the interest
rate. In the example we have shown here, the misallocation of production arising from tight
financial conditions is compounded by the reductions in aggregate capital, productivity, and
labor that it causes. As a result, there are protracted adjustments in aggregate quantities lasting
a decade or more, and GDP is ultimately reduced by 36 percent, while aggregate consumption
is reduced by 13 percent.
   We next consider what implications the prolonged financial crisis from above can have if its
onset is followed by a 1 standard deviation negative technology shock. As seen in the lower right
panel of Figure 12, the exogenous component of TFP falls one year after the financial shock hits,
and thereafter gradually reverts to its mean. Were credit markets functioning as normal when this
TFP shock appeared, output would fall 38 percent, labor would fall 2 percent, and the half-life
of the output response would be roughly 5 years, as seen in Figure 7. While the overall declines
in quantities here are larger and protracted, they are no more so than would be expected once we
account for the eﬀects of the credit shock in Figure 8.
   Until now, we have considered the implications of a persistent financial crisis, in that borrowing
conditions do not recover throughout the exercises depicted in Figures 9 - 12. We next consider
the recovery. We assume the same financial shock studied in Figure 9 persists for 4 periods;
thereafter, beginning in date 5, we allow a complete recovery of financial conditions, returning
the value of collateral to normal. Over the first four periods, agents have the same expectations
regarding financial recovery as we assumed above. Thereafter, beginning in date 5, they under-
stand that borrowing conditions have permanently recovered. We omit the negative TFP shock
from this exercise for expositional simplicity, as we have seen above that its implications do not
add unexpected or noteworthy features to the impulse responses.
   In Table 4, we compare the peak-to-trough behavior of our model with the 2007 US recession.
Driven solely by a credit shock, our model generates the same decline in GDP as in the data.
Furthermore, the 23 percent fall in investment is almost as large as the 27 percent in the data.
Elsewhere, the model explains roughly half of the actual reduction in employment and 43 percent
of the fall in consumption. As shown below, the overall fall in consumption in our model is larger,
but it occurs after the trough in GDP.
   Consider these results in comparison with the responses to a technology shock, whether in



                                                39
our model or in a standard representative firm model. On its own, a technology shock cannot
reconcile the empirical declines in GDP, measured TFP and investment. A one-standard deviation
exogenous shock to TFP generates almost as large a change in GDP, −385 percent, and about half
the fall in employment. However the required change in TFP, −267 percent, is far larger than the
largest change measured in the data, which was −165 percent in 2009Q1.29 Furthermore, the drop
in investment is only 14 percent. In contrast, following a credit shock, our model reproduces the
changes in output and investment observed in the data, without implying a counterfactually large
decline in measured TFP. Furthermore, this exercise implies a reduction in debt of 228 percent,
which is comparable to the 19 percent fall in commercial and industrial loans by regulated banks
through the end of 2009, and far less than the 48 drop in syndicated lending between 2007 and
2008. In contrast, the TFP-shock driven recession generates less than a 4 percent fall in debt.
       Figure 13 shows the full credit shock driven recession in our model, including the recovery.
Three aspects of the responses there are worthy of note. First, so long as GDP or consumption
is adopted as our measure, the eﬀects of a large credit shock are not rapidly reversed. Although
loan markets are operating normally in year 5, GDP remains 31 percent below trend in that date.
Moreover, GDP recovers twice as slowly as in the data, with a half-life of 1.5 years. Consumption
takes longer to return to its average with a half life of 4 periods. The slow recovery of output and
consumption after real and financial frictions have been restored to their ordinary levels arises in
part from the fact that the distribution of capital does not immediately settle back to its pre-shock
state. As a result, aggregate productivity remains below normal until year 8, as seen in the third
panel of the figure.       This compounds the fact that the aggregate capital stock is more that 5
percent below its usual level by the start of the recovery.
       Second, consumption does not begin to recover in date 5. Given a high demand for investment
goods, and output’s failure to rebound rapidly, households actually allow their consumption to
fall for two more periods and thereafter raise it only very slowly.              Third, during this episode,
it is the labor input that drives the recovery. Anticipating the subsequent rise in endogenous
productivity, and thus a raised return to savings, households abruptly raise their hours worked
from 36 percent to only 11 percent below normal within date 5. In the next date, the allocation
of capital across firms has begun to move back toward the long-run distribution, and the resulting
improvement in productivity directly encourages a further large rise in the labor input. At this
  29
       Because TFP led GDP in the 2007 recession, the change reported in Table 4 reflecting the 2007Q4 to 2009Q2
drop in TFP was less, at 060 percent.


                                                        40
point, it overshoots its average level by just over 1 percent. Thereafter, it remains high for many
periods while the capital stock is being rebuilt.
         One and a half years after the start of the recovery in 2009Q2, there is little net change in
total hours worked in the data. In the model, the recovery is stronger. In part because it fell
by less, employment regains two-thirds of its pre-crisis level within a year. In 2010Q4, private
investment is still more than 20 percent below its pre-recessionary level. Here again, the model
predicts a more rapid recovery, with investment less than ten percent below its steady state level
after one year. Nonetheless, these responses are more gradual than would be seen following an
equivalent shock to TFP.30
         The rapid growth in investment and employment, relative to the data, is in part a result our
assumption that lending conditions, as represented by the value of  , are completely restored
in one period. We have not examined gradual changes in  in the exercises presented above
largely because data restricting  period-by-period is unavailable. Moreover, our assumption of a
constant probability of complete reversal in  has allowed us to solve for impulse responses under
uncertainty. We have explored the economy’s response following a gradual recovery in  under
the assumption of perfect foresight.31 The recovery in investment and employment is somewhat
slower there, but that in output and consumption is also slowed.


7         Concluding remarks

          We have developed a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with persistent, firm-level
shocks to total factor productivity, costly investment reversibility and collateralized borrowing
constraints. We have calibrated the model to be consistent with U.S. evidence on establishment-
level investment dynamics, as well as overall measures of borrowing by non-financial firms. Our
resulting economy is characterized by a nontrivial distribution of firms over productivity, debt
and capital that shapes aggregate output and total factor productivity.
    30
         Consider an exogenous one standard deviation reduction in aggregate total factor productivity. Absent any
credit shock, this TFP shock would result in a similar fall in GDP to that seen in figure 10. If this shock was
eliminated at date 5, with the exogenous component of TFP immediately reset to its long-run level, then GDP
would complete 94 percent of its recovery instantaneously. By contrast, the corresponding instantaneous rise in
GDP in figure 10, following the elimination of the credit shock, is only 27 percent. Furthermore, the rapid increases
in employment and investment seen in figure 10 would be instantaneous with the elimination of a technology shock.

   Firms respond endogenously to the frictions they face and, over time, build suﬃcient precau-
tionary savings so as to ensure that borrowing limits will not aﬀect their investment. Only a small
subset of the firms in our economy have investment activities curtailed by their current ability
to borrow. Nonetheless, borrowing and investment decisions are inter-related for most firms, and
the risk associated with future collateral constraints aﬀects their current decisions with respect
to both.
   Our model predicts that, in a modern developed economy such as the U.S., the typical business
cycle may be relatively unaﬀected by financial frictions. Nonetheless, absent any real shock to the
economy, we find that a credit crisis on its own can generate a recession that is not only large, but
persistent. Because tight borrowing conditions deliver a long-lived disruption to the distribution
of capital, and thus to endogenous aggregate productivity, their aftermath is a gradual recovery
in output.
   The recession generated in our model by a credit shock is qualitatively diﬀerent from that
following a negative shock to aggregate productivity, and it more closely resembles the 2007 U.S.
recession in several respects. The decline in GDP is gradual. Consumption initially rises. The
response in investment is unusually severe relative to the fall in GDP. The decline in measured
TFP that accompanies these movements in output, consumption and investment is similar to that
in the data.
   While capturing several aspects of the recent U.S. recession, the credit shock we have consid-
ered here does not deliver the unusually slow recovery in investment and employment over the 18
months of data since the trough of the recession in 2009Q2. It is possible that tight credit has
aﬀected not only business fixed investment, but also firms’ ability to finance working capital used
to pay wages, and that lending conditions did not fully recover by the end of 2010 (Koepke and
Thomson (2011)). However, no such explanation is likely to reconcile the observed changes in
investment and employment with the growth in consumption and GDP. A more likely suggestion
proposed by Ohanian (2010) is that time-varying distortions in the labor market have been im-
portant in shaping employment over this recession. Given the complexity of our current model,
micro-founding such additional frictions is beyond the scope of this paper.
