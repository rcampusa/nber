1     Introduction
This paper uses the unique experiment of the European integration process to explore the
link between integration and price convergence in international markets. Few topics have
attracted as much attention and controversy in International Economics as the topic of con-
vergence to the Law of One Price (LOOP). While until a few years ago, one was hard-pressed
to …nd evidence in favor of the convergence hypothesis, the newly emerging consensus in the
literature seems to be that Purchasing Power Parity does hold in the long run, with a half-
life of shocks of …ve to six years (see Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000) for a detailed discussion).
The new evidence comes primarily from “bigger” data sets — use of panel data sets as in
Frankel and Rose (1996), Parslei and Wei (1996), Cecchetti et al (2000), etc., or exploitation
of longer time-series data for individual countries (see Taylor (2000a) for an overview) – and
methodological advances (Taylor 2000b). Still the slow speed of convergence documented in
international markets remains a puzzle. In their excellent study of price dispersion across
U.S. cities, Parsley and Wei (1996) report half-lives of shocks of four to …ve quarters for
tradeables, a substantially shorter time than the aforementioned …ve to six years estimated
in cross-country studies. While various explanations have been suggested in the literature
– with nominal exchange rate volatility being the primary contender – there is little agree-
ment as to what factors generate international price dispersion in the …rst place, and what
mechanisms can accelerate convergence to the LOOP.
    The goal of this paper is to shed light on the above question by focusing on a period that
is characterized by a distinct e¤ort to “integrate” national markets in Europe (1970-2000).
The progress towards integration took the form of removal of trade barriers, encouragement
- within limits - of arbitrage, harmonization of tax rates and other national regulations,
increased transparency, monitoring of cross-country price di¤erences, and, with the creation
of the European Monetary Union (EMU), reduction of exchange rate volatility in the later
years of our sample. To the extent that price dispersion was driven by any of the above
factors, we would expect to see accelerated convergence to the LOOP. Moreover, by relating
price dispersion (or the reduction thereof) to the timing of institutional changes, we hope to


                                              2
highlight the factors primarily responsible for deviations from the LOOP.
   Our approach to the above questions deviates from the traditional convergence literature
in that it is a distinctly micro approach. We focus on a particular market, the European
automobile market, and exploit a large panel data set that we have put together ourselves
over several years, containing observations on car prices and characteristics in …ve countries
over the period 1970-2000. We believe that this approach o¤ers three main advantages.
   First, the European car market has been a notorious example of deviations from the
LOOP in international markets. The persistent and exceedingly large cross-country price
di¤erences, for virtually identical products, have been the focus of intense public debate in
Europe. The European Commission has considered the European auto market a test case
for integration and ordered several investigations into the sources of these price di¤erences.
Furthermore, it has taken concrete steps to integrate the national markets and reduce price
dispersion. Hence, the car market is a natural starting point in an investigation of the
relationship between market integration and convergence.
   Second, while recent studies seem to “converge” in their …ndings on PPP, the evidence
pertains primarily to the relative versions of LOOP or PPP. As pointed out in Goldberg
and Knetter (1997), and Knetter and Slaughter (2001), this preoccupation with the relative
versions re‡ects data realities rather than research interests - typically, the data employed in
price comparisons are fairly aggregate price data or price indices (Parsley and Wei’s use of
disaggregate product level data from ACCRA is a notable exception). In general, disaggre-
gate data are easier to obtain for national markets, which is one of the reasons that studies
of the absolute version of the LOOP tend to focus on a single country. Disaggregate price
data for multiple countries need to be assembled individually, on a product-by-product basis
from national industry journals written in many di¤erent languages. Even when disaggregate
data are available, it is rarely the case that the identical goods assumption needed for the
absolute version of the LOOP holds. Yet, there is little doubt that absolute price di¤erences
can be indicative of market segmentation; few of us, for example, would characterize Europe
as an “integrated” market if there were a constant $3,000 di¤erence in the price of a Toyota
Corrolla across Belgium and Germany. One of the strengths of our data set - and this is


                                               3
why we had to collect the data ourselves - is that the detail of the information (prices of
individual car models plus characteristics) allows us to compare prices of identical products
across countries, and hence test not only the relative, but also the absolute version of the
LOOP.
       Finally, our focus on a particular market allows us a more in-depth analysis of the in-
stitutional details. It is the institutional analysis that helps us understand the sources of
market segmentation and relate particular measures aimed at integration to actual price
convergence.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we provide a brief
overview of the sources of segmentation in the European car market and discuss the steps
that have been taken in the last two decades to promote integration. We use this institutional
analysis as a basis for forming the hypotheses concerning price convergence that we examine
in Section 4. Section 3 discusses the data. Section 4 considers various speci…cations of
convergence equations, and reports our …ndings. To summarize our results, we …nd strong
evidence in favor of convergence towards both the absolute and the relative versions of
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). To our knowledge, this is the …rst study documenting
convergence towards the absolute version of the Law of One Price in international markets. 1
In comparison to previous studies our estimated speed of convergence seems surprisingly
high - the implied half-life of a shock is, depending on the speci…cation, between 1.3 and
1.6 years when we test the relative version, and between 5 and 8.3 years when we test the
absolute version of LOOP. Moreover, we …nd equally high speeds of convergence when we run
the regressions country-by-country, thus giving up the cross-sectional dimension of our panel
data. This contrasts with the widely held view in the literature that it was the transition
from time-series to panel data that allowed researchers to …nd support for the convergence
hypothesis. Finally, our results also seem to contrast with the …ndings of an earlier paper
by Gagnon and Knetter (1995) that focuses on the same market (automobiles), but uses
   1
       The closest analog to our study for domestic markets is Parsley and Wei (1996). Their work also
documents convergence to the absolute version of LOOP, but in a setting without trade barriers or currency
‡uctuations.

data from a di¤erent set of countries, and …nds strong evidence against the relative version
of the LOOP. We attribute this surprisingly strong evidence in support of the convergence
hypothesis to the progress towards integration in the European market.



2     Segmentation, Price Dispersion, and Integration in
      the European Car Market
When thinking about cross-country price dispersion, it is useful to distinguish conceptually
between two conditions that are required for the existence of price di¤erences. First, price
di¤erences require market segmentation. Second, conditional on markets being segmented,
we need …rms to have reasons to take advantage of this segmentation. Such reasons would
include cost di¤erences across markets, or di¤erences in the price elasticities of demand, in
which case the price di¤erences are indicative of price discrimination. With this concep-
tual framework in mind, we now discuss the institutions that generate segmentation in the
European car market and the factors that account for the price di¤erences.


2.1    The sources of market segmentation

Since the removal of tari¤ barriers in 1968, segmentation in the European auto market has
been driven by three distinct factors: the di¤ering national systems of type approval, the
distribution system, and the requirement of national registration. These factors add to the
transportation costs, information costs and language barriers that are also present in many
other European industries.
    The di¤ering national systems of type approval formed until recently a …rst major imped-
iment to consumers seeking to purchase a car abroad. Each European country had typically
its own set of vehicle requirements. Costly modi…cations of the imported vehicle were often
needed. Moreover, in most countries the job of checking and certifying the conformity of an
imported car was entrusted to the o¢cial importers. There is no doubt that this procedure
enabled them to control and monitor the cross-country trade in the cars they were selling.


                                             5
The granting of a certi…cate often took several weeks, involved costly trips, and required fees
that bore no relationship to the services provided. 2
       A second major obstacle to cross-border trade stems from the distribution system. Dur-
ing the 1970s and early 1980s many suppliers already instructed their dealers (threatening
to withdraw their concessions) not to sell to unauthorized resellers, in particular if the pur-
chase was intended for export. Discrimination against resellers occurred in several subtle
forms: excessive delivery lags, high deposit requirements, reservations to provide guarantee
outside the country of purchase, and higher prices (see BEUC, 1981 and 1982). Regulation
123/85 subsequently institutionalized these practices as a block exemption to the European
competition rules. This regulation was initially approved for 1985-95, but was renewed for
another 7 years in 1995. It e¤ectively introduced a system of selective and exclusive distribu-
tion, specifying in detail the potentially restrictive arrangements that are legally permitted
in agreements between car suppliers and their dealers.3 Selectivity means that the manufac-
turer can choose his/her dealers and restrain them from reselling to anyone but end-users or
approved sellers. Exclusiveness refers to the right of being the single seller in a designated
territory, implying restrictions to engage in active sales promotion outside the territory (or
country). Although the system in theory protected the rights to end-users to purchase their
cars abroad, many di¢culties were encountered. An anonymous dealer survey by BEUC
(1986) revealed a refusal to sell to foreign consumers in 20% of the cases; excessive delivery
lags for right hand drive cars for the U.K.; and lower discounts to foreigners. These prob-
lems need to be added to the high transportation and information costs for unexperienced
consumers seeking to purchase abroad. Furthermore, Regulation 123/85 formally erected ob-
stacles against independent commercial importers who attempted to purchase cars in bulk.
These were only allowed to act as intermediaries, with a written purchase authorization
   2
       For example, the general importer of General Motors in Belgium was convicted in 1975 for demanding
excessive fees with the evident intention to discourage parallel imports. BEUC (1982) reports that one
importer even charged the di¤erence between the two countries’ local prices as a fee for issuing the type-
approval certi…cate.
   3
     The regulation was explicitly motivated on the grounds that cars are durable goods, and need as such
high quality after-sales-service through an o¢cial distribution network.



                                                     6
from their customers. Though the Regulation stated that the European Commission could
withdraw the bene…ts of the Regulation in some instances, for example if price di¤erences be-
tween two member states (excluding the high tax countries Danmark and Greece) exceeded
12% over a period of 6 months, or 18% at any point in time, in practice these threats have
never been enforced.
   A third obstacle to trade between countries has been caused by the system of national
registration, which had the e¤ect of limiting trade of foreign, mainly Japanese models. Quan-
titative restrictions on imports from third countries, in particular Japan, have long existed in
various European countries (France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the U.K.). These restrictions
take the form of import quotas or voluntary export restraints. The problem is, of course,
that parallel imports from other European countries can undo the national restrictions. The
requirement of national registration resolves this problem, since it can control cross-border
trade of Japanese cars. In Italy, for example, there existed a tight quota of 3300 cars that
could be directly imported from Japan. The total number of Japanese cars that could be
o¢cially registered in Italy, including cars from other European countries, was limited to
23000 (slightly more than one percent of the Italian market). When the national quotas
were replaced in 1993 by a common import quota for the European Union as a whole, the
requirement of national registration continued to maintain uno¢cial national quotas under
various pretexts.
   Any remaining doubts about the degree of segmentation in European markets can be dis-
pelled by looking at the magnitude of parallel imports, the goods imported by unauthorized
resellers. Table 1 summarizes the evidence collected from various BEUC surveys. It reveals
that parallel imports have been quite low in all European countries. They generally do not
constitute more than three percent of the total market, and in many countries and years less
than one percent. These small numbers are even more remarkable, when one considers that
the average price di¤erence between the cheapest and the most expensive European country
has been around 30% of the car price.
   Given that markets are segmented, it is clear that …rms can charge di¤erent prices in
European countries. But why should they want to? Providing an answer to this question


                                               7
is important as it allows us to understand why barriers to arbitrage were erected in the
…rst place. Given that segmentation does not rest on “natural” barriers, but is the result
of regulations that re‡ect …rms’ lobbying e¤orts, understanding the incentives of …rms to
charge di¤erent prices in di¤erent markets is equivalent to understanding the incentives for
preventing arbitrage across markets. This question is investigated in detail in Goldberg and
Verboven (forthcoming). In the context of a structural model of the European auto market
they identify three main sources of price dispersion in Europe: cross-country di¤erences in
costs, di¤erences in the price elasticities of demand generating di¤erences in markups, and
import quota constraints. The …rst source (costs) seems particularly relevant for explaining
the high prices in the U.K. (better equipped cars, di¤erences in dealer discount practices)
and Germany (catalyzator, environmental regulations); the second source (price elasticities
of demand) explains the relatively high prices in Italy, where a strong preference for domestic
brands generates market power for the domestic …rm (Fiat); quota constraints are relevant
explanations for Italy, France and the U.K.. In addition, the authors document local currency
price stability that generates large variation in year-to-year price di¤erentials. This stability
is attributed primarily to the presence of a local component in marginal costs (around 35%
of marginal costs are estimated to be denominated in local currency), and, secondarily, to
markup adjustment that is correlated with exchange rate volatility.


2.2    The integration process

Against this background we can think of the integration process in the European car market
as having two goals: …rst, diminish the degree of segmentation, and, second, directly reduce
price di¤erences by eliminating sources of cost di¤erences and discouraging price discrimi-
nation. An important measure towards reducing segmentation has been the harmonization
of so-called “essential requirements” for new car models throughout the European Union.
A list of such requirements was set out as early as 1970; yet the process of actually imple-
menting speci…c changes has been very slow and gradual. For a long time countries had
the option of allowing their national type approval standards to co-exist with the European
directives. Most countries made use of this option. By 1987, only Italy had adopted the

                                               8
European directives as the single local standard. The harmonized type approval directives
eventually became mandatory, and fully replaced the national systems in 1995. To the extent
that these di¤ering national requirements have been responsible for cost di¤erences across
countries we would expect cross-country price di¤erentials to decline in absolute terms as a
result of integration. To the extent that national regulations have been used as an excuse
to prevent arbitrage, we would expect the integration process to have sped up convergence.
At any rate, we would expect these changes to show up only gradually given how slow the
harmonization process was.
   A second step towards integration was the relaxation of the exclusivity of the distribution
system when Regulation 123/85 was renewed in 1995; dealers can now advertize outside their
territory and carry competing brands. At the same time, there has also been some e¤ort to
prevent auto dealers from abusing the selectivity of the distribution system. For example,
the explicit condition was added that manufacturers should not restrict consumers, or inter-
mediaries acting on their behalf, to purchase from any dealer. In addition, the European
Commission has been carefully monitoring price di¤erences since 1992, and has explicitly
stated its preparedness to withdraw the bene…ts of the selective distribution system if price
di¤erences across states exceed 12% (this is the so-called 12% rule). The recent Volkswa-
gen case (1998) has also indicated the Commission’s intention to get more serious about
preventing dealers from abusing their privileges. Volkswagen was accused and convicted for
putting pressure on Italian dealers not to sell to German and Italian customers. This pres-
sure involved threats to 50 dealers to withdraw their licenses, and 12 licenses were e¤ectively
withdrawn. The penalties included a 102 million ECU …ne (about 10% of Volkswagen’s
annual pro…t), the largest …ne ever issued by the European Commission to a single …rm, and
the removal of Volkswagen’s rights as set out in the Regulation. Similar investigations are
under way against Opel and Mercedes. These investigations and penalties should have the
e¤ect of encouraging arbitrage across markets - in fact, parallel imports have been increasing
in recent years - and increasing the speed of convergence. In addition, one would also expect
manufacturers to be more hesitant to exercise price discrimination - at a minimum, they
might try to keep price di¤erences below the 12% benchmark. As a result, we would expect


                                              9
to see lower price di¤erentials across countries - in absolute terms.
    Further measures towards integration include tax harmonization and the recent transition
to the EMU (1998). As Table 1 indicates, tax rate di¤erences are now much smaller compared
to their levels in the past; the diminishing of tax di¤erences should reduce absolute price
di¤erentials. To the extent that price di¤erentials re‡ect local currency price stability, the
transition to a system of …xed exchange rates should substantially reduce the year-to-year
variation in price di¤erentials. While the transition to the EMU is too recent for us to be
able to detect its e¤ects on prices, the fact that Belgium, France and Germany have had a
system of quasi-…xed rates in the 1980’s and 1990’s, allows us to indirectly test the hypothesis
that a reduction of nominal exchange rate volatility translates to faster convergence to the
LOOP.
    In summary, in light of the recent developments in the European markets, one wonders
whether absolute price di¤erentials have been reduced and whether the speed of price con-
vergence for the countries in our sample has increased. Nevertheless, the above discussion
also suggests that impediments to arbitrage still exist, and that exchange rate volatility is an
issue throughout our sample period, especially for the U.K.. Given this, we start by asking
the basic question, whether the LOOP holds in our data.



3     A First Look at the Data
The data set we have constructed to examine price convergence is a large three dimensional
panel, containing information on approximately 150 vehicle makes per year in …ve distinct
European markets over the period 1970-2000. For each make we have information on sales,
list price, and physical characteristics such as engine attributes, dimensions, and performance
variables; these characteristics sometimes vary across markets. The …ve markets included in
our analysis are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. We focus our
attention on these …ve countries, both because of data availability constraints, and, more
importantly, because they represent the largest markets in Europe: collectively they account
for over 85% of total car sales in Europe every year. In addition, these countries represent a


                                              10
large spectrum for several reasons: the size of the market varies from ca. 400,000 units per
year in Belgium to almost 3 million cars in Germany; the degree of import penetration ranges
from ca. 30% in France and Germany to almost 100% in Belgium; the Japanese penetration
varies from ca. 1% in Italy to 20% in Belgium; tax rates vary from 14% in Germany to 33%
in France in the early years, and 25% later; and the C1-concentration index ranges from 53%
in Italy to 16% in Belgium; throughout our sample period Belgium tends to be the cheapest
destination, while the U.K. is associated with the highest prices.
   Because our information is at the vehicle make level, our cross-country price comparisons
refer to relatively homogeneous products (for example, we are comparing the price of a Honda
Civic in Belgium to the price of a Honda Civic in Germany). Nevertheless, to be absolutely
sure that we are comparing identical products, we use hedonic price regressions to control
for possible variation in characteristics or options of models across countries, and use the
residuals of these regressions as the relevant prices in our price convergence regressions.
   To obtain a preliminary idea about price dispersion and convergence in our data, it is
useful to look at some graphs based on more aggregate data …rst. To construct aggregate
price indices, we ran hedonic price regressions of the form:

                    ln(rpEuro
                         i;k;t ) = wi;k;t ° + µc + µ f + µ s;t + µ k;t + ² i;k;t


   The subscripts i, k and t refer to product i, country k and year t respectively. The
variable rpi;k;t refers to the raw, pre-tax price of car model i expressed in a common currency
(Euro). The vector wi;k;t consists of physical car characteristics (horsepower, size, etc.) that
may vary across markets, while µ c and µ f are market segment and …rm dummies respectively.
In addition, we include a set of source country/time dummies (µs;t ) to control for di¤erences
that may be due to a common cost shock facing …rms located in a particular country of
origin (e.g. an increase in wages facing all Japanese …rms). Given this speci…cation, the
destination/time e¤ects µ k;t capture the residual cross-country price di¤erences that cannot
be explained by di¤erences in quality or taxation across markets. All di¤erences are measured
in percentage terms relative to Belgium.
   Figure 1 plots the estimated price indices µk;t for the period 1970-2000. The …gure

                                                11
documents the same patterns reported in Goldberg and Verboven (forthcoming) for a sub-
period of this sample: (1) large and persistent cross-country price di¤erentials; and (2)
substantial year-to-year volatility. Belgium appears to be the cheapest country throughout
the sample period, while the U.K. is - in most years - the most expensive. These patterns
were robust to alternative speci…cations of the hedonic equation. Moreover, they were robust
to the use of more disaggregate price indices. For example, using a similar hedonic price
framework as the one described above, we estimated and plotted price indices for each
market segment separately (small, large, luxury, sports cars, etc.). The graphs exhibited
approximately the same magnitude and same volatility of price dispersion, indicating that
the patterns evident in Figure 1 are not driven by aggregation.
    Looking at Figure 1, one would be hard-pressed to claim price convergence. What is
perhaps most surprising is that, while prices seem to be coming together around 1990-92,
they start diverging again after 1992, a development that certainly runs against the idea of
the integrated “Europe 1992”. A closer examination of the graph reveals that it is the prices
in the U.K. and Italy that diverge the most. These two countries however experienced large
currency ‡uctuations in the 1990’s that may have a¤ected price convergence. More generally,
the price volatility exhibited in Figure 1 immediately brings exchange rates to mind, as there
is no other source of price dispersion as volatile as nominal exchange rates. Figure 2 plots
the exchange rates of the countries in our sample vis a vis Belgium; the correlation between
the evolution of price di¤erences in Figure 1 and the exchange rate ‡uctuations in Figure 2
is immediately apparent.
    Since the existence of price convergence over our sample period does not seem to be
an issue that can be settled through graphs or simple statistics, we now turn to a more
systematic investigation of price convergence.



4     Results on Price Convergence
This section investigates di¤erent versions of price convergence. We start by documenting
the persistence of long term price di¤erentials and providing an estimate of the speed of con-


                                             12
vergence, i.e. how fast deviations from the long-term price di¤erentials are eliminated. Next,
we investigate the e¤ects of the integration process; in particular, we examine whether long
term price di¤erentials have decreased over time, and whether the speed of convergence has
increased. In specifying the dependent variable we face two choices: De…ne the dependent
variable as ¢qi;k;t where q denotes the log- price level of product i in country k at time t;
or, alternatively, choose a benchmark country, and de…ne the dependent variable as ¢pi;k;t
where p refers to the log-di¤erence in the price of product i in country k relative to the
benchmark country. We chose the second approach with Belgium as the numeraire country.
Belgium provides a natural benchmark as it is both the country with the lowest car prices in
Europe, and the market with the fewest trade restrictions and lowest concentration. In the
context of arbitrage, we …nd it more appealing to focus on bilateral price di¤erences relative
to the cheapest country, rather than on deviations from a theoretical cross-country average.
A possible criticism of this approach is that the convergence results are not invariant to the
choice of the numeraire country (see Papell (1997), Wei and Parsley (1995), Cecchetti et al
(2000)). To address this criticism we also estimated convergence equations using di¤erent
countries as the benchmark (e.g., Germany), and also using the log-price level as the depen-
dent variable. 4 In both cases our results were very similar to the ones reported below, so
that we are con…dent that our conclusions are not due to the particular choice of the base
country.
       Because some of the vehicle makes are not available for all 31 years in our sample, our
panel is unbalanced. To deal with this issue we found it easiest to convert our data to a
balanced panel, by using the following procedure: First, we run hedonic price regressions to
control for quality, and …rm reputation di¤erences across markets. These regressions also
include interactions of market segment/country of origin/destination market/time dummies
on the right hand side. The coe¢cients of these dummies represent quality adjusted aver-
ages of individual vehicle make prices each year, by market segment, country of origin and
destination country. We use these quality adjusted prices to form the dependent variable
   4
       In this case we include time e¤ects on the right hand side of the convergence equations. Convergence in
this case is understood as convergence to an average across the countries in our sample.

used in the estimation.


4.1    The basic convergence equation

We start by estimating the following basic version of the convergence equation:


                                                      L
                                                      X
                       ¢pi;k;t = ®i;k + ¯pi;k;t¡1 +         ° l ¢pi;k;t¡l + "i;k;t          (1)
                                                      l=1

   Our estimation procedure is based on the work of Levin and Lin (1992) on unit root tests
with panel data. As noted above, the dependent variable is the log-di¤erence in the price of
product i in country k relative to Belgium. The main parameter of interest is ¯ that denotes
the speed of convergence. Under the null of no convergence, ¯ is equal to zero. In this
case a shock to pi;k;t is permanent. Convergence implies a negative ¯, with the approximate
half-life of a shock to pi;k;t given by ¡ ln(2)= ln(1 + ¯). Cecchetti et al (2000) also consider
an alternative speci…cation (based on work by Im et al (1997)), in which the coe¢cient ¯ is
allowed to vary across countries (¯ is replaced by ¯ k in this case); convergence here implies
a negative ¯ for some countries (¯k < 0, for some k); as opposed to all countries as in Levin
and Lin. We chose the Levin and Lin approach as it is the more conservative one - it is
unlikely that the behavior of only one or two countries will lead us to reject the unit root
hypothesis in this case. We do consider country-speci…c ¯’s however, later in subsection 4.3,
in which we estimate a separate convergence equation for each country pair in our sample.
   The dummies ®i;k capture product/country …xed e¤ects that account for non-time depen-
dent, product speci…c price di¤erences across countries. Such e¤ects could be transportation
costs (measured as percentages of price di¤erences), unobserved quality di¤erences that vary
by destination, or markup di¤erences. The presence of the product/country …xed e¤ects in
the estimation indicates that we are testing the relative version of the LOOP. In addition
to the speed of convergence ¯, we are also interested in examining the absolute values of
the ®i;k ’s; large values of these product/country speci…c e¤ects would indicate market seg-
mentation, even if the relative version of the LOOP held in the data. The lags ¢pi;k;t¡l are


                                               14
used to account for possible serial correlation in the error term.5 As a robustness test on our
results, we also estimated unpooled regressions by product, and the results were similar. We
therefore only report results from the pooled regressions here.
       Table 2, column 1, reports the estimation results for equation (1). The coe¢cient estimate
for ¯ is ¡0:41, with a t-statistic of ¡24. Note that in the pooled estimation we have 30 years
of data, and approximately 240 product and country speci…c dummies. The critical values
reported in Levin and Lin (1992) for t = 25 and N = 250 (approximately our panel size) are
¡21:98, ¡21:43 and ¡21:13 at the 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively. Based on these critical
values we can reject the null of a unit root (or no convergence). This results contrasts with
the …ndings of Parslei and Wei (1996) or Frankel and Rose (1995) who …nd it hard to reject
the unit root hypothesis when …xed e¤ects are allowed in the panel framework. It is also
remarkable that the implied half life of a shock is according to our estimates 1:3 years.
This is a much shorter interval than what is traditionally estimated with international data
(5 to 6 years); interestingly enough, it corresponds roughly to Parsley and Wei’s estimate
for tradeable goods in the United States, a market that we would normally consider more
integrated than Europe.6 Note, however, that Parsley and Wei’s basic speci…cation does
not include destination speci…c …xed e¤ects, while ours does. As mentioned above, such
…xed e¤ects may themselves be indicative of market segmentation. We therefore turn our
attention to our estimates of the …xed e¤ects next.
       The product/country speci…c dummies are jointly signi…cant at the 5% level. Rather
than reporting the individual product/country …xed e¤ects, Table 2 displays the country
average …xed e¤ects ( i.e. the averages of the ®i;k across products by country), and the
corresponding standard errors. By dividing these …xed e¤ects by ¡¯; we obtain the long-
term, systematic price di¤erentials across countries. The long-term price di¤erentials take
values between 5% (France) and 17% (U.K.) and are all highly signi…cant. They indicate the
   5
       The number of lags is determined using Campbell and Perron’s (1991) top-down approach. We start
by setting L = 5; if the absolute value of the t-statistic for °^ 6 is less than 1.96 then we reset L = 4 and
reestimate the equation. We repeat this procedure until the t-statistic of the coe¢cient with the longest lag
is greater than 1.96.
    6
      For services, Parsley and Wey …nd lower convergence rates, with a median of about 4 years.


                                                     15
presence of persistent price di¤erences relative to Belgium - the U.K. estimate, for example,
implies that during our sample period, U.K. quality adjusted prices are approximately 17%
higher than in Belgium. Price di¤erences of this magnitude seem at odds with the common
wisdom view of market integration - despite the fact that the unit root hypothesis is rejected
in the data. Comparing our results with the analogous …ndings of Parslei and Wei for the
U.S., it seems that the big di¤erence between Europe and the U.S. lies in the …xed e¤ects.
While our estimates of the speed of convergence are very similar, the …xed e¤ects are high
and statistically signi…cant in Europe, which is probably not the case in the U.S..
   The histogram of Figure 3 provides a more detailed description of the product/country
…xed e¤ects. Here the product/country dummies are averaged by market segment. Each
bar in the histogram represents the percent price di¤erence of the corresponding market
segment in the country of interest relative to Belgium. Note that the pattern of price
di¤erences seems relatively robust to di¤erent market segments. The only exception is the
luxury market segment in Germany which represents the only product group with prices
lower than in Belgium.
   Columns 3 and 5 of Table 2 also report results based on regressions in which (a) Germany
is used as the base country; and (b) there is no numeraire country, but the comparison of
price di¤erences is relative to a cross-country average (the speci…cation includes time e¤ects
in this case). The basic message of columns 3 and 5 that our conclusions are not sensitive
to the choice of the base country; the estimates of the convergence speed are very similar in
both cases to the ones obtained with Belgium as the base country.


4.2    The role of exchange rate changes

The literature on the relative version of PPP has suggested that nominal exchange rate
volatility in conjunction with short-term price rigidities may be important in explaining
international price di¤erences. To investigate the role of exchange rate changes, we also




                                             16
estimated the following equation:
                                             L
                                             X                       M
                                                                     X
              ¢pi;k;t = ®i;k + ¯pi;k;t¡1 +         ° l ¢pi;k;t¡l +         ± m¢e k;t¡m + "i;k;t   (2)
                                             l=1                     m=0

   The variable ek;t denotes the log of the exchange rate of country k’s currency relative to
the Belgian Franc. The lag structure of exchange rate changes is included to capture changes
in cross-country price di¤erentials that may result from short-term nominal rigidities. Figure
2 that plots the exchange rates of the four countries in our sample relative to Belgium suggests
that this may be an important issue. For example, the decline in the price di¤erential
between the U.K. and Belgium in the period 1990-92 coincides with the depreciation of the
pound. Without controlling for this depreciation we might be attributing this apparent “price
convergence” to institutional changes aimed at fostering integration, when the true source of
the change might in fact be just fortuitous movement of exchange rates in the right direction.
And vice versa, there might be periods where, despite e¤orts to increase integration, we may
observe a widening of price di¤erentials because of exchange rate changes that are not passed
though onto local currency prices in the short run.
   The results for the speci…cation that includes exchange rate changes are displayed in Table
2, column 2. In the reported speci…cation we included the exchange rate change and its …rst
three lags to capture pass-through e¤ects that may spread over several years. All variables
appearing in equation (2) are stationary - prices by virtue of the results in the previous
subsection, while for exchange rate changes we established stationarity separately. There are
two things to note in Speci…cation 2. First, our estimate of the speed of convergence hardly
changes compared to the speci…cation without exchange rates; the point estimate is ¡0:38 (t-
statistic: ¡23:3) implying a half-life of a shock of approximately 1.5 years. Nevertheless, the
exchange rate change and its …rst two lags are highly signi…cant. As expected, all coe¢cients
are negative, and declining in absolute value as the lags get longer. The magnitude of ¢ek;t is
striking (point estimate: -0.76, with a t-statistic of -32). It implies that only 24% of an
exchange rate change gets passed through (on average) onto local prices in the short run.
This is consistent with previous work on exchange rate pass-through that has documented
local currency price inertia. Note, however, that the coe¢cient on the …rst lag is substantially

                                                    17
smaller in absolute value (0.14). The robustness of the estimated speed of convergence to the
inclusion of exchange rate changes suggests that, while exchange rate changes and nominal
rigidities are important in the short run in explaining cross-country price di¤erentials, our
…nding of fast relative price convergence is not due just to movements of exchange rates in
the right direction.
       Of course, a natural objection to the above statement is that two of the countries in our
sample (France and Germany) had quasi-…xed exchange rates relative to Belgium for most of
our sample period. To investigate whether these quasi-…xed exchange rates may have had an
impact on our results, we next turn to bilateral regressions examining the price di¤erentials
in each of the countries in our sample relative to Belgium.


4.3        Country pairs

Table 3 reports the convergence coe¢cients (standard errors in parentheses) obtained by
estimating convergence equations for each country pair separately. The …rst row of numbers
was obtained using Belgium as the base country, the second row using France, and so on.
The striking feature of this table is that the estimated speeds of convergence are very high for
virtually all countries in our sample. While there is some variation in the point estimates of ¯
(it ranges from -0.35 for the Italy/Belgium pair to -0.60 for Germany/France), the coe¢cient
is always statistically signi…cant, and implies relatively short half-lives of price shocks (from
0.75 to 1.6 years). 7 Note that by estimating bilateral regressions, we give up the country
dimension in our panel data set - we only exploit the time variation in price di¤erences. In
light of this, our results are remarkable. Most previous work on price convergence failed
to reject the null of a unit root in the price series when time series data were used. The
recent …ndings on relative price convergence are often attributed to the use of panel data sets
which allow the econometrician to exploit the cross-sectional dimension. This explanation,
   7
       Note that the relevant critical values for this speci…cation are the ones corresponding to t=25 and N=50,
where N here denotes the number of products. These critical values are -10.89, -10.35 and -10.06 at the 1%,
5% and 10% signi…cance levels respectively (Levin and Lin (1992), Table 5). All the t-statistics of the
estimated ¯’s in Table 3 are less than -11.



                                                        18
however, does not seem to apply to our case. Of course, we do exploit a richer than usual
data set, in the sense that we have detailed data on multiple models.
   The results in Table 3 were obtained using a speci…cation that did not include exchange
rate changes. Including exchange rate changes leaves the ¯ coe¢cients virtually unchanged;
as before, the coe¢cients on the exchange rate changes are highly signi…cant. A notable
pattern concerning the exchange rate coe¢cients is that these are substantially higher in
absolute value in regressions in which the U.K. is compared to an other base country. For
example, in the U.K./Belgium regression, the coe¢cient on ¢e k;t , where e here denotes the
exchange rate between the Belgian Franc and the British Pound, is 0.81 (standard error:
0.04), while the exchange rate coe¢cients for the other countries range between -0.42 and
-0.69. This suggests that nominal exchange rate volatility is more important in explaining
price di¤erences in the U.K., relative to the other countries in our sample. This is not
surprising given that two out of the three remaining countries in our sample had a system
of quasi-…xed exchange rates.


4.4    Progress towards integration?

The previous results established (i) the persistence of long-term price di¤erentials across
countries, and (ii) a relatively fast convergence to the long-run equilibrium after price shocks
(half-lives of approximately 1.5 years). Our next question concerns the role of the integration
process. Our panel data set, that spans a period of 30 years, is ideal for addressing this
question. As discussed in Section 2, the European Commission has taken several measures
over the past three decades to improve European integration. Since most of these measures
have been implemented gradually, we found it most appropriate to use trend variables to
capture their e¤ect. We interpret these trend variables as applying only to our sample period:
1970-2000. To make sure that we are capturing the real e¤ects of integration, rather than any
nominal shocks, we include exchange rate changes in our speci…cation, as we did previously
in equation (2).
   Our primary hypothesis is that, to the extent that integration measures have had an e¤ect,
the absolute price di¤erentials (the …xed e¤ects) should have declined. To investigate this

                                              19
hypothesis, we interact the product/country …xed e¤ects with time trends. A second question
is whether the speed of convergence has changed over time. All else being equal, one would
expect integration to speed up price convergence: shocks to prices should be eliminated faster
if consumers or intermediaries can more easily engage in arbitrage. However, this expected
increase in the speed of convergence may not occur if the absolute price di¤erentials have
declined as a result of integration. This is because of the commonly observed non-linearities in
the speed of price convergence: large shocks and large price di¤erences tend to be eliminated
faster than small di¤erences. If integration reduces price di¤erences across countries, then
price shocks may be eliminated more slowly, not because impediments to arbitrage have not
diminished, but because the price di¤erences to be eliminated are smaller compared to the
pre-integration period. To capture the e¤ect of integration on the speed of convergence we
interact the convergence coe¢cient with a time trend.
   Table 4 reports the results. Column 1 considers the e¤ect of integration on the absolute
price di¤erentials. The underlying equation is:


                                                    L
                                                    X                       M
                                                                            X
       ¢pi;k;t = ®i;k + ®~k ¤ trend + ¯pi;k;t¡1 +         ° l ¢pi;k;t¡l +         ±m ¢ek;t¡m + "i;k;t   (3)
                                                    l=1                     m=0

   We focus on a speci…cation where only the country average …xed e¤ects ®
                                                                         ~ k are interacted
with a trend, so that our trend coe¢cient captures the e¤ect of integration on average price
di¤erentials in each market relative to Belgium. It is important to note here that we use
the trend only to capture gradual integration during our sample period (see the institutional
discussion in Section 2), and not long-run growth out of sample. The estimated coe¢cients
indicate that the average price levels in France, the United Kingdom and especially in Italy
have declined signi…cantly relative to Belgium. The annual declines range from 0.7 percent
(France) to 1.5 percent (Italy). In contrast, the average price level in Germany has increased
(moderately) relative to Belgium. Yet the country …xed e¤ects show that Germany had a
lower price level than France, Italy and the United Kingdom at the beginning of the sample.
The change of the …xed e¤ect for Germany thus shows convergence of the German price
level to the price levels in the other countries. Overall, these country averages indicate a

                                               20
gradual increase in integration. Nevertheless, it is possible that, while the country averages
demonstrate a trend towards price convergence, prices at the product level are still dispersed.
To examine this possibility, we tested whether the deviations of the country/product …xed
e¤ects from the average country …xed e¤ects were signi…cant. Only 22 percent of these
deviations were signi…cant at the 5% level. Most of the deviations fell within the ¡3% + 3%
range.
   Column 2 of Table 4 considers the e¤ect of integration on the speed of convergence. The

   It turns out that integration has had little e¤ect on the speed of convergence; if anything,
the speed of convergence has decreased (the decrease is signi…cant at the10% level). This
may follow from the presence of non-linearities, as suggested above.
   In sum, we conclude that integration has led to a gradual reduction in the average
price di¤erentials during 1970-2000, yet the speed of convergence in response to shocks has
remained more or less una¤ected. This is perhaps not surprising given that our estimate of
the speed of convergence is comparable to the speed of convergence in the more integrated
U.S. market.


4.5      Convergence to the absolute LOOP

So far our discussion has focused on convergence to the relative version of the LOOP. As
mentioned at the beginning, this has traditionally been the focus of the literature on interna-
tional price convergence. Next, we turn our attention to the absolute version of the LOOP.
The nature of our data (disaggregate product level data) is ideal for testing this version of
the LOOP.
   The basic equation we estimate to test for convergence to the absolute LOOP is:



                                                  21
                                                       L
                                                       X
                               ¢pi;k;t = ¯pi;k;t¡1 +         ° l ¢pi;k;t¡l + " i;k;t                    (5)
                                                       l=1

       Note that this equation is similar to equation (1), except for the omission of the prod-
uct/country …xed e¤ects. The results from this speci…cation are reported in Table 5, column
1. Column 2 of the same table reports results from a speci…cation that includes, in addition
to the right-hand side variables in (5), the exchange rate change and its lags. In both columns
1 and 2, the hypothesis of a unit root is easily rejected. The coe¢cient ¯ is negative, with
t-statistics equal to -12 in column 3, and -8.7 in column 4, while the critical values according
to Levin and Lin (1992) for T=25, N=250, and no intercepts, are -2.34 at the 1% level, and
-1.67 at the 5% level. Note, however, that the implied speeds of convergence are substantially
lower compared to our estimates when product/country …xed e¤ects were included in the
equation. The ¯ estimate in column 1 implies a half-life of a shock of approximately 5 years,
while the convergence coe¢cient in column 2 implies a half-life of 8.3 years. These numbers
seem more in line with the estimates traditionally obtained in the International literature on
price convergence. But while the estimates in the literature usually refer to convergence to
the relative version (i.e., the half-lives represent the time that elapses until price di¤erentials
return to their long-run level), in our case the half-lives refer to convergence to the absolute
LOOP (that is the time that elapses until price di¤erentials are eliminated). In this sense,
one can claim that our results on convergence are much stronger than the ones previously
obtained for international markets.
       There is an obvious caveat to the speci…cation (5): the estimation pools data across
products. Including product (but not country) dummies reduces the estimated ¯ coe¢cients
to values around -0.20, but in this case there is no correspondence between our speci…cation
and the speci…cations considered in Levin and Lin. Accordingly, the appropriate critical val-
ues for testing the unit root hypothesis are not available to us.8 We therefore employed an
   8
       The results from speci…cations that include product speci…c, but not country speci…c dummies, are
reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5.    Given that the critical values are not available to us, we cannot
formally test the unit root hypothesis in these two cases. But we can get an idea in which direction the ¯
coe¢cients change when product dummies are included.


                                                    22
alternative approach and estimated equation (5) on a product-by-product basis. There are
too many coe¢cients to report in this case, but the general picture that emerges from the
estimation supports our conclusions from the previous paragraph: the estimated convergence
speed is substantially lower when we test for the absolute version, compared to the speci…-
cation with the country …xed e¤ects. The ¯ coe¢cients vary from -0.15 to -0.05, implying
half-lives between 4 and 13 years. While the majority of the coe¢cients are statistically
signi…cant, the number of the ones that are not, is substantial.
    Overall, our results on the absolute version of the LOOP indicate that, while the hypoth-
esis of a unit root is rejected, the results are weaker compared to the tests for the relative
version. The fact that the …xed e¤ects estimated in equations (1) and (2) were jointly sig-
ni…cant, also argues in favor of the hypothesis that deviations from the absolute LOOP still
exist – even if we cannot formally reject convergence when estimating equation (5). This
is not surprising given that, as discussed in Section 2, impediments to arbitrage still exist
in European markets. Nevertheless, our estimates of the trend variables in the previous
subsection in conjunction with the results on absolute convergence suggest that violations
of the LOOP are diminishing over time, and are certainly not as pronounced as previously
found in studies of international markets.



5     Conclusions
This paper set out to investigate convergence to the LOOP in international markets using
detailed product-level data. We view our results as providing strong evidence in favor of
both the absolute and relative versions of the LOOP. In particular, there are two features of
our …ndings that distinguish them from those of previous studies: (1) When testing for the
relative version of PPP we estimate half-lives of shocks (1.3-1.6 years) that are substantially
shorter than the ones estimated in earlier work; (2) We cannot reject the hypothesis of
convergence to the absolute LOOP. While our …ndings regarding the absolute LOOP are
not directly comparable to other international studies (as pointed out before, international
studies usually focus on relative PPP), it is remarkable that the half-lives of shocks we


                                              23
estimate under absolute PPP (5 to 8 years) correspond roughly to the half-lives estimated by
other researchers under relative PPP. A comparison to the results of Parsley and Wei (1996)
for the domestic market is also instructive. Our half-life estimates under relative PPP are
similar in magnitude to the ones obtained by Parsley and Wei under absolute PPP, while
the country/product …xed e¤ects capturing long-term, persistent price di¤erentials across
markets, are jointly signi…cant. Under absolute PPP, our half-life estimates are noticeably
higher. These results taken together suggest that one important di¤erence between domestic
and international markets may be the presence of the …xed e¤ects. While our estimation did
account for short-term rigidities associated with nominal exchange rate volatility, we found
no evidence that our results on price convergence were driven by exchange rate changes in
the right direction.
   When interpreting our results it is important to keep in mind that they were obtained
using data from Europe, a market that has undergone many changes in the last two decades
in order to become more integrated. We are therefore hesitant to generalize our …ndings to
other international markets. Rather, we view them as evidence that the progress towards in-
tegration in Europe has had visible e¤ects on cross-country price dispersion that are re‡ected
in tests of the LOOP.
