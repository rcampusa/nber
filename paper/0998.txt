                                ABSTRACT



     Our paper seeks to provide an explanation for why the prevalence of

COLA provisions and their characteristics vary widely across U.S. indus-

tries. We develop models of optimal risk sharing between a firm and

union that allows us to investigate the determinants of a number of charac-

teristics of onion contracts. These include the presence of wage indexa—

tion, the degree of wage indexation if it exists, the magnitude of deferred

noncontingent (on the price level) wage increases, the duration of labor

contracts and the trade—off between temporary layoffs and wage indexatlon.

Preliminary empirical tests of some of the implications of the model are

conducted using industry data on both the prevalence of COLA provisions and

layoff rates, and using contract level data on the characteristics of COLA

provisions and contract duration. One key finding is that the level of

unemployment insurance benefits appears to simultaneously influence the

level of layoffs and the extent of COLA coverage.

      Cost—of—living escalator clauses in union contracts tie, or index,

 workers' wages to some index of prices, such as the Consumer Price Index.

 The first major U.S. labor contract to contain such a provision was the

 1948 contract between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers.'

 The prevalence of such provisions spread duringthe-inflatjon that accom-

 panied the Korean War, but interest in them waned as the economy experi-

 enced stable prices during the early 1950s. As a result, by January 1955,

 only 23 percent of those workers covered by major collective bargaining

agreements, agreements that covered 1,000 or more workers, were also

covered by contracts that included cost—of—living provisions (Table 1).

When prices rose during the late 1950s coverage expanded, as large national

Contracts in steel, aluminum and can, railroads, and electrical equipment

incorporated such provisions. The relative price stability of the early

1960s led to a reduction in coverage; indeed the cost—of—living provision

was dropped from the steel contract in 1962. Since 1966, however, high

rates of InflatIon have been associated with steady increases in coverage

and during the 1976—1981 period roughly 60 percent of workers covered by

major union contracts were also covered by cost—of—living provisions

(Table 1).

     The growth in the prevalence of cost—of—living provisions (COLA's),

has led to a rekindling of both academic and public interest in the topic

and this interest has taken a number of forms. 2   First, attention has

been directed towards the role of COLA's In the inflationary process.

During the l97Os the wages of employees in heavily unionized industries

who were covered by COLA's grew significantly relative to the wages of

other employees in the economy.3 In addition, the growing prevalence

 welfare gains.

        Finally, another stream of research has focused on the implications

 of COLA's for microeconomic efficiency, in particular the sharing of risks

 of uncertain outcomes by firms and workers. These papers are in the tra—

 dition of the "implicit contract" literature and they focus on the optimal

 degree of indexation from the perspective of a micro—level decision
                                                                     making
       8
 unit.   In particular, they examine the effects of such variables as the

expected rate of inflation, uncertainty, employee risk aversion, the cost

of indexing and nonlabor income on the optimal degree of indexing.

       Somewhat surprisingly, although the latter two streams of literature

have focused on the determination of the optimal degree of indexation at

the aggregate and micro levels, there have been only a few attempts to see

if these theories can be used to explain either the varying prevalence of

COLA's in the aggregate U.S. economy over time or why the prevalence of

COLA's and their characteristics varies across industries at a point in

time.9 Table 2 presents data for November of 1980 that indicate quite

clearly that the prevalence of COLA's in major collective bargaining agree-

ments varies widely across industries. Moreover, one can not attribute

these differences solely to differences in union strength; for example, a

strong national union exists in bituminous coal mining and strong local

unions exist in construction, but in neither industry are there many

contracts with COLA's.

       Our paper seeks to provide an explanation for why the prevalence of

COLA   provisions   and their characteristics vary widely across U.S. industries.

contract provisions. The following two sections attempt to test sonic of

the hypothuses that these models generated. Section VII uses pooled cross—

section time—series data at the two—digit manufacturing industry level

to ascertain the determinants of both the proportion of unionized workers

who are covered by COLA's and industry layoff rates. Section VIII uses

individual contract data to ascertain the determinants of COLA coverage,

the characteristics of COLA's when they exist, and the determinants of

the duration of contracts. Finally, Section IX summarizes what we have

learned from the paper and provides some concluding remarks.



             II. A ONE-PERIOD MODEL WITH FIXED EMPLOYMENT


     Consider first the following simple one—period model. A union and

an employer must decide on the provisions of a collective bargaining agree—

nient before the aggregate price level is known. At the time negotiations

take place, the aggregate price level p. is equal to unity, but during

the period that the contract will cover the price level is uncertain; the

expected value of p during the period is denoted by          and its coef-

ficient of variation by     >   0.   We also treat the firm's production function,

its demand curve, and the prices of its nonlabor inputs as being uncertain,

in a manner to be specified below.

     In principle, an optimal risk sharing arrangement would make both the

wage and the employment level contingent on the realized outcomes of the

aggregate price level, the firm's productivity, its demand curve (as

proxied perhaps by its output price level), and the price of its nonlabor

inputs. For now, however, we assume that the employment level is pre-

determined and equal to the number of union members, N. Thus, there is
                                                                      6




no temporary layoff unemployment in this model; in Section VI we relax this

assumption and allow the employment level to vary across states of the world.

     In addition, we assume that when the employer and the union negotiate

a wage schedule w, this wage is contingent upon, or indexed only to the

aggregate price level



     (1)      w =   w(p).


Virtually all contracts with COLA's in the United States are structured

in this manner and only rarely are wages explicitly tied to future produc-

tivity, industry price levels, or input price levels.10 Our failure to

observe more contracts which also tie wages to these variables, undoubtedly

reflects factors such as moral hazard (firms may have some control over

their output prices) and the costs of obtaining information and enforcing

such contracts (the difficulties involved in measuring productivity and

demand shifts, etc.))' Later, however, we will indicate how allowing

contracts to be contingent on these variables would alter the results.

     Suppose that workers are risk averse and have cardinal utility functions

of the form



              U =   U[(w/p)   + M]      U' > 0          U" <   0.
      (2)




 Utility depends on the worker's real income in a period, with M being

 the level of real nonwage labor income. For now we treat M as being

 identically equal to zero; later we will indicate how the extent that it

 varies with the price level effects the optimal degree of indexation of
                                                                       7




wages. Note that when M is equal to zero, for a given wage schedule,

a worker's expected utility (E U(w/p)) depends only on the distribution

of the price level during the period.

     The firm uses labor (L) and a composite variable input (X) to

produce output (Q) via the production function relationship



               Q =
     (3)
                     f(L,X,e1).

Here e1 is a random productivity shock whose realized value becomes

known only after the contract is signed. That is, productivity is uncer-

tain at the time of the negotiations. For simplicity, we assume that e1

is independent of both the distribution and realization of the aggregate

price level.

     Demand for the firm's output is assumed to depend both on the price

charged by the firm and on the amount of unanticipated inflation, with the

latter defined by




The notion is that unanticipated inflation in the aggregate price level may

lead to increases In the demand for some firms' products and decreases in

the demand for others.'2

     Specifically, we assume that the inverse demand function can be

written



               q =
     (5)             pg(Q,,e2)
                                                                               8




where q is the price of the firm's product, e2 is a random demand

shock whose realization becomes known only after negotiations are concluded

and the inclusion of Q allows the firm to face a downward sloping

demand curve. The demand shock is assumed to be independent of the distri-

bution of the aggregate price level and accordingly we assume that the real

price of its product (q/p) that the firm can charge for any specified

output level is independent of the expected inflation rate.

     The price of the variable input X is also assumed to depend on the

amount of unanticipated inflation and is given by



        (6)    z =




where     z is the price of the input and e3 is a random cost shock. As

with the other shocks, the realized value of e3 becomes known only after

the negotiations are completed and e3 is assumed to be independent of

the distribution of the aggregate price level (although it need not be

independent of e1 and e2). The firm is assumed, in (6), to be a price

taker in the market for the other input for expositional convenience only.

        Since initially employment (L) is always equal to the number of

union members, the firm's profit        (ir)   is given by



                                                     —              — wN

The variable input X is chosen after the realized values of all of the

 random variables are known and, conditional upon them, X             is always chosen

 by the firm to maximize profits. Assuming an interior solution always

 exists, this requires that
                                                                            9

     The firm's objective is to maximize its expected utility from real

profit

where V is a cardinal utility function, V > 0,         and V'1 <   0(=0)   if

the firm is risk averse (risk neutral). Given a wage schedule w(p), the

firm's expected utility obviously depends upon the distributions of all of

the random variables in the model.

    The goal of the union is to maximize the representative worker's

expected utility, while the goal of the firm is to maximize its expected

utility. It is beyond the scope of this paper to model the bargaining

process and show how it may lead to an agreed upon contract.13 The only

assumption that we make here is that the parties will reach a contract

that provides for efficient sharing of all risks stemming from unanticipated

inflation. Such contracts can be obtained by choosing a wage indexation

schedule that maximizes

employer receives. Other things equal, higher values of A reflect

greater employer bargaining power.

      In general each of these variables is a function and not a parameter.

In what follows when we talk about a change in any one of them we mean a

shift in the whole schedule.

      The elasticity of the wage rate witli respect to the aggregate price

level, c, is a measure of the extent to which the wage rate is indexed

to the price level. It is straightforward to show (see Appendix A) that

maximization of (10) subject to (1) —              (9)   yields that the optimal degree

of indexation is given by

                               e


That is, the optimal degree of wage indexation depends on both factors

                                                                                 11




exogenous      to the bargaining process (such as the     extent   of employer and

employee risk aversion) and on the outcome of the bargaining process

itself (such as the level of wages).

     Note that if the firm is risk neutral       (V't =   0)    indexation is com-

plete (c =      1).   In this case, the real wage is independent of the aggre—

gate price level and the firm fully insulates workers against inflation

risks. Since collective bargaining agreements seldom call for

complete indexation, throughout the rest of the paper we assume that the

firm is risk ,averse.

     It is apparent from (12) that the elasticity of the firm's real value

added with respect to the aggregate price level, A, is a key variable in

determining the extent of indexation. If A is greater (less) than zero,

so that increases in the aggregate price level increase'(decrease) the

firm's real value added, then the firm shares the rewards (costs) of infla-

tion by providing workers with a more than (less than) complete indexation.

That is,




     (13) c1                    as AO

That is, indexation is not necessarily less than full; optimal risk—sharing

agreements may call for workers to be "overcompensated" for inflation. Of

course, if inflation is neutral In the sense that the firm's demand and

the price of nonlabor inputs are unaffected by unanticipated inflation

(a = b   = 0    for all e), then e = 1.     In this special case inflation

risk affects the firm only through its effect on real wages, and full

indexation elimintes all inflation risk for both workers and firm. The
                                                                          12




firm is stil.l exposed to other risks (e), but since these are not

related to inflation they cannot be alleviated by indexation to the

aggregate price level)4

     The first column in Table 3 summarizes the main comparative static

results that follow from equation (.12); how changes in various factors

influence the optimal degree of indexation. An increase in the elasticity

of the demand curve with respect to unanticipated inflation (a)       increases

the degree of indexation since the larger the increase in real value—added

that results from an unanticipated increase in prices, the larger the "pie"

that is available to share with workers. Conversely, the larger the

elasticity of other input prices with respect to unanticipated inflation

(b), the more disadvantageous is the unanticipated inflation to the firm

and therefore the smaller the degree of wage indexation that occurs.

     The effect of the elasticity of the firm's demand curve with respect

to its real price ii,   depends upon the relationship of a and b. To see

this, consider first the special case where these two elasticities are

equal (a =   b).   ifl this case, unanticipated inflation causes identical

percentage changes in the real marginal revenue product of nonlabor inputs

(MRP) and in the inputs' real price. Since the input level, x, is always

chosen so that its real marginal revenue product equals its real price

(eq. (8)), there will be no adjustment in the amount of the input used and

hence in output. In terms of Figure la the firm will move      from M to N.

Consequently, the value of    i-i   does not affect the change in real value—

added in this case and c will be independent of n.

     In contrast, if a is greater than b, a higher unanticipated infla-

tion implies a higher percentage increase in MRP        than in z. In order
                                                                                13



to maintain the equal ity between the       variable   input's marginal revenue
product and    its price   the   amount of the input   and hence   output must be

higher.    The magnitude of this effect will be larger the higher the
elasticity   of the marginal revenue product curve with respect to the input.

This is illustrated in Figure lb where we assume that a is greater than

b. The firm will move from M to 0 with a less elastic demand curve and

from M to P with a more elastic one. The latter case is associated with

a greater increase in real value—added and thus we should observe a higher

degree of indexation associated with it. Since,other things equal, higher

values of the elasticity of the firm's demand curve with respect to its

real price are associated with more elastic marginal revenue product curves

for the variable input, higher elasticities of the demand curve will lead

to higher values of wage indexation in this case.'5 In contrast, if a is

less than b, similar reasoning shows that increasing the elasticity of

the firm's demand curve with respect to its own price will reduce the

extent of indexation.

      The key point here, then, is that the firm's elasticity of demand with

respect to its own real price (ri) does affect the optimal degree of wage index—

ation, but that the direction of the effect depends upon the relationship

of a and b, the elasticities of the firm's demand curve and its other

input prices with respect to unanticipated inflation. If a is greater

(less) than b, higher values of r lead to more (less) wage indexation.

Since a higher elasticity of output with respect to the variable input ()

is   also associated with a higher elasticity of the variable input's MRP

curve, analogous results follow with respect to this variable. That is,

increases in       are associated with increases (decreases) in the extent

of indexation if a is greater (less) than b.
                                                                           14




     Several other results are easier to explain. First, the more risk

averse woikers are, the greater is the value to them of smoothing varia-

tions in the real wage. Consequently, increased risk aversion (S) is

associated with values of c closer to unity. Note that if the optimal

degree of indexation is initially less (greater) than unity because A is

less (greater) than zero, increasing the extent of employee risk aversion

will increase (decrease) the extent of indexation.'6

     Second, the optimal degree of indexation is independent of both the

expected level of inflation (5) and the uncertainty of inflation (s).

These results follow directly from the assumption that all 'real variables

are unaffected by the distribution of p, as opposed to its realized
         17
value.

     Finally, the optimal degree of indexation also depends on the residual

uncertainty in real value added; the uncertainty in real value added caused

by shocks to productivity, demand, and other input prices.        Unfortunately,

its effect on the optimal degree of indexation depends upon many parameters

in the model and how they change. If one further assumes, however, that

                                                        is the firm's relative
a, b, r, , A and R (where R = —(V"/V)(lT/p)
risk aversion) are constant, it can be shown (see Appendix A) that



                                  as A(S — R)       0
        (14)          ' 0                       -


where          the coefficient of variation of real value added is used as

a measure of the residual uncertainty in real value—added. If employee

relative risk aversion (S)      is greater than employer relative risk

aversion, this implies that increased residual uncertainty makes indexation

less perfect (further from unity).18
                                                                                          15




       Before   conci uding this section, two           extensions    of the mode.I warrdnt
being briefly discussed. First, suppose that we relax the assumption that
the   employee's   nonlahor income, M, is always zero. Assuming that the

level   of nonlabor income is positive, its effect on the optimal degree

of   wage indexation dependsupon how it varies with the price level. If

the level of nonlabor income is fixed in nominal terms, then to stabilize

the sum of real wages and real nonlabor income will require a greater

degree of wage indexation than in the absence of the nonlabor income, assum-

ing that indexation is positive. In contrast, if the nonlabor income is fixed

in real terms (perfectly indexed), then any desired degree of real income stabi—

lization (not equal to perfect stabilization) can be achieved with now less

perfect wage indexation Cc further from unity).

       Second, suppose we now allow wages to be indexed not only to the aggre-

gate price level, but also to the shocks to the firm's productivity, demand

curve, and input prices. In this case, one can show that



        (15)        =

               c ge2Rl — p3)      and         =

       Observe that (15) suggests that if employers are risk neutral (R = 0)

then wages are tied only to the aggregate price level (in this case recall

that c = 1)        and not to the other forces. If firms are risk averse, in
                                                                         16




theory wages should be tied to all of the other forces. However, small

values of the elasticity of the firm's total revenues with respect to

its output (),    of   the elasticity of its output with respect to other

inputs (s),   and of the elasticities of output, demand, and input prices

with respect to the random shocks will reduce the extent to which wages

are tied to the other forces. These factors, in addition to the ones we

have described above, may explain why wages are typically not indexed to

anything other than the aggregate price level.



                       III. THE DECISION TO INDEX


     As Table 1 indicates, in recent years approximately 60 percent of

all unionized workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements

are also covered by COLA provisions. It would be coincidental if the

optimal degree of wage irtdexation implied by (12) was zero for 40 percent

of unionized employees. What factors are responsible then for such a

large fraction of workers having contracts that are not indexed at all?

     The answer hinges on the possibility that there may be fixed real

costs per worker of negotiating or administrating indexation clauses that

must be borne either by the union or the employer. These costs may arise

from a number of factors. For example, if a contract is indexed, union

leaders may not receive "credit" from their members for the periodic

nominal wage increases that automatically arise due to inflation. As a

result, to maintain their political positions in the union, union leaders

may push during contract negotiations for additional periodic noncontingent

money wage increases; this may make it more difficult to reach a contract

settlement.
        To take another example, in a world of heterogeneous workers of

differing skill levels, employers would like to have the flexibility to

alter relative wages in response to external shortages or surpluses of

workers in particular skill classes. COLA provisions, however, typically

are specified as a given percentage increase in wages for each percentage

increase in prices, or as a given absolute increase in wages for each

percentage point increase in prices.             The former scheme rigidly preserves

relative wage rates, while the latter causes skill differentials to be

compressed. In either case, the employer loses the ability to alter rela-

tive wages during the period covered by the contract and this reduces his

willingness to agree to COLA provisions.

        Suppose that we can represent these fixed real costs per worker of

having an indexed contract by c., then the total cost of indexation is

c1N. Indexation of course yields benefits to both the employer and the

employees in terms of risk sharing. The monetary value of these benefits

to them is the total amount in real terms that both parties would be

willing to pay to have wages indexed. Appendix B shows that this real

amount is approximately equal to



        (16)              1 22    (S —   NEV"/EV'),


where          =   w()/, = ()/, c          is evaluated at ,   S   is evaluated at

   and V' and V't are evaluated at 9Thus, the sum of the net benefits

per employee to both parties from having an indexed contract is



        (17)        B =   2c2(S   — NEV"/EV') —

 that may influence COLA coverage.

tion, if lit   occurs,   also influence the probability of indexation. However,

as   Table 3 indicates, in several cases the effect of a variable on the

former may be different than its effect on the latter, and one variable,

the coefficient of variation of expected inflation, influences only the

latter.



              IV. A TWO—PERIOD MODEL, DEFERRED PAYMENTS, AND THE
                     RELATIONSHIP BEWTEEN CONTRACT LENGTH
                              AND COLA GENEROSITY


      The models discussed in the previous two sections provide a number of

insights into the determinants of COLA provisions in union contracts.

They are not structured in a way, however, that enable us to address a

set of related issues. These include, what determines the length of col-

lective bargaining agreements? How do COLA provisions vary with contract

duration? What determines the size of deferred wage increases that are

not contingent on the price level in multiperiod contracts? Is there a

trade—off between deferred increases and COLA provisions? To answer these

questions one must move to a multiperiod model and we do so in this and

the following section.

      We consider for simplicity a two—period model in which neither firms

nor workers can borrow or lend. Let a subscript 1 (2) denote period

1 (2). A representative worker's utility is given by



       (19)     U=               + 1J2(w2/p2)
                     U1(w1/p1)
                                                                            20




and the firm's utility by



             V =              +
     (20)
                   V1(1/p1)       V2(i2/p2)


where the within—period utility functions may differ to allow for dis-

counting and other factors.

     The production function in period i (for i equal to 1 or 2) can be written



             Q. =
     (21)           f.(L.,X.,e1.)

and this function may differ between periods to allow for productivity

growth. Finally, the inverse demand functions and the prices of nonlabor

inputs are assumed to be given by (22) and (23) respectively.



     (22)    q1 =   p1g1(Q1,1,e21),

             q2



     (23)    z1 =   p1h1(1,e31)

             z2 =



Note that this specification also both allows the demand function and input
price schedules to change between periods and the effects of unanticipated

inflation to persist over time, so that unanticipated inflation in period

1 may affect the demand curve and other input prices in period 2.23 While

the vector of error terms e1 =                       and e2 =                    are
                                     (e11,e21,e31)              (e12,e72,e32)
                                                                                   21




assumed     to be independent of   the real ized   values of p1 and p2,     they

are   not   required to be independent of each other.

      The wage that will prevail in the second        period   of the contract can

be written as



       (24)     w2 =   w1y()


where w1 is the wage that prevails expost in period 1,                 equal to

p2/p1 is the actual relative increase in the price level in the second

period, and y() is the multiplier that translates the wage in period

1 into the wage in period 2. We assume that the realization of                is

independent of the realization of p1 and that its expected value (the

expected inflation rate in period 2) is ,            the   same expected rate as in

period 1. It is straightforward to see that the deferred wage change, as

a percentage of the wage that prevails in period 1 is given by D minus

one where



       (25)     D =    y(l).

When D Is greater than (less than) unity a deferred increase (decrease)

is called for in the contract.

       As before, the firm will always choose the variable inputs in each

period to maximize the profits in that period and, assuming that an Interior

solution exists,



                           =            = 0

and   all contracts that optimally share inflation risks can be obtaintd
by choosing indexation schemes w1(p1) and v() to                       maximize

(remembering that in general each of these may vary and hence is not neces-

sarily a parameter)

     Note that we have restricted the way in which inflation in period 1

may affect the wage rate in period 2 by the specification of (24). Efficient

sharing of inflation risks would in general require the second period wage

to depend directly on inflation in p&riod 1, not only indirectly via the

latter's effect on wages in period 1. In the more general case the expres-

sions for c1, C2t and the elasticity of wages in period 2 with respect to

prices in period 1 would be similar to equation (12), the optimal degree

of indexation in the one—period model. The complexity of (29) and (30)

arises for two reasons. First, since unanticipated inflation in period 1

affects the real value added in both periods, the degree of indexation in

period 1 depends on both A1 and A*. Second, since thi elasticity of

wages in period 2 with respect to inflation in that period must (by (24))

be independent of the actual inflation rate in period 1, optimal risk

sharing requires that the elasticity of wages with respect to inflation

in each period depend upon the distribution of inflation in the other

period.
                                                                         2

    While it is possible for one to analyze the determinants of wage

iridexation in each of the two periods in this general case, for our

purposes it is much more useful to make a set of further simplifying

assumptions. Suppose, first, that p1 and           are identically and

independently distributed, as are e and e2. Next, suppose that the

workers' and the firm's utility functions both exhibit equal constant

relative risk aversion (S) and can be written



              U =                            and
     (19a)          U(w1/p1) + pU(w2/p2)


     (20a)    V =              + pV(n2/p2)
                    V(n1/p1)


where p(>O) is a discount factor common to both workers and firms.

     Suppose, also, that the firm's production function can be written

as a Cobb—Douglas function



     (21a) Q =       LX.t11e1

                                                                             in
where t1 equals one in period 1 (t111) and t1. equals t1(>O)
period 2 (t1ft1). Larger values for t1 indicate higher expected rates

of productivity growth in this formulation.

     Finally, suppose the inverse demand functions and the input price

functions are of constant—elasticity type and are given respectively by



      (22a)   q1 = p1Q1        P1 e21


              q2 = p2Q2

Here    y(S) is the degree of serial correlation in the effect of unantici-

pated Inflation on the demand function (input prices). If y(S) equals

zero, unanticipated inflation in period 1 has no effect on the demand

curve (input prices) in period 2. In contrast if y(5) equals unity then

unanticipated inflation in period 1 has the same effect on demand (input

prices) in period 2 as unanticipated inflation in period 2 does. The expected

growth between periods in real demand is given, in the absence of any

unanticipated inflation by t2 and the expected growth in input prices is

similarly given by t.

substituting these into the expressions for the realized profit levels,

the wage in period 1, when the rate of inflation in period 1 equals its

expected value.

      Equations (32) and (33) immediately highlight a number of points.

First, with the assumptions we have made, the formula for the optimal degree

of indexation in      the   second period i idntical to the formula for the

optimal degree of indexation in the one—period model        (see   footnote 22).

Second, the deferred increase D i proportioni1 to the expected growth
                                                                        27



in real value added which the firm faces (t) when unanticipated inflation

is zero in both periods. While the expected rate of productivity growth

(t1) influences this variable, so does the expected growth in demand (c2)

and the expected growth in other input prices (t3). Third, unless the

elasticity of real value added with respect to the increase in the price

level in the same period (A) is zero, the expected inflation rate

influences the size of the deferred increase, with higher expected infla-

tion rates leading to lower (higher) deferred increases if A is greater

(less) than zero.25 Moreover, any parameter that influences A (a, b, r,

will have opposite effects on the size of the deferred increase and on the

degree of wage indexation in the second period. There is, then, a trade—off

between COLA provisions and deferred wage increases.

       What about the extent of wage indexation in the first period of the

two—period contract? Is it larger or smaller than the extent of indexation

that would prevail in a one—period contract (1 + A)? With workers and

firms having the same relative risk aversion, perfect sharing of p1 —     risks
in the first period would require that w1 and IT1       have the same elasticity

with respect to p1, and hence that      c.. would equal 1 + A. On the

other hand, due to the serial correlation in the effect of unanticipated

inflation on demand and on input prices, unanticipated inflation in period

I also affects the wages and profit in period 2, and perfect sharing of

p1 —   risks   in the second period would require that w2 and 112 have the

same elasticity with respect to p1, and hence that the elasticity of w2

with respect to p1 would equal 1 + A*. However, since w2 may depend

on p1 only through w1, the elasticity of the wage with respect to p1

is constrained to be the same In the two periods, and unless A =

some Inefficiency In the sharing of p1 —    risks   is unavoidable.
                                                                                  28



Equation (33) shows that a weighed average of 1 + A and 1 +                  is
chosen, where the weights when p1 equals              depend only on   k26
     It is clear that the degree of indexation is larger in the first

period of the two—period contract than it is in the one—period contract

(recall the latter equals the degree of indexation in the second period

of the two—period contract) only if A is less than A*. The latter

requires that



     (34)       ay   — b6 > a   —



     Is   this likely to occur? While no general theoretical statements can

be made, we can consider two special cases. First, suppose that b equals

zero, so that unanticipated inflation does not influence input prices.                  If

the degree of indexation in period 2 is less than complete (c2 <         1),           which

is typically the case, then A and hence a will be less than zero. In

this case, (34) will be satisfied as long as y < 1.          That is, the extent

of ndexaton will be greater during the first period of the two—period

model as long as the effect of unanticipated inflation on the firm's demand

curve depreciates overtime (y <

     Second, suppose that b is not equal to zero but that the effect of
unanticipated inflation on the demand and input price curves depreciates

at the same rate (y = 5).           In this case, again as long as indexation is

less than complete, so that A and a —           bB   are both less than zero, it

follows that if y is less than unity the extent of indexation will again

be greater during the first period of the two—period contract.
                                                                           29



      These special cases suggest that a reasonable hypothesis to test

 empirically is,   that   as long as the observed extent of indexation is less

 than unity in the second period of a two—period contract, the extent

 of indexation will be higher in the first period. Since the former equals

 the extent of indexation in the one—period contract, on average the extent

of indexation will be higher in the two—period contract. Put more generally,

one might expect to observe contracts of longer durations having more

generous COLA provisions. Since the same factors that influence the

generosity of a COLA also influence the probability of COLA coverage (see

Section III), one should expect to observe the incidence of COLA's ircreas—

ing with contract duration. In fact, this occurs.28



                V. THE OPTIMUM DURATION OF LABOR CONTRACTS

     The last   section suggested that, other things equal, the extent of

indexation will be greater in a multiperiod contract than in a single

period contract. But, what determines the optimal duration of a collective

bargaining agreement? Clearly the parties to the agreement must consider

the benefits and costs of contracts of different lengths and it is to this

question that we now turn. For expository purposes we shall continue to

contrast one— and two—period contracts.

     Consider first the benefit side. We have emphasized before that,

because inflation in the first period       (p1) can affect wages in the second

period (w2) only through its effect on wages in the first period
                                                                        (w1),
inflation risks are generally not shared efficiently in the two—period

contrLct. Straightforward calculation shows that efficient sharing of

inflation risks in the two—period model would require that the optimal
                                                                     30




degree of wage indexation would be equal in the two periods




     (35)       c1 = £2   1+A

and that the base wage in period two would be the base wage in period one

multiplied by



     (36)




     Suppose that instead of the two—period contract, the union and the

firm negotiate a sequence of two one—period contracts that actually have

the properties specified in (35) and (36). That is, they actually agree

in each period to have the extent of indexation called for in (35) and

agree at the time they negotiate the second contract to have a deferred

increase called for by (36). Such a sequence of contracts might arise if

they consider each contract negotiation as an incident in a long—term rela-

tionship, if they are concerned with total expected utility rather than

expected utility for any single period, and i they seek to negotiate a

contract in period two which insures that all inflation risks are shared

efficiently, when considered as of the time of the first negotiation.     Such

a sequence of two one—period contracts would clearly be preferred to the

 two—period contract.

     The sequence of two one—period contracts has costs as well as benefits,

 however. These costs are of two types. First, there are costs to the

 employer and the union of conducting collective bargaining negotiations.

 These are the explicit and implicit resource costs of the negotiations

 process including, but not limited to, the time diverted from production,
                                                                       31




 contract administration, and planning activities. While lost output due

 to strikes is an example of such costs, we emphasize that these costs may

 be substantial even in the absence of a strike or threat of strike.

 Multiperlod contracts obviously reduce the frequency with which these

 costs are incurred.

      Second, since the two oñe—perod contracts arenegotiated
                                                                sequentially,
 there is invariably some uncertainty, as of period one, as to what the terms

 of the second contract will be. Even if, on average, the outcomes in the

 second contract correspond to (35) and (36), the uncertainty will generate

 costs for the parties if they are risk averse. Multiperiod contracts reduce

 this form of uncertainty.

     The choice of contract duration obviously involves a weighting of the

loss from inefficient sharing of inflation risks if a multiperiod contract

is chosen with the loss from additional bargaining costs and the uncertainty

about the second period contract if two one—period contracts are chosen.

To see the implications of this point, let   Cb be the fixed real bargaining

costs of each round of contract negotiations. Suppose, for simplicity,

that the uncertainty in period one about the period two contract occurs

with respect to the base wage in period two and that this has an expected

value (as of period one) that is implied by equation (36) and a coefficient

of variation of b Then using the same techniques that are used in

Appendix B, one can show that the total real amount      that the workers

and the firm are jointly willing to pay in period i in order to have

one two—period contract rather than two one—period contracts is given for

each period by

While in general one cannot observe the continuous variables H1 and H2,

one can observe whether a contract is two periods long and it is reasonable

to postulate in empirical implementations that



     (39)         H     1   if H1 + H2 + u > 0

                        0 otherwise



Here H equals one if a two—period contract is chosen and zero if two one—

period contracts are chosen, and u is a random variable that summarizes

all other unobservable forces that may influence contract duration.

     it immediately follows from (37) to (39) that



     (40) (a) H/cb > 0

            (b)        ''b > 0

            (c) H/ =            0

            (d) H/y 0 as a(A — A*)                         0


            (e) H/S 0 as b(A — A*)                         0




     An increase in the cost of concluding collective bargaining negotiations

 (cb) or in the uncertainty in the first period associated with the sequence

 of two one—period contracts due to not knowing what the wage bargain will be
                                                                             33



in the second period            both obviously increase the probability of

observing a two—period contract. Since the expected inflation rate ()

does not affect the expected utility from contracts of either duration, it

does not affect the choice of contract length.

        The results for serial correlation in the effects of unanticipated

inflation on demand (y) and other input prices (6) can be explained as

follows. We know that if A* equals A, a two—period contract distributes

inflation risk efficiently and dominates two one—period contracts. Given A,

the more A* deviates from A, in absolute value, the less efficient is

the distribution of inflation risks in the two—period contract, and conse-

quently, the smaller would be the net benefits from having such a contract.

Since



        (41)    A*/y 0 as a          0   and

                         0 as b      0



the results for the effects of serial correlation, in unanticipated inflation

on demand and other inputs prices fo1lo directly.

     The remaining parameters unfortunately influence the length of contract

in complicated ways. For example, the uncertainty about the aggregate

inflation rate (&)      affects   H both directly and through its effect on k.

Without still further restrictive assumptions, unambiguous implications

about the signs of the effects of ,S (risk aversion), a and b (demand

and input price elasticities with respect to unanticipated inflation),

   (the firm's own   price   elasticity of demand), and $   (the   elasticity of

output w.r.t. non—labor input) cannot be drawn. All of these parameters do

affect, however, the optimum duration of contracts.

                VI. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS AND COLA COVERAGE


        In this final theoretical section, we return to a one—period model

with indexation of wages, but allow employment to be variable across

states—of—the—world. This section stresses that temporary layoffs and

the extent of indexation are simultaneously determined and highlights the

role that several parameters of the unemployment inêurance (UI) system
        29
play.

        Suppose that the nominal unemployment benefits that a laid off worker

receives in a period is Wb• The benefit level may be specified as a

function of the individual's previous earnings; what is important for our

purposes is that wb is not contingent on the realized price level during

the period.

        To capture the essence of the imperfectly experience rated aspect of

the UI system, we assume that the nominal unemployment insurance tax that

the firm must pay in the period is               —   L) + T. Here L is the number

of union members actually employed during a period which implies, given the

union membership level N, that N — L            workers are on temporary layoff.

If r is less than one, experience rating is said to be imperfect and the

firm does not bear the full marginal cost of the UI benefits that its laid

off workers receive. If r is equal to one, the system is perfectly

experience rated. Finally, if the firm is paying either the minimum or

maximum tax rate, so that laying off an additional worker will not increase

its UI tax rate, then r will equal zero (and T will be positive)°

        In the presence of UI taxes, the firm's profit function becomes



        (42)    r =   pg[f(L,X),1f(L,X)   —   ph()X   — wL —
                                                               b(N   —   L)   — T
                                                                                              35




 where for simplicity we have assumed that there is no residual uncertainty

 In the demand (e1), production function                        (e2) or inthe price of non—

 labor inputs (e3).

        Suppose that the utility of a laid off worker is                   Z(wb/p), with
 Z' >   0,     and that the utility of an employed worker continues to be U(w/p);

 Z can be sufficiently general to allow for nonwork time to yield positive

 utility. If each worker has the same, probability of being laid off
 (1 —   CL/N)),    a worker's expected utility, given the price level, wage rate

and employment level is (L/N)U(w/p) + (1 —
                                                                (L/N))Z(wb/p).
        As before, we do not attempt to fully describe the bargaining process

by which a firm and a union reach a contract settlement. Contracts which

provide for efficient sharing of inflation risks, however, will require

that both the wage rate and the employment level will depend upon the price

level and all such contracts can be found by choosing wage and employment

schedules w(p) and L(p) to maximize



        (43)      c.                      + (1       —
                        [(L/N)U(w/p)                     (L/N))Z(w/p)]   + XEV(,r,'p) +   iiE(N — L)



where larger values of A again indicate that the firm wins a greater share

of the "pie", p will be equal to (greater than) zero if we are in a layoff

(full employment) state of the world, and we have assumed a unique solution

exists.

        It is straightforward to show that the optimum wage and employment

schedules must satisfy (for L(p) <               N       and all p)



        (44)       —   [U(w/p)   —                          =
                                     Z(wb/p)]/U'(w/p)
                                                                                  ,f)




That is, the worker's loss of utility from being laid off, divided by

the marginal utility from raising the wage rate when employed should be

set equal to the marginal real profit that the firm obtains from increas-

ing employment.

       Now if we hold the wage schedule, w(p), constant, as well as p, N,

and Wb partially differentiating (44) with respect to r implies
       31
that



                                                       > 0
        (45)       L/3r =     — (wb/p)/[2(/p)IaL2

                                                               that the term in
As the second order conditions for a maximum require

brackets be negative, it immediately follows           that




        (46)        aL/sr >   0.


                                                       increases the cost of a layoff
Because increased marginal experience rating

 to the firm, increases In r lead to higher employments and hence to fewer

 layoffs being associated with each realization of the price level.

        Similarly, holding w, p, N, and r constant and partially differen-

 tiating (44) with respect to Wb one obtains that



            (47)    L/wb =      - (r   —   (Z'/U'))[2(/p)/L2

            Since the bracketed term is negative, the effect of increasing UI

 benefits on the employment level is the same sign as            r —   (Z'/U').   With

 imperfect experience rating r is less than one and if the marginal

 utility of income does not depend on whether the individual is working,
                                                              -
                                                                                      37



 then risk aversion on the part of workers and UI benefits that are less

 than the wage in each state—of—the—world          (wb <   w(p))   giarantee that
                               32
 V/U' is greater than 1.            As a result,



      (48)     3L/wb < 0



 Higher UI benefit levels should lead to lower employment and hence more

 layoffs.

     To obtain implications about the effect of changing UI system para-

meters on the optimal degree of wage indexation, we contrast a realiza-

tion of the price level for which there are layoffs (L(p) <                 N),   with a
realization in which all union members are employed. Assuming that the

wage, but not necessarily the employment level, in the unemployment state

is unchanged when the UI parameters are changed, we investigate what

happens to the wage in the full employment state.

     Let a subscript L indicate the unemployment state and an N the

full—employment state. It is straightforward to show that the maximization

of (43) requires that



     (49)    UIu =       V/v

Differentiating with respect to r for a constant

WN to change, one obtains that

        Since /L is less than zero and              L/r is greater than zero

 Substituting (47) into (54) and noting that the product of al.1 of the

 terms    outside the brackets in (54) is negative, it follows that


                                                r                       ,       2

     The two terms within the brackets have opposite signs and hence one

cannot unambiguously determine the sign of             wN/Bwb without further assump-

tions. Note, however, that the smaller the extent of experience rating

 (the smaller r), the more the second (negative) term dominates. Indeed,

if r equals zero, we unambiguously know that increasing UI benefits will

lead to a lower wage in the full—employment state. Following the logic

used before, one can conclude in this case that



     (56)        C/Wb > 0       as          1




     That is, if experience rating is zero (r = 0)                     an increase in UI

benefits will decrease (increase) the extent of wage indexation, as long

as indexation is less than complete. More generally, if experience rating

is positive, but sufficiently small to leave (55) negative, the above

result will continue to hold. While we have not formally modelled the

forces that influence the decision to have an indexed contract in the

variable employment model, Section III suggests that most parameters that

influence the degree of indexation, if it exists, also influence the proba-

bility of observing an indexed contract in a similar manner. Thus, it also

seems likely that increased UI benefits will reduce the probability of

observing an indexed contract.

plete   description of the data, including its sources, is found in Appendix

D and a complete list of the explanatory variables is found in Table 5.

        Several comments should be made about this specification. First, we

use data pooled across three years. Since many labor contracts are long—

term in nature, we do not use adjacent years' data which would allow for

the possibility of the same contract influencing the industry "outcome"

variables in more than one year. Rather, we use data for 1975, 1978 and 1981.

     Second, it is difficult to make unambiguous predictions about the

expected signs of many of the v variables because they do not always
                                                                              42




correspond neatly in a one—to—one fashion with the list of variables in

Table 4. For example, bargaining structure variables such as the number

of unions in the industry (v2), the percentage of unionized workers (v3)

and the percentage of workers covered by multiemployer agreements (v5) may

all be proxies for the costs of having indexed contracts (c.),           the costs

of concluding collective bargaining agreements (cb), and the share of the

"pie" that the employer wins (X). Similarly, while personal characteristics

of unionized workers such as mean age (v7), percent married (v5), percent

white (v9), percent male (v10), percent residing in SMSA's (v11) mean

schooling (v12), and mean number of children (v13) may reflect employee

relative risk aversion (S), some may also influence the costs of conduct-

ing negotiations, the costs of indexed contracts, and indeed employer and

employee demands for long—term employment relationships.        As such, we will

not spend alot of time below discussing these variables' coefficients.

      Third, the estimated parameters of the demand function were obtained

as follows. Using quarterly data on the consumer price index (Pr) from

1970 to 1978, an expected consumer price index series (E(P(t)) was
                                                        35
generated using a fourth—order autoregressive model.         For each two—

digit manufacturing industry, equations of the form



      (59)     log(S/P) = h11 + h12log(P/E(P)) +         h13T
                                                                +
                                                                    u1

and


               log(S/P) =          +                    + h23log(S...1/P_1)
      (60)                   h21       h22log(P/E(P))

                           + h24T +
                                                                            43




were then estimated using quarterly data from 1971 to 1978, where S.. is

the value of shipments in industry i in year t, T is a time—trend

term that is incremented quarterly and the u are random error terms.

When equation (59) is used, which assumes that there is no serial correla-

tion in the effects of unanticipated inflation, a1, a3 and a4 are esti-

mated respectively by h12, 'l3 and              Similirly,   when equation (60)

Is used, which allows for serial correlation in the effects of unanticipated

inflation on demand, one can show that a1, a2, a3 and a4 are given

respectively by h22, h23, h241(1 —      h23),   and aZ2.36

        Fourth, a key explanatory variable is the average unemployment insurance

net replacement rate (UI); the average weekly UI benefits divided by the

average weekly net (after tax) loss of income by laid—off unemployed workers

in the industry. These data are obtained from a large scale microsimulation

model   of   the unemployment insurance system built by the Urban Institute,

and are based on data from the Survey of Income and Education.37

     Finally. dummy variables that indicate the year the data are from and

whether the industry Is in durable manufacturing are also included In the

model. The former are meant to control for variations in expected inflation

and in the coefficient of variation of expected inflation over time. The

latter is another proxy for negotiations costs, the elasticity of the firms'

demand curve w.r.t. its own price and the costs of indexed contracts.

     Estimates of variants of equations (57) and (58) are found in Tables 5,

6 and 7. The dependent variables in these tables are the fraction of the

workers under major collective bargaining agreements who are covered by a

COLA, the fraction of such agreements that contain COLA's, and the three—.

year average of the Industry layoff rate, respectively. Quite strikingly

a number of key implications of the models are confirmed.
                                                                        44




     For example, as suggested in Section VI, higher UI replacement

rates in an industry are associated with a lower probability of observing

an indexed contract (Tables 5 and 6) and a higher level of industry layoffs

(Table 7). These results support the notion that cost of living indexation

and the level of temporary layoffs are simultaneously determined.

     To take another example, an increase in the .elas.ticity of the demand

curve w.r.t. unanticipated inflation (a1) does appear to be associated

with an increase in the probability of observing an indexed contract

(Tables 5 and 6), as suggested in Section III. Furthermore, the effect of

an increase in the serial correlation of unanticipated inflation on the

probability of observing an indexed contract can be shown, from equation

(33), to be the same sign as the elasticity of the demand curve w.r.t.

unanticipated inflation. If Indexation is less than complete (c <      1),

which is what one typically observes, ceteris paribus this elasticity will

tend to be less than zero (from (31), which implies that an increase in the

serial correlation parameter should decrease the probability of observing

an indexed contract. In fact (Tables. 5 and 6), this is what we do observe.

     An increase in residual uncertainty does appear to reduce the proba-

bility of observing indexed contracts (Tables 5 and 6); this result is

consistent with the theoretical result that degree of indexation declines

with increased residual uncertainty when the optimal degree of indexation

is less than unity and employee relative risk aversion is greater than

employer relative risk aversion (see equation (14)).38 Wliere statistically

significant, increased residual uncertainty also increases the industry

layoff rate (Table 7); a result consistent with one's a priori expectations.
                                                                                 45



       Also,   an increase in the expected growth of demand   does   reduce the

industry   layoff rate (Table 7), as might be expected and, where significant,

appears to increase the probability of observing indexed contracts (Tables 5

and 6). One can show, from (33), that the effect of an increase in the

expected growth of demand is of the same sign as (A* —        A)(1   —   S).   Since

it is likely that A* > A,      this result is consistent with employees'

relative risk aversion (S) being less than unity.39

       Numerous associations between the other explanatory variables, COLA

coverage and the layoff rate are also found. High quit rates, which suggest

less permanent attachment of workers and firms, are associated with less

COLA   coverage   and higher layoff rates. With respect to the bargaining

structure variables, an increase in the number of unions in an industry,

which reduces the bargaining power of each union, reduces COLA coverage,

while an increase in the proportion of workers covered by unions increases

it. The latter also is associated with higher layoff rates; a result con-

sistent with the evidence presented by James Medoff (1979). Finally,

increased coverage by xnultiemployer contracts, which tends to reduce wage

competition among firms in an industry also leads to a greater probability

of observing COLA's.

       Where statistically significant, the greater the percentage of family

income attributable to the wage earnings of the union member, the greater

the probability of observing COLA coverage. In terms of the discussion in

Section II, this suggests that other forms of family income tend to be

fixed in real rather than nominal terms.

       Finally, increases in the mean age of union members and their mean

education level, and decreases in the percentages of them who are married,
                                                                        46




white, or reside in an SMSA, all are (where significant) associated with

increased COLA coverage. The result for whites may reflect their greater

access to capital markets and thus less need for COLA's to stabilize consump-

tion over time. Similarly individuals residing in SMSA's may face more

stable alternative earnings opportunities than individuals residing in

smaller labor markets, again reducing the former's need for COLA coverage.

Finally, higher levels of schooling may reflect higher levels of specific

human capital and increased desire by firms and workers for long—term

employment relations. This would lead to both increased COLA coverage and

lower layoffs; the latter result is observed in Table 7.

     In sum, while the results presented in this section can not be des-

cribed as being totally unambiguous, they do generate some support for the

relevance.of the models that we developed in earlier sections.



                      VIII. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES:
                             INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT DATA


      This section provides further empirical tests of our models using

data on COLA coverage, on the characteristics of COLA's when they exist,

and on the duration of contracts, for individual manufacturing collective

bargaining agreements covering more than 1,000 workers that were on file

with the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1981. The data on the characteristics

of COLA's are of interest because contrary to popular impression, COLA pro-

visions vary widely across union contracts., on a number of dimensions. For

example, they vary in the frequency of review. Some contracts call for

quarterly reviews and adjustments of wages, some for semi—annual reviews,

and still others for annual ones.4° Some allow for a COLA increase in the
                                                                         47




initial year of the contract, while others do not. Other things equal,

the earlier the first cost—of—living adjustment and the more frequent the

reviews, the greater the "yield" of the COLA. That is, the more complete

indexation will be.

         To take another example,. COLA provisions also vary in their generosity

per review. Some specify minimum price increases before any cost—of—living

wage increase is granted. Others specify maximum cost—of—living adjustments,

or "caps". Still others specify bands of price increases (e.g., 5 to 7

percent) for which no COLA wage increases will be granted. Clearly, such

provisions affect the yield of a COLA.

      Increases are typically specified as a one—cent increase in wages for

each fractional point increase in the consumer price index. Among 102
                                                                      41
major union contracts in 1979, this fraction varied between .3 and .6.

Larger fractions obviously represent less generous COLA's. The generosity

of a COLA provision also depends upon the level of earnings of the covered

employees. Since COLA's typically are specified in absolute terms (so many

cents/hour), the higher the earnings of employees, other things equal, the
                                42
less generous a COLA will be.

     When seeking to ascertain the generosity of a COLA provision, there

are a number of strategies one might follow. First, one might estimate the

eante degree of indexation by the expost degree of indexation; the elas—

ticity   of   wages with respect to inflation that actually occurred. This is

the approach followed by Hendricks and Kahn (1981).

      Its weakness is that given the complex way COLA's are formulated,

this number will typically depend nonlinearly on both the actual level of

inflation and the various COLA provisions. Since the elasticity of wages
                                                                         48




with respect to inflation typically varies with the level of inflation,

 it is unclear whether one should attempt to suniinarize the provisions of a

COLA by this single number. Furthermore, such a number at best would be

an average expost elasticity; it would tell us nothing about the marginal

effect of inflation on wages. Indeed, it is not difficult to think of

circumstances in which contract A shows a greater COLA increase than

contract B, given the actual inflation rate that occurred, but where the

marginal COLA increase for Increments of Inflation would be larger in B

than in A because of a cap on the COLA increase in A. It is unclear in

such a case which contract one would want to argue has the more generous

COLA provision.

      A second approach is to argue that it is dlfficult to disentangle

COLA increases and the portion of deferred noncontingent wage increases

that are Implicitly based on expectations of inflation.   Indeed, if

intracontract real wage changes are generally small, one might treat them

as being zero and argue that the sum of the percentage deferred wage

increases and the COLA increases that occurred expost, divided by the

expost inflation rate, is a good measure of the exante elasticity of wages

with respect to prices.

     The theoretical models we presented In Sections IV and V suggest that

such an approach may be incorrect; it is possible to model both the determi-

nants of COLA increases and of deferred increases. Moreover, a simple

numerical example illustrates the empirical difficulties inherent in such

an approach. Consider two contracts. Suppose that the first calls for a

five percent deferred increase and no COLA increase, while the second calls

for no deferred increase, but a one percent COLA increase for each one
                                                                        49



percent increase in prices. If the expost increase in prices was five

percent, the two would yield equal percentage increases in wages and, if

the exante increase in prices was also five percent, the two would also

yield equal expected wage increases. However, the former would provide

workers with no protection against unanticipated inflation, while the

latter would provide them with complete protection. Since we, and Card,

have argued that a major motivation for COLA's is their risk sharing pro-

visions, in particular the sharing of risks due to unanticipated inflation,

it seems strange to argue that the two contracts offer equal COLA protection.43

      A third approach, followed by David Card (1982), is to argue that

because of the interdependence between deferred and COLA increases, it makes

little sense to focus on the overall expost change in wages. Rather, Card

measures the exante elasticity by the marginal elasticity of the wage esca-

lator; the cents per point increase in the CPI that the escalator yields

(while active) divided by the real contractual wage at the start of the

contract. The weakness of this approach, of course, is that it ignores the

presence of CAPS, nonlinearities, etc. For example, two contracts may initially

offer the same COLA payment per point incxease in the CPI, but if one has a

CAP on the maximum size of the COLA payment and the other does not, one would

not want to argue that both offer equal COLA protection. The weakness of

his measure then lies in the restriction twhile active".

      The discussion above suggests that it may be inappropriate, indeed

nearly impossible, to summarize all of the information about the generosity

of a contract's COLA provisions in a single number. Hence, the strategy

we follow in this section is to use information on a whole vector of contract

provisions and to estimate a set of eleven equations of the form
                                                                    50




      (61)    Z = F(X) + u               I =   1,2,...11


     Here       is a dichotomous variable that takes on the value of unity

if there is a COLA provision and zero otherwise, Z2 is a polytomous

variable for contracts with COLA's that takes the value of one if the

frequence of COLA review after the first year is monthly, two if it is

quarterly, three if it is semi—annually, and four if it is annually, Z3

is a dichotomous variable that is unity if there is a COLA review in the

first year and zero otherwise, and      and Z5 are variables that, for

contracts with COLA's, show the number of cents that workers would receive

for each one—point increase in the CPI and an estimate of the percentage

point increase in wages the workers would receive for each percentage

point increase in the CPI. For contracts with COLA's, Z6 is the natural

logarithm of the number of months until the first COLA review, while Z7

is the logarithm of the contract duration (in months) for all contracts.

Again for contracts with COLA's, Z8 and Z9 are dichotomous variables

that capture the presence of guaranteed mInimum COLA increases and caps, or

maximum permissable COLA increases, respectively. Finally, Z10 and Z11

are variants of Z4 and Z5 that assign the value of zero to contracts

in which COLA's do not exist. The latter two measures combine information

on both the existence of a COLA provision and its generosity.

      Each of these variables provides information on either the existence

of a COLA, its generosity, or the duration of the underlying contract. A

stringent test of our models then, is to look at the coefficients of a given

explanatory variable across equations and to see if a consistent pattern of

results is present. That is, does it appear that a given variable Is
                                                                             51



influencing each of the   outcomes   in   a way that   is consistent with the under-

lying theoretical models?4

      The explanatory variables (the X's) in this specification are similar

to those used in the previous section and are meant to capture the

same forces described there. With the exception of the number of employees

covered by the contract, another proxy for the cost of concluding collective

bargaining negotiations, all are specified at the two— or three—digit

industry level and merged in from other sources. Three variables not

used in the previous section, but included here, are the eight firm concen-

tration ratio, the import/sales ratio in an industry, and wages as a share

of shipments in the industry. The former two are meant to capture competitive

pressures that the firm faces; increased product market competition;

might lead to a reduced willingness to grant COLA's. The latter is a proxy

for the share of labor in total costs. Also included, since the starting

dates of the various contracts span a three—year period, are direct

measures of the expected rate of inflation as of the contract date and

the coefficient of variation of forecasters' expected inflation rates.

These are obtained from the Livingston survey forecasts.'5

     The effect of unanticipated inflation on industry demand, the magnitude

of the general trend in industry demand and productivity, and the magnitude

of residual uncertainty are obtained from within three— or four—digit

industry regressions of the form



      (62)     los(PPIj/P) =          + a log(P/E(P)) +              +
                                                                         c
where PPI is the producer price index for industry j in period t, P
is the consumer price index in period t, E(P) is the expected consumer
                                                                       52



price index (which is generated as before), and T is a time trend term.46

These equations are estimated using quarterly data for the 1973—1978 period.47

Because of the small number of observations involved, it proved impossible

to also estimate the parameter that reflected the serial correlation in the

effects of unanticipated inflation on demand.

      Table 8 presents estimates of each of the eleven equations. Depending

upon the sample (all contracts or only those with COLA's) and the form of

the dependent variables used, the estimation method is either probit (Zi,

13, Z8, Z9), ordered probit (Z2), ordinary least squares (Z4, Z5, Z6, Z7),

or Tobit (Z1O, Zil). A list of explanatory variables appears in the table,

while a more complete description of the data appears in Appendix D.

      The results in this table can best be described as mixed. For

example, an increase in the elasticity of the demand curve with respect

to unanticipated inflation (Xli), where significant, is associated with

more frequent COLA reviews (Z2) and larger COLA increases (110), as sug-

gested in Section II. Increased residual uncertainty, however, is also

associated with more frequent COLA reviews (12), shorter duration until

the first review (Z6), and larger COLA increases (Z5); Section II suggests

that these results should obtain only if the optimal elasticity of wages

with respect to prices is greater than one——a result rarely observed in

these data. To take another example, where significant, higher UI replace-

ment rates are associated with larger COLA increases; this contrasts both

with our theoretical expectations and the estimates of the effects of UI on

the probability of COLA coverage observed in the previous section.48

      Some variables perform in a more consistent manner, either across

equations or with respect to our hypotheses. For example, increases In

the import/sales ratio (X7) are associated with decreases in both the
                                                                       53



probability of COLA coverage (Zi) and the size of COLA increases (Z1O, Zil).

Similarly, increases in wages as a share of shipments (X4) are associated with

decreases in the probability of coverage (Zi) and the size of COLA increases

(Z5, Z1O, Zil). As long as the effect of unanticipated inflation on demand

is larger than its effect on other input prices, these latter results are

consistent with the theoretical prediction summarized in Table 3. Finally,

as in the macro results reported in the last section, an increase in the

share of total family income due to the wages of the union members (X25) is

associated with an increase in the COLA payment.

      The results for other variables, however, are more ambiguous. For

example, increased unionization in an industry (X5), is associated with

either lower (Z4) or higher (Z1O) COLA payments, depending upon the esti-

mation method used. Similarly, some demographic variables, such as age

(X16), marital status (X17), and SMSA status (X20) affect the probability

of COLA coverage in this micro data set in exactly the opposite direction

that they did in the macro results reported in the previous section.

      Table 8 also reports results for a contract duration equation. Contract

length (Z7) is positively associated with the extent of unionization (X5),

durable goods industries (X8), and the trend in productivity and demand

(X12). It is negatively associated with industry concentration (X3) and

the import/sales ratio (X7). Finally, several of the demographic charac-

teristics variables appear to influence it; percent white (XiS) and percent

in SMSA (X20) positively and mean age (X16), percent male (X19), and percent

craftsmen (X22) negatively. While many of these results are in accord with

our prior expectations (from Section V), some are not. For example, one

might have expected situations in which skilled workers were involved (high

values for X22) to be ones in which both firms and workers pushed for long—

term contracts. Apparently, however, this does not occur.
                                                                        54



      In sum, the results of this section at best cin be described as mixed.

They are sufficiently ambiguous that they cannot be said to. provide strong

support for the validity of our theoretical models. A possible explanation

for the ambiguity may lie in our method of testing. It may be unreasonable

to expect that one can estimate the effect of an explanatory variable on

ten dimensions of a COLA provision and hope to observe a consistent pattern

of coefficients across equations. After all, the theoretical models provide

hypotheses about the elasticity of wages with respect to prices, not about

timing of reviews, minimum increase, caps, etc. While we believe our

criticisms of the approaches of previous investigators are valid, our

approach in this section obviously has its own problems.49



                        IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS


      This paper has presented a series of theoretical models that sought

to ascertain the determinants of COLA provisions in union contracts, the

generosity of these provisions when they exist, the magnitude of deferred

wage increases that are not contingent on the price level, the duration of

labor contracts and the level of temporary layoffs. The factors that we

highlighted were a varied lot and encompassed characteristics of the firm's

demand curve (including how it responds to unanticipated inflation),

employee and employer risk aversion, characteristics of the bargaining

relationship (including the costs of concluding negotiations), macroeconomic

variables, and parameters of the unemployment insurance system.

      Two initial empirical tests of the hypotheses generated by the models

were provided. The first test used data at the two—digit manufacturing

industry level of aggregation and focused on the determinants of the fraction

of workers covered by COLA provisions and on the industry layoff rate. This
                                                                        55



analysis, which made use of pooled cross—section time—series data, appeared

to confirm a number of key implications of the models. In particular,

higher UI replacement rates were associated both with lower probabilities

of observing indexed contracts and higher levels of layoffs in an industry.

The second test used data at the individual collective bargaining agreement

level and focused on the determinants of COLA coverage, the characteristics

of COLA agreements when they exist, and the duration of labor contracts.

Unfortunately, the results here were much more mixed and did not provide

strong support for the models.

      In spite of the mixed nature of these empirical results, we believe

that this paper has demonstrated the usefulness of analyzing the determi-

nants of these union contract provisions in the context of risk—sharing

models. Numerous extensions suggest themselves. At the empirical level,

it is clear that better measures of the "exante degree of indexation" must

be devised. Neither the single parameter measures used by Card (1981) and

Hendricks and Kahn (1982) that are based on exante marginal elasticities

over an initial range and expost wage increases respectively, nor the

multiple (10) parameter measures used by us seems to be appropriate. Using

a single parameter measure based on the COLA increase that would have

resulted if the expected price increase at the time of the negotiations

actually occurred, seems qually inappropriate for reasons we discussed

in Section VIII. At the very least, what is required is a two—parameter

measure that contains information on both the expected COLA wage increase and

the marginal change in the wage increase that would result from unanticipated

inflation.
                                                                         56



       We have also only begun to test the implications of the models. One

 productive line of testing would focus on the trade—off between COLA.

 increases and deferred noncontingent wage increases that was discussed

 in Section IV and see if the models proved useful in explaining such splits.

Much more work also needs to be done on the determinants of contract dura-

tion and on the effects of UI parameters (both replacement rates and

experience rating) on the COLA—layoff trade—off.


      At the theoretical level, an important unresolved issue is why COLA

provisions typically take the form of "X cents per one point increase in

the CPI" rather than "X percent increase in wages for each percentage

increase in the CPI"? As is well known, the former type scheme will tend

to compress wage differentials within a firm, while the latter will keep

them constant? What is needed here are models of union decision—making

processes that highlight how heterogeneity of union members and different

voting schemes will, lead to different types of contract provisions. Ulti-

mately, such theoretical modelling would lead to empirical research on the

determinants of the type of COLA provision adopted.

      Similarly, the existence of minimum price level increases that are

required before COLA coverage starts in some contracts, and caps or maximum

increases in others, suggests that risk—sharing agreements often exist only

over a subset of possible states of the world. It may be useful to try to

model the conditions that lead such restrictions to occur and then to

empirically test the usefulness of such models.

     1. See H.M. Douty (1975) for a more complete discussion of the history
of cost—of—living clauses in union contracts in the United States.

     2. We say rekindling since academic interest in the effect of indexa—
tion schemes, such as COLA's, on the economy goes back at least as far as
Alfred Marshall (1886).

     3. See, for example, Daniel Mitchell (1980) and Marvin Kosters (1977).

     4. On the growing insensitivity of the aggregate rate of wage inflation
to unemployment, see James Tobin (1980). On the insensitivity of deferred
wage increases, including COLA's, in union contracts to unemployment, see
Daniel Mitchell (1978).

     5. For evidence on the "yield" from COLA's, see Victor Shiefer (1979).
We will return to this point below. Henry Farber (1981), Wallace Hendricks
and Lawrence Kahn (forthcoming), Lawrence Kahn (1981), and Wayne Vroman (1982)
have presented evidence on the role of COLA's in the inflationary process.

     6. For details of this argument and aggregate evidence that the presence
of COLA's reduce strike activity, see Bruce Kaufman (1981). See also Martin
Nauro (1982) for a similar argument and empirical evidence using individual
contract negotiation data.

     7. Important contributions here include Robert J. Barro (1977), Olivier
J. Blanchard (1979), Stanley Fisher (1977a; 1977b), and JoAnna Gray (1976;
1978).

     8. The relevant papers here are Costas Azariadis (1978), Leif Danziger
(1980), and Steven Shavell (1976). Important initial contributions to the
"implicit contract" literature include Costas Azariadis (1975), Martin Baily
(1974), Donald Gordon (1974), and Hershel Grossman (1977).

     9. See David Estenson (1981), Wallace }endricks and Lawrence Kahn
(forthcoming), Lawrence Kahn (1981), and David Card (1981; 1982). The former
three studies are primarily empirical in nature; they do not provide rigorous
analytical models that permit them to identify all of the forces
that influence COLA's. Our paper is more in the tradition of Card's work,
although in some respects (which we note below) our model is more general
than his, and his empirical analyses use Canadian contract data.

     10. There are, of course, exceptions to this statement. The "ton tax"
method of financing fringe benefits that prevailed for many years in the
bituminous coal industry is an example of a contract where compensation is
contingent upon productivity; as is well known, this scheme was designed to
reduce employers' incentives to substitute capital for labor. Similarly,
the recent UAW contract with Chrysler and the airline contracts with Eastern
Airlines, that tie compensation to profits, implicItly are contingent on all
uncertain events.

     11. For more on this point, see the discussion between Robert Barro
(1977) and Stanley Fisher (1977—a).

     12. The key role of unanticipated inflation in the indexation decision
has been previously noted by David Card (1981). Richard Parks (1978) showed
that relative prices are affected by unanticipated inflation, but not by
perfectly anticipated inflation.
      13. See Jan Svejnar (1982) forrn an attempt to accomplish this objective.

      14. Indexation to other variables is discused below.

      15. The elasticity of MEl'             w.r.t.        x is i, where from (11)

     16. Hendricks and Kahn (1982) erroneously concluded that increased
employee risk aversion always would lead to increased wage indexation.

     17. Although p and         do not influence c directly, it is conceiv-
able that they influence the bargaining over the total pie available and thus
affect c through this route (see equation (12) and Martin Feldstein (1980)
and Eytan Sheshinski and Yoram Weiss (1977) on this point).

     18. Note further that if A is also less than zero, so that indexation
is less than complete, this implies that increased residual uncertainty reduces
the extent of indexation. This apparently is a hypothesis that Estenson (1981)
and Hendricks and Kahn (1982) sought to test, although they did not distinguish
between anticipated and unanticipated aggregate inflation.

     19. In determining the monetary value of indexation, we assume that w
and hence also r are the same for indexed and non—indexed contracts. As
our discussion about c should indicate, this may not be an innocuous
assumption and it should be viewed as a further approximation.

     20. This assumes that 0 < e < 2. Differentiating B partially w.r.t.
S and using equation (12) yields
                      =
                          - W•   c[23c/3S(S—wN EV"/EV') +               ci

                          + 4 c[2(1—c)      + ci     = - 2c(2—c)              > 0 if 0 < c < 2.

     21. The effect of these costs on the degree of indexation, if it occurs,
is ambiguous and depends, among other things, on the distribution of the
costs between the workers and the firm.


      22.   With the assumptions stated in the text, C =                           1   + A and B becomes
                                                                         -

            B =   -- wN+(1+A)         S(1 + WNE1T          /Eir    ).

Since the term in the parentheses increases with                                 it follows that
                                                                             V
       > 0 as long as c . 0.
                                                                      72




     23. The demand and input prices may depend also on unanticipated
inflation in periods before period 1. However, since there is no uncertainty
about the unanticipated inflation in periods before period 1, this dependenc\'
needs not be made explicit.

     24. The formula is more complex for p1      p.
                                                 -A
     25. The reason that D is proportionate to p     is that although
only the unanticipated change in th aggregate price level 1D2 has real
effects, the wage gets indexed to the total change in the aggregate price
level  (ii). To avoid the expected change in th aggregate price level
having real effects y must therefore be proportional to p for all p2.
          =     and e2 = 1 + A, this is obtained by multiplying t by
SiRce
      in D.   Consequently, assuming that p > 1, the effects of a, b,
r, and      on D are the opposite of their effects on

     26. Perfect sharing of      risks requires only that w2 and            have
the same elasticity with respect to     and hence that £2 = 1 + A.         Thus,
there is no inefficiency in the sharing of    — risks.

     27. If a equals zero, and £2 <       1  one similarly can show that one
requires that    < 1   to get the same result.

     28. For example, Douty (1975) reports that in 1975 3.2 percent of all
contracts with a duration of one year, 14.8 percent of all contracts with a
duration of two years, and 50.0 percent of all contracts with a duration of
three years contained a COLA (these figures refer to major collective
bargaining agreements only).
     Note that it may also be reasonable to assume that the effect of within—
period unanticipated inflation on demand and input prices is closer to zero
in the second period than in the first. If this is the case, it provides
another reason for the degree of indexation being closer to complete in long—
term contracts.

     29. Martin Feldstein (1976) has stressed the effect of UI system
parameters on temporary layoffs, but he does so in the context of a model in
which both workers and firms are risk neutral so that the degree of indexation
is indeterminate. See also Martin Baily (1977).

     30. See Frank Brechling (1982) for a more detailed parameterization of
the financing of the UI system.

     31. In general, a change in UI system parameters may lead to changes in
both the wage schedule w(p) and the employment schedule L(p). Without
developing an explicit bargaining model or holding some variables constant,
one cannot obtain implications about how a parameter change af.fects either
schedule if both are allowed to freely vary. In what follows in this section
then, we always must specify carefully what we are holding constant. When
we look at parameter changes on employment, we will hold the whole wage
schedule constant. When we look at parameter changes on the extent of indexa—
tion (below), we will hold the "full—employment" employment level and the
wage rate associated with some arbitrary price level constant.
                                                                        73




     32. One could, of course, allow for utility from leisure by specifying
that Z(X) = U(X) + in where  in  is the utility the worker receives from
leisure time (not working). This obviously satisfies the condition in the
text.

     33. This conclusion, and the one that follows, ignores that fact that
whether L         will also depend upon the parameters of the UI system.
For example, an increase in the price level decreases the real value of UI
benefits; this makes layoffs more attractive to the firm, and less attractive
to workers and,without full knowledge of the bargaining process, we cannot
unambiguously ascertain how this will affect the layoff rate associated with
each price level. We assume in what follows that. this effect is small and
that the relationship between      and p1 can be inferred solely from the
sign of A.

     34. As noted earlier, major collective bargaining agreements are
those that cover 1,000 or more workers.

        35. Simpler autoregressive structures yielded virtually identical
results.

where  a1 represents the effect of unanticipated inflation on demand, a2
the serial correlation in the effects of unanticipated inflation and a3 the
expected growth in demand. Taking logs of the equation, lagging it one
period and multiplying the lagged equation by a2 and then subtracting this
from the unlagged equation, the result in the text immediately follows.

     We should caution here that these parameters may actually represent
parameters of the real value added function, not parameters of the demand
curve. However, since the implications that result would essentially be
the same, for expository convenience we continue in the text to refer to them
as parameters of the demand function. An analogous problem arises with
respect to the parameters of equation (62) below.

     37. See Wayne Vroman (1980) for a description of the model and data.
We are grateful to him for generously providing us with these data.

     38. As Section III suggests, however, there are situations in which
Increased residual uncertainty would increase the probability of observing
an indexed contract, which is not the empirical result we observe.

     39. Some studies, however, find that relative risk aversion exceeds
unity. See, for example, Henry Farber (1978) and Irwin Friend and Marshall
Blume (1975).

     40. For example, in 1981 45 percent of all major collective bargain-
ing agreements with OJLA's called for quarterly reviews, 21 percent called
for semi—annual reviews, and 30 percent had annual reviews (see Douglas
LeRoy (1981)).

        41. See AFL—CIO (1979).
                                                                        74




      42. COLA's may also be excluded from wages for the purpose of
 computing.certain nonwage benefits in some cases (e.g., vacation pay) and
 some contracts also permit COLA adjustments to be deferred to pay for
 nonwage benefits (e.g., COLA being used to finance improved benefits for
 retirees rather than increased pay for existing employees).

      43. Our discussion of these two approaches should make it clear why
we consider it equally inappropriate to use the expected COLA increase,
valued at the expected level of inflation over the contract, as a measure
of the generosity of a COLA. This measure, which Hendricks and Kahn inform
us they plan to use in future work, tells us little about the response of
wages to unanticipated inflation.

      44. This test may be excessively stringent. To see this note that
more generous COLA provisions are, ceteris paribus, those with frequent
reviews, reviews in the first year, large wage increases for given CPI
increases, a short number of months until the first review, minimum
guaranteed COLA increases, and no maximum permissable increase (cap). If
a variable, in theory, should increase generosity, we test if it has
influenced each of the above in a way that increases, or does not affect,
the COLA. A weaker test would allow some of the provisions to move in
"opposite directions" as long as the net effect is to make the COLA more
generous. This would require us, however, to reduce the COLA formula to a
single number and, as we have argued in the text, we do not believe that
this is a wise strategy.

      45. We are grateful to John Carlson of Purdue for providing the
unpublished data for the most recent years to us.

      46. The Livingston Series could not be used here since the underlying
survey is conducted every six months and we required quarterly expectations.

      47. Producer price indices for many of the industries were not
collected prior to 1973. 1978 was chosen as the end date because most of
the contracts in the sample commenced at that date or later.

      48. Of course, since only 1 of 11 UI coefficients is statistically
significant, and that at less than the .05 level, this may reflect only a
spurious correlation.

      49. In any case, we did not receive the micro data in a form that
would allow us to use the approaches of either Hendricks and Kahn (1982)
or Card (1981).

wage indexed is defined by

previously defined, is the wage with wage indexation. An approximate value

for I is given by
