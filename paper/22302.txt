Returns to Consumer Search: Evidence from eBay

                                          ABSTRACT

A growing body of empirical literature finds that consumers are relatively limited in how much
they search over product characteristics. We assemble a dataset of search and purchase behavior
from eBay to quantify the returns, and thus implied costs, to consumer search on the internet.
The extensive nature of the eBay data allows us to examine a rich and detailed set of questions
related to search in a way that previous structural models cannot. In contrast to the literature, we
find that consumers search a lot: on average 36 times per purchase over 3 (distinct) days, with
most sessions ending in no purchase. We find that search costs are relatively low, in the region of
25 cents per search page. We pursue the analysis further by, i) examining how users refine their
search, ii) how search behavior spans multiple search sessions, and iii) how the amount of search
relates to finding lower prices.

1     Introduction
Across a wide range of markets, from online retail to consumer packaged
goods to mutual funds, consumers must actively search to obtain information
about available products and their prices. Following Stigler (1961), models
of costly search helped explain imperfectly competitive behavior and price
dispersion in seemingly competitive markets with homogeneous goods. A
recent wave of empirical papers argue that consumers do not search extensively,
implying that search costs must be high. We argue that these conclusions are
based on limited data, and as such, were forced to rely on theoretical models
and structural estimation to infer search costs. In essence, this literature
substitutes models and structure for data, leading to search costs estimates
that seem unrealistically high. We, instead, analyze both search behavior and
the implied search costs with panel data containing comprehensive search
and purchase behavior. We find that users search extensively, which implies
that search costs are quite modest.
    The theory underpinning the structural literature generally follows one
of the two canonical models of search in economics. The first, developed
by Stigler (1961), assumes that consumers sample a fixed number of stores,
or websites, and choose to buy the lowest priced item. The second, more
widely adopted theoretical model was developed first by McCall (1970) and
Mortensen (1970), who posit that a model of sequential search is a better
description of consumer search behavior. Both modeling approaches make
assumptions and develop structure that can reduce the need for data in an
attempt to measure search costs. For example, Hong and Shum (2006) infer
search costs from a structural model that only uses online price data with
no consumer behavior data at all. They estimate a median search cost for
a book using a Stigler-like fixed sample size model to be $2.32, whereas a
sequential-search model delivers an estimate of $29.40 per search. De los


                                      1
Santos et al. (2012) use Comscore data that includes online book purchases
with some limited search behavior data. Their data is more consistent with
the fixed sample size search model, and they estimate search costs that are on
average around $1.35 or $4.14 per search, depending on some assumptions.
   In a more recent paper, Koulayev (2014) develops a model motivated
by the features of a hotel search website from which he obtained data. He
estimates the median search cost of an extra online search for a hotel to be
around $10 per page of results, though it can be as high as $30 for some
consumers. This is a direct consequence of the fact that in his data, consumers
search very little, many only engaging in one or two searches. This observation
is, as we suggest, a consequence of limited data; because users in his sample
are anonymous, Koulayev (2014) cannot connect searches made by the same
person more than 24 hours apart.
   Unlike the empirical studies described above, we use comprehensive data
from eBay to shed light on the search process with minimal modeling assump-
tions. The data show that consumers actually search significantly more than
other studies have suggested – on average 36 times per purchase. Consumer
search is a protracted process, which can span 3.5 distinct days over a period
of several weeks. Furthermore, there is a large tail of heavy searchers; we
find that 5 percent of users are still searching for the same product 30 days
after starting a search. Unlike previous studies like those mentioned above,
we estimate the average costs per search to be about $0.25. To put this in
perspective, if a user spends about a minute per search then the estimates
of Hong and Shum (2006), De los Santos et al. (2012) and Koulayev (2014)
suggest an hourly opportunity cost of search in the range of $81 to $1,800,
while our estimate is about $15, which we believe is a much more realistic
estimate.
   Our rich data allows us not only to use minimal assumptions to estimate
search costs, but it also offers some insights on the way people search. Consider


                                       2
a consumer’s book purchase decision: You may have a vague intuition about
the type of book you want to read (fiction vs. non-fiction), so you go to
Amazon and search for “non-fiction”, trusting Amazon’s search engine to
return best-selling results to you. You then click on a few different titles
and read some reviews. The next day you return to Amazon and search for
“non-fiction WW2” having decided you wanted to read a book in that category.
After a few more sessions like this, you settle on a book and then check Barnes
and Noble’s website, and maybe a couple more websites, to see if they have
a cheaper price. When Johnson et al. (2004) document that “On average,
households visit only 1.2 book sites” they are referring to the very last piece
of this search process. Similarly, when Kim et al. (2010) estimate that for
consumers searching for a digital camera, “The mean of the search set size
distribution is 14,” they are inferring from decisions that consumers made
within a single search session, ignoring previous (or later) search sessions that
the same consumer engaged in.
   In our data we are able to track individuals over time, and are therefore
able to link their search sessions over time all the way through to either a
purchase or abandonment of the search. The richness of the data allows us to
shed light on the search process by using simple econometric techniques that
do not rely on complex models or structure. We therefore contribute to the
existing literature in three ways.
   First, we start by documenting behavior within a given search session
using a cross section of search efforts at a single point in time. We examine
the clickstream data for a particular day and find that users refine searches
as they engage with the site, very much like the example of choosing a book
that we described above. The data suggests that the average number of terms
in the query increases as the session unfolds. We also find that the use of the
default “best match” ranking declines as users move to more “deterministic”
searches that sort over prices, and the average price of search results declines


                                       3
over time. Thus, it seems that people search in ways that are consistent
neither with the fixed-set nor with the sequential search models.
   Second, we construct a cohort of 500,000 users who searched on a single
day and track their activity over long periods of time. We then tabulate all
search and purchase activity for these users for the following 30 days. We
find that users search frequently and over a protracted period, sometimes
spanning weeks. Users perform about 144 searches per user for an average of
4 transaction, suggesting an average of 36 searches per transaction. These
searches also span an average of 11 distinct (i.e., non-consecutive, active) days.
This is in stark contrast to previous studies who used data that is significantly
more constrained. For example, De los Santos et al. (2012) analyze (limited)
browsing data up to 7 days before a transaction and state that “one week
is long enough to capture all search behavior related to a transaction.” Our
data show that this is too restrictive an assumption, which will understate
the amount of search performed by consumers.
   Third, we put together a third data set based on a “reverse cohort” analysis
to quantify the returns to searching, and through this analysis, propose a
simple estimate of the cost of searching. Like much of the previous literature
we create the cohort by conditioning on a purchase and then observing the
purchaser’s prior search levels. However, eBay’s rich data allows us to go back
over many days to fully capture the search process and to compare purchase
outcomes to comparable purchases to see how the purchase price compares
to the expected price for the item. Then, using a simple revealed preference
approach, we back out the implied search costs. We find that gains from
search are modest compared to the prior literature but still demonstrably
positive. Consumers save, on average, 25 cents per search page and about 75
cents for each day spent searching. We then identify a proxy for patience and
show that users who are more patient actually search more, consistent with
intuition from economic theory.


                                        4
    The richness of our data, and our simple revealed preference approach puts
our paper in stark contrast to other recent empirical studies. Previous studies
either use data from Comscore (Johnson et al., 2004; De los Santos et al., 2012)
or infer search costs from purchase or scraped “view-item” behavior (Kim
et al., 2010; Seiler, 2013). In both instances, the data constraints are severe.
With the Comscore data, researchers can observe the purchased product and
the sites that were visited, but don’t observe the products that were searched
for, the results returned to the user, or the number of searches within a site.
When search behavior is inferred from purchases, a whole host of assumptions
go into a model that substitutes for the lack of actual search data. Papers
that work with actual primitive search data do not link users across sessions
and, perhaps consequently, find that users search very little and have high
search costs (Koulayev, 2014; Ghose et al., 2014).
    It is important to note that a limitation of our analysis is that we only
observe what users do on the ebay.com website. This implies, however, that our
already low estimates of search costs can be considered upper bounds. Because
many users probably search on more than just eBay’s marketplace, actual
search costs are likely to be even lower than what we estimate. Furthermore,
if consumers may have sampled both online competitors and traditional brick-
and-mortar retailers before buying on eBay then their implied search costs
are even lower.


2     Background & Data

2.1    Background: Search at eBay
As with many online retail or marketplace websites, search is the main way
that consumers find products on eBay. A common pattern is shown in Figure
1, where a consumer arrives at the ebay.com homepage and is confronted


                                       5
with a large search box on the top of the page. After entering a search term
(or “query”), the user is taken to a “search results page” (SRP). As figure 1a
documents, a list of available products, together with some information about
each product, are available directly on that page. The information typically
includes a picture, whether or not it is an auction or fixed price listing, the
item’s price (or current auction price), and when the listing ends. Fifty items
are listed per page by default, with the user needing to click “next” in order
to advance to the next page of results. If the user sees a product that interests
him or her, he or she clicks on the title and is taken to a “view-item page”
(VIP) with more information about the item, including detailed information
about the seller, the product’s condition, and any other notes that the seller
has entered about the product, as shown in Figure 1b. From there, if the
user is interested in purchasing the product, he or she can bid in the auction
(if it is an auction listing) or purchase the item from the seller if the item is a
fixed price (“buy it now”) listing. If the user is not interested in the product
or wishes to do more exploration, he or she can return to the SRP page (not
counted as a separate search) and click on other items or refine the search
query to change or refine the focus of the search.
    From the perspective of a marketplace platform like eBay (or any retail
website more generally), the search process provides many levers for influencing
a consumer’s decisions. Perhaps the most important is the order in which
search results are displayed. Figure 1a illustrates that a search for the term
“watch” returns over 1.4 million listings. With so many options to choose
from, finding a product match without a good ranking algorithm would be
a herculean task to say the least. It also indicates that the orderings of
search results potentially plays a large role in determining which products
are purchased or whether a product is purchased at all. With a platform
like eBay, these results are a mix of different products (as illustrated by all
of the different watch types available) and different sellers listing the same

product for different prices or in different conditions. This provides us with
opportunities, such as observing the same user searching through different
sellers of the same product, but also with challenges, such as the difficulty
in determining whether two listings are actually the same product because
product characteristics are potentially amorphous.
       By default, eBay displays search results using a ranking algorithm called
“Best Match.”1 The best match algorithm was created to display items in
the order that best predicts expected eBay revenue, maximized by increasing
the probability that a product is purchased times its sale price.2 Behind the
   1
     Users have the option of sorting according to other ranking schemes, including by
highest price, by lowest price, and time ending soonest (for auctions). Interestingly, most
users do not “unsort” best match, but we are cognizant of the potential concerns that
these options give rise to and it will be discussed in the context of selecting a sample for
our study.
   2
     Historically, eBay has generated revenues that are comprised of some fees for listing an
item on the site (listing fees) and a percentage of the sales prices (final-value fees, typically



                                               7
scenes is a machine learning algorithm where the target is eBay’s revenue,
which is trained on data that is associated with both product and seller
characteristics. The results of this machine learning process are fit to the
current set of products available that match any given search term.


2.2     Available Data
Data for this project come from internal eBay records. For years eBay has
done an extremely thorough job recording data from the search and purchase
process. There are two sources for this data. First, all transaction relevant
information such as bids, purchases, price paid, buyer and seller IDs, etc., are
recorded in a structured database used as a record of all transactional activity
on eBay. These records tend to be precise with very few errors or leakage.
Second, eBay logs “clickstream” data that tracks how users navigate through
the site. This is a much messier process given the amount of data and its semi-
structured nature. These data are divided into sessions, defined by 30 minutes
of inactivity for a given user. Within the session, eBay records all clicks that
occur, and, for search results, an extremely rich set of information about what
was displayed to the user, including the ordering of items displayed and their
properties. Essentially, as far as search and economic choice is considered,
eBay captures and records the whole “consideration set”, what a user typed
to obtain that set, and how that translated into a user’s click behavior, all
the way up to a purchase, or to abandonment of the search process.
   One large benefit of eBay’s internal records data is that a user can be
tracked across sessions and purchases, which allows us to link a user’s behavior
across sessions over time. Correctly recording this is easy if a user is signed
in across multiple sessions (which they would need to be in order to purchase
or participate in activities like bidding or making offers, which show up
around 9%) when an item successfully sells. Most of eBay’s revenue is generated by the
final value fees.


                                          8
in the transactional logs) but trickier given that most users are often not
signed in during exploratory searches even if they have an eBay account.
Fortunately, eBay does a substantial amount of work to unpack who these
users are. “Cookies”, or little bits of information that are stored on a user’s
computer and then transmitted to sites every time a page is requested, are
key to this process. Whenever a new browser is seen by the eBay servers, a
cookie with a unique ID is “dropped” on the browser/computer. This ID is
then tracked through all of the clickstream data. If a user ever logs in on
that browser/computer, the system automatically backfills all clickstream
information to reflect the fact that the system has learned who the user was
who generated all of that clickstream data. There is noise in the process,
for instance, if multiple people sign in from the same browser/computer or
if a user never signs in from a computer but browses on it. For the most
part, however, the process works well – internal eBay audits indicated that
somewhere around 70% of search behavior can be tracked back to an eBay
user account.


2.3    Data Selection
In theory, transactional records are available for all users going back to 2005
and clickstream records going back to 2010. The volume of this data, however,
is way too large for any meaningful analysis without careful selection rules.
We believe that three styles of analysis make the most sense in the context
of analyzing search behavior: 1) Cross-sectional. For any given day or
relatively short window, construct a dataset that includes all search behavior
and associated product/seller characteristics. This sort of analysis is most
suited for getting a sense of complete search behavior for a given search term.
2) Cohort analysis. Track all search and purchase behavior for a cohort of
users, selected with some larger goal in mind. This style of analysis has the


                                      9
advantage of tying search behavior to users at a very detailed level and gives
a complete picture for any given individual, but does not allow for working
through models of equilibrium behavior. 3) Condition on purchase. Find
all buyers of items and examine pre-purchase behavior, that is, search behavior
that occurred before the purchase was recorded. This data, which effectively
would be constructed looking backward (hence the term “reverse cohort”),
would allow for the comparison of search strategies and effort across different
types of purchases. We explore each of these approaches in the following
sections.


3     Cross Section - Within Session Behavior
We start by documenting behavior within a given search session. This
constitutes a cross section of search efforts at a single point in time. We
examined the clickstream data for a particular day and summarized select
measures of search as they evolve with time within a given session. For this
purpose we used data generated by searches that started on July 27th, 2014.
We computed the time since the users’ first site activity (on that day) for each
search event and then examined how different measures of search behavior
evolved as users refined their search.
    As expected, many users drop off in the first few minutes of sessions
suggesting that many searchers abandon the site if they do not quickly find
what they are looking for. This, for example, might be a consequence of a
consumer checking across several websites, eBay being just one, in order to
get an idea of selection and prices. The rate of quick termination is not very
high, and the majority of sessions last many minutes.
    We then considered measures that quantify the specificity of each search.
For example, early in a search a user may use the query “watch”, then refine
it to “men’s watch” and later add further qualifying words such as color,


                                         10
shape, strap type, and more. Hence, the number of words used can proxy for
how refined a focused a search is. Similarly, early in the exploratory phase of
a search a user may be happy to use eBay’s Best Match algorithm for sorting
items, but once a search has been refined and the user has a clear item in
mind for purchase, the user may want to use price as a ranking in order to
find a good deal.
        The data suggest that users do indeed refine searches as they engage with
the site over time within a session. The results are summarized in Figure 2.
The average number of terms in the query rises over time. The propensity to
use the default ranking declines over time as users move to more ’deterministic’
searches like price sorts. The average price of search results also declines over
time.
        In summary, the simple cross-section search analysis suggests that search
follows an intuitive pattern. Users seem to focus and refine their searches as
the search session progresses, with indications that the process starts with
more of a “what would I like” phase, followed by more of a “find a good
deal” phase. This behavior fits neither the fixed-sample search models nor
the sequential search models described earlier.3


4         Cohort Analysis
For the purposes of trying to understand user behavior across time, we
constructed a cohort of searchers by identifying a pool of searchers from a
single seed day, July 27, 2014.4 We identified the full list of unique, logged in,
    3
     Though not reported in our paper, similarly to De los Santos et al. (2012) we find that
users return to view items that they already viewed earlier, which is inconsistent with the
sequential search model. And the way in which people refine their searches is not captured
by the fixed-sample models either.

     This date is a Sunday, which we chose deliberately to increase the sample as the
broadest set of users search on Sundays. When instead sampled a Friday and performed
our analyses on that data set, the results were virtually unchanged.

This plots several metrics within a single search session. Each plot shows mean values for the indicated
value on the vertical axis for the minute from session start on horizontal axis. Plots show (starting in the
upper left) the i) number of users still actively searching , ii) the average number of words in each query
searched, iii) the percent of performed searches that use the default algorithmic ranking, iv) the average
price of all items returned on the search page, v) the number of purchase events, and vi) a normalized plot
of the log of transaction prices which represents the percentage deviation from average purchase price.




users that performed at least one search on that day and then took a sample
of 500,000 users to make the analyses manageable. We focused on logged-in
users because their activity can be tracked over long periods of time. Any site
activity that occurs on a browser or device on which the user has ever logged
in can then be matched by mapping cookies to a common user. We then
tabulated all search and purchase activity for these users for the following 30


                                                                           12
days after the July 27 search. We believe that this period of time should be
long enough to capture all of at least one purchase intent.5
       We found that users search frequently and over a protracted period,
sometimes spanning several weeks. Table 1 presents summary statistics of
the resulting panel. Users search, on average, a great deal. There are 144
searches per user for an average of 4 transaction. This suggest an average
of 36 searches per transaction. These searches also span an average of 11
distinct (i.e. non-consecutive, active) days. Users tend to search within a
narrow product range, spanning 2.4 categories of products.6

       Much of this search activity is undoubtedly for many overlapping search
efforts because users may be searching eBay for many items at the same
time. That said, there is evidence of substantial repetition of searches across
separate days. An obvious way to measure repeat search behavior is to track
the individual search query strings across time in our panel. That is, we
identified all of the search queries on our seed date, and then identified which
users repeated one of those searches for every subsequent day in the panel.
   5
     We note that this sample construction is left truncated; this is likely to be searching
activity related to the same purchase prior to the seed date for some users. Given that
search activity is continuous and ongoing for many users, identifying the exact beginning of
any given search intent would require additional assumptions about the definition of search
intents. If anything, the fact that we may be truncating prior search behavior means that
users may search even more than we infer they do from our data.
   6
     We are using a slightly broad definition of category, such that there are 110 unique
categories in our panel.

                                            13
    We found that the average user repeats a specific search query on 3.5
separate days during this 30 day panel window. Figure 3 shows that these
repeat searches taper off over time but over 5 percent of the panel is still
searching 30 days after the seed date. For reference, Figure 3 also plots the
fraction of users that purchase on each day in the panel. The panel was
selected based on actively searching on the seed date, so there is naturally a
greater purchase volume in the beginning of the window. The purchase rate
appears to reach a stable weekly cycle (peaks are Sundays) about half way
through the panel, which is about 2 weeks. Interestingly, the search efforts
continue past that time, which is indicative that unsuccessful search efforts
last longer than successful ones.
    In summary, the cohort analyses suggest that users search a lot more than
one might have concluded from previous studies. As mentioned earlier, De los
Santos et al. (2012) assume that “one week is long enough to capture all
search behavior related to a transaction.” Our analyses shows that this is
too restrictive an assumption, which will understate the amount of search
performed by consumers. Moreover, we are restricted to search activity
recorded only on eBay. Since multi-homing is common (i.e., users will search
sites like Amazon, Etsy, and others), actual search activity is likely to be even
more intense than we are able to show with our data.


5     Reverse Cohort Analysis
We now turn to an alternative approach to quantify the returns to searching,
and through this analysis, propose a simple estimate of the cost of searching.
We turn back to the tradition in the literature of conditioning on a purchase
and then connecting price to the purchaser’s prior search levels. However,
eBay’s rich data allows us to add two important features to the analysis
that are critical: 1) we collect data going back over many days to try and

fully capture the search process and 2) we compare purchase outcomes to
comparable purchases to see how the purchase price compares to the expected
price for the item.
   This approach allows us to use a simple method that does not rely on the
structure of a more complex theoretical model to tease out search costs from
the data. That said, we still follow the most basic of economic theories: that
by revealed preference on search intensity and the resulting price savings,
we can identify the search costs. One disadvantage of our approach is that
we do not attempt to explicitly identify search costs separately from other
underlying structural parameters. The reverse cohort strategy uses variation
from two different consumers searching different amounts for the same product.
If other fundamentals differ between these consumers then the interpretation
of our reduced form numbers as search costs might be incorrect. For instance,


                                                                                   15
if an individual’s price coefficient is correlated with their search costs, then
inelastic customers might search less not because they have high search costs,
but because the mapping of the gains from searching into utility (the price
coefficient) is different relative to someone that searches a lot. Nevertheless,
with this caveat in mind, we believe that the gains to searching that we
document can be thought of approximately as search costs. If in order to
obtain a reduction in price of $2 a user must engage in 5 searches, then we
infer the cost of a search to be 40 cents. Of course, to perform this kind
of analysis we must set other things equal, in particular, the product under
consideration.
   To do this we identified all purchasers on an arbitrary date, July 27th, 2014.
We then limited the sample to purchases of common and well defined goods
which have defined product identifications (declared by sellers or flagged by
eBay). These ‘well defined’ items are generally those with Universal Product
Codes (UPCs). We defined a product as ‘common’ if we found at least 10
purchases of that same product in the 6 weeks prior to our selection date.
This allowed us to construct a distribution of prices for each of the goods in
our sample.
   Next we identified all search behavior of the buyer in the 6 weeks prior
to the purchase. A challenge is to identify searches related to the product
purchased, knowing that the queries over time may have changed due to
refinements of all sorts. To do this, we first we counted the number of searches
that returned items which are identified as being the exact same product that
was eventually purchased. That is, we relied on eBay’s search engine to infer
that the user is searching for the kind of items that were eventually purchased.
We then identified the length of search as the time between the first search
and purchase as another measure of search intensity. Finally, we counted the
number of distinct days on which the user searched for the product.



                                      16
   We then computed the expected product price by taking the mean of all
of the purchases of a given product in the 6 weeks prior to the selection date.
We treat this as the expected price one would pay for a product in lieu of
search activity. We proceeded to derive the discount relative to the expected
product price as the percentage difference between expected price and the
buyer’s realized purchase price.
   Figure 4 displays distribution of the deviation from mean price for the
product purchased during the sample period, as well as the distribution of
our three measures of search intensity described above. There is a general left
skewness in the price data; most users realize a slightly below average price
but some pay very high prices. The search metrics all exhibit long right tails;
most users search very little yet some search quite intensively, consistent with
the cohort analysis described in Section 4. We will use the search intensity
measures to impute returns to search.
   Using the data we collected we proceeded to explore the relationship
between measures of prices paid and of search intensity, which are displayed
in Figure 5. The first row of Figure 5 shows the mean price paid for the
different levels of the indicated search intensity (days searching, days since first
search, and the number of searches). There is generally a positive relationship
between price and search, which at first glance may be surprising. However,
this does not control for the product purchased. Users presumably spend
more time searching for costlier purchases because they expect to get a larger
absolute value of savings from additional searches. Hence, this should not be
interpreted as a causal relationship but rather one driven by selection.
   We controlled for this selection by controlling for the products being
purchased. That is, rather than use price paid on the y-axis we plot the
percent difference from the expected price that would have been paid for
the purchased product. The second row of Figure 5 shows a clear negative
relationship between our three measures of search intensity and the price paid.

That is, the more a consumer searches for a given product, the lower the pice
paid for that product.
   The results shown in Figure 5 sit well with search theory: the more a
user can benefit from search, the more they search, and conditional on a
given product, the more they search the less they pay. We can quantify this
return on searching using a set of simple regressions to infer the actual costs
of a search. That is, using a revealed preference approach we use the actual
searches and the resulting price discount to infer the willingness to search,
and hence, the implied search costs. Table 2 shows the results.
   Columns 1 through 3 show regressions of price on search with product
fixed effects. Each additional search is associated with a 26 cent reduction in
the price. Columns 4 through 7 show results from a regression using percent
discount and log price as dependent variables. The coefficients in these

columns can be interpreted as percentage gains to searching. An additional
search is associated with a 0.2% to 0.3% gain. For the mean sample purchase
price in this sample, that is also about 25 cents. Each additional day spent
searching yields a 0.8% or 75 cents savings.
                   These magnitudes are much more sensible than those described earlier
from the existing literature and seem like reasonable returns to such modest
efforts. It is hard to exactly assess how long a search takes. As described
in the introduction, if a user spends about a minute per search then the
estimates of Hong and Shum (2006), De los Santos et al. (2012) and Koulayev
(2014) suggest an hourly opportunity cost of search in the range of $81 to
$1,800, while our estimate is about $15 and hour. If a search takes half the
time then these estimates should be doubled. It is, of course, the fact that we
observe a lot of search behavior that results in our lower and more believable
measures of search costs.

6          Search Cost Heterogeneity
One might reasonably expect there to be a large amount of heterogeneity in
search behavior across consumers. Indeed, there are surely a myriad of factors
that distinguish intensive searching consumers from more passive consumers.
An obvious one would be heterogeneity in search costs. Any economic theory
of search would imply that consumers with higher search costs will search
less. A complete exploration of the mechanisms underlying search intensity is
beyond the scope of this paper, but we can show that comprehensive data like
ours can unlock insights that narrow data and modeling assumptions cannot.
      To shed some light on the issue of heterogeneity, we explore one consumer
characteristic that would explain heterogeneity in search intensity: patience.
More patient consumers would be willing to spend more time delaying a
purchase in order to achieve a better deal. Hence, if we could measure
patience, then we could test whether more patient users tend to engage in
more search.
      Clearly, patience is not observable to us. However, we can use another
revealed preference choice of consumers to rank them as more or less patient.
As a proxy for patience we use a consumer’s choice of shipping methods.

                                                                              20
Many sellers on ebay offer potential buyers a variety of shipping methods
from slowest to fastest, and the faster shipping methods obviously cost more.
Hence, users who choose faster shipping methods reveal less patience compared
to those who choose those that are cheaper, yet come with more delay.

   We constructed an indicator for each consumer recording whether or not
they chose the fastest option when they were faced with multiple shipping
options, hence being a proxy for impatience. The assumption is that the
more impatient a consumer is, the more willing they are to pay extra for a
faster shipping option. We then regressed this indicator of impatience on our
measures of search intensity in the reverse cohort dataset.
   Table 3 shows that choosing expedited shipping is generally negatively
correlated with search intensity. This confirms our intuition from search
models: the more impatient a consumer is, the less they should engage in
search behavior that will delay their purchase. Columns (1) through (3)
show that each of our search intensity measures are significantly negatively
correlated with our proxy of impatience. When all three measures are put

                                              21
in the same regression as shown in column (4), only the number of searches
returning the same product ID remains significant. This should not be
surprising because the three measures are positively correlated.


7     Discussion and Conclusion
Putting all of the analysis together leads to a rather coherent story of search
behavior. Consumers search a lot on eBay both within and across sessions.
This intensive amount of search behavior should imply that search costs are
relatively modest online. Indeed, our measure of the returns to search is on
the order of 25 cents per search. This is in contrast to the existing literature
findings, which indicate very little product search and consequently estimate
high search costs as a justification of the low amount of search.
    The data suggest not only that search costs are low, but that search
proceeds as a kind of “funnel” where initially search is along broad categories,
and then search becomes more refined to obtain a good at the lowest cost
given a consumer’s cost of search. In thinking with this heuristic model, a few
things become apparent. First, firm behavior, and specifically the ordering
of search results, should cater to these types of search patterns. Where a
search engine like the one at eBay is tuned to encourage immediate purchase,
the site might be better served if it thought holistically about this search
funnel and helped consumers learn about the attributes of products in a way
that ultimately led them step by step down the process instead of assuming
that they are at the end of it. Search queries that indicate browsing behavior
might be met with results designed to encourage learning. In a way, this idea
of endogenous firm behavior relates closely to the literature on informative
advertising and consideration sets. In that literature (Goeree, 2008; Draganska
and Klapper, 2011), products enter a consumer’s consideration set through
costly advertising by firms. Here, products enter a consumer’s consideration


                                      22
set through search ranking by firms. Either way, one begins to question
whether firm behavior coincides with actions a social planner might take and
whether oligopolistic markets create inefficient outcomes.
   This search behavior has implications both for optimal firm actions and for
what market equilibria might look like. Consider a multi-stage model where
consumers are unaware of either the distribution of product characteristics or
of the individual draws of characteristics at different web sites. The consumer
must decide, in essence, whether to walk down a search funnel at eBay or
at another site. The user could of course do both, but the narrowing down
process is costly and does not necessarily translate across sites. For instance,
the user might observe the current set of results that are returned from a
search query for “watch” on eBay, which include used and old-fashioned
watches, narrowing down the search criteria over time, and homing in on a
self-winding antique. The user might then search for this same or similar
watches on other sites, which unlike eBay, would probably have a very limited
selection of antique used watches. Thus, because it is costly to do every
iteration of every search across sites, the initial decision of which site to search
on may have large consequences despite a large number of searches.
   This heuristic model of consumer behavior also sheds light on an empirical
regularity that has been a bit puzzling – evidence that consumers have strong
brand preferences across websites that essentially offer very similar services.
For instance Chevalier and Goolsbee (2003) argue that despite similarities
between Amazon and Barnes and Noble across a wide variety of dimensions,
consumers still have strong preferences for one or the other (see also Ellison
and Ellison (2005) for a summary of this literature). Plenty of explanations,
such as the fixed cost of registering for an account, have been put forward to
explain this, though these do not seem terribly convincing to us. The heuristic
search funnel model might be another explanation. If consumers start to
learn about the types of products that each site carries through search, then


                                        23
brand preferences will develop endogenously and be in part controlled by firm
behavior, in particular the search engine ranking schemes.
