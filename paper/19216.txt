Did Age Discrimination Protections Help Older Workers Weather the Great Recession?

NBER Working Paper No. 19216

                                             ABSTRACT

We examine whether stronger age discrimination laws at the state level moderated the impact of the
Great Recession on older workers. We use a difference-in-difference-in-differences strategy to compare
older workers in states with stronger and weaker laws, to their younger counterparts, both before, during,
and after the Great Recession. We find very little evidence that stronger age discrimination protections
helped older workers weather the Great Recession, relative to younger workers. The evidence sometimes
points in the opposite direction, with stronger state age discrimination protections associated with
more adverse effects of the Great Recession on older workers. We suggest that this may be because
during an experience like the Great Recession, severe labor market disruptions make it difficult to
discern discrimination, weakening the effects of stronger state age discrimination protections, or because
higher termination costs associated with stronger age discrimination protections do more to deter hiring
when future product and labor demand is highly uncertain.

I. Introduction

         The Great Recession led to dramatic increases in unemployment rates and unemployment durations

for workers of all ages. But unemployment durations of older individuals rose far more dramatically

(Figure 1). The relative increase in unemployment durations for older workers indicates that older

individuals who became unemployed as a result of the Great Recession, or who are seeking new

employment, have had greater difficulty becoming re-employed.

         The implication is that the effects of the Great Recession – which are likely to linger for many

years – may pose challenges to longer-term reforms intended to increase employment of older workers,

such as increases in the Full Retirement Age (FRA) for Social Security. Unemployed workers may be

more likely to claim Social Security benefits early (Hutchens, 1999), to forego returning to work, and to

seek support from other public programs to bridge the period until age 62 (Autor and Duggan, 2003; Dorn

and Sousa-Poza, 2010; Riphahn, 1997). Difficulties in getting hired seem likely to exacerbate these effects,

making it harder to return to employment, and forestalling efforts of older individuals to find the partial-

retirement jobs that they often use to bridge career employment to retirement (Cahill et al., 2005; Johnson

et al., 2009).

         The increase in unemployment durations for older workers has led to speculation that age

discrimination plays a role.1 One possible perspective is a static one. In particular, there may be no change

in the tendency of employers to engage in age discrimination during and after the Great Recession.

Nonetheless, the large numbers of layoff that occurred may have put more older workers at risk of

experiencing age discrimination, leading to large increases in unemployment durations.

         Alternatively, there may have been increases in discrimination. One possibility is that in slack

labor markets long queues of job applicants make it less costly for employers to discriminate, because they

are not passing up qualified older workers in favor of less-qualified younger workers; this argument goes

back to Ashenfelter (1970) and Freeman (1973), and was recently considered by Biddle and Hamermesh

(2013). The data are consistent at least with rising perceived discrimination. As Figure 2 shows, based on

Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims filed with the U.S. Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (EEOC), that age discrimination claims rose sharply at the beginning of the Great

Recession, and have remained elevated. (Claims also rose during the earlier recession covered in this

graph, but subsequently fell more quickly.)

        This basic hypothesis that age discrimination may have increased or become more important during

the Great Recession, and remained prominent, provides a simple motivation for our analysis. In particular,

many states offer stronger protections against age discrimination than the federal ADEA. Recent work

finds that these stronger state protections affect employment and Social Security benefit claiming of older

individuals, leading to more delaying of claiming benefits until the Full Retirement Age (FRA) and

increased employment prior to the FRA, in part because stronger age discrimination protections are

associated with increased hiring of older individuals into new jobs (Neumark and Song, forthcoming).

        Motivated by this hypothesis and this other evidence, we ask whether these stronger age

discrimination protections at the state level also acted to protect older workers during and after the Great

Recession. Of course we do not actually know whether age discrimination was or is occurring. But we can

ask whether these state protections reduced the adverse effects of the Great Recession on older workers

relative to younger workers.

        The reality can, however, be more complicated. The labor market turbulence that severe recessions

create may make it difficult to sort out the effects of age discrimination versus changing business

conditions on employment adjustments, reducing the likelihood that workers, attorneys, or the EEOC or

state commissions that enforce state anti-discrimination laws perceive age discrimination, or that claims of

age discrimination can prevail. These conjectures suggest that stronger age discrimination protections may

be particularly valuable during severe recessions, in which case older workers should have fared relatively

better during and after the Great Recession in states with stronger protections. On the other hand, the

diminished effectiveness of age discrimination protections during recessions could give rise to a situation in

which the Great Recession led to worse outcomes for older worker in states with stronger age



                                                       2
discrimination protections. One possibility is that because stronger state age discrimination laws impose

constraints on employers, there could be more “pent-up demand” for age discrimination in these states,

which firms act on during a sharp downturn. This type of story has parallels to economic research arguing

that firms may undertake more organizational restructuring or labor reallocation during economic

downturns (e.g., Aghion and Saint-Paul, 1998; Davis and Haltiwanger, 1990; Koenders and Rogerson,

2005).

         An alternative story with the same consequence stems from past work thinking about the effects of

anti-discrimination laws on hiring and terminations. In particular, there has been some speculation that age

discrimination laws may reduce hiring of older workers. Why? In hiring discrimination cases it is difficult

to identify a class of affected workers, and for this reason and others economic damages can be much

smaller than in termination cases (Adams, 2004; Posner, 1995), reducing the effectiveness of these laws in

hiring cases. Moreover, because the ADEA makes it more difficult to terminate older workers (Neumark

and Stock, 1999), it may actually discourage their hiring (Bloch, 1994; Lahey, 2008a). This might be a

better argument for younger groups protected by anti-discrimination laws than for older workers, because

older workers are unlikely to stay with employers for a long time (in contrast, say, to a decision about

hiring a young black man protected by race discrimination laws). However, during and after the Great

Recession, product and labor demand may have been sufficiently uncertain that employers – in

contemplating hiring an older worker – perceived a stronger possibility of wanting to terminate that worker

before the worker voluntarily chose to leave. That is, in such a period it is more conceivable that stronger

age discrimination protections deterred hiring through the termination cost channel.

         Because of these considerations, we present estimates that distinguish the effects of age

discrimination protections before, during, and after the Great Recession. To summarize the results, we find

some mixed evidence, but generally little evidence that stronger age discrimination protections helped older

workers weather the Great Recession, relative to younger workers. The negative conclusion is particularly

clear for men. Indeed for the subset of cases where we find evidence that stronger state age discrimination

protections mediated the effects of the Great Recession, they appear to have made things relatively worse



                                                      3
for older men. In particular, state age discrimination laws allowing larger damages than the federal ADEA

were associated with relatively higher unemployment rates of older men (by about one percentage point in

the period after the Great Recession) and longer unemployment durations of older men by about 5.5 weeks

during and after the Great Recession.

        Similarly, in the period after the Great Recession older women in states with stronger age

discrimination protections in the form of applicability of state laws to smaller employers than those covered

by the ADEA experienced larger relative declines in the employment-to-population ratio (by about 1.5

percentage points), and where larger damages are allowed there was also a larger relative decline in the

hiring rate (by about 0.3 percentage point during the Great Recession, and 0.7 percentage point afterwards).

On the other hand, there is some evidence that in states with larger damages older women experienced

relatively smaller increases in unemployment durations during the Great Recession (by about 4.7 weeks) –

our one finding in which age discrimination laws appear to have protected older workers during the Great

Recession.

        In general, then, older workers bore more of the brunt of the Great Recession in states with stronger

age discrimination protections. This contrasts with the pre-Great Recession period, when both types of

stronger state age discrimination laws were associated with better relative outcomes for older workers –

most consistently with regard to hiring rates. Thus, this evidence is consistent with the interpretation that in

normal times age discrimination protections help older workers, as suggested by past work (Neumark and

Stock, 1999; Adams, 2004). However, during an experience like the Great Recession age discrimination

may worsen either because severe labor market disruptions make it difficult to discern discrimination, so

that employer behavior in states with and without stronger age discrimination protections becomes more

similar, or higher termination costs associated with stronger age discrimination protections do more to deter

hiring of older workers when future product and labor demand is uncertain.

II. Related Research

        There are four strands of related prior research. First, existing research provides ample evidence

that age discrimination remains pervasive (Neumark, 2008). Moreover, some research as well as a good



                                                       4
deal of conjecture suggests that age discrimination is particularly pervasive with regard to hiring (Adams,

2004; Hirsch et al., 2000; Hutchens, 1988; Lahey, 2008b; Posner, 1995).

        Second, research establishes the effects of state and federal age discrimination laws in increasing

employment of protected older workers (Neumark and Stock, 1999; Adams, 2004), although not new hiring

(Adams, 2004; Lahey, 2008a). More recent evidence establishes that state age discrimination protections

that are stronger than the ADEA made it easier for workers affected by increases in the FRA to remain

employed, and finds evidence that these stronger state age discrimination protections were associated with

increased hiring of those affected by increases in the FRA (Neumark and Song, forthcoming).

        Third, research has begun to look at some of the effects of the Great Recession on older workers.

Gustman et al. (2011) find little impact on flows into retirement, although their data go only through 2010

and the labor market for older workers worsened subsequently. Rutledge and Coe (2012) estimate the

effect of the national unemployment rate during the Great Recession on early Social Security benefit

claiming, estimating sizable impacts. Bosworth (2012) studies the impact of the Great Recession on

retirement decisions of older workers, contrasting the push into retirement from job loss with the increased

incentive to work longer stemming from financial losses, and concludes that the job loss effect in

increasing retirement is stronger.

        Focusing on age differences, Munnell et al. (2009) note that the increase in unemployment rates for

older men relative to younger men was higher (for the December 2007-December 2008 period they study)

than in past recessions, when unemployment rates for younger men rose much more sharply than

unemployment rates for older men. They ascribe this to a decline in labor market protections for older

workers stemming from the decline in manufacturing as a share of employment – a sector with

considerable protections for more-senior workers – and a decline in the tenure of older workers relative to

younger workers – implying less of a specific human capital advantage for older workers that would make

firms less likely to lay them off.

        Finally, although not the focus of their paper, Davis and von Wachter (2011) report estimates of the

earnings loss associated with displacement, disaggregated by age, as well as whether the displacement



                                                      5
occurred during a recession. They show that the losses are far bigger for older workers (aged 51-60),

especially in relative terms since their counterfactual no-displacement earnings are higher. However, the

relative difference between displacements occurring during recessions or not are more modest for older

workers than for younger workers (although relative to counterfactual earnings, the losses are larger for

older workers displaced in non-recessionary periods than for any of the younger groups during recessions).

        Thus, the existing research suggests that there is age discrimination, that age discrimination laws

have some beneficial effects for older workers, and that the Great Recession adversely affected older

workers (perhaps more than other workers). However, there is no existing research that ties these

phenomena together to ask whether age discrimination laws mediated the effects of the Great Recession on

older workers.

III. Data

        We rely primarily on two data sources: the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Quarterly

Workforce Indicators (QWI). The CPS data provide estimates of the unemployment rate, the employment-

to-population ratio, and unemployment durations, while the QWI data measure hiring.

Current Population Survey (CPS)

        The CPS monthly micro-data were used to construct estimates by state, month, age group, and sex

of the unemployment rate, the employment-to-population ratio, and median unemployment duration.2

Population weights were used to create statistics that are representative of the populations within each state,

age group, sex, and month cell.

        The age groups we use are younger (prime-age) individuals (ages 25 to 44) and older individuals

(55 and older). There are two issues here: the appropriate control group for older workers, and how to

define older workers. The federal ADEA applies to those aged 40 and over, while some state laws extend

to younger workers. In that sense our younger (25-44) age group is not the ideal control. However we

chose this age range to match what is available in the QWI data, which are reported aggregated by age. We

also regard it as relatively unlikely that there is much age discrimination faced by those aged 40-44. In

 We do not use mean duration due to bias from top coding and changes to the top coding in January, 2011, from two
years to five (http://www.bls.gov/cps/duration.htm, viewed April 13, 2013).


                                                        6
defining older workers as 55 and older, we focus on ages for which policy reforms are attempting to

increase attachment to the labor force and lengthen work lives. However, we report sensitivity analyses

later using different age ranges to define both older and younger workers.

        Table 1 presents summary statistics for the CPS from 2003 to 2011 by age group and sex, both

unweighted and then weighted by state population.3 The weighted estimates weight more populous states

more heavily, leading to estimates that are representative of the population. In the analysis that follows, we

focus on the weighted estimates for precisely this reason; they are more informative about what age

discrimination laws imply for the effects of the Great Recession on the U.S. labor force.4 We do, however,

also discuss the sensitivity of our results to using unweighted estimates.

        Unemployment rates are higher for younger individuals than older individuals, for both men and

women (by 1.6 percentage points for men, and 1.8 percentage points for women, for the weighted

estimates), and unemployment rates are also lower for women (for both age groups). To some extent, the

former difference likely reflects the subjective nature of unemployment, as older individuals who cannot

find work may be more likely to leave the labor force. The employment-to-population ratios similarly

show that younger men and women are more likely to be employed. In contrast to unemployment rates,

durations are much higher for older than younger workers; median duration is higher by 7.8 weeks for older

men, and by 6.7 weeks for women (weighted estimates).

Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)

        For the QWI-based estimates of hiring, quarterly data by age, sex, and state were downloaded from

the Cornell University’s Virtual Research Data Center.5 The QWI provides data in age groups bins, so the


3
  Most likely due to small sample sizes in some cells, in particular for older individuals in small states there are
occasionally cells with no unemployed individuals in the sample, in which case unemployment durations cannot be
estimated. For our sample period there are two cells of younger men, four cells of younger women, 200 cells of older
men, and 331 cells of older women with no unemployed observations, out of a total of 5,400 observations for each age
group. For these cases, we replace the missing unemployment duration variables with zeros. As we discuss later, the
results were insensitive to dropping these cells from the analysis.
4
  Moreover, for the CPS data (although not the QWI data discussed below), we are using a sample of the population to
estimate the data for each state and month cell, which provides an econometric rationale for weighting to account for
the greater accuracy of the estimates from large cells.
5
  The QWI provides data for all states and the District of Columbia, with the exclusion of Massachusetts. We use the
R2013Q1 release, as of May 7, 2013. By downloading data from the Cornell RDC website, we acknowledge support
by NSF Grant #SES-0922005 that made these data possible.

younger group is generated by summing ages 25 to 34 and ages 35 to 44, and the older group is generated

by summing ages 55 to 64 and ages 65 to 99, separately by sex as well. QWI data became available for

different states at different times, and are updated for each state at different times.6 Data from all states are

available from 2004:Q2 to 2011:Q4 for hires, and 2005:Q3 to 2011:Q4 if DC is included. We use 2004:Q2

to 2011:Q4 and exclude Washington, DC, to create a balanced panel.7 We divided hires by the average

employment level from the QWI in 2005, to normalize hires as rates rather than levels that would reflect

state population; we use employment levels for each of the two age groups, and for men and women

separately. We chose to use 2005 because it is the first full year for which the QWI data are available. We

wanted to fix the base year so that the denominator of the hiring rate would not be influenced by changes in

the employment level, which could itself be influenced by the variables we study. There is a slight risk that

the base becomes less accurate as time moves forward because of changes in the age composition of the

population. But given the relatively short sample period this seems unlikely to matter much.

         Table 2 presents summary statistics for the QWI by age group and sex. Not surprisingly, the hiring

rate (as we define it) is higher for younger than for older workers, for both men and women. The hiring

rate is slightly higher for men than for women in both age groups.

         The QWI also reports data on separations, but not the reason for the separation (see Abowd et al.,

2009, p. 208). Because we cannot distinguish quits and layoffs, it is difficult to interpret results for

separations. For example, if age discrimination laws are associated with fewer separations for older worker

during the Great Recession, is that because the laws lead to relatively fewer layoffs (i.e., more protection),

or because the laws make it harder to get hired (less protection), so people do not leave jobs as readily?

The latter may be more likely, since more separations are voluntary, although the effects we estimate could

still be driven by the involuntary separations.8

State Age Discrimination Laws

        Data on age discrimination laws at the state level were compiled for Neumark and Song

(forthcoming) and are used here. In this paper we focus on two features of state age discrimination laws

that were found in that research to be effective: lower firm-size minimums for the applicability of state age

discrimination laws, and larger damages than under the federal ADEA.

        The firm-size minimum specifies the minimum number of employees working at a firm for state

age discrimination laws to apply. Whereas the ADEA applies for firms with 20 or more workers, many

states have lower minimums, and some apply to firms that have only one employee. Age discrimination

laws are stronger – covering more workers – the lower this minimum firm size.9 Figure 3 shows the

minimum firm size required for each state as of 2003. Following Neumark and Song (forthcoming), we

categorize states as either having lower firm-size minimum (fewer than 10) or higher firm-size minimum

(10 or more).10

        Larger potential damages are likely to arise when the state age discrimination laws go beyond those

of the federal law by providing compensatory or punitive damages, whether or not proof of intent or willful

violation is required. In 2003, there were 29 states (plus DC) with larger potential damage (henceforth

“larger damages”). These are shaded in Figure 3. There were no changes to this classification of states

during our sample period. Three states (AR, MS, and SD) do not have state age discrimination laws, and

these are put in the higher firm-size minimum group and classified as not having larger damages, because

in these states the ADEA prevails.



9
  Neumark and Song (forthcoming) find that older workers tend to work at smaller firms, which could reinforce the
effects of these lower firm-size minimums. This is also echoed in 2011 data from the Small Business Administration,
which show that the percentage of workers aged 65 and over who work at firms with fewer than 50 employees jumps
markedly (by 10 percentage points), relative to those aged 55-64 (and also drops with age over other age ranges), and
correspondingly the percentage at firms with 500 or more employees drops by 9 percentage points. Data from 1995
cover firms with fewer than 25 employees and the result is starker. The percentage of workers at these small firms
around 25 percent for ages 25-64, and jumps to 44 percent for those aged 65 and older. (See U.S. Small Business
Administration, 2012.) Nonetheless, lower firm-size minimums are still irrelevant for many employers.
10
   Since 2003, there have been few changes to these laws; the only change during our sample period is when Nebraska
changed its minimum firm size from 25 to 20 in 2007 and when Oklahoma changed it from 15 to one in December
2011. Since we classify states by having a lower firm-size minimum (fewer than 10) or higher firm-size minimum
(ten or more), only Oklahoma’s change requires recoding, and given that this change occurs in the final month of our
sample, we ignore it as it could only have a negligible effect.


                                                          9
IV. Methods

        To infer how stronger state age discrimination laws mediated the impact of the Great Recession on

older versus younger workers, we need to isolate the effects of these laws from other influences that affect

outcomes for these two age groups in this period relative to the pre-recession period. These other

influences can include differences that persist over time and across states. For example, we clearly want to

control for average differences between, say, unemployment rates for older and younger workers. In

addition, there may be some age-related differences that vary across states, perhaps because of differences

in industrial composition, the actual demographic makeup of the broad age groups we use, and other policy

differences. Finally, it is possible that the economic shocks caused by the Great Recession differed for

older and younger workers nationally, as well as by state, or that policy changes adopted because of the

recession had differential impacts. With regard to shocks, for example, the industries that were more

affected by the Great Recession may have tended to employ a greater share of older workers in some states.

        To control for these confounding factors, we employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences

(DDD) empirical strategy. In our case, we have four groups: (1) older individuals in states with stronger

laws, (2) older individuals in states with weaker laws, (3) younger individuals in states with stronger laws,

and (4) younger individuals in states with weaker laws. (We also have two classifications of stronger and

weaker laws, as noted above, but we ignore that variation for this discussion.) Moreover, we compare

differences between these four groups in periods during and after the Great Recession to before the Great

Recession – which is our third level of differencing – to ask how the impact of the Great Recession on

older versus younger workers depended on state age discrimination laws.

        At the same time, as discussed in the Introduction, we are also interested in how labor market

outcomes differed between older and younger workers in the period prior to the Great Recession, and how

these differences were associated with stronger state age discrimination protections. The coefficients

needed to reveal these differences also emerge from the DDD estimates, unless we saturate the model so

much so as to absorb pre-recession differences by age and state; we discuss this point later, and present

results for the post-recession period with and without this added level of saturation.



                                                      10
        For the statistical analysis, we need to specify pre- and post-Great Recession periods. Based on

NBER recession dates, we define the Great Recession as covering 2007:Q4 to 2009:Q2 for the quarterly

QWI data, and December 2007 to June 2009 for the monthly CPS data. We choose to consider the

recession period itself and the ensuing period separately, in part because (as we will see) the labor market

dynamics were quite different in these periods, and in part because labor market changes often lag the

output changes that define recessions.11 In addition, we might expect the data to be more reflective of the

influence of age discrimination laws (and other factors) in the period following the large layoffs that

occurred at the height of the Great Recession, when the very strong influence of product demand shocks

probably dominated everything else. This implies that we have two DDD estimators – one pertaining to the

Great Recession period relative to earlier, and the other pertaining to the post-Great Recession period

relative to the same pre-recession period.

         We start with the basic DDD model that does not include other controls, except seasonal

adjustment:




                                                                                                             [1]



                                  ×        3+     ×       ×        4+

where the subscript    indexes the age group – younger (25 to 44) or older (55+) – indexes the state, and

indexes time. The CPS data are monthly and extend from January 2003 to December 2011; the QWI data

are quarterly and cover 2004:Q2 to 2011:Q4.           is the outcome variable, OLD equals one for the older

group, and zero for the younger group, GR is a dummy for the time period of the Great Recession, AfterGR

is a dummy for the time period after the Great Recession, and LAW is a dummy variable, varying across

analyses for the two indicators we use of stronger state age discrimination laws. Rather than seasonally

adjusting the data used in the regressions, we simply include calendar-month (CPS) or calendar-quarter

11
  For example, following the Great Recession, aggregate U.S. economic growth became positive in the third quarter
of 2009 (http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp, viewed August 27, 2012), whereas job growth (as measured by
the payroll survey) did not become positive until the fall of 2010 (http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm,
viewed August 27, 2012). (It actually ticked up seven months earlier but then declined again slightly.)


                                                        11
(QWI) dummy variables – denoted SA in equation [1] – including their interactions with OLD, LAW, and

OLD × LAW, to approximate the seasonal adjustment made in the figures.

        The DDD parameters, which of are of prime interest, are β10 and β11 ; the corresponding terms in

equation [1] are highlighted in boldface. β10 captures the effect of stronger age discrimination laws on

older versus younger workers during the Great Recession compared to before, while β11 captures the same

type of effect, but for the period after the Great Recession compared to the same pre-recession baseline.

For example, suppose our dependent variable is hiring rate. A positive coefficient on β10 (β11) would

indicate that age discrimination laws boosted the relative hiring of older workers during (after) the Great

Recession, relative to the period prior to the recession (which means 2003 through November 2007 for the

CPS data, and 2004:Q2-2007:Q3 for the QWI data).

        As discussed earlier, we are also interested in β3, which captures the differential effect of stronger

age discrimination laws on older versus younger workers in the baseline period. As outlined in the

Introduction, estimates of this parameter can be helpful in putting a theoretical interpretation on the results.

At the same time, we might be less confident in a causal interpretation of this parameter because it is

identified solely from cross-sectional variation, by age, across states. For example, it is possible that

stronger laws prevailing in the baseline, pre-recession period were adopted in response to longer-term labor

market differences between older and younger workers. In contrast, with age discrimination laws almost

universally fixed over our sample period, the variation that identifies β10 and β11, which is induced by the

Great Recession, is quite clearly exogenous.

        The identification argument regarding the DDD parameters is even more compelling in

specifications that more flexibly saturate the model. In all of our main tables, we also report estimates of

augmented versions of the DDD model that add a much greater level of saturation. First, we add a full set

of interactions between state dummy variables and dummy variables for each unique month (or quarter for

the QWI data) in the sample. And second, we add a full set of interactions between the age categories and

dummy variables for each month (quarter). Together, these interactions subsume the OLD, LAW, GR,

AfterGR, GR × OLD, AfterGR × OLD, GR × LAW, and AfterGR × LAW variables in equation [1]. These



                                                       12
interactions allow an arbitrary (and hence much less constrained) pattern of changes over time by state in

the dependent variables common to both older and younger workers, and allow for arbitrary changes by age

over time, common to all states. They also let the baseline intercept vary by state, rather than allowing only

a difference between states based on whether or not the state has a stronger age discrimination law. .

         With these detailed interactions added, the three variables from equation [1] that remain are the two

triple interactions of most interest – GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR × OLD × LAW. In addition, because

we have not added interactions between the dummy variables for age and state, the OLD × LAW interaction

also remains. We chose to focus on this saturated specification (without the age-by-state interactions) so

that we could still identify the baseline, pre-Great Recession difference between labor market outcomes for

older versus younger workers, because this difference is potentially informative about the effects of state

age discrimination laws in the pre-Great Recession period.12

         In addition to the dummy variable interactions, we added two control variables. The first captures

extensions to the number of weeks of unemployment insurance (UI) available due to automatic increases

from the Extended Benefits program and due to the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program

created in June 2008. These UI increases are linked to decreases in the likelihood of exiting

unemployment, leading to higher unemployment rates (Rothstein, 2011) and longer unemployment

durations (Farber and Valletta, 2013). We use data on the number of extra UI weeks available from Farber

and Valletta (2013). To account for the lagged labor market effects of the extensions, we also include lags

of this variable through two years. This variable (and all its lags) are entered interacted with OLD.

Because we add them to the more-saturated model, the state-by-month (quarter) interactions subsume the

effects of these controls on the reference younger group.

         The second control accounts for the possibility that the economic shocks caused by the Great

Recession had differential impacts on older and younger workers that vary by state. If we look at the

correlations across two-digit NAICS industries between employment growth during or after the Great

Recession, and the ratio of older to younger workers, the correlations for the period of the Great Recession

12
  We also report the sensitivity of the estimated triple-difference parameters to adding the age by state interactions,
and find very similar results.


                                                           13
are –0.17 for men and −0.07 for women. For the period after the Great Recession the corresponding

correlations are 0.07 and 0.04.13 Thus, to a limited extent, industries hit hardest during the Great Recession

tended to employ relatively more older workers, and correspondingly the recovery was a bit stronger for

these industries.

        We want this control to be an exogenous measure of the age composition of employment demand

shocks by state. We therefore construct it using information on national changes in employment coupled

with the baseline age composition of industry employment in each state, as explained in the Appendix A.

Again, this variable (and all its lags) are entered interacted with OLD in the more-saturated model.

        With the interactions and controls added, our specification becomes (retaining the coefficient

subscripts from equation [1]):



                                                                                                           [2]

                                 ×        3+     ×       ×        4+

where Time is a vector of month dummy variables for the CPS data, and quarter dummy variables for the

QWI data.

V. Results

        Based on the arguments outlined above, our analysis focuses mainly on whether stronger state age

discrimination protections led to relatively better or relatively worse outcomes for older workers during and

after the Great Recession. We suggested reasons the effects could go in either direction. Our analysis is

also intended to provide information on whether stronger state age discrimination protections were

associated with relatively better labor market outcomes for older workers in the baseline period prior to the

Great Recession.

        For each outcome, we first provide information on these questions by presenting a series of figures




13
   For these calculations we wanted to measure growth between the same calendar months to avoid seasonality. We
therefore use December 2007 to December 2008 for the Great Recession and June 2009 to June 2011 for after. The
start dates we use (December 2007 and June 2009) match the start and end dates of the GR according to the NBER.


                                                       14
that show the levels and differences over time.14 For each outcome and for each type of law (lower firm-

size minimum and larger damages), and for men and women, we present three figures. The first presents

seasonally-adjusted time-series estimates for each of the four groups defined by age and the age

discrimination laws. For the estimates derived from CPS data, the estimates are weighted by state

population using the provided population weights, so the estimates are representative of the population in

states with or without stronger laws. For the QWI data, the total number of hires are summed for states

with and without stronger laws, and then divided by the sum of employment in these states in 2005. These

estimates are implicitly weighted by state population, since larger states contribute more weight to the

calculation. The second figure shows the difference in the time-series between older and younger workers,

for states with stronger versus weaker laws. And the third figure shows the difference between these. The

latter figure provides a difference-in-difference estimate at each point in time, and comparing this across

time is then informative about how the influence of age discrimination laws on older versus younger

workers varied with the onset of the Great Recession.

           We then turn to the regression estimates of equations [1] and [2], which enable a sharper focus on

the estimated differences between older and younger workers across states before, during, and after the

Great Recession, and permit statistical inference on the differences of interest. In addition, of course, the

regressions allow us to include the other control variables that could have differentially affected older and

younger workers across states, in ways that differ during and after the Great Recession compared to earlier.

Unemployment rates

           The top panels of Figure 4 show that, for both sexes, and irrespective of state age discrimination

laws, unemployment rates – which were initially higher for younger than for older workers – rose

substantially more for younger workers during the Great Recession (indicated by the shaded region), and

remained elevated in relative terms for younger workers in the subsequent years shown. Thus, the Great

Recession did not increase unemployment rates as much for older workers as for younger workers.

           The second row in the figure displays the differences between unemployment rates of younger and


14
     In these figures, the data are seasonally adjusted using X-12-ARIMA.


                                                           15
older workers depending on whether there was a stronger state age discrimination law, to make it easier to

see how the Great Recession affected older versus younger workers in each group of states. As the left-

hand panel shows, the relative increase in the unemployment rate of younger men during the Great

Recession was larger in states with a lower firm-size minimum. (The lines are in negative territory because

unemployment rates rose less for older than for younger workers.) However, the pattern reverses for some

part of the period after the Great Recession (most notably beginning in 2011), with – in relative terms –

larger increases in the unemployment rates of older men in the states with the lower firm-size minimum.

For women the pattern is different, with the main indication being that a lower firm-size minimum was

associated with relative increases in unemployment rates for older workers in the period after the Great

Recession. In the middle graphs, there is little indication that unemployment rates for older workers

relative to younger workers were much different in states with a lower firm-size minimum for its age

discrimination law in the pre-recession period.

        These differences are displayed yet more clearly in the bottom row of the figure, which shows the

difference-in-differences estimates. In these panels a negative (positive) value indicates that a lower firm-

size minimum is associated with smaller (larger) increases in unemployment among older workers relative

to younger workers. For men, therefore, we see that during the Great Recession the line is almost always in

negative territory, although often not by much. Subsequent to the Great Recession, however, the evidence

is less clear. And for women the sharpest result appears to be for the period after the Great Recession,

during which the stronger age discrimination protection is associated with higher relative unemployment of

older workers.

        In Figure 5, we turn to the same kind of evidence, but focusing on the other type of age

discrimination protection – larger damages. Looking at the bottom row, for men there is no evidence that a

state age discrimination law allowing for larger damages resulted in relatively lower unemployment rates

for older workers. Before the Great Recession there is little apparent difference. During the Great

Recession the pattern is not consistent, although for most months the relative unemployment rate of older

workers was higher in states with larger damages. In the period after the Great Recession there is rather



                                                      16
clear evidence that relative unemployment rates for older workers were higher in states with larger damages

under state law – especially the first 18 months or so after the Great Recession ended. For women this

negative conclusion is even stronger. During most of the Great Recession period, and for the entire post-

recession period, unemployment rates were higher for older relative to younger workers in the states with

larger damages. However, the size of the gap is generally smaller than for men.

        Thus, for unemployment rates, there is relatively little indication that stronger state age

discrimination protections protected older workers from increases in unemployment in the periods during

and after the Great Recession. Indeed the most pronounced evidence appears to be in the opposite

direction, for women with regard to lower firm-size minimums, and for both men and women for the

stronger age discrimination protection in the form of larger damages.

        The regression estimates, which are reported in Table 3, confirm these impressions. Columns (1)-

(4) report the results for lower firm-size minimums, and columns (5)-(8) for larger damages. In each case,

the first two columns are for men – showing first the estimates of equation [1], and then the more-saturated

model with controls (equation [2]) – and the next two columns are for women.

        Turning to the estimates for firm-size minimums for men, first consider, as a preliminary, the

evidence regarding some of the main effects. The estimated coefficient for OLD shows that the baseline

(pre-Great Recession) difference in unemployment rates is about a percentage point lower for older men,

consistent with the usual finding that older workers have lower unemployment rates. The estimated

coefficients on GR and AfterGR measure the differences in unemployment rates for the reference group of

younger workers during and then after the Great Recession. The differences, of course, are sharp – about

two percentage points higher during the Great Recession, and five percentage points higher in the

subsequent period. The following two rows, for GR × OLD and AfterGR × OLD, show the differential

effects of the Great Recession on unemployment rates of older workers. Consistent with what we saw in

Figures 4 and 5, these estimates are negative, indicating that unemployment rates rose by less for older

workers – by about one percentage point.

        The main estimates of interest are are highlighted in the top three rows. First, the estimated



                                                      17
coefficient of OLD × LAW is the baseline difference in the relative unemployment rate of older versus

younger workers in states with stronger age discrimination protection in the form of lower firm-size

minimum. The estimated coefficient is negative, consistent with a lower firm-size minimum lowering

unemployment of older workers in the pre-recession period; but the estimate (– 0.14) is small and

statistically insignificant.

         Finally, the DDD parameters are the coefficients of GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR × OLD ×

LAW. These estimates capture the differential effects of the Great Recession on unemployment rates of

older versus younger workers, across states with and without a lower firm-size minimum. These estimates

can be interpreted as estimating the change in the graphs in the bottom panels of Figure 4 from before the

Great Recession to two subsequent periods – the Great Recession itself, and the period following the Great

Recession. As column (1) shows, in this case both estimates are small and statistically insignificant,

paralleling the ambiguous evidence for men in Figure 4.

         In column (2) we enrich the specification by adding the state-by-month and age-by-month

interactions, and the control variables for UI benefits and the age composition of demand. As explained

earlier, with the rich interactions added, only the coefficients of most interest – on OLD × LAW, GR ×

OLD × LAW, and AfterGR × OLD × LAW – are identified. As column (2) shows, the estimates are

essentially unchanged.

         Note that the UI extensions were not associated with differential effects on unemployment rates of

older workers, as the estimated coefficient (0.01) is very small and insignificant.15 The estimated

coefficient of the age composition control interacted with OLD is negative but not significant; the negative

sign is as expected since this control indicates that national trends in industry employment were favorable

to older workers in the state, so their unemployment rate rose by less. The estimated sum of the

coefficients is very large, but recall that these coefficients reflect a one percentage point differential

15
  If we simply add the controls to the specification in column (1) we can also identify the effect of the UI benefit
extensions on the reference younger group, and overall. In this case the sum of the main effects, which reflects the
effect of an extra week of benefits that lasts for two years, was 0.11 and statistically significant. To put the estimate in
perspective, it implies that a 9.1 week extension that lasted for two years would add one percentage point to the
unemployment rate. We do not necessarily attribute a causal interpretation to this because the extensions are triggered
by unemployment rates.


                                                            18
between the “predicted” growth rate of employment for older versus younger workers that persists for two

years. When we look at the individual regression coefficients, we find much smaller effects for any one

period, and the effects dissipate within two years.16

           Column (3) and (4) turn to women. As shown in column (3), the baseline unemployment rate

difference between older and younger women – the coefficient on OLD – is larger than for men (1.62

percentage points, versus 1.03 for men). The estimated coefficients for GR and AfterGR show that the

Great Recession had a smaller impact on unemployment rates of younger women than of men.17 Turning to

the DDD estimates, the point estimates for the post-recession period (AfterGR) are larger for women than

for men, consistent with Figure 4. But the estimate is insignificant.

           Overall, the estimates in columns (1)-(4) of Table 3 do not provide evidence that a stronger age

discrimination law in the form of a lower firm-size minimum for applicability of state laws had a

statistically significant impact on the influence of the Great Recession on the relative unemployment rates

of older men or women. Certainly there is no statistical evidence that this protection led to smaller

increases in unemployment; and indeed for women the point estimates for the period after the Great

Recession suggest if anything the opposite.

           Columns (5)-(8) turn to the same specifications, but looking at stronger age discrimination

protections in the form of larger damages, for which Figure 5 gave a stronger indication that this age

discrimination protection worsened the effects of the Great Recession. Having gone through columns (1)-

(4) in detail, we can summarize the results in columns (5)-(8) – and the tables that follow– much more

quickly.

           First, as reflected in the estimated coefficients of OLD × LAW, for the period prior to the Great

16
   This is generally true for all of the models we estimate below, so we do not revisit this point, nor discuss the
estimated coefficients of these control variable more.
17
   The difference in the early period, reflected in the estimated coefficient of GR, has been noted in the popular press,
which at the height of the Great Recession coined the label “mancession”
(http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/the-mancession/?_r=0, viewed October 18, 2013). This was
attributed to the overrepresentation of men in cyclically-sensitive industries like construction and manufacturing that
were hit hardest initially. However, when government employment fell later on as states faced budget crunches,
women experienced larger job losses (http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Women-hit-harder-by-government-job-
cuts-4322420.php, viewed October 18, 2013). (These overall trends are more likely to be reflected in the
unemployment rates for younger men and women, because their employment rates are so much higher.) Moreover, as
documented by Hoynes et al. (2012), the recovery has been stronger for men (which they term a “he-covery.”)


                                                           19
Recession there is no evidence of differential unemployment rates for older workers in states with larger

damages. For the post-Great Recession period, which is the period when unemployment rates peaked, the

DDD estimates of AfterGR × OLD × LAW for men are positive, very close in magnitude – around one –

and statistically significant at the one-percent level. For women the estimates are about 0.5 but not

statistically significant. For both men and women the estimated coefficients of GR × OLD × LAW, which

capture the differential effects in states with stronger damages during the Great Recession, are positive

(around 0.55 for men, and 0.37 for women), but not statistically significant. The positive estimates in all

cases imply that where state age discrimination laws provided for larger damages, unemployment rates for

older workers rose more in relative terms after the Great Recession; but the results are statistically

significant only for men in the period after the Great Recession, for whom there was a relative increase in

the unemployment rate of about one percentage point.

        In contrast, the estimated coefficient of OLD × LAW is negative for men, consistent with larger

damages lowering unemployment of older workers prior to the Great Recession (by about 0.25 percentage

point), although recall our earlier caveat that identification of this parameter is less compelling. However,

the estimated differential for men prior to the Great Recession is not statistically significant, and the sign is

reversed for women. Nonetheless, the results for men are indicative of a particular pattern of results that

occurs in many of our analyses reported below – with stronger age discrimination protections associated

with better labor market outcomes for older workers prior to the Great Recession, but a relative worsening

of outcomes during and after the Great Recession.

Employment-to-population ratios

        We next turn to similar analyses for employment-to-population ratios. The formats of the figures

for the graphical analysis and the tables for the regression analysis are the same, so we just highlight the

main results.

        As shown in the middle panels of Figure 6, prior to the Great Recession the relative employment-

to-population ratios of older versus younger workers were higher in states with a lower firm-size minimum,

consistent with a lower firm-size minimum improving labor market outcomes for older workers; for



                                                       20
women, however, this is less pronounced. The bottom figure for men does not show much of a change in

relative employment-to-population ratios during or after the Great Recession, whereas for women the

relative advantage of older workers eroded during these periods.

        Looking at larger damages, in Figure 7, the results are similar for women. Older women show

persistently higher employment-to-population ratios in states with larger damages, although this does

diminish during the Great Recession. For men, there is no clear difference before the recession, and if

anything a worsening in the relative employment-to-population ratios of older men in the period

immediately subsequent to the Great Recession.

        The regression estimates in Table 4 do not provide much statistically significant evidence of

differences in the effects of the Great Recession on employment-to-population ratios associated with

stronger age discrimination protections (the estimated coefficients of GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR ×

OLD × LAW). The one exception is in column (4), where the estimate implies that where firm-size

minimums are smaller, women’s employment-to-population ratio fell by relatively more (a sizable 1.98

percentage points) in the period after the Great Recession. In addition, the point estimates for the

corresponding specification for women for larger damages (column (8)), for both during and after the Great

Recession, are sizable and in the same negative direction, suggesting employment-to-population ratio lower

by 1.22 percentage points during the Great Recession, and 0.73 percentage points afterward. In contrast,

the estimated coefficients of OLD × LAW are almost always positive, although also not statistically

significant. Nonetheless, like some of the preceding results for men for unemployment rates, the estimates

are in the direction of age discrimination protections improving outcomes for older workers in the prior

baseline period but leading to worse labor market outcomes during or after the Great Recession.

Unemployment durations

        Figure 8 does not provide clear evidence one way or the other that lower firm-size minimums for

state age discrimination laws were associated with differential changes in median unemployment durations.

Looking at the bottom panels, for men there is no change apparent during the Great Recession, and in the

period after the Great Recession the direction of the difference varies. For women, there is more of an



                                                      21
indication that during the Great Recession a lower firm-size minimum was associated with smaller relative

increase in median durations for women, but the period after the Great Recession the figure shows perhaps

some increase in durations.

        In Figure 9, the pre-Great Recession period exhibits significantly shorter durations for older men in

states with larger damages; echoing earlier results, this is consistent with stronger laws helping these older

workers in the pre-recession period. For women, however, there is no evidence of such an effect in this

period. Turning to the period of the Great Recession and afterward, for men the shorter durations of older

workers evaporate, whereas for older women things seem to move in the opposite direction, with the data

pointing to a decrease in durations during the Great Recession.

        Table 5 presents the corresponding regression evidence for median unemployment durations. In

columns (1)-(4), there is no statistically significant evidence that a lower firm-size minimum was associated

with differential changes in unemployment durations of older men or older women; the estimated

coefficients of GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR × OLD × LAW are never statistically significant. As in the

figures, the sign pattern is not consistent, with a lower firm-size minimum associated with longer spells for

older men relative to younger men during the Great Recession, and shorter spells afterwards, whereas for

women the signs are reversed.

        For larger damages, as reported in columns (5)-(8), the evidence is stronger (and more consistent

for each gender, although different between men and women). For men, the estimates suggest that larger

damages resulted in longer durations of unemployment for older men relative to younger men by about five

to 5.5 weeks both during the Great Recession and after the Great Recession. The estimates are generally

statistically significant at the one-, five-, or 10-percent level depending on the specification and period. For

women the signs are reversed, indicating that larger damages were associated with smaller increases in

unemployment durations – by about three to four weeks – during and after the Great Recession; only the

estimated coefficient for GR × OLD × LAW in the less-saturated model is statistically significant. Note

also that larger damages under state law were associated with shorter unemployment durations for men in

the period prior to the Great Recession (OLD × LAW); the estimates are sizable (about 4.5 weeks) and



                                                      22
statistically significant.

Hiring

         Turning to hiring in the QWI data, the top panels of Figure 10 show the dramatic drop in hiring

rates for all groups, in both sets of states, during the Great Recession, and how these hiring rates have

remained low. The middle panels show that the hiring rates for older men and women have been

consistently higher in states with a lower firm-size minimum, consistent with this type of age

discrimination boosting hiring of older workers. However, the middle and bottom panels do not reveal

much evidence of a change in the relative hiring rate of older workers during or after the Great Recession.

For larger damages – shown in Figure 11 – there is a more-pronounced change for women, with the hiring

rate for older women relative to younger women dropping during the Great Recession and afterwards, and

remaining low.

         Similarly, in the regression estimates in Table 6 only for women and larger damages (column (8))

is there statistically significant evidence that stronger state age discrimination protections are associated

with differential changes in hiring rates. Paralleling Figure 11, the evidence indicates that larger damages

under state law were associated with relative declines in the hiring of older women in the period after the

Great Recession, with the significant estimate in column (8) indicating that the hiring rate declined by 1.07

percentage points in relative terms. Note also that in both tables, and for men as well as women, the OLD ×

LAW coefficient estimates are positive and (almost always) significant, indicating that stronger age

discrimination protections were associated with higher hiring rates of older relative to younger workers in

the period prior to the Great Recession, by between 1.6 and 2.3 percentage points for men, and between 1.1

and 1.5 percentage points for women.18



18
  As noted earlier, the QWI data on separations are harder to interpret, because they reflect both voluntary and
involuntary separations. We report estimates of the same models for separations in Appendix Table B1. We find that
the estimated coefficients of OLD × LAW are always positive and almost always significant, ranging from about a 1.1
to 2.4 percentage point higher separation rate. If this reflects greater ease of getting hired for older workers, as
suggested by the estimates in Table 6, then these positive estimates likely reflect a higher level of voluntary
separations among older workers where age discrimination laws are stronger, presumably because it is easier for them
to find new jobs. The differential effects of stronger age discrimination protections during and after the Great
Recession are generally small and insignificant. The one exception is in column (8), where we find that the separation
rate for older women in the period after the Great Recession rose by significantly less in states with larger damages


                                                         23
Statistical power

         We have found some evidence that state age discrimination laws were associated with statistically

significant, differential effects of the Great Recession on older workers. This tells us that some of the

changes that actually occurred were large enough relative to the precision of our estimates to be detected.

But it is fair to ask, with respect to the many cases where we do not find statistically significant evidence,

whether this is likely because the effects if they occurred were small, or because our empirical analysis

does not detect as significant estimates that are substantively large.

         We do not have any other evidence of expected effects with which to compare our estimated

standard errors. We do have some much earlier evidence (from the 1960s) on the effects of age

discrimination laws on employment rates of older men, which point to increases of about four percentage

points for men aged 60 or 65 and older (Adams, 2004). So it might be reasonable to suppose that, as an

upper bound, a stronger age discrimination law could boost employment by four percentage points. There

is no evidence on which to ask how the extent of discrimination might vary over the business cycle.

However, if we think of this question in the sense of a recession changing the effectiveness of age

discrimination laws, then presumably this effect has to be smaller than four percentage points. And we

have to recognize that this four percentage point figure does not come from the types of variation in age

discrimination laws we study in the current period, but rather comes from the advent of these laws. Hence,

we should probably start with a maximum effect below four percentage points. Suppose we cut it in half,

to two percentage points. Then the question becomes whether we can detect as significant changes of two

percentage points (or less). For employment rates, the standard errors on our DDD estimates in the more-

saturated models in Table 4 range from about 1.0 to 1.6 for men, and 0.7 to 1.0 for women. So on this

score the answer is that we might be able to detect reasonably-sized effects of the business cycle on age

discrimination for older women, although perhaps less so for older men. Nonetheless, the point estimates

for older men are small, so that the issue is not large standard errors.




(by 1.06 percentage points). This estimate is almost exactly the same as the corresponding estimate for hires, and so
might be interpreted as also reflecting changes in voluntary quits – lower, in this case, because hiring is also lower.


                                                           24
        There is no existing research on which to draw for thinking about such calculations in the context

of the other outcomes we study. Nonetheless, we can still think about the standard errors for these

estimates for other outcomes and whether they would allow us to detect as statistically significant what

seem to be meaningful differences. For unemployment rates, the DDD standard errors for the more-

saturated models are around 0.4-0.8, meaning that we can detect as significant differences of about 0.8-1.6

or higher. For unemployment durations, the standard errors hover around 2.5. Our sense is that given the

dramatic movements in unemployment rates and durations during and after the Great Recession, this

implies that we could detect as significant relative changes across states that are meaningful, and

conversely that the magnitudes of changes that would not be detected as significant (like changes of two

weeks duration) would not be very substantive anyway. The same goes for hiring rates, which are in the

10-25% range pre-Great Recession but drop by as much as 10 percentage points. The standard errors for

hiring rates in the more-saturated models are about 0.4 to 0.8, suggesting that we would detect meaningful

differences in changes in hiring rates.

Robustness analyses

        We next explore the robustness of the key results to variations in the specification, sample, or

estimation. We report these for the five cases where we found significant differences in the relative effect

of the Great Recession on older workers between states with stronger age discrimination protections and

states without them. These five cases are: the effects of larger damages on unemployment rates of men; the

effects of lower firm-size minimums on employment-to-population ratios of women; the effects of larger

damages on unemployment durations of both men and women; and the effects of larger damages on hiring

rates of women.19

        The results of many of these analyses are reported in Table 7. In each case, the change indicated in

the panel heading is relative to the baseline specification from the even-numbered columns of Tables 3-6,

for which the estimates are repeated in panel (a). First, in panel (b) we report estimates of the specification


19
  We also estimated all of these robustness analyses for the other specifications for which we did not find any
significant estimates of the DDD interactions GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR × OLD × LAW, and verified that in no
case did these additional analyses discussed below lead to significant estimates.


                                                      25
that adds state-by-age interactions, allowing more flexibly for differences in the age profile for each

outcome by state. In this case, we saturate the model as fully as we can with regard to all the two-way

interactions in equation [1]. The coefficient of OLD × LAW is no longer identified, but the two key triple

interactions are. Comparing panels (a) and (b), the point estimates are qualitatively similar, although two

of the estimates become smaller and statistically insignificant – for the effect of lower firm-size minimums

on the employment-to-population ratio of women in the period after the Great Recession, and for the effect

of larger damages on the hiring rate of women in the same period. The estimated effects on unemployment

rates and durations remain very similar, however.

        Second, we noted earlier that in a small number of cases there were no unemployed workers in the

cell so we set median duration to zero. However, this may not accurately reflect median durations in the

population in the state and month. Hence, in panel (c) we instead drop these cells from the analysis, and re-

estimate the models for unemployment duration. The estimates are scarcely affected, and indeed the

estimate for men for the period after the Great Recession becomes more strongly significant.

        In panel (d) we drop the weighting by state population. The signs of the estimates are unaffected,

but there are some changes in the magnitudes and most of the estimated effects during and after the Great

Recession become insignificant; in quite a few cases standard errors are larger. However, as argued earlier

the weighted estimates are more representative of what happened to workers during and after the Great

Recession.

        Finally, in panels (e)-(g) we use different age groups to define older and younger. In the first

panel, we restrict the older group to 55-64 rather than 55+, and in the last two panels we reports results for

the alternative definitions of the older group, but a more narrowly-restricted younger group (25-34 instead

of 25-44). We view the results as qualitatively very similar. And more generally, across all of the

robustness analyses we have explored this is true, although as Table 7 shows some analyses – especially

not weighting – lead to far fewer significant results.

        We did two other analyses for which results are available from the authors upon request. First, the

results are robust to using different lag lengths for the UI benefit and age composition controls (through one



                                                         26
year or three years) as well as dropping these controls. Second, using a smaller firm-size minimum (fewer

than six instead of fewer than 10 workers), we found qualitatively similar results, although the significant

effect for the employment-to-population ratio for women becomes insignificant. This confirms the findings

throughout the paper that the results for larger damages are stronger and more robust than the results for

firm-size minimums.

        Finally, in addition to the specifications discussed thus far, we estimated specifications where we

substituted for GR and AfterGR a continuous measure that captures the severity of the Great Recession

within each state. This effectively means that we interact GR and AfterGR with a variable with only cross-

state variation, allowing for differential impacts of the Great Recession across states, in both the

recessionary period itself and afterwards. The approach and results are described in an appendix available

from the authors. The results were very similar, in part because using an exogenous measure of the

severity of the Great Recession across states – generated from national industry employment trends coupled

with the workforce composition of each state by industry, age, and sex, related to our age composition

control – does not generate much variation in the strength of the Great Recession across states. Using a

measure like changes in unemployment rates would exhibit more cross-state variation, but would

potentially be endogenous with respect to the effects of state age discrimination laws, if these laws affect

the evolution of unemployment for a given economic shock.

Falsification test

        Finally, Table 8 reports results for a falsification test. The principal concern is that underlying

trends could drive the results. Even though our estimated model is quite saturated, we of course cannot

control for arbitrary changes in age profiles over time that vary by state (age-by-state-by-time interactions).

So it is possible that changes in age profiles of our outcomes over time that are correlated with differences

in state age discrimination laws could spuriously generate our results.

        We test for this alternative explanation of our results by choosing a recent, sustained period without

a recession and asking if changes over this period generate similar findings. We consider the same five

outcomes and state age discrimination protections as in Table 7, using the period 2002-2007, and treating



                                                      27
2005-2007 as the “recession.” This was actually a period of continuous expansion, so if we were to find

similar estimates to what we actually find comparing the Great Recession period to the prior period, we

would conclude that the results were instead driven by trends in labor market outcomes by age that happen

to coincide with which states have stronger age discrimination protections. Note that in this case there is

only one “recession” period, post-2004, and hence only one triple interaction, which we denote Post-2004

× OLD × LAW. Also, we can only do this for the CPS data because the QWI data for many states do not

go back far enough.

        As the estimates in panel (b) show, there is no evidence of changes over time in labor market

outcomes of older relative to younger workers associated with stronger age discrimination protections that

mimics what we find comparing the Great Recession period to the earlier baseline period. We do find a

positive and significant effect coefficient on Post-2004 × OLD × LAW for the employment-to-population

ratio for women, for lower firm-size minimums. But note that this is the opposite sign from the original

results, and hence does not point to a trend toward lower employment of women in states with this stronger

age discrimination protection. The one estimate that parallels the original results is the estimated

coefficient of OLD × LAW in column (3). However, this captures the same shorter durations of

unemployment for older men in non-recessionary periods that we found before, rather than changes over

time. Thus, the estimates in Table 8 rule out spurious trends driving the results.

Summary of results

        Table 9 summarizes the results across both the main results in Tables 3-6, and the other robustness

analyses we have reported. We report results for the two key triple-difference coefficients, of GR × OLD ×

LAW and AfterGR × OLD × LAW, which measure the change in labor market outcomes for older versus

younger workers, during or after the Great Recession relative to the prior period, in states with stronger age

discrimination protections versus other states. We also report on the estimates for OLD × LAW, which

captures the difference in outcomes, associated with stronger protections, for older versus younger workers

prior to the Great Recession. To provide a summary of the evidence across all of the analyses we have

discussed, the table reports the mean and range of estimates, as well as the number that are (1) significant



                                                      28
(at the 10-percent level) and positive, (2) significant and negative, and (3) insignificant.

        Looking first at the triple-difference results, in the second and third rows, for men, we simply find

no evidence that stronger age discrimination protections helped older workers weather the Great Recession,

relative to younger workers. When there is evidence that stronger state age discrimination protections

mediated the effects of the Great Recession, they appear to have made things relatively worse for older

workers. This is the case for unemployment rates and unemployment durations, for larger damages under

state law. These estimates suggest that state age discrimination laws allowing for larger damages were

associated with higher unemployment durations of men by on average about 5.5 weeks, and unemployment

rates that were higher by about one percentage point (in the post-Great Recession period). These estimates

indicating that age discrimination protections led to a worsening of unemployment-related outcomes for

older workers, relative to younger workers, are shaded in the table.

        For women, the evidence is more mixed. On the one hand, there is some evidence that stronger age

discrimination protections in the form of larger damages were associated with relatively smaller increases

in the unemployment durations of older women during the Great Recession – by about 4.7 weeks; the one

cell in the table reflecting this positive effect is indicated by a box. On the other hand, we also find that in

the period after the Great Recession, in states with lower firm-size minimums for age discrimination laws

older women had larger declines in their employment-to-population ratio (by about 1.5 percentage points),

and in states with larger damages they had bigger declines in their hiring rate (by about 0.3 percentage

point during the Great Recession, and 0.7 percentage point afterwards); these estimates indicating adverse

effects of stronger age discrimination protections on older women are also shaded.

        Thus, between the results for men and women, there is very little evidence that stronger state age

discrimination protections helped older workers weather the Great Recession. Moreover, there is quite a bit

of evidence that the opposite occurred, with older workers bearing more of the brunt of the Great Recession

in states with stronger age discrimination protections.

        Finally, turning to the OLD × LAW estimates, there is some evidence that stronger age

discrimination protections helped older men and women in the period prior to the Great Recession. The



                                                       29
evidence consistent with stronger protections helping older workers in the period prior to the Great

Recession is statistically significant for unemployment durations and larger damages for men – indicating

unemployment durations shorter by about 4.4 weeks – and for hiring rates for women – with hiring rates

higher by about 1.0 percentage points. (Indeed Table 6 reports a higher hiring rate for older men and

women in the pre-recession period in nearly all specifications.)

        Putting the evidence together, in some cases we find that stronger age discrimination protections

helped older workers in the pre-Great Recession period, but led to a relative worsening of outcomes for

older workers during and after the Great Recession. The estimates where we find at least some statistically

significant evidence of this pattern – i.e., significant beneficial effects pre-Great Recession, and adverse

effects during or after the Great Recession – are boldfaced in Table 9. This evidence arises for

unemployment durations for men, and for hiring rates for women – in both cases for larger damages. And

the point estimates are rather sizable and consistent with this pattern for unemployment durations and larger

damages for women as well.20 Moreover, the pre- and post-Great Recession magnitudes are often similar

but opposite signed, suggesting that the advantages these protections offered prior to the Great Recession

may have been largely eroded during and after the recession.

VI. Conclusions and Discussion

        We generally do not find evidence that stronger state age discrimination protections helped older

workers weather the Great Recession, and for some outcomes older workers appear to have experienced

relatively worse outcomes from the Great Recession in states with stronger age discrimination protections.

The effects are often sizable; for example, state age discrimination laws allowing larger damages were

associated with longer unemployment durations of older men by about 5.5 weeks during and after the Great

Recession. In contrast, there is some evidence that – for these same outcomes, in particular unemployment


20
  There is an issue largely confined to the legal literature about the ADEA not helping older women so much because
of the inability of women to file “intersectional” discrimination claims based on age and sex, since age and sex are
covered in separate statutes (the ADEA and Title VII). Song (2013) discusses this work and presents some evidence
that the initial enactment of the ADEA and earlier state age discrimination laws did not do as much to help older
women. However, there is not related information on these kinds of differential effects in the contemporaneous
period. And unless age discrimination is worse for women than for men, the inability to file intersecting claims does
not disadvantage women. As the results indicate, we do not find much evidence of weaker effects of age
discrimination laws for women.


                                                         30
durations and hiring rates – stronger age discrimination protections helped older men and women in the

period prior to the Great Recession. The combined estimates often suggest that the advantages these

protections offered prior to the Great Recession were largely eroded during and after the recession. In

general, this evidence emerges much more strongly for larger damages than for smaller firm-size

minimums. This is perhaps not surprising given that larger damages apply to all workers potentially

affected by an age discrimination claim, and directly affect the financial incentives to pursue a claim,

whereas firm-size minimums apply to a subset of workers and firms.

        This evidence is consistent with some of the theoretical conjectures we outlined in the introduction.

In particular, the evidence that older workers fare better in normal times in states with stronger age

discrimination protections is consistent with the idea that these protections help combat discrimination, and

in general help older workers, and consistent with past work finding that the initial adoption of state and

then federal age discrimination laws laws increased employment of older men (Neumark and Stock, 1999;

Adams, 2004).

        The evidence on unemployment durations and on hiring in particular is inconsistent with some

claims in the literature that age discrimination laws generally worsen outcomes for older workers by

deterring hiring, perhaps most plausibly because these laws increase termination costs. In particular, Lahey

(2008a) studies the period pre- and post-1977. Looking first at the period prior to 1978, before the

Department of Labor gave administrative responsibility for ADEA enforcement to the EEOC, Lahey finds

little evidence that state laws affected older workers. In the subsequent period, however, her evidence

suggests that state age discrimination laws reduced employment of white men older than 50 years of age

(measured as weeks worked), and made such individuals more likely to be retired. She also finds lower

hiring rates for older workers where there are state laws. She suggests that because the ADEA makes it

difficult to terminate the employment of older workers, it ends up deterring their hiring in the first place.

This may be exacerbated by the difficulty of bringing suit over age discrimination in hiring, as discussed in

the Introduction.




                                                       31
        Lahey’s post-1978 results are identified from cross-state variation in laws, and outcomes for older

versus younger workers. In that sense, these results are similar to our results for the pre-Great Recession

period, and therefore point in the opposite direction. However, there are some important differences and

other explanations.

        First, Lahey studies the existence of state laws, rather than focusing on the features of these laws

that we study. What the existence of a state law per se does is lengthen the statute of limitations for filing a

claim. However, Neumark and Song (forthcoming) found, in a different type of study of the effects of state

age discrimination laws on older workers, that variation in the length of statutes of limitations has no effect.

Second, we have found, as explained above, that during recessions age discrimination laws may have more

adverse effects on older workers. Lahey’s post-1977 period extends to 1991, and hence includes two

recessions in the early 1980s – during the second of which unemployment rates went higher than in the

Great Recession – and another in the early 1990s. Thus, the results may not in fact be so contradictory,

even putting aside the issue that the studies do not look at the same features of age discrimination laws.

        Moreover, Lahey potentially ignores evidence that may point to a different conclusion (see

Neumark, 2008, for a full discussion). If we accept Lahey’s characterization of the federal law as

becoming effective (to a large extent) in 1978, then there is an important source of identifying information

that she ignores – namely, the extension of the federal law to states without anti-discrimination laws in

1978. Her evidence shows that between the pre-1978 and the 1978-1991 period, hours of workers over 50

years of age fell in states with their own age discrimination laws, relative to the states without their own

laws; there was no such change for those aged 50 and under. This implicit difference-in-difference-in-

differences estimator suggests that when the federal law became more effective, employment of those older

than age 50 increased precisely in the states that did not previously have state age discrimination laws.

This would seem to imply that age discrimination laws – at least the federal law – boosted employment of

protected workers, contrary to Lahey’s conclusions.

        In other words, Lahey is identifying the effects of age discrimination laws from cross-state

variation only – the post-1978 differences between states with and without their own laws. But if the more



                                                      32
important source of variation in the strength of age discrimination laws is the strengthening of the federal

legislation post-1978, and the “catching up” of the strength of age discrimination laws in states that did not

previously have their own laws to those that did, then the evidence points in the opposite direction. Thus,

our view is that while there have been conjectures that age discrimination laws can be harmful to older

workers, and in particular reduce hiring, there is little compelling evidence to support this conjecture, and

some evidence to the contrary. That said, this is still an unsettled question that deserves more research.

        Moreover, our findings suggest that the effectiveness of age discrimination laws, and in particular

their effects on hiring of older workers (which we presume can be reflecting in hiring rates or

unemployment durations), vary over the business cycle. We discussed why the effectiveness of age

discrimination laws could decline during severe downturns like that experienced during the Great

Recession – and why stronger age discrimination protections could increase discrimination against older

workers relatively more during such downturns. We suggested this could occur because in states with

stronger laws, there is more pent-up demand to shed older workers, and this can be done during recessions

when age discrimination protections are less effective. Alternatively, stronger protections against

discrimination could increase termination costs, and these could weigh more heavily on hiring decisions

during and after a severe recession when product and hence labor demand is uncertain. Naturally it would

be useful to try to distinguish among these alternative explanations; but that awaits further research.

        These conjectures about the decreased effectiveness of age discrimination protections in the

aftermath of a severe recession have potentially different implications for longer-run consequences. If

indeed all that happens is that there are temporary increases in age discrimination, then we might anticipate

that as the economy recovers the stronger state age discrimination protections – in the states that have them

– would again become more effective at improving labor market outcomes for older workers.21 On the

other hand, the longer-term effects of even temporary changes in behavior could turn out to be adverse. If


21
  A reviewer pointed out one possible exception. Specifically, the “pent-up” demand for discrimination could be
driven by moral hazard among older workers protected by stronger age discrimination laws, leading them to become
less productive. If such behavior led to, for example, lower human capital investment or deterioration of work habits
that would deter their hiring even when age discrimination protections are strong, then older workers terminated
during or after the Great Recession could face persistently worse employment prospects going forward.


                                                          33
it did indeed become easier to discriminate against older workers during the Great Recession and its

aftermath, or employers were more likely to engage in such discrimination, then the extended periods of

unemployment, especially among workers near retirement ages, might have hastened transitions out of the

labor market and toward retirement, permanently lowering employment among older workers. In that

sense, the longer-run implications can be more severe than for temporary increases in discrimination after

recessions against other, generally younger groups, for whom permanent labor force exit is much less

likely. If in fact increases in age discrimination during and after sharp economic downturns do spur labor

force exit, then given the imperative to extend work lives of older individuals, it may be useful to think

about whether it is possible to modify age discrimination protections so that they maintain their

effectiveness in times of economic turbulence. It is not obvious what kinds of changes might meet this

objective, since inferring discriminatory patterns in terminations or other dimensions of employer behavior

will inevitably be difficult when labor markets are more volatile. But making it more difficult to

discriminate in hiring, in general, could help.

        Let subscripts s index states, a age group, g gender, and k industries. Denote by SEasgk03 total

employment for age group a, in state s, for gender g and industry k, in the baseline year of 2003. Denote by

AEkt national (aggregate) employment in each period t in industry k, and denote by AEk03 national

employment in industry k in 2003. Then we can predict the variation in employment by age and state (and

gender) based solely on national employment changes subsequent to the base year of 2003, by applying the

national changes to the baseline composition, as in


                                                                                                           [A.1]


        We use non-seasonally adjusted monthly employment at the national level, by two-digit NAICS

code, to measure AEkt and AEk03, both of which come from the Quarterly Census of Employment and

Wages (QCEW). We use the QWI to measure SEagsk03, since the QWI allows for employment estimates by

age and state (and gender).22 For each k, the ratio in equation [A.1] captures the growth in industry k over

time. This is multiplied by the mean employment of age group a and gender g in state s and industry k in

2003.23 This weights the national industry employment growth by the age and gender composition of

employment in that industry in the baseline year. Our resulting age composition control is the difference in

predicted employment growth rates between the two age groups, or:



                                                                                                           [A.2]



        CCgst captures the difference in predicted growth rates, which can be interpreted as demand

influences, between older and younger employment within the state (for each sex separately). If both

groups are hit with the same predicted shock, then CCgst equals zero. In contrast, for example, CCgst will be

positive if the shock that hit the state in period t was more favorable to employment of older workers. This

discrimination laws, since it is based on national employment growth with fixed weighting during the base

The shaded areas indicate official dates according to the NBER. Each series was generated using the
Current Population Survey “Basic Monthly” micro-data. State estimates were calculated and weighted by
state population to generate nationally representative estimates. Each series was seasonally adjusted and
smoothed using X-12-ARIMA.

                                             Laws




See Neumark and Song (forthcoming) for additional details on age discrimination laws by state.
    Figure 4: Unemployment Rates by Age and Firm-Size Minimum, Men (Left) and Women (Right)




See the notes to Figure 1 above. States are divided into two groups based on the minimum firm size
required for age discrimination laws to apply. See Figure 3 for additional details on age discrimination
laws by state. Each series in the top figure is generated using the Current Population Survey “Basic
Monthly” micro-data, using the provided population weights, and seasonally adjusted and smoothed using
X-12-ARIMA.

See notes to Figure 4. The only difference is that larger damages than the federal law are used instead of
firm-size minimum.

See the notes to Figure 4. States are divided into two groups based on the minimum firm size required for
age discrimination laws to apply. Each series in the top figure is generated by summing QWI estimates of
the number of hires per quarter, by age group, in states of each law group, and dividing the entire series
by the average employment across all those states in 2005. For most of the hiring series, X-12-ARIMA
smooths using the two nearest quarters, resulting in 2004:Q2 being missing. However, when the data are
smoother it can use fewer quarters to smooth, so in some cases data for 2004:Q2 are available.
          Figure 11: Hiring Rates by Age and Size of Damages, Men (Left) and Women (Right)




See notes to Figure 4. The only difference is that larger damages than under the federal law are used
instead of smaller firm-size minimum.

Standard errors, clustered at the state level, are in parentheses. *, **, and *** mean statistically significant from zero at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The sample period is 2003-2011. There are 11,016 observations. All estimates are weighted
by state population. The unemployment rate and other proportion variables in following tables are on a scale of zero to 100. For
both the unemployment insurance and compositional controls, both the contemporaneous variable and 24 months of lags are
included in the even-numbered columns. In these columns, the addition of state-by-month fixed effects removes GR, AfterGR,
LAW, GR × LAW, and AfterGR × LAW, and age-by-month fixed effects remove OLD, GR × OLD, and AfterGR × OLD. In the
regressions, rather than using seasonally-adjusted data, the models include calendar-month dummy variables. To allow for
different seasonality by age group and type of state (defined by age discrimination law) – to better match the separate seasonal
adjustment we do in the figures – these are also entered interacted with LAW, OLD, and LAW × OLD. (Prior to forming these
interactions, the calendar-month dummy variables are demeaned, so that the estimated coefficients of LAW, OLD, and LAW ×
OLD reflect differentials evaluated at the sample means.)

Standard errors, clustered at the state level, are in parentheses. *, **, and *** mean statistically significant from zero at the 10%, 5%,
and 1% levels, respectively. The sample period is 2004:Q2-2011:Q4. There are 3,038 observations. All estimates are weighted by
state population. The hiring variable is constructed by dividing the number of hires in the quarter by the average employment in
2005 for that state and multiplying by 100. For both the unemployment insurance and compositional controls, both the
contemporaneous variable and lags through eight quarters are included in the even-numbered columns. In these columns, the
addition of state-by-quarter fixed effects removes GR, AfterGR, LAW, GR × LAW, and AfterGR × LAW, and age-by-quarter fixed
effects remove OLD, GR × OLD, and AfterGR × OLD. In the regressions, rather than using seasonally-adjusted data, all
regression models include calendar-quarter dummy variables. To allow for different seasonality by age group and type of state
(defined by age discrimination law) – to better match the separate seasonal adjustment we do in the figures – these are also entered
interacted with LAW, OLD, and LAW × OLD. (Prior to forming these interactions, the calendar-quarter dummy variables are
demeaned, so that the estimated coefficients of LAW, OLD, and LAW × OLD reflect differentials evaluated at the sample means.)

Estimates are based on the specification used in the even-numbered columns in Table 3-6. We include only the outcome variables and
the law characteristics combinations that led to statistically significant results in Tables 3-6. No GR × OLD × LAW and AfterGR × OLD
× LAW coefficients for other outcomes coupled with state age discrimination protections that are not shown in this table here were
statistically significant. In panel (b) the state-by-age interactions subsume OLD × LAW.

See notes to Table 7. Estimates are based on the specification used in the even-numbered columns in Table 3-6. In panel (b), we define
2002-2004 as the “pre-recession” period and 2005-2007 as the “recession” period. Since many states are missing from the QWI before
2004, we cannot conduct this falsification test for hires.

This table summarizes the results for the regressions for the even-numbered columns in Tables 3-6, the robustness analyses in Table 7, and the additional robustness analyses
discussed in the text running the even-numbered regressions in Tables 3 to 6 without controls, with lags of the controls through one or three years, with the smaller firm-size
minimum (< 6), and using a continuous measure of the business cycle shock. # + Sig / -Sig / Not Sig counts the number of regressions where the coefficient is positive and
statistically significant (at the 10% level), negative and significant, or neither. Estimates surrounded by a box are those for which the evidence indicates that stronger age
discrimination helped older workers relative to younger workers. Shaded estimates are those that indicate the opposite. Boldfaced sets of estimates are those where the main
effect indicates that prior to the Great Recession stronger age discrimination protections helped older workers, but generated relatively worse outcomes for them during or after
the Great Recession.
