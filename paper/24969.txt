                                          ABSTRACT

As the American college student population has become more diverse, the goal of hiring a more
diverse faculty has received increased attention in higher education. A signal of institutional
commitment to faculty diversity often includes the hiring of an executive level chief diversity
officer (CDO). To examine the effects of a CDO in a broad panel data context, we combine
unique data on the initial hiring of a CDO with publicly available faculty and administrator hiring
data by race and ethnicity from 2001 to 2016 for four-year or higher U.S. universities categorized
as Carnegie R1, R2, or M1 institutions with student populations of 4,000 or more. We are unable
to find significant statistical evidence that preexisting growth in diversity for underrepresented
racial/ethnic minority groups is affected by the hiring of an executive level diversity officer for
new tenure and non-tenure track hires, faculty hired with tenure, or for university administrator
hires.

1        Introduction

The issue of race and diversity on campus has been a central educational research and policy concern

of universities for decades (Dee, 2005; Hurtado, Clayton-Pedersen, Allen, and Milem, 1998). Fol-

lowing President Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 equal employment opportunity executive order (Johnson,

1965) affecting hiring practices of federal contractors, American universities quickly and volun-

tarily enacted similar affirmative action policies to increase the diversity of student populations

(Arcidiacono and Lovenheim, 2016). However, changes in the diversity of faculty has proceeded

at a slower pace. With faculties less diverse than their student bodies, universities have sought

programs and policies designed to better increase faculty diversity. Advocates for greater diversity

have argued that a higher-profile executive-level Chief Diversity Officer, preferably one who reports

directly to the university president, can more effectively promote and encourage diversity at the

highest level of university governance compared with lower level diversity-focused offices and orga-

nizations such as multicultural and diversity centers (Wilson, 2013). The movement to hire CDOs

is gaining momentum. We find that in the 2016 academic year, more than two-thirds of the major

U.S. Universities we study had a CDO in place.

   In a university with shared governance, it is not immediately clear how much influence an

executive level CDO can exert upon faculty hiring decisions made by individual departments. Yet

increasing faculty diversity appears to enjoy broad support within academe. A 2017 survey found

that 64% of provosts at Doctoral granting state universities and 53% of provosts overall agree or

strongly agree that “Most academic departments at my institution place a high value on diversity in

the hiring process” while 8% of Doctoral state university provosts disagree (0% strongly disagree)

and 15% of all provosts disagree or strongly disagree (Jaschik and Lederman, 2017). University

cultures also value academic freedom and local autonomy. Yet the number of new PhDs who

are members of an underrepresented minority group vary widely by academic discipline. Despite

widespread desire to increase faculty diversity, it simply may not be possible to rapidly increase

faculty diversity given the pool of available faculty candidates.

   The purpose of this paper is to present a first look at how the hiring of a CDO has affected

the diversity of faculty and administrator hiring in four-year and above degree-granting American

universities with 4,000 or more students from the 2001 through 2016 academic hiring cycles. To

do so, we supplement publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Education Integrated

Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) with data we have gathered on the presence of an

executive-level CDO. We are unable to find statistically significant evidence that diversity hiring

patterns of faculty and administrators from universities with a CDO present differ from other


                                                  2
universities in our sample which had not hired a CDO by the conclusion of the 2016 academic

hiring cycle, or differ from patterns which existed in those same universities prior to hiring a CDO.

    In the following sections, we discuss the emergence of the executive level diversity officer position,

common roles of the position and the theoretical connection between faculty diversity and student

diversity. We then document our data collection process and public IPEDS data used, followed by

our methods, results, and discussion of our findings that may offer avenues for future research.



2     Background and Literature Review

2.1    Diversity and the Role of Chief Diversity Officers

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) offices have been a staple of the workplace since the pas-

sage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII in 1964, and more recently the Americans with

Disabilities Act in 1990. However, EEO and other multicultural and diversity offices were typically

not executive-level offices within universities, but were located at the departmental level or as a

division of student services.

    A more recent trend is the hiring of executive level officers to coordinate various diversity

initiatives on campus. Advocates for the establishment of a Chief Diversity Officer argue that a

CDO must be an executive-level position and preferably one that reports directly to the president

to enhance their effectiveness (Wilson, 2013). Damon Williams, founder of the Center for Strategic

Diversity Leadership and Social Innovation and Katrina Wade-Golden, Deputy CDO and Director

of Implementation for the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, both at the University of

Michigan, contrast the CDO with earlier positions:


      What distinguishes the current executive diversity officer from its historical predecessors
      is the functional definition of diversity as a resource that can be leveraged to enhance
      the learning of all students and is fundamental to institutional excellence, in addition to
      its historic definition as the presence of individuals that differ by race, gender, or some
      other social identity characteristic. . . . Given complexities like infusing diversity into
      the curriculum, enhancing the compositional diversity profile of students, faculty, and
      staff, and developing policies designed to improve the campus climate, the challenge of
      diversity is beyond the capabilities of any one individual, division, or team. Hence, chief
      diversity officers serve as powerful integrating forces for diversity issues, collaborating



                                                    3
      and working through the lateral networks of the institution no matter how large or
      small their staffs (Williams and Wade-Golden, 2007).

   Recent work notes the growth in the diversity of PhD candidates and suggests that univer-

sities may not place enough emphasis on hiring underrepresented faculty (Smith, Turner, Osei-

Kofi, and Richards, 2004). Data collected from the National Science Foundation’s 2016 Survey of

Earned Doctorates report (National Science Foundation, 2018, Table 12) indicates that the growth

of PhDs awarded to members of underrepresented minorities exceeds the overall growth rate of

PhDs awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Four socioeconomic trends have been

offered to explain this push contributing for greater diversity in higher education (Williams and

Clowney, 2007): 1) legal and political dynamics, 2) changing demographics, 3) the rise of a post-

industrial knowledge economy, and 4) persistent societal inequities. Within the university setting,

diversity may improve the individual well-being of members by increasing the likelihood that each

person finds others with a similar background and common interests. It also offers opportunities

for learning from individual or group differences that improve understanding in an increasingly

globalized work environment. Business team diversity fosters more innovative ideas (Van Knip-

penberg and Schippers, 2007; Ruef, 2002) which would also apply to university research teams and

classroom groups.


2.2   Chief Diversity Officers, Faculty Hires, and Student Outcomes

The recruitment and retention of underrepresented faculty are considered a key priority facilitated

by CDOs to meet changing student demographics. The logic is that positive educational outcomes

will result from congruency of student and professor race/ethnicity, thereby reducing achievement

gaps for minority students (Campbell and Campbell, 1997). The most frequently cited benefits

of this race/ethnicity matching hypothesis include greater engagement/retention, improved class-

room discussion and better preparation for the real world (Maruyama, Moreno, Gudeman, and

Marin, 2000). There are several theories seeking to explain why and how educational outcomes are

associated with faculty-student gender or race/ethnicity congruency. Role model theories suggest

increased student motivation through (1) behavioral modeling of how to perform a skill or achieve

a goal; (2) showing that the skill or goal is possible; and (3) articulating that the goal is desirable


                                                  4
and worth the effort (Almquist and Angrist, 1971; Basow and Howe, 1980; Morgenroth, Ryan, and

Peters, 2015). The Pygmalion or Rosenthal Effect is a phenomenon where demographic similarities

can positively influence faculty and student communication leading to higher expectations for en-

hanced performance (Rosenthal, Jacobson, et al., 1968). Stereotype theories suggest that a faculty

member of a different gender and/or race may have an effect on student outcomes through nega-

tive stereotypes (Leslie, Cimpian, Meyer, and Freeland, 2015; Steele and Aronson, 1995). Faculty

diversity and student outcomes as a research topic has been studied by scholars in multiple fields

with mixed findings.1

   A weakness of many of the earlier studies is an inability to credibly control for the likelihood of

self-selection. For example, if female students are able to select which section of a large introductory

course to enroll in, and higher achieving/more motivated female students specifically seek out female

professors whereas lower achieving/less motivated female students must enroll in sections taught

by male professors, it would not be statistically possible to separate preexisting ability and/or

motivation from any gender-based professor effects upon student achievement.

   Several recent studies use research designs and data which overcome some of these earlier

methodological weaknesses. Carrell, Page, and West (2010) use data on the random assignment

of students and professors into classrooms to investigate the effects of professor gender on student

achievement at the U.S. Air Force Academy finding that in mandatory introductory STEM course-

work, the achievement of female students increases when they are randomly assigned to female

faculty members. In a second Academy study, Kofoed and McGovney (2017) examine the effects of

randomly assigned mentors on career choices at the U.S. Military Academy. Students must choose

from a small number of military specialties for their careers upon graduation. All students are more

likely to choose the specialty of their military commander, but the study finds underrepresented

minority students are additionally likely to choose the military specialty of their commanding officer

if that commander is of the same racial/ethnic group.

   A third study uses data from De Anza College, a large community college in the San Francisco

Bay area. Fairlie, Hoffmann, and Oreopoulos (2014) address issues of self-selection by focusing

analysis on lower-achieving students with lower registration priority, and consequently, a more

limited selection of faculty instructors. The findings show that underrepresented minority students

are 1.2-2.8 percent more likely to pass classes, 2.0-2.9 percent less likely to drop out of classes, and

2.4-3.2 percent more likely to get a grade of B or higher in classes with underrepresented minority

instructors. These represent modest, but statistically significant reductions in achievement gaps

relative to majority groups (20% to 50% of the total gap). Subsequent course selection, retention,

and degree completion of minority students are also positively influenced when matched with a

minority faculty member.

    In contrast to these positive findings, other studies also addressing selection effects at the

secondary level (Dee, 2007; Neugebauer, Helbig, and Landmann, 2010; Helbig, 2012) and post-

secondary level (Price, 2010) find either mixed results or no significance for teacher-student gender

or race/ethnicity congruity on student performance. For example, in a study by Cho (2012) of

15 OCED countries using multi-wave TIMSS data that allows for student fixed effects estimation,

there was no effect of teacher gender on student math performance outcomes. Another study finds

overall positive effects of mentoring regardless of race or gender (Kim and Sax, 2009).

    The nascent academic literature addressing CDOs often discusses the experiences and effects of

CDOs through case studies from a handful of interviews with current CDOs (Parker, 2015; Wilson,

2013). Wilson (2013) states that the effectiveness of CDOs remains unknown. Therefore, whether

CDOs influence the hiring of diverse faculty premised on the association with minority student

outcomes is important to investigate. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-

scale statistical analysis of the effects of a university CDO position on the diversity of faculty and

administrator hiring.



3    Data

A critical initial decision in our analysis involves selecting which institutions to include in our

sample. We prefer inclusion of the broadest sample of U.S. universities possible, but limit the

dataset to institutions that are broadly comparable to one another in their selection of new faculty

from the same pool of applicants. We include universities located in the United States which are



                                                   6
classified as Carnegie R1 doctorate-granting universities with highest research activity, Carnegie R2

doctorate-granting universities with higher research activity and Carnegie M1 with larger master’s

degree-granting activity. Because our interest is the CDO position and the proportion of diversity

hires, we limit our sample to R1, R2, and M1 universities with an enrollment of 4,000 or more

undergraduates on the assumption that they are large enough to have regular hiring of new faculty

and administrators and sample from 2001 through the 2016 academic year.

      A wide variety of demographic, hiring, financial, and institutional characteristics are pub-

licly available for this set of universities in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System

(IPEDS) at the National Center for Education Statistics. Universities, prior to 2016, were only

required to complete IPEDS surveys in odd academic years regarding the race and gender of em-

ployees hired. The recent mandate by the U.S. Department of Education requires annual reporting,

but a subset of institutions did choose to voluntarily report the race and gender of new employees

hired in even academic years as well. Due to concerns that institutions which chose to voluntarily

report may differ systematically from those which did not, we use in our regression analysis only

data from the academic years in which reporting was mandatory.

      IPEDS does not record whether a university has employed an executive level chief diversity

officer. We were not able to locate other sources which had compiled such data and instead gathered

our own. Our data on whether an executive level CDO was present is the result of a three-step

process. We employed a web scraping company to initially determine the year in which an executive

level CDO was first hired for the universities in our data set. Our search for the start date of an

executive level diversity position included variations of the Chief Diversity Officer title at a Vice

President or higher level of organizational management.2 To assess whether a university established

an executive diversity officer and the year hired, we searched university web pages, press releases,

news articles, LinkedIn, university organizational charts, and other publicly available material. A

coauthor of this paper and a graduate research assistant subsequently and separately repeated this

same process as a way to independently verify data accuracy and reliability. The 462 universities

included in our data set and the year in which the first executive-level CDO was hired are listed in
  2
    Examples include Associate Provost for Equity and Inclusion, Senior Executive Assistant to the President for
Diversity, and Vice President for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equal Opportunity, etc.

Appendix A.

   To correct for the possibility that increased diversity affects the decision of whether to hire a

CDO, we employ the proportion of peer R1 institutions which have a CDO in place as an instrument

for the presence of a CDO. We posit that institutions look to best practices and innovations of other

R1 institutions. We found that decisions regarding a CDO at R1 institutions within 100 miles do

not have as much explanatory power over a R1 institution as the decisions regarding a CDO of

all R1 institutions (excluding self) nationwide. This is consistent with our understanding that the

U.S. market for higher education is a national as opposed to a localized market (Hoxby, 2016).

Likewise, we found that CDO hiring decisions of R2 and M1 institutions were more affected by

the decisions of all R1 institutions than by either nearby or nationwide institutions with the same

Carnegie classification, perhaps because the decisions of these institutions are affected more by

aspirational behaviors than peer institutions. In light of this, we calculate our instrument, Peer

R1 CDOs, measured as the proportion of other R1 institutions which have a CDO present in the

current year.

   For our primary measurement of diversity, we use the proportion of the total number of students,

faculty, or administrators who are identified as being members of an underrepresented minority

group in IPEDS as African-American, Hispanic, or Native American/Pacific Islander. To measure

current institutional diversity, we report the proportion of current undergraduate students, faculty

of all academic rank and tenure status, and administrators who are members of an underrepresented

minority group.

   IPEDS reports a vast amount of data on each university. We report only selected relevant

statistics in the interest of brevity. These include the average inflation-adjusted 9-month Assistant

Professor salary, in- and out-of-state tuition plus fees, the proportion of students who are in-state,

and statistics on student financial aid and loans. In addition, we compute the percentage growth in

applications for undergraduate admission. We believe each of these indicators may also influence

the ability to attract students and faculty, particularly in institutions where budgets are primarily

funded by undergraduate tuition and fees.

   As a secondary specification for diversity, we use a Herfindahl-like index to measure total di-




                                                  8

                                                          g∈G

where G is the set of all racial and ethnic groups, and pigt is the proportion of persons in university

i of racial/ethnic group g in time t. This index assumes a value of zero if all members are of a single

racial/ethnic group and reaches its maximum when all racial/ethnic groups are evenly represented.

It is equal to the probability that two randomly drawn individuals from a large population come

from different races (Simpson, 1949; Hirschman, 1980).

   Within our sample of academic institutions, we also account for the role played by Historically

Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). These universities, founded prior to 1964 with the inten-

tion of serving the African-American community, have very high percentages of underrepresented

minorities in their student bodies, faculty, and staff by design. Until very recently, most have not

employed a CDO. Although these institutions meet all of the criteria for inclusion in our sample,

we analyze the sample with and without HBCU so as to better understand the influence of these

institutions on our results.

   Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. Means and standard deviations for the full sample

are reported in column (1). Column (2) reports summary statistics gathered only in the years

where reporting of the racial and ethnic composition of newly hired faculty and staff is mandatory.

In columns (3), (4), and (5), the institutions reported in column (2) are separated into their

respective Carnegie classifications. Finally, in column (6) we separate out HBCU. We note the

much higher prevalence of CDOs among Carnegie R1 institutions than R2 and M1 institutions. The

summary data indicate a much higher proportion of underrepresented minority students, faculty,

and administrators and a lower proportion of CDOs present at HBCU institutions than in the

sample as a whole.


3.1   Graphical Analysis

The time period 2001-2016 has been one of substantial change in U.S. universities regarding issues

of diversity and inclusion. To better illustrate dynamics within our data, we illustrate changes in

demographic hiring practices related to the CDO position in Figure 2, and by specific academic


                                                  9
position levels in Figure 1. For both figures, we omit HBCU due to the unique mission and

demographics of these institutions. Figure 1a illustrates the rate at which universities in our sample

have hired an executive level diversity officer over time. The proportion has steadily increased from

5.4 percent in 2001 to 67.6 percent in 2016.3 The remaining panels of Figure 1 illustrate trends

by CDO presence for underrepresented (b) students, (c) faculty and (d) administrators in years

for which demographic reporting was mandatory. The proportion of underrepresented minority

students, faculty, and administrators illustrated in Figure 1b to 1d increased from 2001 through

2016 for universities with and without a CDO presence.

       Perhaps surprisingly, the proportions for underrepresented groups has been consistently higher

in universities without a CDO than with a CDO present over this time period. This finding may be

a consequence, at least in part, of the changing composition of these groups.4 For underrepresented

students (Figure 1b), the average gap by CDO position presence increased from 4.9 percent in 2001

to 8.5 percent in 2016. Figure 1c indicates the university proportion of underrepresented faculty by

CDO presence, differed by only 0.4 percent in 2001, but that gap increased to 3.3 percent by 2016.

Likewise, the gap in the proportion of underrepresented administrators by CDO position presence

grew from 3.8 percent in 2001 to 6.3 percent in 2016. Figures 1e and 1f are analogous to 1c and

1d, but with categories which do not change through time. Figures 1e and 1f contrast faculty and

administrator diversity in universities which established an initial CDO in 2005 or earlier, defined

as Early CDO, with universities which had not established a CDO by 2016.

       Figure 2 illustrates more specific diversity hiring trends by CDO presence for (a) non-tenure

track faculty, (b) tenure-track faculty, (c) tenured faculty, and (d) administrators along with the

total number of corresponding hires for each category in Figure 2 panels e to h. We note the adverse

effects of the Great Recession on overall hiring in 2007-2008 along with the remarkable stability of

the proportion of diversity hires by CDO presence, given the underlying volatility in the academic

job market. The post-recession hiring increases again across academic categories (Figure 2e to 2h)

while the trend for the proportion of diversity hires by presence of CDO position continues through
   3
     For the universities in our sample, in only one case was an existing CDO position eliminated. At the Provost’s
request, the CDO’s duties were assumed by the Provost at this university.
   4
     As an example, if universities were rank ordered from least diverse to most diverse, for a given year, hiring a
CDO at the least representative institutions will increase the average of both groups over time.

3.2    Supply of New PhDs

A comprehensive analysis of the academic job market and trends in diversity would require detailed

data on both the supply and demand of academic job market candidates. IPEDS regrettably does

not report data on academic job market applicants by university. However, the National Science

Foundation (NSF) does collect data on the number of PhDs awarded annually by academic field

and subfield by race and ethnic group. Table 2 contains a tabulation of earned PhDs awarded

by U.S. universities to citizens and permanent residents in the 2016 academic year for all fields

(bolded) and selected subfields within these fields (indented) by race and ethnic group. The final

column of Table 2 reports PhDs awarded for members of underrepresented minority groups, which

is a sum of the second, third, and fourth columns.

    In 2016, 5,043 members of an underrepresented minority group earned a PhD out of a total

of 35,719 PhDs earned for U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or 14.1% of the total. The NSF

survey reports that in 2016, 48.5% of U.S. citizens or permanent residents earning their PhD

with definite employment plans at the time of the survey had secured jobs in academia. The

proportion of underrepresented minorities with academic employment plans was comparable.5 In

2016, diverse hires were 11.6% of tenure-track faculty members in our sample (including Historically

Black Colleges and Universities), and 13.7% of non-tenured faculty members. There is substantial

variation in the proportion of earned PhDs by field for total underrepresented minorities, from a

low of 7.9% in Physical Sciences and Earth Sciences to a high of 23.1% in Education. Variation by

subfield is even more substantial with the proportion of PhDs earned by minorities as high as 40%

for Latin American History and 38.2% for Area & Ethnic & Cultural & Gender Studies, to a low

of 6.4% in Physics and Astronomy and 9.6% in Economics. Awarded PhDs in certain subfields of

engineering not shown are even less diverse.

    Unfortunately, the IPEDS data on faculty hiring by race is not disaggregated by academic
    5
      The proportion of American Indian or Alaskan Natives was unreported due to small sample size and confiden-
tiality. 47.3% of African Americans and 48.9.8% of Hispanic and Latino employed PhDs had secured academic
employment (National Science Foundation, 2018, Table 47).

discipline. However, we infer from Table 2 that a university wishing to enhance the diversity of

its faculty may be limited in the extent it can do so by the limited availability of PhDs in some

academic disciplines.



4     Methods and Results

Although the primary focus of our paper is an examination of a CDO position hire to changes in

faculty diversity, it is possible that the establishment of a CDO is driven, instead, by a response to

growing campus diversity among students. In a 2017 survey conducted by Inside Higher Ed (Jaschik

and Lederman, 2017), 51 percent of respondent provosts from doctoral-granting public universities

responded in the affirmative to the following question: “Either because of the protests, or because of

prior/subsequent commitments, does your college currently have a target for increasing the number

or percentage of minority faculty members you employ by a certain date? ” To better understand

directions of causality, we implement a Granger Causality Test between the initial establishment

of CDO and changes in student, faculty, and administrator hiring diversity, and growth in student

applications for undergraduate admissions.


4.1    Granger Causality

Our dataset includes the number and demographic characteristics of incoming students, and new

faculty and administrator hires. We first examine our data for empirical evidence of whether the

establishment of a CDO is in response to changes in diversity, and whether diversity changes in

response to the establishment of a CDO. The richness of our data set allows us to decompose

changes in diversity into changes in student, faculty, and administrator diversity. In addition to

changes in diversity, we also include changes in annual applications for admissions.6 Equations 2-5

implement a standard Granger Causality Test on these related variables where ∆CDOit represents

whether a CDO was established by university i between years t − 1 and t. ∆Uits is the change

in the proportion of underrepresented students from year t − 1 to year t. ∆Uitf is the change in
   6
     We include this variable to account for the possibility that a university may establish a CDO position in response
to adverse publicity and a corresponding drop in applications, or the possibility of an increase in applications due to
the establishment of a CDO.

change in the number of applications for admission.

Table 3 reports the results from a Granger causality test with specifications in columns 2 through

6 in Table 2 matching equations (2) through (6) above. In Panel A of Table 2, we present our

analysis on the full sample of universities, and in Panel B we omit HBCU due to their unique

nature as mentioned previously. We report the F-statistics for the joint significance of each group of

explanatory variables in Table 3, with p-values in square brackets underneath. In each specification,

we estimate the first through fifth lags of each variable, but do not report an F-statistic for lags of the

dependent variable, since this lacks any economic meaning.7 The proportion of underrepresented

students is reported on an annual basis, but the reporting of faculty and administrator demographics

as well as applications are not mandatory in even calendar years. To enable the use of all years in

the estimation of Equations 2-6, we impute unreported values linearly.8

       Comparing Table 3 Panels A and B, we note the different patterns and magnitudes of significance

as evidence that HBCU are distinctly diverse regarding students, faculty, and administrators, while

largely absent of a CDO presence due to the historic mandate of these institutions. This suggests

Panel B is a more appropriate specification for understanding the effects of a CDO upon institutions

with lower proportions of diverse faculty, students, and administrators.
   7
     Whether a university has a CDO present in years t − 5 through t − 1 has high explanatory power over whether
a CDO is present in year t, but this is not of any interest in examining cross-variable correlations.
   8
     Missing values are imputed by taking a time-weighted average of preceding and following observations. While
not ideal, we rely upon the assumption that diversity measures do not rapidly change over time based on trends in
the dataset.



                                                                13
       We focus interest primarily on the first column of Table 3, labeled (2), which tests for the

effect of changes in diversity and university applications that are correlated with the establishment

of a new CDO, and the first row of parameter estimates in Panel B, which represent the effect

of a new CDO on these measurements of diversity and applications. In our preferred Panel B,

past changes in faculty diversity are not significantly correlated with the establishment of a new

CDO. Past changes in administrator and student diversity are only marginally correlated with

the establishment of a new CDO, while past changes in the growth of university applications are

significantly correlated at the 5 percent level. Although F-statistics can only indicate the presence or

absence of joint correlation but not the sign of the relationship, all unreported individual regression

coefficients which are individually significant are negative. Negative coefficients indicate that recent

admissions growth rates below the sample average are correlated with the initial establishment of

an CDO.      9   In contrast, there does not appear to be a significant correlation between either more

rapidly increasing or decreasing diversity and the initial establishment of a CDO. From the first row

of Panel B, with the initial establishment of a CDO within the past five years, we are unable to find

any significant effects of the initial establishment of a CDO on faculty or administrator diversity or

on university application growth. There is a marginal effect on the percentage of underrepresented

students.


4.2      Main Specifications

An executive level CDO could affect the diversity of faculty and administrators both by encouraging

the hiring of greater numbers of diverse candidates, and by better retaining current diverse faculty

and administrators. The measurements of diversity used in the previous section, change in the

proportion of diverse current faculty, administrators, or students, represents the sum of incoming

and attrition effects. Ideally, we would like to analyze the effect of a CDO on both hiring and

attrition. Although IPEDS reports very detailed data on hiring, the surveys did not inquire about

attrition, and limitations of the data set limit our ability to carefully calculate attrition.        10   Our data
   9
     It is beyond the scope of this paper to establish why a university should see a sudden drop in applications. We
note that adverse publicity is one possibility.
  10
     IPEDS requires that universities report both new hires and existing faculty and administrators on a biannual
basis. Because of this, it would not be possible to reliably estimate annual attrition.

Where Uith represents the proportion of hires who are members of an underrepresented minority in

university i at year t. CDOit−1 is an indicator variable whether university i had a CDO in place

in year t − 1. IPEDS defines a hire by the academic year in which they are added to the university

payroll. If a faculty member is added to the university payroll in August of year t, the hiring process

for this faculty member took place during the previous academic year, t − 1. A CDO presence in

the time period in which hiring decisions are made should have the largest potential effect on hires

that begin the following year. U s , U f , and U a are the proportion of existing students, faculty,

and administrators who are members of an underrepresented minority included as controls. The

change in each of these variables is used as opposed to the total number out of concern that the

total of each variable is growing over time as seen in Figures 1 and 2.11 ∆Ait−1 is the growth

in student applications to university i in year t − 1. β0i and φt are university level and time

fixed effects. By using a fixed effects specification, we do not attempt to explain differences in

the diversity of hiring practices across universities, but examine how the diversity of hires in one

particular year compares to the average of that same university over the sample period. Time fixed

effects account for the changing annual diversity of job candidates. We estimate equation (7) for

dependent variables of non-tenured faculty hires, tenure-track faculty hires, tenured faculty hires,

administrator hires, and the change in graduate students. We include graduate students because

the set of graduate students contains future faculty members and many graduate students are also

classroom instructors. IPEDS does not collect data on incoming graduate students. We include

the change in the proportion of underrepresented graduate students as an alternative.

       We report OLS fixed effect estimates of Equation (7) in Table 4. As in Table 3, we report

estimates using the full sample in Panel A and omit HBCU in Panel B. The Chief Diversity Offi-

cer (CDO) variable of interest is dummy variable coded 1 in years when a CDO is present and 0
  11
     Since we only analyze data when reporting is mandatory, the change between adjacent observations in our data
set represents biannual changes.

otherwise. We interpret the coefficient as the effect of a CDO on diversity hiring relative to that

same university in the absence of a CDO, controlling for the diversity of job candidates, changing

diversity of existing students, faculty, and administrators, and the growth of student applications.

We are unable to find any statistical effects of the presence of a CDO on the diversity of hires in

the full sample. In Panel B with HBCU omitted, we find that the proportion of underrepresented

tenured faculty hired in universities with a CDO present is 2.8 percentage points less diverse than

in universities without a CDO at a 10 percent level of significance. We note that the largest and

most significant effects are those of changes in the percent of underrepresented faculty on diverse

tenure-track hires, and of changes in the percent of underrepresented administrators on diverse

administrator hires. Although we believe that because of their historic mission, these correlations

exist within HBCU institutions, we note that these correlations become larger when HBCU in-

stitutions are omitted in Panel B. In Column 2, Panel B, as the percentage of underrepresented

faculty rose by 1 percentage point, the proportion of diverse tenure-track faculty hired increased by

1.096 percentage points. We find an equally significant but numerically smaller effect of existing

administrator diversity on the proportion of diverse administrators hired. We interpret both of

these coefficients as evidence of homophily – the tendency of individuals to associate, network, and

bond with similar others (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook, 2001).

   Table 3 presented statistical evidence that the decision to establish a Chief Diversity Officer is

endogenous with respect to student and administrator diversity, and growth in applications. Other

sources of unobserved endogeneity, such as a university desire to increase faculty and administrator

diversity, are plausible and likely. (Jaschik and Lederman, 2017) If the decision to establish a

CDO position is affected by the interaction between academics and administrators with those of

peer and aspirant institutions, the proportion of peer and aspirant institutions with a CDO is a

possible instrument. Although we found that the presence of a CDO at a Carnegie R1 institution

is significantly affected by the proportion of peer R1 institutions with a CDO, the decision in R2

and M1 institutions were much more closely correlated with R1 universities than with peer R2 and

M1 institutions. We interpret this as evidence that R2 and M1 institutions view R1 institutions

as institutions that they aspire to become like, more so than institutions of the same Carnegie

classification. In light of this, we use as our exogenous instrument the lagged proportion of peer


                                                 16
R1 institutions with a CDO present for each of the R1, R2, and M1 institutions.

   We present instrumental variables fixed effects estimates of Equation (7) in Table 5. For each

regression estimate, we report the first stage F statistic from excluding our exogenous instrument,

Lagged Peer R1 CDOs. Our IV specifications do not suffer from weak instruments, as the smallest

reported first stage F statistic of 244.3. As in Table 4, the only specifications in which we find

an effect of a CDO being present is in the proportion of diverse tenured faculty hired. With IV

estimates, the effect of a CDO is now significant at a 5 percent level both in the full sample and

with HBCU institutions omitted. In Panel B, the proportion of diverse tenured faculty hired was

5.6 percentage points lower with a CDO present than in the same institutions without a CDO.


4.3   CDO Effect with Limited Supply of Diverse Candidates

If in the market for academic positions of all types investigated in this paper were characterized

by more institutions desiring to hire diverse candidates than diverse candidates on the job market,

the possibility of a university increasing its diversity would be limited (Flaherty, 2015). It is

possible under this scenario that a CDO would enable the employer to better compete against

other universities without a CDO in the academic job market for scarce diverse candidates, even

though the reported proportion of diverse candidates may see limited changes. To measure the

success of a university in recruiting diverse hires relative to other institutions, we compute the

proportion of total hires within a year that are underrepresented, pt . Let university i in year t

hire Nit positions, nit of which are diverse. If each hire were interpreted as an opportunity to

hire a diverse candidate with probability pt , the probability of the observed outcome is distributed

Binomial with probability density of


                                                    Nit !
                          P (nit , Nit ) =                     pnit (1 − pt )(Nit −nit )
                                             nit !(Nit − nit )! t

We use for our dependent variable in Tables 5 and 6 the cumulative distribution function CDF (nit , Nit ),

or the probability of hiring up to nit diverse candidates out of Nit total hires. A larger value can

be interpreted as a university that is more successful in hiring diverse candidates relative to peer

institutions.



                                                        17
    In Table 6, we present OLS estimates of Equation (7) using the relative success of an institution

in hiring diverse candidates as the dependent variable. In both Panels A and B, we are unable to

find any effect of a CDO. We continue to find strong evidence of homophily, now in non-tenured,

tenure-track, and administrator hires at the 1 percent level of significance. We find the same

patterns of significance when correcting for the likely endogeneity of a CDO in Table 7. We are

unable to find evidence of a CDO effect relative to universities without a formal CDO position in

the hiring of non-tenured, tenure-track, tenured faculty, or administrators.

    To check for possible effects of a CDO on a broader measurement of diversity, we estimate

Equation (7) using the diversity index defined in Equation (1). We report OLS estimates in Table

8 and IV estimates in Table 9. In Table 8, we are unable to find effects of a CDO in the overall

diversity of hires within each of the four categories considered. However, we now observe homophily

for the first time in tenured faculty hiring, although at a lower 5 percent level of significance in

Panel B. Correcting for the likely endogeneity of a CDO in Table 9, we now find negative effects

on the diversity index of tenured faculty hires at the 5 percent level.



5    Discussion

Universities are increasingly hiring executive level diversity administrators (CDOs) signaling a

commitment to increased diversity. This study began with an overview of diversity trends among

students and faculty in higher education and the logic of hiring a CDO. A key role of the executive

level position is to promote faculty diversity hiring to increase congruity between faculty-student

gender and race/ethnicity. A key motive for better matching faculty and student on these character-

istics is to enhance support for underrepresented students which, in turn, may lead to improvements

in student satisfaction and performance. We empirically test whether this executive level adminis-

trative position significantly alters faculty diversity hiring practices beyond normal growth patterns

of faculty diversity from 2001 to 2016. Importantly, we are unable to find evidence that preexist-

ing patterns in diversity hiring are altered by the hiring of an executive level diversity officer at

the faculty or administration hiring level using a number of alternative specifications. We do find

patterns of homophily for current faculty/administrator diversity and new hires.



                                                 18
   The trend for hiring executive level diversity officers (Figure 1a) began in the early 2000s. By

2016, approximately 65 percent of higher education institutions established a form of this executive

position. Higher education student gender and race/ethnicity characteristics have also changed

over the 15-year sample frame with the overall proportion of underrepresented students increasing

from 0.189 in 2001, to 0.255 in 2016. Figure 1b shows student diversity trends for institutions

with and without a CDO in place. Diversity among faculty and administrators has also increased

(Figures 1.c to 1.f), but at a slower rate than student diversity. For example, the overall proportion

of underrepresented faculty was 0.089 in 2001 and 0.110 in 2016. In Figure 1, it is notable that

universities without CDOs have higher proportions of minority faculty than those with a CDO.

While a perceived lack of diversity relative to peer institutions could be used to justify hiring a

CDO, the gap between the diversity of institutions with and without a CDO is greater in 2016 than

in 2001. In Tables 6 and 7, we were unable to find evidence of a sustained advantage for diverse

hiring relative to other institutions due to the presence of a CDO. It is possible this finding reflects

the lack of authority the CDO has over hiring decisions. Hiring decisions are generally entrusted to

departments given their expertise in the field. Cabinet-level officers might, in effect, have very little

influence in decisions made at the department and college level. In the remainder of this section,

we offer alternative possible explanations for our inability to find significant effects of a CDO on

diversity hiring trends; and suggest potential avenues for future research.


5.1   Limited Supply of Diverse PhD Job Candidates

The dataset we analyze on the proportion of non-tenured, tenure-track, and tenured faculty and

administrators who are members of an underrepresented minority group properly represents the

outcome of a two-sided matching problem between universities and job market candidates. Detailed

data on the preferences of institutions that are hiring, and detailed attributes and preferences of job

market candidates are not available from IPEDS or other sources we can access. In our discussion

of Table 2, we noted that in 2016, 14.1% of earned PhDs awarded to U.S. citizens and permanent

residents were to members of underrepresented minority groups. The supply of job candidates

is further limited by approximately 50 percent of minority PhD recipients accepting employment

outside the academic sector according to the 2016 NSF survey. We can also examine the distribution


                                                   19
of PhDs earned by race in 2016 from Table 2. Evidence points toward a congregation by field

and subfield for underrepresented minorities. For example, of the 2,360 degrees earned by Black

candidates in 2016, 27% were in education (640/2,360) and 21% were in Psychology and Social

Sciences (495/2,360). For the subfield of Physics and Astronomy, there were less than 1% (23/2,360)

of total PhDs obtained for the year by Black doctoral candidates with a similar trend of limited

candidates reported in Economics (Bayer and Rouse, 2016). These disparities in the presence of

underrepresented minority academic job market candidates across academic fields could contribute

to underrepresentation in the aggregate. Further research is needed to determine whether this is

the case.


5.2   Recruitment and Retention Initiatives

In the theory of a two-sided matching problem, members of each side determine a rank ordering

of available options. As applied to the academic job market, candidates rank order potential

employers, and hiring departments rank order potential candidates. A university hoping to make its

faculty more diverse can boost its attractiveness to underrepresented candidates by offering higher

salaries or reduced teaching loads. As an example, Yale University recently announced a five-year,

$50 million-dollar campaign to increase faculty diversity (Yale University, 2016). Carnegie Research

Intensive (R1) universities as a group are characterized by greater financial resources devoted to

research and larger endowments (Phillips, Lombardi, Abbey, and Craig, 2016), which should enable

such institutions desiring to increase faculty diversity to make more attractive offers to diverse

candidates. We present summary statistics in Table 1, Columns 3, 4, and 5 for Carnegie R1, R2,

and M1 institutions respectively. Despite increased resources which could enable R1 institutions

to make more financially attractive offers, these institutions as a group have less diverse faculty

and administrators than R2 and M1 institutions. We interpret this as evidence that financial

resources alone are not enough to increase faculty and administrator diversity. We were not able

to find careful, scholarly analyses of diverse faculty turnover, but in online sources, advocates of

diversity have suggested that reducing the turnover of diversity faculty may be a more effective

path to increasing faculty diversity (Ann, 2016). Analysis of a survey of associate professors at

50 universities found non-monetary factors, such as quality relationships with colleagues, more


                                                20
important to workplace commitment than formal programs including diversity hiring initiatives

(Mackey, 2017). Beginning in 2016, universities must report annually both current and new faculty

and administrators by gender and racial/ethnic group. This will enable future researchers to impute

annual attrition by racial and ethnic group and perform a detailed analysis of faculty turnover.


5.3   Carnegie Classifications, Urbanization, and Geographic Regions

The main specifications of our analysis included university level fixed effects to restrict our analysis

to variation of underrepresented hiring within individual universities. A consequence of this is

the inability to include explanatory variables which are time-invariant. For the 2016 academic

year hiring cycle, we consider variation in diverse hiring by Carnegie classification, the degree

of urbanization as recorded by IPEDS, and the U.S. Census region. Carnegie classification is of

interest to test whether research intensity and the additional financial resources that accompany it

are effective in successfully attracting underrepresented candidates. IPEDS records the degree of

urbanization that a university is located in from a large city to a distant rural area. Additionally,

we consider the four U.S. Census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Results appear in

Table 10. For each category of academic position we consider; non-tenured, tenure-track, tenured,

and administrator, we present the proportion of positions where the academic hired was black,

Hispanic, a native American, or an underrepresented minority, which is a sum of the previous

categories. Column 1 presents proportions, and Columns 2 through 4 present an F -statistic testing

equality of means across groups.

   The F -test of significance for difference of mean underrepresented group hired by Carnegie cat-

egory (R1, R2, or M1) is presented in Column 2. We are unable to find any significant difference for

underrepresented minority groups in aggregate. Looking at individual racial/ethnic groups within

underrepresented minority groups, we find marginally significant differences in the percentage of

black tenure track faculty and black administrators hired. We also find highly significant evidence

of differences across Carnegie categories for the percent of native administrators hired, though we

note that in 2016, only 27 native administrators were hired nationwide. Interestingly, we find highly

significant differences in the proportion of universities with a CDO in place by Carnegie category.

Carnegie R1 institutions are substantially more likely to have a CDO in place in 2016 than R2 or


                                                  21
M1 institutions.

   Differences by urbanization are presented in Column 3. The percentage of black non-tenured

faculty hired differs significantly by degree of urbanization. We find that the proportion of black

non-tenured faculty hired is substantially greater in large cities and midsize cities than in suburban,

towns, or rural areas. We find a similar concentration of Hispanic administrators in large urban

areas. A sharply lower proportion of CDOs in place in Remote Towns causes the average proportions

of CDOs in place by degree of urbanization to differ at a highly significant level.

   We find substantial variation in diverse hiring by census region. For non-tenured faculty, the

proportion of Black and Hispanic faculty hired have highly significant variation by census region. In

the West, where the proportion of non-tenured faculty who are Hispanic is highest, the proportion of

Black faculty is lowest. And in the South, where the proportion of Black faculty hired is dramatically

higher, the proportion of Hispanic faculty hired is well below the national average. The proportion

of underrepresented non-tenured faculty hired as a group is only marginally significant, due to

offsetting regional variation by Black and Hispanic faculty hired. Hispanic tenure-track faculty

are also heavily represented in the West, but we do not find significant regional variation by Black

tenure-track faculty hired. Significant variation by census region also exists in administrator hiring.

Interestingly, the proportion of universities with a CDO in place does not exhibit any significant

regional variation.

   IPEDS data on faculty hiring represents the dual coincidence of wants between job candidates

and hiring institutions. As such, it is not possible with IPEDS data to identify whether the

disparities by group in Table 10 are due to candidate preferences, institutional desires, or both.

Additional work to understand the role of urbanization and geographic region on institutional

diversity is needed.


5.4   Public Choice

Our discussion assumes the objective of universities in our sample is to increase the proportion

of faculty and administrators who are members of an underrepresented group, subject to various

constraints. Under this paradigm, senior administrators establish a CDO for the particular purpose

of increasing the proportion of underrepresented members in the overall interests of the university.


                                                  22
However, if a university hires a CDO to appease critics or to quell negative publicity with no

intention of increasing diversity, then the lack of a significant effect on faculty diversity is less

surprising. Under this scenario, even negative and significant effects of a CDO on diversity may

be found, as we do in Table 5, Column 4. In our data, the proportion of diverse tenured faculty

hired is 5.61% lower with an active CDO in place. Unfortunately, we do not have an identification

strategy to parse out university motives for CDO hiring that would distinguish universities with

strong intentions to increase diversity from those with placating motives. Our results do show an

important finding with policy implications regardless of the cause for lack of CDO hiring efficacy.

Future research may consider in greater detail why across a population of larger U.S. universities,

no significant effect of CDO establishment is found on diversity hiring.



6    Conclusion

This study examines the effect of an executive-level CDO on the diversity of faculty and administra-

tor hires for the set of 4-year or above degree-granting U.S. universities with 4,000 or more students

from 2001 to 2016. Using a wide variety of robust specifications, we are unable to find significant

evidence that the presence of an executive level CDO alters preexisting trends of increasing faculty

and administrator diversity in the institutions we study. Our inability to identify a significant effect

should not be interpreted as an argument that an effect does not exist. Given the importance of

this topic to the academic community, much additional work remains to be done. We performed

our analysis using data on the race and ethnicity of faculty and administrator positions at the insti-

tutional level. Data from the National Science Foundation by academic discipline and subdiscipline

reveal large differences in the proportion of underrepresented persons earning a PhD by academic

field. Although important progress has been made in increasing faculty and administrator diversity

from 2001 to 2016, we believe more work must be done to better understand barriers to increased

diversity, and how they might be best addressed.
