Sovereign Risk and Bank Lending: Evidence from 1999 Turkish Earthquake

                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate the effect of sovereign risk on credit supply, using August 1999 Earthquake as an
exogenous shock leading to an increase in Turkey's default risk. Using data on universe of banks
between 1997-2012, we show that, banks with higher ex-ante exposures to government bonds
suffered a bigger shock to their networth and decreased lending more ex-post. Tracing the impact
of an exogenous increase in the sovereign spread to credit supply, the average bank decreases its
credit supply by 1.6 percentage points which corresponds to 55 percent of the actual decline in
aggregate loan provision in the aftermath of the shock.

      Sovereign governments mostly borrow from domestic residents (Aguiar and Amador
(2013), Tomz and Wright (2013), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009)). By lending to their own
sovereigns, domestic financial institutions expose themselves to sovereign risk. As sovereign
default risk increases and sovereign ratings get downgraded, the net worth of banks who
hold sovereign debt goes down (Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi (2014b), Holmstrom and Ti-
role (1993)). Such an increase in sovereign risk constitutes a direct balance sheet shock to
the banks who hold sovereign debt and reduces the eligibility of sovereign bonds as collat-
eral to secure funding. Sovereign risk can also increase endogenously due to weak banks.
Governments can backstop the financial system as a lender of last resort, and recapitalize
banks post financial crises. Such bailouts can increase sovereign risk (Acharya and Schnabl
(2014)). Both channels can underline the well known fact of the coincidence of sovereign
crises and banking crises (Reinhart and Rogoff (2009)).

      This “diabolic loop” between sovereign and bank credit risk was at the center of the
2009–2012 sovereign debt crisis in the periphery of the euro area. In Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, and Spain, the deterioration of sovereign creditworthiness reduced the value of
banks’ holdings of domestic sovereign debt. Bank and sovereign CDS spreads started to move
together. The presumed solvency of domestic banks was reduced, which directly impacted
their lending activity. The resulting bank distress increased the chances that banks would
have to be bailed out by their own government, which increased sovereign distress even
further. Everyone agrees on the policy urgency for the break-up of this vicious circle or
doom loop/diabolic loop.1

      To this date, there has been no causal empirical evidence on this mechanism, where
an exogenous shock to banks’ balance sheet due to heightened sovereign risk resulting in
lower liquidity provision by banks to the private sector. The difficulty in obtaining this
evidence lies in three peculiarities of these bank-sovereign doom loop episodes. First and
foremost, the shock to the bank balance sheets is never exogenous and mostly anticipated,
given the fact that these events unfold together in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis. If

banks cause the increase in sovereign risk or banks anticipate a government default, then
they can actively manage their balance sheet by buying/selling government bonds and hence
we cannot deduce the effect of government bonds on the balance sheet on lending when the
value of such bonds go down. Second, the value of the existing government bonds may not
change on the bank balance sheet even sovereign ratings go down, if banks are recording
all assets at the book value. In this case, the shock to the bank balance sheet may not
be observed in the data. Bank will change its behavior in terms of private sector lending
given the lower market value of bonds, but the change in the value of the bonds may not be
observed on the balance sheet. The econometrician will erroneously attribute this change
in lending to another factor or simply conclude that there is no effect of increased sovereign
risk on lending through banks’ holdings of government bonds. And last but not least, if
the troubles in the banking sector and/or increased sovereign risk lead to a recession and
increased uncertainty, the demand for credit by private sector will go down. Since we observe
in the data the equilibrium loan provision, the decline in loans can simply be due to this
recessionary environment rather than the deterioration in bank balance sheets.

   This paper investigates the link between government bonds, banks and credit market
disruptions using a natural experiment that solves the aforementioned identification issues.
Our experiment allows us to investigate the link from government bond holdings to banks’
balance sheet health and then to credit supply to real sector. Specifically, we investigate the
effect of government debt on banks’ performance and credit provision, using administrative
portfolio data for the universe of banks in Turkey between 1997–2012. We use the 1999
Marmara Earthquake as an unanticipated exogenous fiscal shock that led to fiscal distress.
The earthquake provides us with a fiscal shock that affects the sovereign risk. There was no
banking crisis prior or in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, during our window for
the event analysis.

   Using a differences-in-differences methodology, we find that banks’ with higher exposures
to government debt before the earthquake suffered a bigger shock to their net worth and
decreased lending more than the banks with lower exposures. Our estimates will be identified


                                              3
from the double difference, i.e., the difference in lending after the earthquake between banks
with low and high exposures to government debt before the earthquake. It is not possible
that banks accumulate or run down government debt in expectation of the earthquake and
hence the unanticipated nature of the shock helps us to rule out moral hazard and/or risk
shifting stories in expectation of a default.

      Our identification strategy relies on the size and the unanticipated nature of the fiscal
shock. In terms of the size of the fiscal shock, the Marmara earthquake is very significant.
On August 17, 1999 a big earthquake (at a Richter Scale of 7.6) hit industrial heartland of
Turkey, composed of cities such as Kocaeli, Sakarya, Duzce, Bolu, Yalova, Eskisehir, Bursa
and Istanbul. The region’s population share in country total is 25 percent and GDP share is
50 percent. Total cost of the disaster is estimated to be 20 billion USD, which is 11 percent
of GDP as of 2000.2 To put this event in context, the ratio of damaged buildings (including
key industrial/chemical factories) is 4 times higher than 1995 Kobe earthquake and 12 times
higher than 1994 Northridge earthquake. The Marmara Earthquake is listed in top ten in
the U.S. NGDS Significant Earthquakes database on all earthquakes recorded in history.3

      We start by showing the increased sovereign risk as a result of the earthquake. The
spreads on government bonds go up and maturity gets shorter, indicating an increase in
default risk. The government bonds decline in value and constitute a negative shock to
banks’ balance sheets; more so for the banks with high ex-ante exposure to sovereign debt.
To establish the mechanism from the reduced value of government bonds to a negative bank
balance sheet shock, we proceed as follows. Bank balance sheets are at book value and
hence the decline in the value of government bonds will not be measured by the existing
government bond holdings that are not marked to market. To remedy this problem, we
make use of the accounting practices of the Turkish banking system during that period, that
is recording any loss from any asset in a separate line item called “valuation”. We show that

                                                4
banks with higher ex-ante exposure enter a loss into this item relative to the banks with
lower ex-ante exposure to such government bonds after the earthquake. Since we separately
condition on the loss in the value of assets due to non performing loans, this shows a direct
negative shock to the net worth of the bank as a result of high exposure to government bond
market.

   Our results are statistically and economically significant. Our estimates imply that, a
bank that holds 75 percent of its assets in government bonds decreases credit provision
2 percent during regular times (a normal time crowding out effect) and 6 percent during
earthquake relative to respective means. We measure credit provision by stock of loans to
assets so these are sizeable affects (mean loans to asset ratio is 30 percent). The actual
decline in loan provision is 3 percentage points during the earthquake period. A bank with
mean bond holdings (20 percent of its assets) will decrease loan supply by 1.6 percentage
points and hence our estimates can explant 55 percent of the actual decline in credit provision
from July to October 1999, on average.

   Our estimates trace the impact of a 100 basis point increase in sovereign spreads, which
was the observed increase during the earthquake period, on banks’ credit supply. Although
this is not a big increase and pales in comparison to the observed increases in spreads during
the actual emerging market sovereign debt crises, such as the Turkish one of 2001–2002,
we believe this is still a useful exercise to provide an exogenous lower bound on the effect
of default risk on credit provision. Altavilla, Pagano, and Simonelli (2015), shows that a
100-basis-points rise in government yields in periphery countries during the summer of 2010
is associated with a 9 percent decrease in the lending of the bank who holds the median level
of sovereign bonds. Our estimates are comparable to theirs.

   Although we use an exogenous fiscal shock, there are still other threats to identification.
It can be the case that banks who hold more government securities on their balance sheets
were affected from earthquake more since, by coincidence, they lend in the earthquake region
more, for example. This is not plausible in our case, given the extent of the region affected
by the earthquake, where every bank in our data set has a big presence in terms of lending.

                                              5
Being the industrial and financial heartland of Turkey, the headquarters of all but 4 banks
were located in the Marmara Region, where the remaining were the state-owned banks with
headquarters located in Ankara. Of course, it can still be the case that the customers of the
banks with high exposure to government debt pre-earthquake, reduce their demand for credit
more post-earthquake. Given the lack of a recession in the region and also countrywide, we
feel that this is not likely. In fact investment demand must increase in the earthquake region
given the higher expected return on the destroyed capital stock.

      In order to make sure that our results are not driven by a time varying bank specific
demand effect, where banks with higher exposure to government holdings also face with
lower demand in the aftermath of the earthquake for unobserved reasons, we proceed with
two more analysis: First one is the use of foreign banks. For foreign banks we have their
lending in Turkey and also outside of Turkey and we show that as a result of a balance sheet
shock via holdings of Turkish bonds, these banks reduce their lending outside of Turkey.
The estimated coefficient is very similar to our benchmark coefficient, which provides more
support for the size of our balance sheet shock. Second analysis relies on data from the loan
officer surveys. The benefit of these surveys is that we can find out changes to bank specific
customer demand. The caveat is that these are undertaken after our earthquake period.
So we will assume the information also applies to our period. From each bank we have
the surveys on customer demand for every quarter, where the survey reports the changes
in customer demand. We show that these reported changes move slowly from quarter to
quarter and our bank level loan data is monthly. As a result we can account for the slow
moving bank specific demand for each bank by bank-quarter fixed effects. This is a very
restrictive specification but nevertheless we obtain a similar estimate when we undertook
this analysis.

      Finally, the exposure to government debt is not random. There is an extensive literature
on the reasons of holding one’s own government’s debt. In general government bonds are the
main source of liquidity and high quality collateral for banks.4 Hence, sovereign debt is like
  4
      Holmstrom and Tirole (1993).


                                               6
any other assets with risk-return features and comove with other asset holdings. Though,
government debt is also open to regulatory arbitrage and excessive leverage given the risk
free nature of it.5 A corollary to this is the theory of financial repression/moral suasion.
When there are government policies that require banks and other financial intermediaries to
hold more government bonds, and if these policies change over time, then they will affect
the time variation in government bond holdings of banks. In fact, Chari, Dovis, and Kehoe
(2016), shows that financial repression can be optimal if governments cannot commit to repay
their debt. These authors show that the government finds it optimal to force banks to hold
government debt during times in which its fiscal needs are unusually high. Their argument
can explain the increase in government bond holdings of Turkish banks during a series of
external shocks in 1990s (e.g. Russian crisis) that led to an increase in the fiscal need of
Turkish government. This is exactly why we use the unanticipated fiscal shock (earthquake)
to identify the balance sheet effect during an era of financial repression since government
cannot undertake “additional” financial repression anticipating its’ future fiscal need via
the earthquake. Our identification centers on a tight window of two months following the
earthquake and falls short of using the whole quarter since then there is enough time that
government can put extra pressure on banks.

       There might also be unobserved bank characteristics that are correlated with bond hold-
ings and these unobserved characteristics might affect bank performance upon the realization
of any fiscal shock even the shock is unanticipated. To the extent that such characteristics
are not varying over time, such as being a state owned bank or a small poorly capitalized
bank, our bank-fixed effects framework will absorb them.6 The time-varying characteristics,
   5
      See Broner Fernando and Ventura (2010) and Acharya and Steffen (2015). Using data from Bankscope
on emerging market banks and defaults, Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi (2014a) find support for government
bonds providing liquidity, while Acharya and Steffen (2015) show support for a carry trade behavior of banks
of different sovereigns in the European context. Angelini, Grande, and Panetta (2014) argue that, in the case
of Italy, there was no build up in advance or during the period where spreads have risen on Italian bonds.
There has been a growing literature on repatriation of public debt back home with heightened sovereign risk,
meaning banks holding their own sovereign’s debt (bank home-bias), in the light of the recent European
crisis. See Brutti and Sauré (2013).
    6
      Buch, Koetter, and Ohls (2013) show substantial heterogeneity in the sovereign bond holdings of German
banks that can be explained by fixed bank characteristics (slow moving) such as being large and/or poorly
capitalized.


                                                     7
such as cash holdings and interbank balances, we control for explicitly. We also show that
the characteristics that determine government bond holdings do not have any differential
affect on government bond holdings before and after the earthquake. This exercise shows
that even banks with low capital ratios hold more government debt, they did not increase
their holdings in anticipation of the earthquake or during earthquake, as expected given the
unanticipated nature of the earthquake. As long as there are no systematic differential prior
trends in our key outcome variables by high and low exposure banks pre-earthquake, our
identification strategy will be valid. To verify this, we run placebo regressions with several
fake earthquake dates, showing no prior trend difference in loan supply by high and low
exposure banks.

    We proceed as follows. Section I presents a brief review of the literature. Section II
discusses the economic background of Turkey. Section III presents a conceptual framework.
Section IV lays out the identification methodology. Section V presents the data. Section VI
undertakes the empirical analysis and Section VII concludes.



I    Related Literature

We contribute to the broad literature that relates the sovereign debt crises to private sector
access to credit. Arteta and Hale (2008), for example, find evidence of a decline in foreign
credit over the period between 1984 and 2004 for 30 emerging markets in the aftermath of a
sovereign debt crisis that these countries experienced. Borensztein and Panizza (2009) finds
that probability of a banking crisis conditional on a sovereign default is much higher then
the unconditional probability, whereas probability of default conditional on banking crisis
is only slightly higher. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) finds the opposite result that banking
crises are the most significant predictors of defaults.

    Our paper is specifically on the transfer of fiscal stress to real sector via the financial
sector. The existing literature focuses on the rise in sovereign spreads and/or actual defaults
as the sovereign shock. An increase in sovereign spreads and the higher correlation between

                                               8
sovereign CDS spreads and bank CDS spreads can be driven by other factors, which also
drive bank fragility. As sovereign bonds yields raise and sovereign ratings deteriorate, cost of
borrowing increases for banks as the value of key collateral, i.e. the sovereign bonds, drops.
If the initial rise in spreads is not exogenous, in terms of anticipation and correlation to bank
fragility, it will be hard to disentangle transmission from sovereign bond markets to banks’
balance sheet health and their ability to supply credit.

   There are other papers that also focus on the balance sheet channel. Bofondi and Sette
(2013) and Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi (2014a). Both papers look at the effect of sovereign
debt crises/defaults on lending to real sector. Bofondi and Sette (2013) interpret their
finding on reduced credit supply as a “lender-of-last-resort” shock, since they do not find
any differential results based on bank characteristics but rather they find a country effect.
Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi (2014a), on the other hand, find that banks who hold more
government bonds during normal times for liquidity reasons cut lending more during defaults.
Using data from a wide array of past emerging market sovereign defaults, Gennaioli, Martin,
and Rossi (2014b) shows a negative relation between bank lending and holdings of sovereign
bonds during default episodes.

   In the European context, Popov and Van Horen (2015) and De Marco (2014) show that
after the start of the euro area sovereign debt crisis, banks from non-stressed countries with
sizeable exposures to stressed sovereign debt reduced their syndicated lending more than
non-exposed banks. Acharya, Eisert, Eufinger, and Hirsch (2015) combine syndicated loan
data with company-level data, to investigate the real effects of the loan supply contraction
triggered by the sovereign crisis. These studies in general uses limited EBA stress test data
for banks’ sovereign exposures. Altavilla, Pagano, and Simonelli (2015), uses confidential
ECB monthly exposure data for a longer time span and also finds a sizeable balance sheet
effect for banks who were exposed more to sovereign risk.

   Our paper is different from all the above papers, not only because we have regulatory
filings of banks’ sovereign exposure data for a long period of time for Turkey, but mainly
because we have an exogenous increase in sovereign risk, where all of the empirical papers in

                                               9
the literature undertakes their analysis in the middle of the sovereign debt crisis. Hence our
paper provides causal evidence on the balance sheet channel and shows that the mechanism
goes through balance sheet health to explain how banks with higher exposures to government
debt reduce their credit supply during times of fiscal stress.



II      Country Background

A series of events in 1990s, such as Asian Crises and Russian Crises, led to an increase in
public sector borrowing requirement in Turkey. Figure 1(a) plots the public sector borrowing
requirement which is akin to consolidated budget deficit. In the light of growing interest
liabilities, primary budget records a surplus as an attempt to keep fiscal situation sustainable.
As shown in Figure 1(b), domestic debt was the culprit for high debt/GDP ratio during this
period, while external debt was more manageable.

     While Asian Crisis in 1997Q3 constituted the first shock to Turkish banks that borrow
internationally, the major shock was observed in 1998Q3 when Russia devalued its currency
and defaulted on its debt. During this period, the banking sector’s portfolios gradually
shifted towards the domestic government debt. The changes in the government’s financing
needs and the increase in the return on holding government debt made the domestic gov-
ernment debt instruments attractive for the banking sector. As a result, Turkish banking
sector’s government bond and bill holdings as a ratio of total credit extended to non-financial
sector doubled within two years, as shown in Figure 2 that plots this ratio for the average
bank.

     Figure 3 plots the share of government securities in bank’s total assets for the average
bank and for the aggregate, where the aggregate behavior is driven by the large banks. It
is clear that there is no significant difference between large banks and small banks until the
2001 crisis, where in the eve of this crisis, both increased their exposure—large banks much
more so—to government debt, consistent with moral hazard stories as in Acharya and Steffen
(2015). As shown in Figures 14(a) and 14(b) (online appendix), there seems to be more of

an increase in holdings of government debt for the very large banks, which increased their
exposure right up until the 2001 crisis.

      The tipping point for the sustainability of the Turkish government’s debt has occurred in
August 1999, when the Turkey was hit by one of the largest earthquakes in world history in
terms of the number of causalities and as well as the economic cost. The event increased the
concerns on the debt sustainability and paved way to a Stand-By agreement with IMF. As
shown in Table I, the borrowing cost for government and default risk has increased sharply
as a result of the earthquake. Table shows approximately a 10 percentage point increase in
3 month coupon yields of floating T-bills after the earthquake, Table also shows the EMBI+
spread increased 100 basis points over a 3 month period after the earthquake. The rise of
100 basis points is maybe small in an emerging market context but not in general: Italian
spreads have increased 200 basis point between July and September 2011, which is the most
elevated point of sovereign risk.

      Figure 4 plots percentage point spread of 3-month Turkish Treasury Bill over the US
Treasury Bill, again showing almost half of the rise in spread during the 2001 crisis was
observed during the earthquake. Figure 5 shows an increase from 20 to 50 percent in the
share of short term borrowing in total borrowing of government after the earthquake. Notice
that this share gets close to 100 in the wake of the 2001 crisis, as typical in EM crisis.

      The 1999 Marmara earthquake played a crucial role for the perceptions on the sustain-
ability of the public debt. The earthquake brought about a total cost estimated to be around
20 billion USD, i.e. roughly 11 percent of the GDP at year 2000 current prices. These costs
consist of infrastructure expenditures, tax revenue losses, production losses and the contin-
gent liabilities resulting for the government.7 High government debt exposure of the banking
sector was accompanied with almost non-existent corporate bond market and equity market
exposure implied limited diversification.

fication strategy, was whether it led to significant changes in the non-performing loans in
the region. According to CBRT, the estimated credit risk to the total banking sector in
the earthquake region for 1999 was 1.5 billion USD, of which about 60 percent were private
bank credits and 40 percent were public bank credits. Despite the perceptions of increased
default probabilities and the credit rescheduling needs in the region, the total amount of
rescheduling as of August 2000 was only 26 million USD in the earthquake region, i.e. only
the 1.6 percent of initial estimate of the perceived risk for the earthquake region. In other
words, there was no evidence of wide spread defaults in the region and neither a region wide
or country wide recession during this period as shown in Figure 15 (online appendix), where
recession periods are shaded which are outside the period of earthquake.

   On December 9, 1999, the Government and the CBRT announced the program aiming
at reducing inflation and restoring the fiscal balance, which involved a 36-month Stand-
By agreement with the IMF. Relative to the pre-program period, the Stand-By Program
brought about a rapid decline in inflation and interest rates, and a significant improvement
in the primary fiscal surplus, leading to a lower ratio of debt to GDP and public sector
borrowing requirement. On the other hand, the weaknesses in the banking system and the
political uncertainties undermining the credibility of the structural reform agenda brought
about concerns on the sustainability of the program in 2000Q4. The official collapse of the
Stand-By Program, triggered by a political crises, took place in February 2001, resulting
in the free-float of Turkish lira after a sharp devaluation as well as a rapid surge in the
inflation rates, nominal interest rates on government debt and one of the largest contraction
episodes in the economic activity in Turkey. This also resulted in a substantial financial
crises associated with a collapse of a number of private banks.



III     Conceptual Framework

We will adopt a multi-period version of the two-period model of bank lending by Khwaja
and Mian (2008). In period t, bank i’s lending is Lit . The bank funds itself via deposits,


                                             15
Dit and also via other instruments such as bonds, Bit , with a marginal cost of αB . Deposits
until an amount D¯it are costless. Bank has a marginal return on loan given by r − αL Lit .
This captures increasing monitoring costs with each loan. r is the fixed interest rate. Hence
the bank’s balance sheet is given by Dit + Bit = Lit .

   In the next period, bank faces a deposit supply shock and a credit demand shock. Hence
deposits in the next period are:


                                      Dit+1 = Dit + δ̄ + δi                               (1)


where δ̄ represents a common shock to all banks and δi represents a bank-specific supply
shock. The credit demand shock will affect the marginal return on loan as:


                  marginal return on loans in t + 1 = r − αL Lit + η̄ + ηij               (2)


where η̄ represents a common shock to all demand and ηij represents a bank-specific demand
shock from its customer j.

   Using the equilibrium conditions and subtracting FOCs in two adjacent periods, we have:



                                   −αB ∆Bi = αL ∆Li − η̄ − ηij                            (3)


   Rearraging terms, we obtain:

                                  αB                1
                        ∆Li =           δ̄ + δi +         (η̄ + ηij )                     (4)
                                αB + αL           αB + αL

Which can be re-grouped into economy-wide shocks and idiosyncratic shocks:

                                1                   1
                     ∆Li =           αB δ̄ + η̄ +         (αB δi + ηij )                  (5)
                             αB + αL              αB + αL




                                               16
Or alternatively:
                                    1           αB             1
                         ∆Li =           η̄ +         ∆Di +         ηij                    (6)
                                 αL + αB      αL + αB       αL + αB

   In a multi period version we can write the above equation as:


                            1           αB             1              1
                 Lit =           η̄ +         Dit +         ηijt +         αi              (7)
                         αL + αB      αL + αB       αL + αB        αL + αB

   The first term represents common shocks for all banks, such as the aggregate macroe-
conomic shocks, and hence can be captured in the empirical analysis by a time fixed effect.
The second term is idiosyncratic to the bank and time varying in a multi-period setting. The
interpretation of this term is a bank specific change to net worth or deposits. Third term
is bank specific demand effect from customer j, which can also vary across time and finally
last term is a bank fixed effect.



IV      Identification and Measurement

Based on the above framework, we estimate the equation below:




                    Lit = αi + λt + ωiq + β1 Gov Debt Expit−1

                         + β2 Earthquaket × GovDebtExpit−1 + β3 Xit−1 + it                (8)


where i is bank, t is month and αi and λt stand for bank-fixed effects and month-fixed effects,
which control for the time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across banks and all common
shocks to the banks (including direct effect of the earthquake), respectively. ωiq controls for
loan demand (ηijt in the above framework), where q stands for quarter.

   We do not have loan level data and hence we do not have customer j level variation.
We argue that we can capture the first order effect of bank specific customer demand ηijt

        Figure 6: Fraction of Banks Reporting a 25 Percent Change in Credit Demand


by ωiq . Our reasoning for this control is based on the loan officer survey data provided by
CBRT. Each bank undertakes such a survey since 2005 that suggests that firms’ demand
for loans move very slowly as shown in Figure 6. We assume that this was also the case
during the earthquake period. Our assumption is supported by the fact that the firm-bank
relationships in general have a very sticky nature even the US that has developed financial
markets.8 Hence, given the monthly nature of our bank level data, the bank-quarter fixed
effects will absorb slow moving firm-bank specific demand.

      The outcome of interest, Lit , is banks’ lending. We measure the loan supply with credit
provision normalized by assets, that is, share of credit to non-financial firms in total assets.
We measure the government debt exposure, Gov Debt Expit−1 , by ratio of banks’ government
security holdings to total banks’ assets. As explained above, β2 gives us how the outcomes of
banks with low and high exposure to government debt differ before and after the exogenous
shock. In order to assure that we do not capture the effects of other events that might have

affected the sustainability of the government debt differentially, we also control interactions
of government debt with the other major events that happened before and after the 1999
Marmara Earthquake, such as Asia Crises, Russia Crisis, Stand-by agreement, and 2001
crisis. The direct effects of these events are absorbed by the month fixed effects.9 We use
Gov Debt Expit−1 , lagged 1 month, 2 month and 3 months to check robustness of our results
since we will define the “Earthquake” period with a dummy equals to 1 for August-November
1999. Other bank-time varying factors are included in X.



V        Data and Descriptive Statistics

We use administrative monthly bank balance sheet data from Turkey for 1997–2012 period.
This data is collected regularly as part of the Monitoring Package, which is the data collection
and processing system for monitoring and regulation purposes. All the banks operating
within Turkey are obliged with reporting their balance sheets as well as extra items by
the end of month to the regulatory and supervisory authorities, such as the CBRT and
the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). We also use the extra reporting
of the banks, such as the decomposition of the banks’ securities portfolio including the
information on which particular securities are held by banks by the end of each month, net
positions against domestic and foreign creditors and the currency denomination of assets
and liabilities through interbank operations.

      The banks in our sample are all banks operating within Turkey, regardless of the owner-
ship status or the classification with respect to the main activity-such as deposits banks or
investment banks.

      In terms of bank entry and exit, the Turkish banking industry has experienced important
variations over time as shown in Figure 7. While there were 49 banks (6 of which being state-

    We define the crises and other dummies as follows. The Asian crisis is a binary variable equal to 1
between July 1997–December 1997. The Russian crisis is a binary variable equal to 1 between August 1998–
January 1999. The earthquake is a binary variable equal to 1 between August 1999–November 1999. The

owned deposit/savings banks) in 1986, the number of banks reached 82 (4 of which being
state-owned deposit/savings banks) by the end of 1999. However, in 1999–2003 period, the
number of banks has declined substantially due to the series of events including the financial
crisis in 2000–2001 period. In particular, if the regulatory agency observes a private bank
to experience a decline in its capital adequacy ratio resulting from losses due its operations,
then the bank is asked to add new capital and to improve the balance sheet quality. However,
if the bank fails to take necessary actions and bank’s capital adequacy ratio falls below the
legal limit, then its control is taken over by SDIF to provide immunity to the depositors
as well as to limit the risks to the banking system. In the aftermath of the 2001 crises,
the weak capital structure of the Turkish banks resulted in a number of takeovers. As a
result, in 2000–2004 period, a total of 25 banks were taken over by SDIF. Also, a number of
mergers and acquisitions resulted in a decline in the number of private banks in Turkey in
the post-crises period, resulting in a total of 45 banks operating in Turkey as of end of 2011.

   Table II presents the key descriptive statistics of our banks. We observe a significant

cross-sectional heterogeneity with respect to holdings of government securities in banks’
balance sheets, where mean is around 18-20 percent depending on the period and it can be
as high as 46 percent.10 Table III presents key macro indicators.



VI         Empirical Analysis

Figure 8 presents aggregate data, plotting credits to non-financial sector as a ratio to total
assets of the financial sector, where this ratio falls to 22 percent from approximately 36
percent during the events starting with Asian crisis. This figure mimics our previous Figure
2 where we show typical bank also decreases credit to non-financial sector during this period,
increasing loans to government sector by similar amounts. Our analysis below recovers that
during this period where credit to private sector declined as a resulting of a crowding out
effect coming from government borrowing, there is an additional effect of an unanticipated
fiscal shock. The banks who were exposed more to government debt and hence affected
more from this shock, decreased their lending to private sector even more. We interpret this
finding as the evidence for the balance sheet channel.

       Another important observation for our identification is the fact that there was no visible
change in government bond holdings post earthquake. Table IV present the average ratios
for government securities to assets and loans to assets before and after the earthquake. It
is clear that average exposure to public debt stayed around the same but average credit
provision declined.

We identify how banks’ performance in terms of net worth and profits and their credit
provision are affected from government debt exposure by comparing banks with different

    For a world-wide sample of banks, the average for government debt holdings to assets is 12 percent and
for German banks it is 15 percent. See Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi (2014a) and Buch, Koetter, and Ohls
(2013), respectively.

         Figure 8: Lending to Private Sector as a Ratio of Financial Sector Assets


degrees of exposure before and after the earthquake, which was a sizable and unanticipated
fiscal shock experienced in Turkish economy.

   Table V runs a simple cross sectional regression by collapsing the sample in two periods
as pre- and post-earthquake to highlight the intuition of the exercise. Loans to the private
sector as a ratio to total assets for each bank are averaged over the period from August 1999
to November 1999. Similarly government bond holdings as a ratio to total assets for each
bank are also averaged over the period from January 1997 to July 1999. This simple cross
sectional regression shows a clear reduction in loan supply after the earthquake by the banks
who have higher exposure to government bond market before the earthquake. This effect is
robust to excluding state owned banks and foreign owned banks as shown in columns (2)
and (3) and also robust to excluding both type banks as shown in column (4).

   The coefficient varies between −0.4 and −0.6, getting stronger when state and foreign
owned banks are dropped from the sample. This of course can be due to variety of selection
issues in a cross sectional regression of this sort. In fact, given the cross sectional nature of


                                                       22
this exercise, one cannot tell whether the effect is driven by unobserved time-invarying bank
characteristics, the inherent negative relation between the loans to government and loans to
private sector, that is the crowding out nature of lending to government. We also cannot tell
whether our channel, i.e., the balance sheet effect, works via the lower value of government
bonds as a result of increased spreads reducing banks’ net worth. In fact the estimated
coefficient is very high since this estimate probably includes all these effects: A coefficient
of -0.6 suggests that a bank who holds 20 percent of its portfolio in government assets (the
mean), reduces credit supply defined as loan to asset a mere 12 percentage points, which
represents a 60 percent decline in the loan to asset ratio relative to its mean value.

   Next, in Table VI, in order to control unobserved time-invarying bank characteristics and
also shocks to all the banking system, we run a differences-in-differences specification with
bank and month fixed effects, where we keep the bond holdings constant at their level in the
month of July 1999, one month prior to the earthquake. Given the bank fixed effects, the
non time-varying nature of bond holdings will not allow us to estimate their direct average
impact but we can estimate their impact after the earthquake, as shown by the interaction
term with an “Earthquake” dummy. This dummy takes a value of one from August 1999 to
November 1999, and zero otherwise. Table VI shows that there is a strong negative effect
of government debt holdings of pre-earthquake, on credit provision post-earthquake. An
estimated coefficient of −0.2 implies a 4 percentage point reduction in loan to asset ratio,
which represents a 20 percent decline in this ratio relative to its mean.

   Columns (2) and (3) add interaction terms of bond holdings as of July 1999 with Asian
crisis and Russian crisis dummies to make sure our “Earthquake” dummy does not proxy
effects of these events that took place earlier. “Asia” is a dummy that takes a value of one
from July 1997 to October 1997. “Russia” is a dummy that takes a value of one from August
1998 to November 1998. The “Earthquake” dummy effect is robust to these other events.
However these other events, though they are not domestic events, also have a negative effect
on the loan provision of banks who hold high levels of government debt in July 1999. These
events happened before and will not have a direct impact on the value of the domestic debt.


                                              23
Hence they must be proxying for the general crowding out effect, that is the tendency to
have less and less private sector loan provision with more and more lending to government
over time due to an increase in the fiscal needs of the government as a result of these external
shocks.

   In order to deal with this concern, Table VII runs a full panel differences-in-differences
specification. This specification allows us to control the direct crowding out effect over time
by entering time varying bond holdings into the regression. We introduce other events and
their interactions with lagged government bond holdings in addition to earthquake, such as
Asian crises, Russian Crises, and the 2001 crises as controls for exploring the differential loan
supply effect of fiscal shock induced by the earthquake with respect to banks’ government
debt exposure. Regardless of whether we control for these events or not, we observe that the
banks with higher exposure to the treasury bills faced higher declines in loan supply after
the earthquake.

   The effect of bond holdings during other events is very intuitive. As conjectured, now
there is no significant impact of pre Asian crisis bond holdings during Asia crisis, as opposed
to the previous tables since we control the direct effect of bond holdings. We obtain the
same result with Russian crisis. These events are external shocks and although they had
an effect on Turkish economy, and even on the spreads to a certain extent via contagion
fears, they should not have a differential effect on the balance sheet of banks holding high
or low levels of Turkish bonds since these events do not constitute a direct fiscal shock
to Turkish government’s ability to pay its’ debt. By the same token we should expect to
see a large negative effect for Turkey’s own banking, currency, and sovereign debt crisis of
2001. Columns (5) and (6) introduces a “2001” crisis dummy that takes a value of one
from December 2000 to December 2001. These columns show a similar negative effect of
holding government bonds during the 2001 crisis, where the estimated coefficient is bigger
than that of the “Earthquake” dummy interaction, as expected. These columns will be a
typical representation of the regression that is run in the literature as we argued above (both
historical emerging market sovereign debt crisis and recent European sovereign debt crisis),


                                               24
where the crisis is endogenous. Although both the “Earthquake” period and “2001” Turkish
crisis period constitute fiscal shocks and cause a decline in the value of government bonds
with the heightened sovereign risk, the earthquake allows us to estimate the causal impact
given the exogenous and unanticipated nature of this event.

   The last three columns of Table VII control for bank specific demand with bank-quarter
effects. As argued above, these effects can capture bank specific demand that moves slower,
from quarter to quarter and hence if a certain banks clientele is specifically located in the
earthquake region, these effects will capture such clients lower demand during the last quarter
of 1999. We can still identify the balance sheet effect thanks to the monthly data where the
value of the bonds will be marked down and affect the banks’ balance sheets quicker than the
changes in demand. Of course, bank-quarter fixed effects make the specification extremely
restrictive, absorbing a lot of variation, which is why the estimated coefficients are now much
smaller.

   The first five columns Table VII define the earthquake period as August-November 1999,
whereas column (6) defines it as August-October 1999. The main reason for this alternative
definition of the earthquake is that the government unexpectedly imposed a tax on banks’
income on government securities holdings on November 26, 1999 to cover the fiscal burden
due to the earthquake. This naturally raises the question of whether our results hold even
when we disregard this direct tax implication of the earthquake on banks’ balance sheets.
Hence we define the “Earthquake” dummy in the last column to make sure the tax imposed
afterwards.

   Our estimates imply that, a bank with the mean holdings, that is 20 percent of its
assets are in government bonds decreases credit provision almost 1 percentage point during
earthquake. If we add the regular time crowding out effect, the total effect of bond holdings
for the bank with the mean holdings becomes 1.5 percentage point. These are much smaller
magnitudes than before but given the fact that they are conditional on controlling demand
effects and they are still sizeable representing a 5 percent decline in loan to assets relative to
the mean. If we focus on a bank at the 90th percentile, who holds almost half of its assets

                                               25
in government bonds, then the total effect of holdings becomes 2.5 percentage point. The
actual decline in loan provision is 3 percentage points.11


A.1       Non-Random Nature of Bond Holdings

Government bond holdings are not random. Certain banks, like small in size, might hold
more government bonds. In this section, we try to understand both the time in-varying
and time variant determinants of government bond holdings. As show in Table VIII most
determinants of government bond holdings are time invarying such as being a state bank,
as shown in column (1). Columns (2) and (3) absorb these time in-varying determinants by
using bank fixed effects and column (3) does double clustering for standard errors both at
bank and month level to allow for serial correlation. Column (3) still shows that banks who
increase their capital ratio over time hold less government bonds in their portfolio over time.
Same is true for interbank balances since banks who accumulate higher surpluses on their
interbank balances need less government bond holdings as collateral. Banks who accumulate
more non performing loans over time also tend to accumulate less government bond holdings
over time, which must be due to the fact that these banks lend more to private sector. Banks
with more cash also decrease their government holdings over time.

       Of course what is important for our identification is whether these determinants of gov-
ernment bond holdings at bank-time level vary systematically at the time of earthquake.
Table IX investigates this possibility. As shown in column (2), once we account for all the
fixed effects, banks with higher cash holdings than average are the only ones who increase
their government holdings at the time of earthquake. This can be associated with risk tak-
ing behavior but also with supplying government with the needed funds since these are the
stronger banks. Nevertheless we will control for cash holdings at the time of earthquake
below for robustness when we investigate the effect of government bond holdings on private
sector credit provision. It is clear from this table that, there are no “usual-suspect” deter-
  11
     Note that in theory there can be yet another differential effect depending on the maturity structure but
all the bonds are less than 14 month maturity in our data given the specifics of that period where Turkish
government can only borrow short term both externally and domestically.


                                                     26
minant of bond holdings that change over the “Earthquake” period that can explain our
results due to an omitted variable bias.

       To make sure, in Table X, we control for all of these potential determinants of government
bond holdings that may be correlated with loan provision at regular times and at crisis times.
Although we know that the most important determinant of government bond holdings during
earthquake is cash holdings, we still control each determinant one by one in respective
columns. In this table we also use banks that are not taken over by State Deposit Insurance
Fund (SDIF) to make sure we guard against the claim that “bad bank will fail anyway.”
This exercise is important especially if there are concerns about the unobserved confounding
features of the banks taken over by the SDIF, which would affect these banks’ performance
even in the absence of a fiscal shock. Although most of these factors will be taken care for
by bank fixed effects and bank-quarter effects, we still run our regressions in a sample of
surviving banks throughout the sample period in order not to bias our results.12 In this table
we show that this is not the case. In fact upon using survivors and controlling for bank-time
level determinants, we still find the same size coefficient as in our benchmark table.

       A surprising result from Table X is the fact that non-performing loans seem to have
no effect. This is due to the fact that neither on aggregate nor at the average level, non-
performing loans were increasing during the earthquake period; on the contrary, they were
on a decline as shown below in Figures 9 and 10 respectively.



B        Channel: Valuation and Net Worth Effect

We argue that the channel from the earthquake driven rise in spreads to reduced private
sector loan provision goes via the balance sheet deterioration of banks. The banks whose
balance sheets were exposed to government debt in large quantities before the earthquake,
suffer from a balance sheet shock after the earthquake, due to a lower value of this asset on
  12
    Only 8 banks are taken over in 1999, so this is not likely to affect our results. Note that if the claim,
“bad banks will fail anyway,” is true and we fail to control for this then a diff-in-diff strategy should not give
us any result since this strategy identifies off of the relative difference between bad and good banks at the
time of the earthquake.

their balance sheet, that cause their net worth to go down.

       To provide evidence on the channel, Table XI investigates the impact of the earthquake
on banks’ balance sheet performance by first considering the banks’ financial asset valuation
changes between current and previous period as a ratio to their total assets (column (1)).
Next column investigates the effect on bank net worth and final column on profits. In
practice, the banks have to revaluate the value of their portfolio as the prices change since
they do not mark their portfolio to market (during our period of study).13 For the banks
which hold the same government security portfolio both at time t and t-1, an increase (a
decrease) in the price of the government security induces a revaluation indicating an increase
(a decrease) in portfolio’s monetary value. We find that the banks with higher share of
government securities in their balance sheets had a decline in the value of portfolio, given
the decline in the value of this asset with the fiscal shock, as shown in column (1). This
evidence is unique and shows first time the direct effect of a decline in the collateral value
on bank’s balance sheet.

       Columns (2) and (3) show that the same shock also constitutes a direct hit to banks
net worth and profits for those banks who had higher holdings of government securities
before the shock. Although there is a direct negative effect of government bond holdings on
valuation and profits (which captures the general trend), this is not the case for net worth
as shown in column (2). Hence, it is not necessarily the case that in the absence of the fiscal
shock, banks who accumulate more government bonds over time, have declining net worths;
these banks do not differ systematically from the banks who reduced their government bond
holdings over time in terms of their net worth. However, after the earthquake, the banks who
accumulated more before, suffer a bigger decline in their net worth. This is direct evidence
for our channel.

       In terms of magnitudes, we find that a bank in 90th percentile who holds almost half
of its portfolio in government securities, suffers a 2 percentage point loss to the value of its
  13
    Notice that the rule of keeping the sovereign bonds in the trading book and marking them to the market
value, was introduced to Turkish banks after December 2002 regulation for the banks’ accounting standards.

portfolio as a ratio to its assets and a 3 percentage loss in its’ networth as a share to its
assets. For this high exposure bank, profits to assets go down by 1 percentage point. These
are significant effects relative to the mean values of these variables.



C     Threats to Identification

C.1    Placebo Tests

Table XII, column (1) runs placebo tests, where we define a “Placebo Earthquake” as a binary
variable equal to 1 between April 1999 and July 1999. Despite the existence of a negative
relation between high government debt exposure and lending in normal times, there is no
additional effect at the time of our pseudo earthquake. This suggests that the effects we
find with the earthquake are a result of increased default risk on the part of government
which deteriorated the balance sheet health of banks with high ex-ante exposure and hence
negatively affected their lending.

    The second column of this table uses the shorter sample until the end of 2002 showing
that our results stay intact, though here we obtain a larger coefficient given less time series
observations that prevent us from using bank-quarter fixed effects.

    Table XIII undertakes an alternative placebo analysis to hedge against the negative
demand effect by the firms who were affected from the earthquake iff these firms happen
to be borrowing from the banks with higher ex-ante government holdings. We matched
the foreign banks (there were 14 of them at the time) operating in Turkey to their balance
sheets in Bankscope database and subtract their lending in Turkey from their lending in
the region (Eastern Europe), obtaining their lending outside Turkey. The bankscope data
is annual/quarterly depending on the foreign bank’s filing and our data is monthly so we
do a linear interpolation for the missing months. Since this lending will not be affected at
all by the earthquake in Turkey, this provides smoking gun evidence that these banks are
also affected by their Turkish bond holdings after these bonds lost their value as a result
of the fiscal shock. The difference between the two columns is that, in the second column,

                                               30
we also control for their lending in Turkey. Their lending in Turkey and outside Turkey is
positively related and these foreign banks do not show the regular time crowding out effect
as a result of government bond holdings as the domestic banks. But they still provide less
loans outside Turkey after the earthquake if they were exposed to Turkish government bond
market relatively more before the earthquake. The magnitude of the coefficient is smaller
than our benchmark estimate of 0.03 but not that much.


C.2    Prior Trends in Outcomes

A key threat to identification is existence of differential prior trends in our dependent variable.
In particular, in order to attribute the corresponding changes in lending to the role of the
differences in government debt exposure at the time of the exogenous fiscal shock, one of
the issues that we need to check is the parallel movement of the outcome variables for the
banks with high and low government debt exposure. The placebo exercise we showed earlier
confirms that this is not the case but we still show here the actual trends in the data.

Figure 13: Loan Provision of Banks with High-Low Exposure to Government Bond Market


                                                                                                                                                                                32
    In Figure 11, 12 and 13, we present respectively the time series behavior of the net
worth, profits and the loan provision of banks with above and below median exposure to the
government debt. These clearly indicate that there were no differential prior trends in our
key outcome variables, loan provision, net worth, and profits, across high and low government
debt exposure banks. In other words, the estimated negative and significant coefficient on
the interaction between the government debt exposure and the earthquake variable does not
reflect the already existing deterioration in profits, net worth and loan provision of the banks
with higher exposure, but rather the impact of the earthquake on the banks’ balance sheet
performance and the loan provision.



D     IV Regressions for Spreads

In this section, we run IV regressions to link the increase in spreads to our exogenous shock,
that is the earthquake. The spreads are measured as shown in Figure 6 by the CBRT Auction
data compound rate in short term T-bills, minus the US T-Bill rate taken from the IMF.

    In the first stage regression, as shown in Table XIV we regress “government bonds×spreads”
on “government bonds×earthquake” and use the residuals in the second stage regression of
loan to assets, as shown in Table XIV. The first stage regression is very strong, especially
when bank-quarter fixed effects are added in second column in its predictive power. The
second stage regression gives a strong negative effect of instrumented “holdings×spread” on
credit supply.

    In terms of the magnitudes, a 100 basis point spread implies a 1.6 percentage point
decline in loan to asset ratio for a bank who has the mean level of government bond holdings
ex-ante. This amount is 55 percent of the actual decline in loan to asset ratio during this
period.

    Overall, we show the strong positive effect of an exogenous fiscal shock on spreads and
the strong negative effect of the same shock on loan provision, driven by banks who had
higher ex-ante exposures to these bonds, which became toxic after the shock. Banks’ net


                                              33
worth and profits got hurt as a result of the shock and hence their credit provision have
declined.



VII          Conclusion

We identify the effect of government debt on banks’ balance sheet health and credit provision.
We use data from the universe of banks in Turkey during 1997–2012. For identification, we
use a rare disaster, the 1999 Marmara Earthquake—one of the largest earthquakes in world
history, as a major unanticipated fiscal shock. Using a differences-in-differences methodology,
we investigate whether the differences in the degree of banks’ exposure to the government
debt matter for the effect of fiscal shock on differences in outcomes, such us banks’ balance
sheet health and loan provision.

      Our results indicate that high government debt exposure resulted in a differential decline
in the credit provision. We show that the negative differential effect of fiscal shock on the
credit provision of the banks with higher government debt exposure works via the balance
sheet channel. We trace the effect of earthquake to a 100 basis point increase in spreads and
that to a decline in loan provision through the decline in banks’ net worth for the banks who
had higher exposure to government bond market before the fiscal shock.

      Our results provide evidence on the link between fiscal distress and financial imbalances,
where the causality goes from fiscal to financial stress impacting the real sector.14 Using
an exogenous rare event which triggered a fiscal shock and an increase in sovereign risk, we
identify that the fiscal imbalances has important causal implications for the performance of
the financial sector and credit provision. Although our identification is clear, valid and policy
relevant, it works only for the link from the government debt to banks’ balance sheet health
and loan provision. Hence, the caveat is that we cannot say anything for the predictive
power of banking crisis on sovereign defaults, which is equally important.
