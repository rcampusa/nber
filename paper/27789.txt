In this study, we investigate what are the factors of the promotion of female and male scientists at
the French Institute of Physics (INP) at CNRS, one of the largest European public research
organizations. We construct a long panel of INP physicists combining various data sources on
their research activities and career. Using event history analysis, we find that female and male
physicists have the same rate of promotion from junior to senior positions when controlling for
research productivity and a variety of other promotion factors. Our results also suggest that
promotion factors such as family characteristics, mentoring, professional network, research
responsibilities have different impacts on female and male researchers.

1. Introduction
       In this study, we investigate what are the factors of promotion of female and male scientists,

trying to understand whether and why "many women are deterred from pursuing a career in science

at the highest level," as claimed in a Nature's editorial (Nature Editorial [2013]). We consider one

of the largest European public research organizations, the French National Center for Scientific

Research (CNRS). CNRS is an ideal setting for studying gender disparity in the promotion since

researchers are ranked on a promotion scale, based on criteria well-defined and publicly available.

       Our study is conducted on a panel data sample of researchers working at the Institute of

Physics (INP), the Institute of CNRS specialized in the field of physics. For the institute, we were

able to combine administrative and bibliometric data, as well as specific information gathered from

an online survey. Based on these data and relying on event history analysis, we analyze promotions

from the entry positions or ranks of junior researcher to the highest ones of senior researcher: in

French at CNRS from `Chargé de Recherche' to `Directeur de Recherche,' we shall denote (CR)

and (DR).

       In this setting, we present our analysis and its results in two steps. In the first step, we

follow the mainstream literature by investigating whether factors of promotion, direct and indirect,

such as research productivity and family characteristics, can account for differences in the

promotion rates of the female and male physicists of INP from CR to DR ranks. In addition to the

usual measure of research output, i.e., the number of publications and citations received, we also

consider complementary research activities such as mentoring, professional networking,

fundraising, technology transfer, and project management activities (as in Leahey [2007];

Weisshaar [2017], Pezzoni et al. [2016]). We have also considered family characteristics as in Fox

[2001], Ginther and Hayes [1999], and Long, Allison, and McGinnis [1993]. Those family



                                                 3
characteristics information has been retrieved in an online survey in which the authors inquiry the

INP researchers about the number and age of thir children (see Pezzoni, Mairesse and Visentin

[2019] for detailed information about the online survey). Controlling for all these factors, we find

that female and male physicists have the same rate of promotion from CR to DR ranks.

       In the second step of our analysis, we focus explicitly on assessing whether the variety of

factors of promotion investigated in the first step related to research output, complementary

activities, and family characteristics, counts differently for women and men. In particular, we find

that quantity and quality of scientific publications, and being head of a research team is equally

beneficial for the promotion of female and male physicists. Having a larger number of children is

beneficial for the promotion of male researchers, not female, and having less than three years old

child does not significantly affect the promotion of neither of them.

       Our study contributes to the empirical literature about promotion and gender disparity in

science in two ways. First, we have been able to construct a rich panel data sample that covers a

broad range of research activities besides the usual bibliometric productivity measures (McDowell,

Singell, and Ziliak [1999]). Second, our study focuses on a large European public research

organization, while most of the literature relates to universities in the USA. The closest

investigation to ours in terms of the data, general method, and issue is the work of Sabatier [2010]

on female and male promotion at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA).

       Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the empirical literature

of gender differences in promotion in science. Section 3 explains the organizational setting of our

study. Section 4 defines and describes in detail our data. Section 5 specifies our model and method

of analysis briefly. Section 6 presents our estimates of the gender impact on the probability of




                                                 4
being promoted and shows how promotion factors may affect differently female and male

scientists. Section 7 summarizes and concludes.




2. Literature overview
       In the early '40s, Robert Merton claimed that science should follow the norm of

universalism according to which all scientists are judged objectively regardless of their "personal

or social attributes" (Merton [1942]). If the norm applies to the promotion, highly-ranked positions

should be attributed to men and women on the base of their scientific productivity. However,

looking at recent statistics, it appears that female scientists tend to stay behind their male

colleagues. "In the United States and Europe, around half of those who gain doctoral degrees in

science and engineering are female ­ but barely one-fifth of full professors are women" (Nature

Editorial [2013]). These facts have urged many scholars to study whether and to which extent

observing few females in highly-ranked positions results from gender discrimination in promotion,

from differences in research productivity, or personal choices, and constraints (Sonnert, G., Holton

G.J. [1995]).

       Universities and public research organizations are an excellent setting for studies on gender

differences in the promotion since it is possible to construct direct measures of scientific

productivity in various dimensions. Studies focusing on one single research field as well as studies

extended to a broad set of fields have proliferated with sometimes divergent findings. For instance,

focusing on economists, McDowell et al. [1999] find that women have a lower probability than

men of being promoted from assistant to associate and from associate to full professor. Ginther

and Kahn [2004] find that women also need a longer time to be promoted. Similar results are found

by Weisshaar [2017] for the promotion to tenure in U.S. universities for assistant professors in

                                                  5
sociology, computer science, and English. Kaminski and Geisler [2012] obtain the opposite result.

Analyzing all fields of science and engineering in U.S. universities, they observe that men and

women have comparable rates of promotion.

       Most of the extant studies on promotion are based on productivity measures using standard

bibliometric indicators of research output: the number of publications and citations received by

scientists (Leahey [2007]). Few scholars like Weisshaar [2017] extend the set of research outputs

by including detailed information on research books, edited volumes, textbooks, book chapters,

and conference proceedings, as well as indications on scientists' fundraising activity (in particular

­ in the U.S. context - the number of grants and the total amount of funds received from the

National Science Foundation).

       Considering a comprehensive set of controls in analyzing promotion is crucial to avoid

biased estimations, since, as claimed by Stewart, Ornstein, and Drakich ([2009], 63), "observed

gender differences in promotion could reflect unmeasured differences between men and women

faculty." Sociological studies confirm, for instance, that female and men scientists tend to

distribute their time differently across academic activities. Usually, female scientists dedicate more

time than their male colleagues to administrative tasks and mentoring students (Mason, Wolfinger,

and Goulden [2013]).

       Looking at the personal characteristics, dimensions like family characteristics might have

a different impact on promotion for males and females. Extant studies seem to converge in finding

that women are penalized by family and parental responsibilities (Bentley and Adamson [2003]),

and evaluators might assume that women are losing commitment to work when they have a family

(Manchester, Leslie, and Kramer [2010]). For this reason, after having children, women feel higher

pressure than men to prove their productivity. Comparing women and men with children,



                                                  6
Wolfinger, Mason, and Goulden [2008] find that women have lower chances to get the tenure or

they get the tenure later. Policy instruments like the "stop the clock" policy, allowing pre-tenure

faculty to postpone their promotion review, seem to have limited effects on promotion rates

(Manchester et al. [2010]). Ginther and Kahn [2004] find that the rate of promotion is ten

percentage points lower for female scientists when they have young children, while it appears to

be higher for their male colleagues with young children. They ascribe this finding to stronger

engagements of women in time-consuming activities external to research, in particular motherhood

and young children care, and they also mention career interruptions when wives follow husbands'

moves of occupation. Similarly, Rudd et al. [2008] find that marriage decreases women's chance

to obtain academic tenure, contrary to men, in the fields of art history and humanities, two fields

with a high proportion of women.




3. Organizational setting
          Our study is conducted in the specific setting of the Centre National de la Recherche

Scientifique (CNRS), and precisely in the context of one of its ten institutes, the Institut National

de Physique (INP). CNRS is the largest governmental research organization in France and the

leading research agency dedicated to basic research in Europe. 1 CNRS, nowadays under the

umbrella of the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, was founded in

1939 with the mission to advance knowledge in the areas of science and technology. INP covers

the fields of theoretical physics, condensed matter, and optics and quantum physics. INP

    In fact, it is the largest one after CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in Switzerland.

researchers, technicians, and the permanent staff are recruited as civil servants, following general

national administrative rules.

           Mostly all researchers at CNRS are recruited through a competitive admission process in

which candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications and research experience. Candidates

are asked to submit a written application, including a curriculum vitae stating their scholarly

background, previous professional experiences, and the list of publications, together with a

research proposal indicating the domain and agenda they wish to pursue in the medium term. They

need to satisfy some minimum requirements, like holding a doctoral degree or equivalent degree,

but there are no nationality requirements. The selection is centralized in Paris, where shortlisted

candidates are interviewed by a committee of experts in the field.

           Permanent CNRS researchers are classified into two categories: Chargé de Recherche or

CR and Directeur de Recherche or DR. Each of these categories has two sub-categories CR2 and

CR1, and DR2 and DR1, respectively. The promotion from CR to DR, as well as within the two

sub-categories, is based on scientific activity and seniority. 2 In our analysis, we focus on the

promotion from CR to DR, primarily based on the assessment of scientific performance.

           As part of a nationwide effort to improve professional equality between women and men,

CNRS created in 2001 a "Mission pour la place des femmes." However, the share of female

scientists working at CNRS increased only by 3,9% in the last twenty years, from 30.1% in 1999

to 34.0% in 2018. Such a modest increase in the share of female working at CNRS would imply

that parity would only be reached in 2088. 3 In an effort to stimulate the movement towards gender

parity, in July 2018, a special "Comité parité et égalité" was created by the CNRS president.

          The proportion of female researchers in the two major ranks of CR and DR varies much in

the ten CNRS Institutes. Nowadays, women represent 37% of all CNRS CR and 27% of all CNRS

DR, respectively (Pepin, Vacherand, and Dumitrascu [2019]). In 2011, the female presence ranged

from a low share in mathematics and physics (17% and 21%) to a higher one in biology and human

and social sciences, where women represent nearly half of the active researchers (42% and 45%).




4. Data sources, variable construction, and descriptive statistics


Data sources
          To investigate the factors affecting the promotion rate of INP physicists to DR rank, we

gathered a variety of data sources. We relied on administrative information available from CNRS,

on bibliometric information mainly collected from Elsevier database Scopus, and on the answers

of INP physicists to an online survey we performed.

          We used the information obtained from the CNRS files to reconstruct the careers of INP

physicists. In particular, we record the researchers' dates of entry at CNRS as a CR and their dates

of promotion to DR. We relied on Scopus bibliometric database to extract their publication records.

We also constructed other research productivity indicators taking advantage of the following

public databases: the French repertory of national Ph.D. theses, the lists of research proposals to

ANR the French "Agence Nationale de la Recherche," the PATSTAT database provided by the

                                                       9
European Patent Office (EPO), and CORDIS the European Union database of funded research

projects.

       In our online survey, we have considered the entire population of 1,085 INP physicists

active in 2017, as part of a project focusing on the impact of family characteristics and research

responsibilities on the gender publication gap (see Mairesse, Pezzoni, and Visentin [2019]). After

three survey waves and deleting 17 incomplete answers, we have obtained a total of 604

respondents, corresponding to an overall response rate of 56%. To evaluate the representativeness

of our sample, we have been able to compare a individual characteristics such as gender, age, the

field of specialization, and rank between respondents and non-respondents. As documented in

Appendix A Table A1, we found limited differences. The broader difference concerns repornednts'

gender with a proportion of 23% (139) female physicists among the 604 respondents and only 14%

(67) among the 481 non-respondents. In the survey, we asked researchers if they have children,

and, if this was the case, their dates of birth. We also asked researchers to record the periods during

which they had research responsibilities, distinguishing being head of a scientific team or having

other research-related duties, such as being a member of a scientific advisory committee.


Variable construction
       According to the CNRS guidelines for promotion, INP physicists to be promoted DR are

judged on their scientific production, visibility, involvement in research projects, and managerial

skills in leading research teams. We capture these promotion factors by constructing a set of

variables measuring scientists' publication productivity, size of the professional network,

mentoring, fundraising, technology transfer, and project management activities. Finally, we also

consider variables constructed from our online survey to take into account scientists' family

characteristics and research responsibilities.

                                                  10
Precisely, we have constructed the following set of 18 variables:

·     Female is a dummy variable that equals one for a female scientist and zero for a male scientist.

·     Cumulated number of articles in t-1 measures the scientist's publication productivity for each

      year t by counting the cumulated number of articles published in peer-reviewed journals until

      year t-1.

·     Cumulated number of conference papers in t-1 measures the scientist's participation in

      conferences by counting the cumulated number of conference papers until year t-1.

·     Average number of citations in t-1 measures the quality of the scientist's publication

      productivity. It counts the average number of citations received by the articles published in

      peer-reviewed journals or as conference papers until year t-1. 4

·     At least one EPO patent in t-1 is a proxy for the scientist's involvement in technology transfer

      activities. It is a dummy variable that equals one if the scientist has at least one patent

      application at the European Patent Office (EPO) until year t-1, zero otherwise. 5




4
    The Average number of citations until t-1 is computed by dividing the cumulated numbers of all the
yearly citations received by the publications until t-1 by the corresponding cumulated number of
publications until t-1. Note that our bibliometric data only includes the total number of citations obtained
by each publication from its publication year until 2019, and that we had to use a good enough
approximation of average yearly citations, which we obtained by simply dividing the total number of
citations until 2019 by the number of years from the publication year to 2019.
5
    In the matching exercise, to minimize the possibility of false matches between INP physicists and
homonym inventors, we consider as valid matches only those for patents where CNRS appears among the
applicants. This appears as a reasonable solution since CNRS includes in the promotion evaluation only
technology transfer activities arising from research work at CNRS.



                                                      11
·     Cumulated number of collaborators in t-1 measures the size of the scientist's professional

      network. It counts the number of distinct co-authors listed in the scientist's articles with eight

      or fewer co-authors until year t-1. 6

·     Cumulated number of Ph.D. theses supervised in t-1 measures the scientist's mentoring

      responsibilities by counting the cumulated number of Ph.D. theses supervised until year t-1.

·     Cumulated years as head of a research team in t-1 measures the scientist's research

      responsibilities. It counts the cumulated number of years the scientist has been head of a

      research team or research laboratory until year t-1.

·     Cumulated years of other research responsibilities in t-1 measures the scientist's participation

      in scientific advisory committee or scientific consultant activities. It counts the cumulated

      number of years the scientist has had such activities until year t-1.

·     At least one ANR or EU grant in t-1 is a proxy for the scientist's fundraising skills. It is a

      dummy variable that equals one if the scientist has been the coordinator of at least one ANR

      or EU funded research project until year t-1, zero otherwise

·     Family size until t-1 measures the scientist's number of children until year t-1.




6
    In physics, the size of teams and norms of authorship attribution might generate articles with long lists
of co-authors, some of whom have marginally contributed to the research work (Sarsons [2017]). To
capture only relationships that are likely to represent actual collaborations, we only counted the co-
authors listed in papers with a limited number of co-authors (Gonzalez-Brambila, Veloso, and Krackhardt
[2008]).



                                                       12
·     One child less than three years old in t-1 is a proxy for the scientist's involvement in taking

      care of a small child. It is a dummy variable that equals one if the scientist has one child born

      in the last three years, zero otherwise. 7

·     Age at CR it measures the scientist's age at the time of the recruitment as CR. 8

·     Ph.D. in a Paris university, Ph.D. in a French university (not located in Paris), Ph.D. in a

      foreign university are three binary indicators proxying for differences in academic environment

      and experience. According to the scientist's place of graduation, they take value one or zero

      (with a sum equals to one).

·     Ph.D. graduation year before 1991, Ph.D. graduation year 1991-2000, Ph.D. graduation year

      2001-2017 are three binary indicators proxying for three contrasted periods during which

      scientists acquired their Ph.Ds. They take the value one or zero according to the scientist's year

      of Ph.D. graduation (with a sum equals to one). 9

·     Recruited as CR1 indicates that the scientist has been recruited at CNRS directly as CR1. It is

      a dummy variable equal to one if this is the case, and zero otherwise.




7
    We consider the age of three as a turning point for two reasons. First, it is the age until when parents are
allowed by the French law to reduce their working hours and, second, the age at which a small child can
start attending a nursery school (see Mairesse, Pezzoni, and Visentin [2019]).
8
    Although the scientist's age is strictly collinear with time, in event analysis and under the assumption of
a linear effect of age on the logs of the hazard of being appointed DR, it is sufficient to measure it at the
beginning of the time scale, that is here the recruitment as CR (see Allison [1984]).
9
    The information about the graduation year is only available for 65% of the scientists. When it is not
available, we have been able to use the year of very first publication before entering CNRS for 23% of
them, and have assumed they were 23 years old for the remaining 12%.

                                                        13
·   Gender parity initiative (MPPF) is a dummy variable that equals one if the scientist entered

    INP as CR after 2001 (the year of the gender parity CNRS initiative "Mission pour la place

    des femmes"), zero otherwise.

·   Section dummies are four binary indicators of the scientist's main fields of specialization:

    "Physical theories" (CNRS Section 2), "Condensed matter physics (structures and electronic

    properties)" (CNRS Section 3), "Atoms and molecules, optics and lasers, hot plasma physics"

    (CNRS Section 4), and "Condensed matter physics (organizations and dynamics)" (CNRS

    Section 5). They take the value one or zero according to the scientist's specialization (with a

    sum equals to one).


Descriptive statistics
         Our study sample is an unbalanced panel of 7,805 observations for 604 INP scientists, of

which 139 are women (23.0%), and 465 are men (77.0%). Each of them is an active researcher

from when she enters at CNRS until 2017, which is the year of our online survey and last year of

our study sample. Table 1 shows that overall, during our study period, 276 (45.7%) researchers

are promoted DR after 14.3 years, on average, and 328 (54.3%) researchers stay CR without being

promoted to DR for 11.7 years, on average.

       We see also from Table 1 that 56 (40.3%) female physicists are promoted DR after 15.8

years and their 220 (47.3%) male colleagues after 14.0 years. The difference of years to be

promoted from CR to DR for female and male physicists is of 1.8 years (=15.8-14.0), a rather

small number, but statistically highly significant (the P-value of the test between the two means

equals 0.0076). Relatedly, 83 (59.7 %) female researchers remain CR for 13.3 years until the end

of the study period, while 245 (62.7 %) male researchers remain CR for 11.2 years.

       Table 2 reports the descriptive statistics for the time-invariant and time-variant variables.

The descriptive statistics for the time-invariant variables are calculated over the sample of 604

researchers. Statistics for the time-variant variables are calculated over the 7,805 periods when the

604 researchers are at risk of promotion, namely from the year of entry at CNRS until the year of

promotion to DR, or until 2017 if a researcher remains CR.

       Without going into the details of this vast array of descriptive statistics, it is useful to point

out the orders of magnitude of some variables and their differences between female and male

researchers. As concerns the averages of the time-invariant variables, we observe that the

differences between female and male researchers, in columns two and three, are often small and

not statistically significant. By contrast, differences between researchers promoted and not-

promoted to DR, in columns five and six, are often statistically significant.

       In particular, male researchers appear more productive than their female colleagues. The

average male physicist counts 23.4 cumulated peer-reviewed articles and 4.5 cumulated

conference papers. Those papers, on average, received two citations each per year. The average

female researcher counts 15.6 cumulated peer-reviewed articles and 2.9 conference papers, which

received per year an average of 1.2 citations each.

           Otherwise, male researchers have a larger professional network than female researchers,

counting respectively, on average, 26.9 and 19.6 collaborators. During our period of observation,

a male researcher supervised, on average, 0.17 Ph.D. theses, while a female researcher supervised,


                                                                           16
on average, 0.13 of them. The small fraction of theses supervised is explained by the French

institutional situation whereby typically Ph.D. doctorates are delivered by universities, and not by

public research institute like the CNRS. However, CNRS researchers are often teaming up with

their university colleagues, working in the same buildings and labs and this collaboration ending

with sharing Ph.D. theses (see Lissoni et al. [2011]; Mairesse and Pezzoni [2015] for two

comparative analyses of scientific productivity and academic promotion of French CNRS and

university physicists).

           Scientists' fundraising and technology transfer activities appear to be limited and are as

frequent for male and female researchers, with only 5% of the observations referring to a scientist

with at least one EPO patent and 4% to a scientist who has been coordinating an ANR or EU grant.

           Concerning the online survey variables, female and male researchers spend, on average,

the same time as head of a research team (0.75 and 0.74). By contrast, the time devoted to other

responsibilities is much larger and significantly higher for male researchers than for their female

colleagues, respectively 0.47 years and 0.28. 10 On average, the family size, as measured by total

number of children, and the child less than three-years old dummy are weakly statistically different

between female and male scientists, and respectively equal 1.19% and 26% for female and 1.13%

and 28% for male. 11


10
     The average figures of time during which researchers have responsibilities may appear small because
they include the periods of inactivity. If we exclude the periods of inactivity, male researchers are
respectively responsible for a research team and in charge of other responsibilities for 4.54 and 4.49
years, while female researchers for 4.67 and 3.32 years
11
     The average family size and percentage of less than three-years old child include the researchers with
no children and periods when children are older. If we exclude these cases, the average family sizes are
equal to 1.95 and 1.82 for male and female researchers respectively, and the average percentages for less
than three-years old child are equal to 0.49 and 0.40.

                                                      17
          Finally, the differences in the time-variant variables between the promoted and not

promoted to DR scientists are, like the ones for the time-invariant variables, both strongly positive

and statistically highly significant. There are nonetheless two not surprising exceptions. The less

than three-years child variable and the gender parity initiative dummies are, on average, about

twice higher and statistically more significant for the physicists non-promoted to DR than for the

ones promoted.




5. Model and method
          We rely on the statistical models and methods of `survival' or `event history analysis' to

assess the rate of occurrence or `hazard rate' of the promotion of INP physicists from CR to DR

(Allison [1984]; Wooldridge [2002]).12 The hazard rate function () is defined by the ratio

between the probability that the event occurs at time t and the probability that the event has not yet

occurred until t: () = () / (1 -  ()), where f(t) is the probability density function, and (1-

F(t)) is the survival function equal to one minus the cumulated density function F(t).

          As a first exploratory analysis, we follow the standard practice of computing and

representing the `Kaplan-Meier' survival function graphically. We plot the survival fuction

separately for female and male researchers. We find that the log-rank test of equality between the

two Kaplan-Meir survival functions is rejected with a P-value of 0.0004 (Chi2 =12.51). We also



12
     Survival analysis or event history analysis refer basically to the same statistical methods, with names
depending on the various fields of application. For example, survival is mainly used in epidemiology or
actuaruial sciences when the interest is in forecasting the time to death, or event history analysis in social
sciences or economics on topics such as labor market mobility and unemployment spells; or else reliability
or failure studies in engineering; etc.

                                                     18
see in Figure 1 that the average survival rate for female physicists as CR is higher than for males

in all periods, meaning that the female average promotion rate to DR is lower than the males' one.

Note: The x-axis years is the time elapsed from the recruitment as CR to the promotion to DR.


                       Beyond this exploratory analyses, the core of our study is to account for the observed

differences in the hazard rates of promotion between female and male scientists based on the

various factors of promotion, which we have been able to measure.

                       We estimate the following model:

                                           () = 0 ()  (11,+2 2,(-1))          Equation 1




                                                             19
where 1 and 2 are vectors of the parameters to estimate, 0 (t) is the unknown baseline hazard

function that relates the hazard rate to time, x1 is a vector of variables including all the time-

invariant covariates, and x2(t-1) is a vector of variables including all the time-variant covariates

lagged by one year. To estimate the vectors of parameters 1 and 2, we use Cox's partial likelihood

estimator for proportional hazard models (see Danell and Hjerm [2013]; Ginther and Hayes [1999]

for similar approaches). The partial likelihood estimation allows us to let unspecified the functional

form of 0 (t). As a robustness check, in Appendix B1 we report parametric estimations where a

Weibull distribution is assumed as the functional form of 0 (). As explained we find that the

results are qualitatively the same.

        To clarify the interpretation of the parameters s, the most straightforward example is to

consider a simplified version of Equation 1 including only the dummy variable Female:

 () = 0 ()  ( ) . We find that the estimated   equals 0.603 with a standard error


of 0.086. The value 0.603 corresponds to the ratio between the hazard rate of promotion of a female

scientist and the hazard rate of promotion of a male scientist. We calculate the variation of the

hazard rate of promotion for a female scientist as 0.603-1, corresponding to a 39.7% lower rate of

promotion for females with respect to her male counterpart. This specification corresponds to the

benchmark equation estimated in the first column of Table 3.




6. Is there gender equality in promotion rates?
        In Table 3, we present estimates of four Cox's regressions, including time-invariant and

time-variant variables described in Section 4 and documented in Table 2 of the descriptive

statistics.

                                                                 21
          In the first column of Table 3, we show the benchmark model including only the female

dummy as explanatory variable. We find, as already shown by the exploratory analysis reported

in the previous section, that the rate of promotion to DR is 39.7% lower for female physicists than

for their male colleagues. In the second column, we include as promotion factors the vector of

seven biographic and family characteristics. Only two of these characteristics are statistically

significant. The Recruited as CR1 dummy variable is highly significant, implying that the

estimated rate of promotion is 94.4% higher for physicists recruited directly as CR1 than for those

recruited as CR2. The Family size variable is significant at a 5% confidence level, implying that

the estimated rate of promotion is 11% higher, on average, for each additional child in the

physicist's family.

          In the third column, we consider only standard scientific productivity indicators of

publication quantity and quality such as the Cumulated number of articles, Cumulated number of

conference papers and Average number of citations. We find that, as expected, the number of

articles and average number citations received have both positive and statistically significant

effect. 13 Precisely, adding one article to the researcher's stock of peer-reviewed articles and one

citation per year to the stock of citations received increase respectively by 2.2% and 3.5% the

promotion rate of physicists. We also find that including these three variables in the regression

exercise is enough to account for the gender inequality gap in promotion to DR recorded in the

regressions reported in columns one and two. The coefficient of the estimated female hazard ratio

is not anymore significantly smaller than one. It is now equal to 0.837 (with standard error 0.123),


13
     The correlation between the Cumulated number of conference papers and the Cumulated number of
articles equals to 0.47 overall, and 0.48 and 0.47 for female and male researchers separately. These high
values partly explain why Cumulated number of conference papers does not show statistical significance,
when included in the Cox's regressions together the Cumulated number of conference papers.

                                                    22
instead of 0.607 (and standard error 0.101), and corresponds to an average rate of promotion 16.3%

lower for female physicists than their male colleagues instead of the 39.3% reported in the second

column.

       In the fourth column, we include our complete set of covariates. We find that the coefficient

of the female dummy remains unchanged and not significantly smaller than one. The variables

(Cumulated number of articles and Average number of citations) remain significant with a positive

impact on the promotion rate to DR of physicists. Looking at the other promotion factors, we see

that one more Ph.D. thesis supervised (Cumulated number of Ph.D theses supervised) and one

more year as head of a research team (Cumulated years as head of a research team) boost

respectively by 18.2% and 9.1% promotion rate. We also observe that the Cumulated number of

collaborators has a weakly significant negative impact impact, showing that having one more

collaborator dampen the promotion rate by 0.6%.




7. Does promotion factors' impact differ for male and female researchers?
       The results shown in Table 3 can be enriched by allowing promotion factors to have

different effects for female and male researchers. To do so, we interact with the Female dummy

variable all the eighteen promotion factors included in the regression model reported in the column

four of Table 3. The results are reported in Table 4, where the first column shows the estimated

hazard ratio coefficients, and the second column reports the raw coefficients estimated using the

Cox's regression. Reporting the raw coefficients allow us to recover the variation of the promotion

rate for female scientists (not directly shown in the interacted regressions). The promotion rate

variation for female scientists is equal to the exponential of the linear combination of the raw

coefficients of the non-interacted variable and the female-interacted variable minus one. For

                                                23
instance, the variation of the promotion rate for a female scientist spending one more year as the

head of a research team is calculated as [exp(0.0667 + 0.0642) - 1]*100 = 14.0%, where 0.0667

and 0.0642 are the raw coefficients of the variables Cumulated years as head of a research team

and Female*Cumulated years as head of a research team reported in column two of Table 4. We

obtain that an additional year spent as the head of a research team accounts for an increase of the

promotion rate of female scientists of 14.0%, about twice the value estimated for their male

colleagues of 6,9%, equal to [exp(0.0667) ­ 1]*100.

         As expected, scientific productivity plays a crucial role in the promotion to DR for both

female and male scientists. The effects of publication quantity and quality (Cumulated number of

articles and Average number of citations) are both positive and significant. Precisely, adding one

article to their stocks of peer-reviewed articles augments by 3.3% and 2.8% the promotion rates to

DR of male and female researchers, respectively. Looking at the significance of the interaction

coefficient Female*Cumulated number of articles we find that the difference between these two

effects is not statistically significant. Similarly, increasing by one citation the Average number of

citations boosts by 5.4% and 23.8% the promotion rates of male and female researchers,

                                                               25
respectively. Although the magnitude of these effects appears much larger for the female than for

the male researchers, the difference is not statistically significant.

          Surprisingly, the effect of Cumulated number of collaborators is detrimental for male

researchers, decreasing their promotion rate by 1% for each additional collaborator, while it has

no effect for female researchers (with an interaction term not significantly different from zero). On

the contrary, the effect of the Cumulated number Ph.D. theses supervised is beneficial for male

researchers increasing their rate of promotion by 23.8% for each additional Ph.D., while it has no

effect for female researchers. Although the difference between the two effects is large, it is not

statistically significant. The effects of Cumulated years with other responsibilities and At least one

EPO patent are not significant for the promotion to DR, neither for men nor for women. Having

an ANR or EU grant increases the promotion rate to DR for female researchers by 185.9% if

compared to the promotion rate of a female researchers with no grants. Grants have no effect for

male researchers. 14

          Concerning the researcher's family and personal characteristics, the effect of Family size

appears to be favorable to male researchers, increasing their promotion rate by 10.4% while it does

not affect female researchers. Having One child born in the last 3 years does not affect the

promotion to DR neither for men nor for women. We find that Age at CR does not affect the

promotion rate and that being directly Recruited as CR1 significantly shorten the path toward the

promotion to DR for male researchers, but not for female researchers (with an interaction term not

significantly different from zero). Having a Ph.D. from a French University (not located in Paris),

     Note that 54 male researchers and 20 female researchers obtain a grant during our study period.
Among them, 11 males and 4 females are promoted to DR. For these males it took, on average, 3.9 years
to be promoted after obtaining a grant, while for the 4 females it took only 3.5 years.

significantly decreases the rate of promotion for female researchers with respect to female

physicists who obtain their Ph.D. from a foreign university. We find that the Ph.D. graduation

year indicators do not affect the promotion rate either for men or women. Finally, we observe that

promotion rates are not significantly different after the implementation of the Gender Parity

Initiative "Mission Pour la Places des Femmes".

          We have tested the robustness of our results to different model estimation strategies, by

considering a series of four robustness checks, which we present in Appendix B in the same format

than our main results in Tables 3 and 4. Specifically, in Appendix B1, we use a parametric

proportional hazard model. In Appendix B2, we run separated regressions considering the

promotion to intermediate positions. In Appendix B3 we address the concern that scientists might

experience alternative `exit modes', and in Appendix B4, we use a parametric model with unshared

frailty. These tests basically confirm our main results, while they also bring up interesting new

points.




8. Discussion and conclusions
          This paper investigates the factors affecting the main career advancement of scientists at

INP, the physics institute of CNRS. Our central result is that differences in research productivity

account entirely for the gender gap in the promotion to DR of INP physicists. This result shows

that INP successfully embraces the "universalism" norm according to which scientist career

reward should be assigned only on the base of scientific productivity (Merton [1942]). It also

supports the so-called "difference model" assuming that the observed gender gaps in promotion

for scientists of equal research productivity do not necessarily imply gender discrimination ("the

deficit model"), but can reflect differences in an individual situation, in the institutional

                                                  27
     environment, as well as imperfect, incomplete and error-ridden measures of productivity (Sonnert

     and Holton [1995]; Ceci and Williams [2011]).

                We summarize in Table 5 the covariate effects on the promotion to DR of female and male

     scientists separately, when they are statistically significant. We recall, in the first and second

     columns, the estimated impacts on rate of promotions for female and male scientists. In the third

     column we report if the differences between these estimates are statistically significant (S) or not

     (NS).15 In the fourth and fifth columns, we present the estimates in terms of `equivalent number

     of articles', that is using as our unit of measure the impact of having one more article in peer-

     reviewed journals.

          The tests of non statistically significant impacts for the rate of promotion of female scientists and their
     differences with male scientists are all very precise, reflecting the large number of observations for both
     female and male scientists in our study sample (see Table 2).

                                                               28
       We find that the most widely used bibliometric indicators of productivity, i.e., the count of

peer-reviewed articles and yearly citations received, have significant positive effects on the

promotion rates for both female and male scientists. We observe a variation of 2.77% and 3.31%

for each additional article published by female and male scientists, respectively. We observe

similarly an increase of 23.85% and 5.41% for each additional citation received by female and

male scientists, respectively. We also see that for female scientists the impact of one additional

citation is equivalent to publishing 8.6 (~23.8/2.8) articles, while for their male colleagues it is

equivalent 1.6 (~5.4./3.3) articles, that is more than five times less. Carrying research

responsibilities as head of a research team is the only other case where the impact on promotion

rate is significant for both female and male scientists. We find each additional year as head of a

research team being equivalent as 5.0 articles more for female scientists and 2.1 for male scientists,

that is more than twice less.

       Among the various possibilities, Table 5 reveals simply two patterns whereby factors of

promotion have significant impacts on male scientists but with no significant differences with

female scientists (four cases), and on the opposite (two cases). For male researchers, each

additional collaborator is equivalent to having 0.3 articles less in their publication portfolio, while

it is not detrimental for female researchers. For male researchers, mentoring one Ph.D. student is

equivalent to publishing 7.2 articles. This is not the case for female researchers. Surprizingly, each

additional child in the family is equivalent to having 3.1 articles for male researchers; however, it

does not affect the promotion rate of female researchers. Being recruited as CR1 is equivalent as

having 38.2 articles for male researchers until their promotion to DR, not for female researchers.

       Having obtained an ANR or EU grant boosts the promotion rate for female scientists as

much as publishing 67.0 articles until their promotion to DR. This is not the case for male scientits.



                                                  29
For female scientists, having a Ph.D. from a French university not located in Paris is equivalent to

publishing 16.8 less articles than researchers who have a Ph.D. from a foreing university, while it

is not significant for male scientists. Having a Ph.D. from a French university located in Paris is

not different from having a Ph.D. from a foreign university, both for female and male scientists.

       Taking them at face value, our findings can provide hints to researchers wishing to leverage

specific factors of promotion to be promoted to DR. They suggest that both female and male

researchers should invest in increasing their peer-reviewed article publications and citation scores.

However, men have more options for a faster promotion than women, who particurlarly benefit

from having research responsibilities as head of a research team and being successful in raising

funds for research projects.

       While our findings on the beneficial impacts of publication and citation scores are expected

and in line with previous studies, others findings deserve discussion. Our estimates on the negative

effect of having an higher number of collaborators for male researchers might be associated with

the difficulties in attributing credit for teamwork in larger teams (Sarsons [2017]). The estimated

effects of mentoring are positive for both female and male researchers, but statistically significant

only in the case of male researchers. Previous studies recognize that women are frequently

committed to teaching and taking care of students (Mason et al. [2013]). This behavior might

generate in promotion committees the feeling that devoting time and effort to coaching students is

normal for many female researchers. For men, in contrast, the choice of mentoring might be

interpreted as a sign of specific commitments and viewed as a positive signal for promotion to DR.

Similar signals are associated with leading a research team, but in this case, female researchers

benefit more than their male counterparts. When female researchers lead a research team, this




                                                 30
engagement is viewed by promotion committees as proof that they have the scientific maturity and

competence to be promoted to DR.

       As a final remark of caution, while we find results showing that policy recommendations

and rules supporting gender equality for promotion are on the whole effective, they may be

primarily driven by the fact they concern highly-ranked institutions as CNRS and the INP. That

may not be the case of other institutions doing scientific research (McDowell et al. [1999]). It

would certainly be enlightening to emulate the present study for other CNRS institutes than INP,

as well as focusing again on the field of Physics discipline but in French universities, and beyond

in other countries.

Appendix B: Robustness checks.
Appendix B1
       In this appendix, we estimate a parametric proportional hazard model, assuming a Weibull

distribution of the baseline hazard function. Equation B1-1 shows a parametric proportional hazard

model where t is the time passed since when the scientist is at risk of promotion to DR, 0 () is a

baseline hazard function, 1 is the vector of time-invariant covariates, 2 is the vector of time-

variant covariates, 1 and 2 are the vectors of coefficients to be estimated. Assuming that our

baseline hazard function has a Weibull distribution 0 () =  -1 Equation B1-1 writes as follow:

           () = 0 () (11,+2 2,(-1))=  -1  (11,+2 2,(-1))                    Equation B1

       Table B1-1 reports the estimates of the models for the overall sample of scientists. Table

B1-2 reports the model estimated including all the interactions between the dummy variable

Female and all the other covariates. In both tables, the estimates are full maximum-likelihood. We

find substantial coherence with the results showed in Tables 3 and 4 in the main text. According

to our estimate of the Weibull parameter , we find that the rate of promotion increases with time.

For instance, when we consider the estimates in Column 4 Table B1-1, the rate of promotion after

four years is 43% higher than the rate of promotion after three years ((4/3)2.244-1 ).

       In Figure B1-1 and Figure B1-2, relying on Column 4 (Table B1-1) estimates, we report

the fitted survival and hazard functions for a female and male scientist with an overall average

value for all the covariates other than Female. We also report the 95% confidence intervals of the

fitted functions showing that the graph is coherent with the non-significance of the coefficient of

the variable Female estimated in Column 4.

       The results presented in Tables B1-1 and B1-2 are consistent with the ones reported in

Tables 3 and 4 in the main text.

Appendix B2
          In this appendix, we run separated regressions considering the promotion to intermediate

positions. At CNRS, the career step CR has two intermediate career steps: CR2 and CR1.

Similarly, DR has two steps: DR2 and DR1 16. In Tables B2-1 and B2-2, we estimated a Cox

regression model for the promotion from CR1 to DR2. The results are consistent with the ones

reported in Tables 3 and 4, except for the variable Family size in t-1 that loses its significance for

males (Table B2-2). In Tables B2-3 and B2-4, we estimated a Cox regression model for the

promotion from DR2 to DR1. In this case, we found different results from Tables 3 and 4. The

Female variable is no longer significant both with and without productivity and family controls

(Table B2-3, Columns 1, 2, 3, and 4). Consistently with the models estimated in Table 4, Table

B2-4 shows that publication quality plays a positive and significant role for males increasing their

rate of promotion but is no longer significant for females (although the difference between the two

coefficients is statistically significant). The cumulated number of articles coefficient is significant

for male but no longer significant for female researchers (although the difference between the two

coefficients is statistically significant). Interestingly, when we consider the promotion from DR2

to DR1, having ANR or EU grants and the size of the family boost significantly the female

scientists' rate of promotion with respect to their male counterparts.




16
     To better understand the promotion dynamics at CNRS, we interviewed a member of the National
Committee of Scientific Research (CoNRS). CoNRS is an independent organisation that helps CNRS to
define the scientific policy of CNRS in terms of recruitment and career advancements of researchers. The
CoNRS member confirmed that the most important and challenging career steps for a CNRS researcher
are the promotion from CR1 to DR2 and from DR2 to DR1. The promotion from CR2 to CR1 depends
mostly on seniority.

Note: In Column 1, a coefficient lower than one is associated with a reduction of the hazard rate of promotion, while a coefficient
greater than one is associated with an increase of the hazard rate of promotion. Column 2 reports the raw coefficients useful to
discuss the effects of the interactions. Standard errors are clustered around scientists. aReference category is Ph.D. in a foreign
university; bWe redefined the Ph.D. cohort dummies as follows: Ph.D. graduation year >= 1991 and Ph.D. graduation year <
1991.

Appendix B3
           In this appendix, we address the concern that scientists experience alternative `exit modes'

other than promotion, such us leaving INP for other job opportunities, or retire. In-depth

discussions with scientists working at CNRS suggest that the rate of abandon of CNRS for external

job opportunities is very low, which is confirmed by internal CNRS statistics on researcher

mobility. 17 However, we have selected a sub-sample of scientists born between 1960 and 1969 in

order to have a cohort of individuals who are not at risk of retirement and whose only possible

`expected exit' is promotion. 18 Table B3-1 and B3-2 show that, although the sample reduces to

153 scientists (32 females and 121 males), the results are qualitatively the same as those reported

in Tables 3 and 4.

     In this subsample, the oldest scientist is an individual born in 1960 and who was 58 in 2017. In France,
the age of 58 is largely below than the age of retirement.

Note: A coefficient lower than one is associated with a reduction of the hazard rate of promotion, while a coefficient greater than
one is associated with an increase of the hazard rate of promotion. Standard errors are clustered around scientists. aReference
category is Ph.D. in a foreign university; bWe redefined the Ph.D. cohort dummies as follows: Ph.D. graduation year >= 1991 and
Ph.D. graduation year < 1991. Due to the limited number of observations, we dropped the variable Gender parity initiative (MPPF)
and At least one ANR or EU grant in t-1 to obtain convergent pseudo-likelihood estimations.

Appendix B4
       This appendix reports the event history analysis for promotion to DR using maximum

likelihood estimation of a parametric model including unshared frailty. The unshared frailty 

represents the unobservable model heterogeneity (Equation B4-1). Specifically,  is a gamma-

distributed random variable with average 1/ and variance , i.e., Gamma(1/, ).

                     () =  0 ()  (11, +2 2, (-1))                Equation B4-1

       We assume that our baseline hazard function has a Weibull distribution 0 () =  -1 .

We end up with Equation B4-2 that writes as follow:

       () =  0 ()  (11, +2 2, (-1)) =   -1  (1 1,+2 2,(-1))                     Equation B4-2

       The results of estimation reported in Tables B4-1 and B4-2 are consistent with those

reported in Tables 3 and 4, except for the variable Family size in t-1 that loses its significance for

male researchers in Table B4-2.
