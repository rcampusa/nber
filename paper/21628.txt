                                           ABSTRACT

We develop a simple algorithm for detecting exam cheating between students who copy off one another’s
exam. When this algorithm is applied to exams in a general science course at a top university, we
find strong evidence of cheating by at least 10 percent of the students. Students studying together
cannot explain our findings. Matching incorrect answers prove to be a stronger indicator of cheating
than matching correct answers. When seating locations are randomly assigned, and monitoring is
increased, cheating virtually disappears.

Introduction

     Student cheating is a perennial issue. In recent years, 70 students in a New York City top

public high school were caught using smart phones to cheat on state exams (Baker 2012), and

cheating scandals have rocked Harvard, Stanford, Dartmouth, and the Air Force Academy, just

to name a few. 1

     These well publicized scandals are only the tip of the iceberg. McCabe (2005) surveyed

8,000 college students in the U.S. and Canada, finding that 11% of them admit to “copying

from another student on an exam without their knowledge,” 10% say they have “helped

someone else cheat on test”, and 9% acknowledge copying from another student “with their

knowledge.”

     In spite of this apparent widespread cheating, there has been little academic attention

devoted to the detection of cheating. 2 Zitzewitz (2012) surveys more than 100 pages in the

emerging field of forensic economics, not one of which addresses student cheating. 3

     This paper develops an algorithm for identifying cases of students copying off one

another’s exam answers. We test this algorithm using data from a course taught at a top

university in which the professor suspected cheating may have occurred. We find compelling

evidence of cheating involving at least 10% percent of the class’s 242 students on a midterm

exam. When seating positions were randomly assigned and monitoring was increased for the

final exam, almost all evidence of cheating disappears. We are able to rule out that the observed

correlations in answers across students who voluntarily sit next to each other is due to studying

   Harvard University admitted that “about 125 students might have worked in groups on a take-home final
exam.” Roughly seventy students were forced to withdraw from the University (Perez-Pena 2013). Similar
numbers of students were involved at Darmouth and the Air Force Academy (Frosch 2015, Associated Press
2015a). In March 2015, Stanford University Provost John Etchemendy sent a letter to the faculty expressing
concerns over allegations of widespread cheating (Associated Press 2015b).

have developed techniques for detecting cheating, but to the best of our knowledge, these tools have never
been made publicly available.

together, as opposed to cheating on the exam because of an unusual experiment carried out an

advance of the final exam. Students seated themselves voluntarily, with the expectation that

the seats they chose would be the ones in which they would take the exam. These seating

choices were recorded. Prior to the actual test, however, students were randomly reassigned to

different seats. Thus, we are able to observe the patterns in correlations among students who

wanted to sit together, but then were not allowed to.

     The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section I describes the background of

the cheating incident that we analyze. Section II presents a simple, reduced form regression

analysis of the cheating patterns. Section III develops and implements a more systematic

algorithmic approach to the problem and also considers alternative explanations for

correlations like studying together. Section IV concludes.



Section I: The Cheating Incident and the Data

    In spring 2012, 242 students registered in an introductory natural sciences course at a top

American university. The course had three midterms and a final exam. 4 All of the exams were

multiple choice, with four possible answers per question. Students recorded their answers on

Scantron sheets. There was no punishment for incorrect guesses, i.e. a wrong answer yielded

no points, as did leaving the question blank. The average percentage correct on the exams fell

in the range of 75 to 85.

    The first three midterms were held in a classroom with nearly every seat occupied. A single

TA proctored the exam. During the third midterm, a student came to the TA reporting

suspicions that another student had been cheating. The proctor did not take any action regarding

the cheating during the midterm, but did report this information to the professor after the exam.

In response, the professor sent out an email, saying that “cheating is morally wrong,” and


4
 Students were required to take only two of the three midterms. The midterms had 50 questions each; the final
exam had 80 questions.
                                                      2
encouraged students to admit their wrongdoing. No students voluntarily came forward,

although a second student said she had also witnessed cheating. This prompted the professor

to once again call for student confessions, bolstered by the threat that he was going to contact

us -- the authors of this paper -- and have us catch the cheaters. 5 Again, no one came forward,

and the professor did indeed contact us two weeks before the final.

     The data available to us include students’ answers to each question on all four exams, as

well as seating information for the third midterm and the final exam. In addition, we were able

to carry out an unusual experiment involving the final exam. Students entered the exam room

and selected their own seats, as was usual practice. These seating choices were recorded.

Before the exam actually began, however, students were shuffled into randomly assigned seats

for the test taking. This provides us with the opportunity to observe correlations in answer

patterns among students who would have liked to sit together (and perhaps studied together),

but were then separated.

     Further steps were taken to prevent cheating on the final exam. Unlike the first three

exams where only one TA served as a proctor, four proctors were present during the final.

Finally, the professor created two different versions of the final exam; the questions in both

versions were the same, but the order in which they were asked was different. Students

randomly received one of the two different versions of the test.



Section II: Reduced form detection of cheating

    We begin our analysis of possible cheating with a simple reduced form regression approach

in which the unit of observation is a pair of students on a particular exam. For each possible

pair of students, we calculate the number of questions for which those students gave the same

correct answer and also the number of questions for which those students gave the same


5
 In his email, the professor warned the students “[they are] extremely good at catching cheating if you have
read Freakonomics.” Apparently, none of the cheaters had read Freakonomics.
                                                       3
incorrect answer. If the number of common answers is high, this may be an indication of

cheating, although of course there may be other explanations as well.

    Copying from a student to one’s left or right is the simplest way to cheat. Thus, the key

variable of interest in the regression is an indicator variable that is equal to one if the students

sit next to each other and takes the value of zero otherwise. 6 Given the room setup, it is difficult

to cheat from two seats away with an empty seat in the middle, but triplets of students might

effectively cheat. Therefore, we include an indicator for students whose seating pattern is

“student 1 – empty seat – student 2,” as well as an indicator if the seating pattern is “student 1

– some other student – student 2.” Cheating from in front or behind another student was not

easily done, so we would not expect this type of proximity to lead to elevated numbers of

shared answers due to cheating. On the other hand, if there are other factors that lead to

correlation in student answers who sit near each other (e.g. because they study together, or good

students congregate near the front of the room), then the back-front indicator will capture these

effects. In some specifications we also control for the gender composition of the pair, whether

they are part of the same academic department. 7

     Table 1 shows the results of these regressions, using as the outcome variable the number

of shared incorrect answers across the two students. The results in columns 1 and 2 correspond

to the third midterm in which cheating is suspected. Columns 3 through 6 reflect the final

exam. In columns 3 and 4, the right hand side variables associated with seat locations are the

initial, voluntary seats occupied by the students; columns 5 and 6 are the assigned seats given

to the students – where they actually sat when taking the final exam. The odd columns do not

include any controls; the even columns include controls.

    Students who sit next to one another on the midterm have an additional 1.1 shared incorrect

  Because we only have seating charts for the third midterm and the final, our analysis is restricted to these
two tests.

  For gender we include dummies for both female, one female-one male, and two males. Each student is
assigned to an academic department within the University (e.g. engineering or arts and sciences).

answers. This estimate is highly statistically significant. Note that, because the typical student

gets most of the questions correct, the mean number of shared incorrect answers across all pairs

of students is only 2.34. Thus, students who set next to each other have roughly twice as many

shared incorrect answers as would be expected by chance. In contrast, we see no evidence that

trying to sit next to one another in the final -- but being relocated before the test began – leads

to shared incorrect answers. If, for instance, studying together were the cause of correlated

answers among people who choose to sit next to each other, then we would expect more shared

incorrect answers even after those students are relocated prior to the test. Students who actually

sit next to each other in the final – after having been relocated and in the presence of heavy

monitoring – also show no evidence of correlated incorrect answers in columns 5 and 6.

   Pairs of students sitting two seats away with another student in between also have elevated

levels of matching incorrect answers, on the midterm only. If there is an empty seat in between,

however, then the correlation in incorrect answers disappears. This suggests that triplets of

students may have worked together to cheat. There is no impact on shared answers among

students sitting front to back on any of the tests.

   Table 2 is identical to Table 1, except that the dependent variable is the number of shared

correct answers. The pattern of coefficients is quite similar to the previous table. Students

sitting next to each other during the midterm have an extra 1.2 shared correct answers. This

coefficient is statistically significant at the .05 level. Students who are two seats apart with

another student in between on the midterm once again have positive coefficients (but this time

statistically insignificant). None of the other seating variables are coefficients are particularly

predictive; if anything, sitting two seats apart with an empty seat in the middle reduces the

number of shared correct answers.

Section III: A more systematic algorithmic approach to detecting cheating

     The regressions above show that students who sit next to each other tend to have an


                                                 5
increased number of both correct an incorrect answer pairs on average, but for identifying likely

cheaters, it is the abnormality of the answers of a particular pair of students which is critical.

In order to identify unlikely occurrences of matching answers, we first need to establish a

baseline expectation with respect to the expected number of matching answers for any pair of

students. To do so, we begin by modeling a student’s answer on a particular question on either

the third midterm or the final exam using a multinomial logit of the form:

                                                 ⎧    𝑒𝑒 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎
                                                 ⎪1 + ∑3 𝑒𝑒 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑎𝑎 < 4
                        𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   = Pr(𝑦𝑦 = 𝑎𝑎) =        𝑎𝑎=1                                              (1)
                                                 ⎨        1
                                                 ⎪      3                𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑎𝑎 = 4
                                                 ⎩1 + ∑𝑎𝑎=1 𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑎
                                                                   𝑋𝑋 𝛽𝛽


Where s indexes students and a reflects the answer the student gave to that question. There are

four possible answers to each question, a=(1,2,3,4). In our basic specifications, we use the

student’s percentage correct on each of the midterms and the final to predict the answers a

student gives to a particular question on the third midterm or the final. In computing the

student’s percentage correct, we exclude the results for that particular question. 8

 An argument could be made for using only the student’s performance on the final exam as a control variable,
due to cheating concerns on the midterms. Empirically, our results are little changed if we do that, or if we add
more covariates such as a gender dummy.
                                                           6
     We then compute two potential indicators of cheating based on unexpected concordance

of answer patterns: (1) the residual between the observed and predicted number of matching

correct answers ( ∆𝑐𝑐 ), and (2) the residual between the observed and predicted matching

incorrect answers (∆𝑖𝑖 ). A priori, it is uncertain which of these two measures will be most

predictive empirically.

     We estimate the probabilities implied in model (1) using data for the 214 students that

took both the third midterm as well as the final. 9 We then create a data set of all possible student

pairs (22,791=214*213/2) for which we compute the number of matching correct and incorrect

answers as well as the expected number of matching correct and incorrect answers using

equations (2) and (3) respectively. Finally, we compute ∆𝑐𝑐 and ∆𝑖𝑖 as the difference between the

observed and predicted number of matching correct and incorrect answers respectively.

     Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of ∆𝑐𝑐 against ∆𝑖𝑖 on the third midterm, where cheating was

suspected. Each symbol in the plot represents a pair of students in the class. Red triangles

correspond to pairs of students who sat next to each other during the third midterm; blue squares

are pairs of students who had one seat in between them, with that seat occupied; black circles

are a 1% sample of all other pairs of students. The further to the right a pair is in the figure, the

greater the number of unexpected shared incorrect answers. The higher up a pair is in the figure,

the greater the number of excess correct answers. The red and blue symbols are greatly

overrepresented in the Northeastern parts of the figure, consistent with cheating. Although

pairs of students sitting next to each other represent only one half of one percent of all possible

pairs of students, four of the six right-most data points are pairs of students who were next to

each other. Although the pattern is less clear in the vertical dimension, the single greatest

anomaly on shared correct answers is a pair seated next to one another. Some blue squares are



9
 We drop questions which all students answer correctly, as they provide no information. We also drop a
handful of cases where exactly one student gave a particular answer on a question because of non-
convergence of the multinomial logit estimation.

near the far right of the figure, but the pattern is much less obviously extreme than for the red.

     For purposes of comparison, Figures 2 and 3 mirror Figure 1, but for the seating positions

originally selected on the final (Figure 2) and the actual seating positions on the final (Figure

3). In stark contrast to Figure 1, there is no visual evidence that students wishing to sit next to

each other or actually sitting next to one another have unusual answer patterns. This supports

the interpretation of cheating on the midterm.

     Figure 4 provides a more systematic means of capturing the degree to which sitting next

to one another produces anomalous patterns on the midterm. The horizontal axis on Figure 4

captures ranges of excess incorrect answers (∆𝑖𝑖 ), with the right-most columns corresponding

to the highest (most suspicious) values. The height of the columns represents the hazard rate

of the frequency with which students who sit next to each other produce outcomes in that range,

compared to all pairs of students. Standard error bands are shown in red. If students sitting

side-by-side look similar to randomly chosen pairs of students, then the hazard rates in all

columns would be equal to one. If the hazard rate in a particular column is two, then that means

that students sitting next to each other are twice as likely to generate answers in that range.

       As can be seen in the figure, pairs of students who sit next to each other in the midterm

produce answer patterns that diverge greatly from random pairs of students. (Note that the

hazard rates are presented on a log scale because the differences in the tails are so large.)

Focusing first on the right-most column of the table, which represents outcomes in the top one-

tenth of one percent in terms of unexpected matching incorrect answers, pairs of students who

sit next to each other are roughly 62 times as likely to fall into this category as a random pair.

The null hypothesis that students sitting next to one another are no more likely than chance to

be in this category is easily rejected. In the next column, reflecting outcomes in the 99.5-99.9th

percentiles, students who sit next to each other are approximately 12 times more frequently

represented than would be expected by chance. This result is also highly statistically significant.


                                                 8
For none of the other columns can we reject the null hypothesis of a hazard rate of one for

students who sit next to each other. By chance, we would have expected one half of one percent

of pairs of students sitting next to each other to appear in one of the two right most columns,

or less than one pair. In actuality, about 9 percent of all left-right pairs (18 individual students)

show up in the extreme tail.

         Figures 5 and 6 present parallel results for the initial and actual seatings of the final

exam. In contrast to Figure 4, there is no evidence that sitting next to another student is

associated with large jumps in shared incorrect answers. We cannot reject the null hypothesis

of a hazard rate of one for any of the columns on interest.

      From this, we conclude that the overrepresentation of shared wrong answers by students

seated next to each other on the midterm is plausibly attributed to cheating, implying that

upwards of ten percent of the students cheated on the midterm in a manner that is detectable

using statistics.

      Figures 7-9 present the same set of results, but for matching correct answers rather than

for matching incorrect answers. Four pairs—seven individual students because one student

shows up in two pairs—appear in the right two columns. Of these, two of the pairs also would

have been labeled cheaters based on anomalies in their incorrect answers. Thus, matching

correct answers add relatively little to the potential cheating detection. Moreover, unlike for

incorrect answers, there is an overrepresentation in the right most column on the final exam,

both for those who wanted to sit together, but weren’t allowed to, and for the students who

were randomly assigned to sit next to each other. The former perhaps suggests that students

who study together have correlated knowledge, although it is interesting that their incorrect

answers do not overlap in an exceptional way. 10 The fact that randomly assigned students who



10
  Further calling into question this conjecture is that we surveyed students after the final exam the following
year and asked them who else they studied with. We saw no excess weight in the right tail of either either
shared correct or incorrect answers for those students who said they studied together.
                                                        9
sat next to each other also have correlated correct answers likely points to cheating in spite of

the randomization. If the extra weight in the tails on the final is indeed due to cheating, then

that suggests four students cheated on the final, still much lower than on the midterm.

     Figures 10-15 are identical to Figures 6-9, except that they report patterns for students

who sat one seat away from another student with a student sitting in the seat between them.

On the midterm, relative risk ratios of roughly ten are present for the right-most category for

both incorrect and correct answers. No such anomalies are present for such student pairs on

the final exam, either in the seats they initially chose or in the randomized seats to which they

were assigned. Doing calculations like those above, eight students sitting with a seat in

between them are identified as likely cheaters. Of those eight, five were identified as cheaters

in the analyses above that compared students sitting next to one another; three of them would

have been missed.



Section IV: Conclusion

   It is not surprising that students cheat – they have strong incentives to do so, and the

likelihood of getting caught is low. What is perhaps more surprising, is that so little effort is

devoted to catching cheating students. In this paper, we develop a simple algorithm for

detecting cheating. In the particular setting in which we apply that algorithm, we conclude that

more than 10 percent of the students in the class appeared to have cheated in a manner blatant

enough to be detected by our approaches. For the most extreme examples, which leave the

cheating students in the top one tenth of one percent of the distribution, the false positive rate

(i.e. cases in which students are falsely accused of cheating) are likely to be quite small since

students sitting next to one another are 62 times more likely than chance to find their way into

this category.

   Perhaps the best supporting evidence for our claims of cheating (and also, perhaps a


                                               10
powerful explanation as to why so little effort is invested in detecting cheaters), comes from

what happened after we carried out our analysis. Based on our initial findings, the professor

in the class forwarded the names of the six most suspicious pairs of students to the Dean’s

office, an investigation was initiated, and a student judiciary court hearing was scheduled. 11

Before the hearing could occur, four of the twelve students confessed. Despite these admissions,

the Dean’s office nonetheless cancelled the investigation the day before the student court

hearing due to pressure from parents. While this precluded any further admissions of guilt, the

professor withheld grades of the presumptive guilty pairs until the first day of the next semester

which resulted in scholarship disqualification. Notwithstanding this punitive action, none of

the twelve accused students complained or sought redress.




11
  Our initial detection algorithms were not as good as those we eventually developed; that is the reason only
12 students were identified.
