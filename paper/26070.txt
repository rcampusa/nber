Monopsony Power in Higher Education: A Tale of Two Tracks
Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson
NBER Working Paper No. 26070

JEL No. I23,J42

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper tests for and measures monopsony power in the U.S. higher education labor market. It
does so by directly estimating the residual labor supply curves facing individual four-year
colleges and universities using school-specific labor demand instruments. The results indicate
that schools have significant monopsony power over their tenure track faculty. Its magnitude is
monotonic in rank, being greatest over full professors and smaller for associate and assistant
professors. For non-tenure track faculty, however, universities do not seem to have any
monopsony power and instead face perfectly elastic residual labor supply curves. Universities'
market power over tenure track faculty does not differ between public and private schools nor
between female and male faculty. Monopsony power is greater for larger universities, and the
geographic market for faculty seems to be national rather than local. Monopsony power is also
larger at higher-status institutions as measured by Carnegie classifications, average test scores of
the undergraduate student body, or initial salary rankings. The results also suggest that
monopsony power has contributed to the trend toward non-tenure track faculty in U.S.

   I.      Introduction

    Rising income inequality and the decline in labor's share of income in the
United States, coupled with a rise in ownership concentration in most
industries, have put the issue of monopsony power and the lack of bargaining
power of workers back in the spotlight for policy makers, economic researchers,
and even in the popular press. 1

    The economics literature has tried to document the existence of monopsony
power in a variety of settings and with a variety of approaches. These have
often relied on more indirect methods than estimating the residual supply
curve facing an individual firm. 2 This is because the data needed to identify
classical monopsony power includes firm-level labor demand shifters that are
not easy to find. 3

    In this paper, we directly estimate firm-level labor supply curves to test for
monopsony power in the college and university labor market. Our methodology
uses school-level instruments for labor demand derived from lagged application
patterns at that school to identify the residual labor supply. 4



1 See the discussions in Council of Economic Advisers (2016), U.S. Department of Treasury

(2016), Autor et al. (2017).
2 Boal and Ransom (1997) and Ashenfelter et al. (2010) survey some of the classical

monopsony literature. Types of tests for monopsony include those relating labor market
outcomes to employer concentration like Abel et al. (2018), Azar et al. (2017, 2019), Benmelech
et al. (2018), and Prager and Schmitt (2019); exploring pass-through of rents to workers as in
Kline et al. (2017) or Lamadon et al. (2019); comparing wages to workers' estimated marginal
revenue products like Isen (2013), Scully (1974), Somppi (1985), and Zimbalist (1992); and
looking at the employment effects of minimum wage and labor market policies as in Card and
Krueger (1995, 2000), Dube et al. (2007), Manning (1996), and Naidu et al. (2016). A somewhat
distinct form and style of modelling monopsony comes out of search-theoretic models of the
labor market and uses data on labor flows. This "dynamic monopsony" approach is explored
extensively in Bhaskar et al. (2002) and Manning (2003), and surveyed in Manning (2011).
3 Some prominent exceptions that have directly estimated firm level labor supply curves

include the work of Hirsch and Schumacher (1995), Matsudaira (2014), Staiger et al. (2010),
and Sullivan (1989) on nurses, Falch (2010) on teachers, and Boal (1995) on coal miners. Most
of these studies take the form of evaluating a natural experiment in the form of a wage change
from a specific one-time policy change with differential impacts on wages across firms.
Interesting direct experimental evidence where researchers vary the wage and estimate the
residual labor supply elasticity includes Dal Bo et al. (2013) and Dube et al (forthcoming).

  We use "school," "college," "university," and "institution" interchangeably in the paper.

                                               1
      The existence of monopsony power in the higher education industry has
been the subject of intense debate in previous years, but this debate has relied
on indirect or suggestive methods like comparing seniority wage premia in
higher education to other industries. 5

      The results indicate that schools do have significant monopsony power over
their tenure track faculty (that is, the tenure track labor supply curve to the
school is not flat), and that market power is highest for full professors and
smaller farther down the academic ladder. Interestingly, on the other hand,
schools are wage-takers for non-tenure track faculty. There is no significant
evidence of monopsony power over that group.

      There are interesting dimensions of variation in this monopsony power.
Private and public institutions have similar monopsony power, and the labor
supply elasticities facing schools do not seem to differ between male and female
faculty. However, the average degree of monopsony power is rising over our
sample and does not appear to be a short-run phenomenon for individual
universities. Furthermore, schools with higher levels of prestige as measured
by Carnegie classifications or average student test scores have significantly
higher monopsony power over their tenure track faculty. Larger schools do as
well.

      Section II will discuss the monopsony literature and the classical
monopsony model we estimate. Section III overviews the higher education
market and the data. Section IV presents the basic results documenting
monopsony in academic labor markets and how it has changed over time.
Section V examines the heterogeneity across schools in their monopsony
power. Section VI explores the rise of non-tenure track faculty in the last 15
years and whether monopsony helps explain it. Section VII concludes.

      II.    Monopsony in Higher Education and How to Detect It


5   See, for example, Ransom (1993), Hallock (1995), Monks and Robinson (2001).

                                               2
    Colleges and universities provide an interesting test case for labor market
monopsony. The data allow us to examine the existence of monopsony but it
remains policy-relevant in its own right. The Department of Justice has
recently argued that university conduct relating to faculty hiring can be
considered anti-competitive antitrust violations (U.S. Department of Justice,
2019).

    There are several elements suggestive of employer market power at colleges
and universities. First, the popular and trade press have argued vociferously
and at length that schools have exploited their faculty, especially adjunct and
contingent faculty, with very low wages and poor working conditions. 6

    Second, in the economic sense, schools are definitely not homogeneous
employers in terms of geography, size, prestige, and other dimensions. There
also seem to be significant switching costs for faculty that rise with tenure at
the school. By turning schools into "differentiated products," these factors raise
the prospect of employer market power.

    Rather than rely on indirect methods, our basic test of monopsony power
centers on estimating the residual labor supply curve facing each institution. A
firm with monopsony power is not a wage-taker and can cut wages below
competitive levels without losing all its workers. Hiring workers drives up
wages for infra-marginal workers. This basic idea suggests a straightforward
way to measure of monopsony (provided we can obtain sufficient data) is to
estimate the inverse labor supply curve facing the individual institution:

                 ln( ) =  ln( ) +  +  +  ,                                   (1)

where  is the wage paid by employer (here, college or university) i in period
(year) t, and  is the amount of labor (number of faculty) i employs in t. The
specification also includes school and year fixed effects. The coefficient  is the


6 See, for example, O'Shaughnessy (2012), Hoeller (2014), Fredrickson (2015), Bodenheimer
(2018), Childress (2019), and Chronicle of Higher Education (2019).

                                             3
inverse of the labor supply elasticity facing the individual school. In a
competitive labor market,  = 0 (firm level labor supply is infinite), and the firm
can hire or fire without changing the wage it pays. If  > 0, then the firm faces
an upward sloping residual labor supply. This creates an incentive to reduce
employment relative to the competitive market and put a wedge between the
marginal product of labor and the wage. For a cost-minimizing firm in the
standard model,  should be the size of this wedge, analogous to the Lerner
index in the product market monopoly context.

    The basic problem with estimating equation (1) has always come from the
data. First, it requires institution level wage and quantity data. Two, it requires
firm-level instruments for labor demand to get around the standard
identification problem. (This is the factor market analog to using firm-level cost
shifters to estimate residual demand curves in an industry, as described in
Baker and Bresnahan, 1988.) Fortunately, there is institution-level data on
wages and faculty employment as well as labor-demand shifting instruments.

               III.   Data

    Our primary data come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System (IPEDS) of the Department of Education's National Center for
Education Statistics. All schools eligible for financial aid under Title IV of the
Higher Education Act of 1965 (e.g., Pell Grants, Stafford Loans) must provide
detailed statistical information annually on their students, faculty, employees,
and institutions. It amounts to something like a census of colleges and
universities and, being mandatory, has a compliance rate of close to 100% of
institutions (though some individual data elements are missing). 7

    We take the information from the Human Resources component of IPEDS
on the number of full-time instructional faculty of various ranks and their


7More details on the IPEDS data methodology can be found in Ginder et al. (2018) or at the
online guide to the IPEDS survey components (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-
data/survey-components).

                                              4
average wage. In some specifications, we will use the information broken out by
gender, institution type, the school's student characteristics, and so on.

   Schools differ in their classifications of what they call a tenured rank (just
full professors, for example, versus associate professors). They also differ
somewhat over what constitutes the tenure track and what they term the
adjunct faculty (e.g., instructors, lecturers, non-ranked faculty). When we refer
to `tenure track' faculty, we include the three categories of instructional faculty
in IPEDS: full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. When
we refer to `non-tenure track' or `adjunct' faculty, we include instructors,
lecturers, and non-ranked faculty.

   Importantly, we will only be looking at full-time faculty. IPEDS data include
information on part time faculty headcounts, but their average salary varies
over time with both their hours (unobservable to us) and their wages. Therefore
we cannot estimate a residual supply curve for them. This is of greatest
concern regarding our non-tenure track faculty estimates, as the majority of
them are part-time, but we can only estimate a residual supply curves for the
full-time adjunct faculty. Implicitly, we are assuming that demand and wages
for the full-time and part time faculty behave in similar ways.

   Based on the data, however, this assumption might be reasonable. While
IPEDS lacks data on hours worked, it does give the headcount ratio of full-to-
part-time adjunct faculty and that has remained rather constant over the
sample. This is shown in Figure 1, which presents the time dummies from a
regression of the share of colleges' full-time adjunct faculty among all adjunct
faculty on school and time fixed effects. We will see later that the share of all
faculty that are non-tenure track has risen dramatically, but the result here
shows that the full-to-part-time ratio of non-tenure track faculty has remained
stable, bolstering our assumption of symmetric patterns between them.




                                         5
     IPEDS also includes information about enrollments and applications at the
school. We use these when designing our instrument for school-specific labor
demand, as described further below.

     We examine four year, not-for-profit colleges and universities in the 50 U.S.
states plus D.C. (i.e., we exclude two year schools, for-profit schools, schools in
U.S. territories, etc.). Given our reliance on applications data as a demand
instrument, we also drop schools with open enrollment, because they do not
report data on the number of applications they receive. The applications data
starts in the 2001-2002 academic year, so our sample spans the 14-year period
from 2002-2003 to 2016-2017. We end up with around 1650 institutions in
our sample with enough information to be included in at least one of our
empirical specifications.

                IV.     Basic Results
                a.      OLS

     We start by looking at the reduced form relationship of the log of the
average monthly wage on the logged quantity of labor. The results are in Table

     Notes: The data are taken from IPEDS with the definitions given in the paper. The sample spans the
2002-03 to 2016-17 academic years. Each regression looks at labor supply of the group listed at the top
of the column. Standard errors are shown in the parentheses and clustered at the school level. The
regressions are weighted by the total faculty head count for the school across the full sample.




                                                   6
   Each regression includes school and year fixed effects, and observations are
weighted by the school's total faculty headcount over the full sample. We
cluster standard errors by school. Column (1) shows the relationship for non-
tenure track faculty and column (2) for tenure track faculty.

   In both cases, the coefficient is close to and not significantly different from
zero. Given the inverse elasticity form, if these were the school-level supply
curves, they would suggest residual supply elasticities that are infinite. In
other words, they would imply that schools are wage takers when hiring
faculty.

             b.    Instrumenting for Institution-Level Labor Demand

   The issue, of course, is that the OLS regression is not a supply curve
because both supply and demand may be moving simultaneously. If outward
shifts in labor supply tend to reduce wages, or the reverse, this will impart a
negative bias on the estimates of  in (1).

   To identify the residual labor supply elasticity facing a single school, we
need an instrument for labor demand at that individual school. Such an
instrument would allow us to use only the variation in wages that is orthogonal
to labor supply shocks to identify the slope of the labor supply curve.

   Labor demand, like any factor demand, is derived from the demand for
firms' final products. Therefore a college's labor demand curve is shifted by
changes in students' demand for education at that school. Student enrollments
obviously reflect student demand, but they may not be a suitable instrument
because enrollment also depends on schools' admission decisions, which could
in turn be shaped by shifts in faculty labor supply. This would violate the
exclusion condition.

   Instead, we use a direct measure of student demand: the number of
undergraduate applications. Variations in applications reflect differences in
students' desires to attend particular universities whether in the cross section

                                        7
or over time, but are not dependent on any choice of the university itself. The
number of applicants is influenced by things like demographics, the availability
of foreign student visas, local and national economic prospects for potential
students, and so on. Our instrument uses undergraduate applications rather
than total applications because the former are more consistently reported
across schools in the sample. However, using total applications for the schools
where we observed them did not make a noticeable difference in the results.
Because admitted applicants do not show up as actual students until at least
one academic year after their application, we use lagged (logged) applications
for our instrument. Lagged applications are strongly correlated with following-
year enrollments in our data. 8

     Table 2 shows the results of the first stage regression separately for both
non-tenure track and tenure track faculty, as well as broken out by tenure
track faculty ranks. In each case, the lagged applications strongly predicts the
quantity of both tenure track and non-tenure track faculty in the following
year. The F-statistics for instrument relevance are well above values that might
indicate weak-instrument concerns.

 There has been a secular increase in the number of applications per student. Total
applications per school over the 14 years in our sample rose about 75% while total enrollment
rose about 20%.

                                                   8
   While we of course cannot directly test the exclusion condition, it is worth
noting that any unobservables that make a school desirable for both students
and faculty (in other words, result in labor supply shifts that are positively
correlated with changes in student demand, and therefore labor demand) will
tend to reduce the equilibrium wage as demand rises, biasing the results
toward finding no monopsony power. Only labor supply shifts that are
negatively correlated with student applications would cause our specification to
indicate more monopsony than actually exists. We did investigate the
possibility that periods of high enrollment raise the reservation wage for faculty
by raising their workload. However, we found no relationship between
enrollments or applications and the schools' student-teacher ratios. Further, as
we will see, any problematic correlated inward supply shifts would need to exist
for tenure track faculty but not non-tenure track faculty, and be larger for full
professors than associate professors, and larger in turn for associate professors
than assistant professors.

      c. Instrumental Variable Estimates of Monopsony Power

   With this school-specific labor demand shifter as our instrument, we can
estimate schools' residual labor supply curves using two-stage least squares.
We present these results in Table 3. Columns (1) and (2) show the results for
the non-tenure track and the tenure track faculty. Columns (3)-(5) then do the
regression separately within the tenure track category for each academic rank.

   The labor supply elasticity is the inverse of the coefficient. Column (1)'s
coefficient is small and not significantly different from zero, suggesting that the
schools are wage-takers for non-tenure track faculty. Column (2), however,
indicates the presence of significant market power in the market for tenure
track faculty at the school level. An idiosyncratic increase in demand for labor
at a specific school significantly drives up the wages at that school. The school-

      The results breaking out the tenure track results separately by rank in
  columns (3)-(5) indicate monopsony power in all three cases. Monopsony power
  is monotonic in rank, being the largest for full professors, smaller for associate
  professors, and smaller still (and only marginally statistically significant, p =
  0.053) for assistant professors. The implied residual labor supply elasticities
  are around 1.9 for full professors, 3.1 for associate professors, and 7.8 for
  assistant professors. These rank-specific results are consistent with tenure
  track faculty's willingness or ability to switch to another employer falling with
  rank, a result we find intuitive. We explore the implications of such product
  differentiation more below.

                  V.       Additional Results
                  a.      Wage Discrimination/Differences



  9 Note, this is not direct evidence that schools optimally exploit their market power when

  setting wages. This evidence documents only the existence of market power and, thus, the
  potential for a school to set wages below marginal product for tenure track faculty by the cost-
  minimizing amount. The actual degree to which schools exploit their market power depends on
  their conduct.

                                                    10
   The two key elements of the classic monopsony model are that firms face
upward sloping residual labor supply and that they cannot price discriminate
between workers. If schools could price discriminate, they would not face
pressure to raise wages of existing faculty when hiring new faculty.

   One of the drawbacks of the IPEDS data for our purpose is that we only
observe average wages for an entire group. We do not have different wages for
different fields of study, for example, nor for different people at each rank. Thus
we cannot directly detect if universities pay new faculty higher wages while
holding existing faculty wages fixed. Of course, to the extent such ability exists,
it would reduce the effect of hiring on wages and bias us away from a finding of
monopsony power. Nevertheless, we indirectly explore this possibility in two
ways.

   One, most public schools make faculty salary information public. The
institutional pressures for equality within ranks or to raise existing faculty
wages if new faculty wages rise should be stronger. We compare the estimated
monopsony power for public and private schools in Table 4 by including the
main effect and then an interaction with a dummy equal to one for public
schools. The results show both public and private schools face perfectly elastic
supply of non-tenure track faculty (column 1) and have monopsony power over
tenure track faculty (column 2). Neither regression indicates a statistically
significant difference in estimated elasticities across public and private schools.

   Two, we can look at whether the estimated degree of monopsony power
seems to depend on the size of the flow of new faculty. If our coefficient is just
picking up price discrimination between new versus old faculty, say, the effect
of hiring on average wages should be larger the greater is the net hiring rate of
new faculty as a share of total faculty. In other words, if average wage changes
actually only reflect wages of marginal workers, the greater are the share of
marginal workers, the larger the estimated wage effect should be. Columns (3)
and (4) interact the labor quantity with the hiring rate of new faculty in the

                                        11
 year as a share of the existing stock of faculty. (We measure the stock as the
 average of the prior and current year's faculty headcount in order to reduce the
 influence of episodes where the prior base is small and hiring rates would tend
 toward infinity.) Column (3) continues to show there is not monopsony power
 for non-tenure track faculty while column (4) shows that there is for the tenure
 track. The coefficients on the interaction terms, though, are insignificant. The
 relative amount of marginal tenure track hiring is not statistically related to the
 increase in average faculty wages.

       Notes: The data are taken from IPEDS with the definitions given in the paper. The sample spans the

 of the column. Standard errors are shown in the parentheses and clustered at the school level. The
 regressions are weighted by the total faculty head count for the school across the full sample. The
 instrument is the lagged level of ln(Applications) as described in the text. `Public' indicates a dummy
 variable for public institutions. `Flow Rate' measure the net hiring rate as a share of the average faculty
 stock from the preceding two years. Column (5) and (6) combine for men and women for the same
 institution (hence the doubling of the number of observations) and include a dummy variable for men.


      Finally, we note that some universities have formal policies to implement
 inframarginal wage increases when hiring new faculty. Such "no inversion"
 rules require that current faculty, or at least some defined subset of current

                                                     12
faculty, are not paid less than recent hires. More formal institutional policies
such as this may also be associated with less codified yet nonetheless
influential attitudes that tend to build inframarginal wage growth into hiring.

                 b.    Gender

       One issue that arises in existing the existing monopsony literature (and
that was first raised in the original discussion of monopsony in Robinson,
1969) is the tie to gender. Arguments about whether women have larger
adjustment costs or put a higher value on flexible work arrangements, and
whether such factors might give employers more monopsony power, arise in
studies like Barth and Dale-Olsen (2009), Hirsch et al. (2010), Ransom and
Oaxaca (2010), and Mas and Pallais (2017). Several other papers have
examined gender differences and discrimination in academic labor markets
specifically. 10

       Because the IPEDS data report average salary and headcount information
separately for men and for women, we can repeat our basic results and test for
different monopsony power by gender. We do this in columns (5) and (6) by
interacting the main effect with gender. We find no significant difference in the
school-specific labor supply elasticities of men and women tenure track faculty.
The inverse labor supply of male non-tenure track faculty is significantly
different from that of female non-tenure track faculty, but neither is
significantly different from zero.

                 c.    Monopsony Power Over Time

       We next consider the evidence regarding the evolution of monopsony power
over time. First, in Table 5, columns (1) and (2) interact labor quantity with a
linear time trend. Again we find evidence of market power over tenure track
faculty but not for adjunct faculty. For the tenure track faculty, though, market



10   See, for example, Hoffman (1976), Ginther and Hayes (1999) or Monks and Robinson (2000).

                                               13
power has increased at a small but significant rate over the 14-year sample.
The implied drop in the school-level labor supply elasticity is from 5.6 to 4.6.

     Notes: The data are taken from IPEDS with the definitions given in the paper. The sample spans the
2002-03 to 2016-17 academic years. Each regression looks at labor supply of the group listed at the top
of the column. Standard errors are shown in the parentheses and clustered at the school level. The
regressions are weighted by the total faculty head count for the school across the full sample. The
dependent variable in columns (1) and (2) is ln(Wit). The dependent variable in (3) and (4) is ln(W17) ­
ln(W03). The instrument is the lagged level of ln(Applications) for (1) and (2) and the long difference of
lagged applications for (3) and (4) as described in the text.


    Second, we consider whether schools' monopsony power is temporary or
persistent. To do this, we take the long difference in log wages across our full
sample for each school--the 2017 value minus the 2003 value--and regress it
on the long difference of the log number of faculty using the long difference in
lagged applications as the instrument. We show these results in columns (3)
and (4). There is a small positive coefficient on the non-tenure track faculty but
a large coefficient for the tenure track. After a long period, the coefficient is
actually a bit larger than in the basic regression, suggesting a lasting degree of
monopsony power. This may indicate that the nature of that power does not
come from the common search frictions and moving costs (which we would
think to be temporary) but rather derive from some more permanent source of
market power on the part of the schools.


                                                    14
               VI.    Correlates of Monopsony Power

     In this section we explore the potential sources of monopsony power that
the universities seem to have over their tenure track faculty.

               a.     Size and Market Share

     Perhaps the most common argument regarding market power is that it
derives from concentration. Indeed, the previous literature has often used
evidence of a wage-concentration linkage as evidence of monopsony. In Table 6,
we compute each school's share of the academic labor market at three levels of
aggregation to determine what matters. The first is the school's share of total
academic employment (in either tenure track or non-tenure track faculty as
applicable) in the school's commuting zone. The second is its share of the
academic labor market in its state. The third is its national share, which is
really just a measure of the size of the school. 11

     In columns (1) and (2) we interact the quantity term with each of these
measures. The results show that the share measure only matters for tenure
track faculty and only at the national level. The degree of a college's monopsony
power is therefore related to its size, but not any measure of local market
share. This is perhaps a sign that tenure track faculty do not seem to operate
within local labor markets, or that local concentration is jointly determined by
supply and demand factors and as such not monotonically related to market
power. The median-sized school (which employs about 0.030% of tenure track
faculty nationwide) faces a residual labor supply elasticity of around 10. At the
75th percentile (employing around 0.064% of faculty nationwide), the school's
elasticity is about 6.1, and it is 3.2 at the 90th percentile of the size distribution
(0.153% of national faculty). In columns (3) and (4) we repeat the regression




11See Berger et al. (2019) for an examination of the relationship of firm size and monopsony
power in the labor market.

                                              15
with just the national share/size interaction alone; it shows very similar
magnitude coefficients.

Zone % is the same but for the school's commuting zone.


                 b.      School Prestige and Job Differentiation

    Our second potential source of labor market power for a school would be
the equivalent of the "brand name" in the product market context. Schools with
higher levels of prestige, for example, might have greater monopsony power
over their faculty through a differentiation channel. We found no ideal
summary statistic for prestige, so we use a few proxies.

    First, in Table 7 columns (1) and (2) we use the Carnegie classifications of
universities. We allow the monopsony coefficient to vary separately by three
categories: R1 schools (doctoral universities with very high research output, of

                                                    16
   which there are around 130), R2 and R3 schools jointly (doctoral universities
   with high or moderate research output), and all other schools as the excluded
   group. The results show rather strong monopsony power over tenure track
   faculty among R1 schools as compared to non-R institutions. The coefficient on
   the R2-R3 school grouping shows an insignificant but positive coefficient of
   moderate size. Interestingly, there is some modest evidence of monopsony at
   the R schools even for non-tenure track faculty (although the combined
   coefficients are small and not significantly different from zero).

         Notes: The data are taken from IPEDS with the definitions given in the paper. The sample spans the
   2002-03 to 2016-17 academic years. Each regression looks at labor supply of the group listed at the top
   of the column. Standard errors are shown in the parentheses and clustered at the school level. The
   regressions are weighted by the average total faculty head count for the school across the full sample. The
   instrument is the lagged level of ln(Applications) and interactions as relevant in the column. The
   R1/R2/R3 classifications refer to the Carnegie classifications of research universities. SAT Q4 is a
   dummy variable for whether the school's average SAT score is in the top quartile of schools in IPEDS.
   Salary Pctile is the percentile ranking (from 1-100) of the university salary level for full professors in the
   first year of the sample.




                                                        17
       Next, in columns (3) and (4) we allow the coefficient to vary for schools in
the top quartile of average SAT score of the students. 12 Again, there is no
significant relationship between the wage and hiring for non-tenure track
faculty at any schools. But there is strong evidence of monopsony power over
the tenure track faculty at the schools with the highest student test scores.
Indeed, monopsony power appears to be concentrated among these 400 or so
schools; lower test score schools exhibit no significant evidence of monopsony
power even over their tenure track faculty.

       In columns (5) and (6) we rank schools prestige by the relative salary of full
professors in the first year in the sample. The schools with the lowest initial
pay for full professors (nationally) have a percentile ranking of 1 and the
highest have rankings of 100. We find again that a proxy for prestige is
associated with greater monopsony power.

                  VII. Monopsony and the Rise of Non-Tenure track Faculty

       The evidence indicates that schools have significant and durable
monopsony power over their tenure track faculty, and especially so at larger
and more prestigious (by several measures) schools. In contrast, they are price-
takers for non-tenure track faculty.

       That asymmetry raises an interesting implication regarding substitution
toward adjunct faculty as universities increase their scale.

       There has been a well-documented rise in the share of non-tenure track
faculty at American universities during our sample (see American Association
of University Professors, 2017). Our data document the same thing. Figure 2
shows the year dummies from a regression of the share of non-tenure track
faculty among total full-time faculty on school and year dummies. The mean
share in the sample started at around 12% in 2003. The figure documents a



12   Unsurprisingly, using ACT scores instead of SAT scores did not change the results.

                                                18
roughly 50% increase in (in our case full-time) non-tenure track faculty share
over the sample. 13

     The standard discussion of this rise centers on the bargaining power of
universities and their ability to exploit adjunct faculty. Indeed, this has been
the rallying point of efforts at several universities of the adjunct faculty to
unionize in order to improve their bargaining power.

     Our results raise the important point that pay can be low for adjunct
faculty without that indicating universities having market power in the
traditional monopsony sense. In other words, our results indicate that low
equilibrium wages for adjunct faculty may arise from the aggregate labor
supply curve of adjunct faculty is shifted out enough relative to demand to
result in a low market wage. It is not because individual universities are
holding back on hiring more adjuncts to avoid raising their wages.

     In addition, we know that there has been a dramatic expansion of both
enrollments and applications to schools over this time period (resulting from
demographic changes, a rise in international demand, and increasing returns
to education, among other reasons). We can see this in our data. Figure 3 plots
the year dummies from regressions of log applications and log enrollments on
institution and year fixed effects. If tenure track and non-tenure track faculty
are substitutes, and schools have monopsony power over one and the other, we
would expect expanding universities to shift their labor mix toward the
competitive input, as the monopsonistic input becomes increasingly expensive.

     The rate of this shift depends on the slope of the residual labor supply
curve for tenure track faulty as well as the production function for the school.
The latter parameterizes the output elasticity of each type of labor and the



13We found the same thing plotting year dummies from a regression including part-time
faculty, as well. This is fully in keeping with our argument earlier in the paper that the share of
full-time adjunct faculty has remained constant even as the share of adjunct faculty has
increased substantially.

                                                19
degree of substitutability between them. We do not have a straightforward way
to estimate the production function directly. However, we can look at indirect
evidence to get a sense of how much of the rise of non-tenure track faculty
might be tied to universities' monopsony power over tenure track faculty.

   First, we take the first stage of our IV results from Table 3 above, where we
estimated a relationship between the number of applications to a school and
the number of faculty of each type. We can use this to compute a projected
impact of the 75-log-point increase in applications over the sample on the
quantity of tenure track and non-tenure track faculty. An important flaw in
this calculation, of course, is that such estimates are premised on there not
being an aggregate labor supply elasticity effect. This calculation predicts how
the aggregate shares of each type of faculty would change if all schools
expanded hiring simultaneously, but does so using relationships from variation
in how individual schools changed hiring when their applications changed. If
the aggregate labor supply elasticity of tenure track and non-tenure track
differs, extrapolating the cross section in this way would be mistaken. The
direction of the bias could go either way.

   That caveat noted, the first stage results from Table 3 imply that a 75-log-
point increase in applications would correspond to an increase in non-tenure
track faculty of 18 log points and of tenure track faculty of 6 log points. This
implied increase in the share of non-tenure track faculty accounts for about
20% of the total increase observed in the data. In other words, the substitution
toward adjuncts would have been about 20% smaller if colleges faced flat
residual labor supply curves for tenure track faculty.

   The second bit of suggestive evidence that tenure track monopsony is tied
to the rise of non-tenure track faculty is to compare the rise across schools
that the results suggest have more or less monopsony power. We ought to see
that larger and more prestigious schools should have substituted more heavily
toward non-tenure track faculty.

                                        20
   Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the year dummies from regressions of the share of
faculty at a school that is non-tenure track on school and year dummies. Each
figure compares these estimates for sets of schools that we found above exhibit
higher and lower monopsony power. In each case, we see a much larger
increase in the share of non-tenure track faculty at schools with more
estimated labor market power. Specifically, larger schools (Figure 4), higher
SAT score schools (Figure 5), and higher initial full professor salary schools
(Figure 6) each saw larger growth in their use of non-tenure track faculty. This
suggests that monopsony may be playing an important role in recent years'
shift away from tenure track faculty.

             VIII. Conclusion

   We have developed and applied a method for testing for the presence and
measuring the amount of monopsony power of colleges and universities in the
US. We use direct estimation of the residual supply curve facing each
institution using demand instruments. The results document that schools have
no significant monopsony power over adjunct faculty, but do hold substantial
and lasting monopsony power over tenure track faculty.

   The monopsony power is monotonic in academic rank but does not seem to
differ across men and women faculty. It has been rising over our sample.
Market power is concentrated at larger schools as well as at more prestigious
schools, as measured by Carnegie classifications, student test scores, and
other measures.

   The presence of market power over the tenure track part of the faculty gives
universities an incentive to shift to non-tenure track labor when demand rises
(in order to prevent driving up tenure track wages). By that means, monopsony
has likely played some role in the rise of adjunct faculty in recent years.
Consistent with this, we find that schools with larger estimated market power
have shifted more intensively to adjunct faculty than those with less.


                                        21
   While we do not have direct evidence on whether schools are fully exploiting
their market power by the degree implied by cost-minimization of a
monopsonistic employer, the degree of market power they have over their
tenure track faculty implies they could sustain a rather substantial wedge
between wages and marginal product of labor.
