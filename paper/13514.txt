                                            ABSTRACT

Low-achieving students in many school districts are retained in a grade in order to allow them to gain
the academic or social skills that teachers believe are necessary to succeed academically. This practice
is highly controversial, with many researchers claiming that it leads to higher dropout rates although
selection issues have complicated previous analyses. In this paper, we use a regression discontinuity
design to examine the impact of grade retention on high school completion. We find that grade retention
leads to a modest increase in the probability of dropping out for older students, but has no significant
effect on younger students.

I. Introduction

        In most developing countries and some developed countries, students are promoted from

one grade to the next based on their academic performance. This was once the case in the United

States. Starting in the mid-1960s, however, educators became concerned that retention (i.e., the

practice of requiring students to repeat a grade) adversely impacts social, emotional and cognitive

development among children, and leads at-risk students to drop out of school. Since this time,

grade retention has gone in and out of vogue among educators in the United States, although it has

remained relatively rare since the early 1960s.

        The recent push for educational accountability, however, has brought this issue back to the

forefront of education debates. In an effort to improve student achievement, many states have

recently implemented policies that require elementary school children to meet explicit performance

goals in order to be promoted. Indeed, nineteen states explicitly tie student promotion to

performance on a state or district assessment (ECS 2000) and three of the largest school districts in

the country – New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago – have similar policies. These policies are

intended largely to provide incentives to students, teachers and parents, although advocates claim

that retaining those students who cannot meet the promotional standards will also benefit the

students themselves.

        On the other hand, critics argue that retention will harm those low-achieving students most

at risk of failure. They point to a vast research literature within education documenting the

negative impacts of retention, particularly in terms of reducing high school completion.1 Because

  In a survey of 47 empirical studies with a variety of academic achievement measures, Holmes (1989) found that
retained students scored 0.19 to 0.31 standard deviations below comparable students who had not been retained.
Moreover, a variety of studies have found that retention is associated with an increased likelihood of dropping out
(Shultz, Toles et al. 1986, Rumberger 1987, Grissom and Shepard 1989, Fine 1991, Roderick 1994). Several more
recent studies have found moderate, positive effects of retention (Karweit 1991, Pierson and Connell 1992, Alexander,
Entwisle et al. 1994, Edie and Showalter 2001, Dworkin, Lorence et al. 1999).

retention decisions are typically made by the teacher or school principal on the basis of a host of

unobservable student characteristics such as maturity or parental involvement, however, all of these

studies are plagued by serious selection issues.

        The introduction of a student accountability program in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS)

provides an opportunity to circumvent these selection concerns. In 1996, the CPS instituted an

accountability policy that tied promotional decisions to performance on standardized tests, resulting

in a highly non-linear relationship between current achievement and the probability of being

retained.2 In prior work, we used the variation generated by this non-linearity to examine the effect

of grade retention on short-run achievement gains. We found no consistent differences in the

performance of retained versus promoted students in the short-run (Jacob and Lefgren 2004).

        In this paper, we utilize a similar identification strategy to examine the long-run effects of

retention on high school completion and cognitive skills. We begin by examining the effect of

grade retention in sixth and eighth grade on the likelihood of dropping out of school. We find that

sixth grade retention does not have a significant impact on the likelihood that a student will drop

out, or the age at which a student will drop out. This suggests that students at risk of retention drop

out soon after they are legally able, regardless of whether they are held back in sixth grade. On the

other hand, retention in eighth grade increases the likelihood that a student will drop out by roughly

8 percentage points, or 14 percent.

        To reconcile these results, it is important to realize that interventions in one period interact

with policies and opportunities in subsequent periods. In particular, students who are retained in

the sixth grade are significantly less likely to be retained in the eighth grades when they face high-

2
  In prior work, we have examined the potential motivational effects of these requirements and found that the policy
increased achievement, particularly among older students (Jacob 2005). In this analysis, we set aside the incentives
associated with the policy and instead focus on the direct academic consequences of summer school and grade
retention for those students who fail to meet the promotional standards.

stakes testing again. In our sample of students scoring close to the promotional cutoffs in sixth

grade, retained students began high school only about one fifth of a year after their promoted peers

on average. In contrast, many students retained in the eighth grade were able to take advantage of

compensatory policies to rejoin their original cohort, but still began high school over 0.4 years later

than promoted students. Because students retained in earlier grades have more opportunities to

catch up with their peers, retention in these grades has less severe long-term impacts on school

completion than does later grade retention.

       Interestingly, among students who ultimately drop out, grade retention has little impact on

the age at which the students drop out, but does reduce the number of credits earned in high school.

This suggests that students who face the greatest risk of dropout fail to catch up with their peers in

the same way that is observed among the broader population of retained students.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on the

Chicago accountability policy. Section 3 describes our data and Section 4 explains our empirical

strategy. Section 5 presents findings the results, and Section 6 concludes.



2. Background

       In this section, we briefly describe the Chicago accountability policy and then discuss the

potential impacts of the grade retention. Because of the myriad channels through which retention

might operate, we argue that the theoretical impact of grade retention on student outcomes is

ambiguous and is likely to vary by the age of retention.

       In 1996-97, Chicago instituted a policy to end social promotion – the practice of passing

students to the next grade regardless of their academic skills or school performance. Under the

policy, students in third, sixth, and eighth grade were required to perform at predefined levels in



                                                   4
both reading and mathematics in order to be promoted to the next grade. In Spring 1997, the

promotion standards for third, sixth, and eighth grade were respectively 2.8, 5.3, and 7.0 grade

equivalents3, which roughly corresponded to the 15-20th percentile in the national achievement

distribution.4 Students who did not meet the standard in the spring were required to attend a six-

week summer school program, after which they could retake the exams. Those who passed the

August exams moved on to the next grade. Students who again failed were required to repeat the

grade.5

          One of the most notable aspects of the Chicago accountability policy was the large fraction

of students that were affected. In the first three years of the program, roughly 30-40 percent of

students in grades three, six and eight failed to meet in the promotional requirements in the spring,

and each year approximately 10-20 percent of students in these grades were eventually retained.

In comparison, between 1993 and 1995 only one or two percent of the students in these grades

were retained.

          The structure of the accountability program does allow retained students to catch up to the

remainder of their cohort. Students who were retained in eighth grade had an opportunity to re-

take the exams the following year. If they passed at this point, they were able to rejoin their

original cohort in the second semester of ninth grade. Furthermore, insofar as students who were

retained in third or sixth grade entered the next accountability grade (i.e., sixth or eighth grade

respectively) at a higher level than their promoted counterparts, they were less likely to be retained

3
  The grade equivalent scale is a nonlinear but monotonic transformation of the raw score (i.e., the number of items
answered correctly), which is created such that a student at the 50th percentile in the nation scores at the eighth month
of her current grade. For example, a third grader performing at the national average will score 3.8 grade equivalents.
Hence, third grade students in Chicago who scored more than one grade below average were subject to retention. The
ITBS is reported in units of one-tenth of a grade equivalent, with 10 potential values reported for each grade which
reflect ten months of school per academic year (e.g., 3.0 to 3.9 inclusive).
4
  The CPS has raised the promotional cutoffs several times since 1997. The eighth grade cutoff was raised to 7.2 in
1998, 7.4 in 1999 and 7.7 in 2000. The sixth grade cutoff was raised to 5.5 in 2000.



                                                            5
in that subsequent accountability grade. Also, retained students may be better prepared to pass

their high school courses and thus accumulate high school credits at a faster pace. Finally, once

students reach high school, they are able to attend summer school in order to obtain credits at a

faster rate. For these reasons, the impact of grade retention may well be mitigated through a

combination of optimizing behavior on the part of students and their increased capacity to

overcome subsequent hurdles to graduation.

           As mentioned above, in prior work we found that the retention induced by the new

accountability policy did not affect student achievement in the short-run (Jacob and Lefgren 2004).

A subsequent study examined dropout rates after the introduction of the Chicago accountability

policy (Allensworth 2005). Focusing strictly on 8th graders, this study examined the interaction

between retention per se (which was predicted to increase dropout rates) and rising achievement

levels experienced by students after the introduction of the accountability policy (which was

predicted to decrease dropout rates). Using data on cohorts before and after the introduction of the

policy, and controlling for a series of background characteristics including latent 8th grade

achievement, the authors find that grade retention under accountability was positively associated

with the likelihood of dropping out, although less so than grade retention that occurred among pre-

accountability cohorts.

           The analysis below builds on this earlier work. In particular, we focus specifically on the

impact of grade retention, and pay particular attention to the differential impact of this “treatment”

across different age groups and how these policies (i.e., retention in both 6th and 8th grade) interact

with each other. Moreover, following our earlier work, we utilize a regression discontinuity

    Students over the age of fifteen who were retained were placed in special “transition” centers.

approach that should mitigate the potential selection biases associated with OLS comparisons,

even those that control for a rich set of observable characteristics.



3. Data

        This study utilizes administrative data from the Chicago Public School system. Student

records provide individual level information on enrollment, demographics and achievement scores.

Unique student identification numbers allow us to follow individual students throughout their

tenure in the public school system. School level data provides demographic and school resource

information, including the racial and socio-economic composition at the school.

        The baseline sample consists of students who were (a) enrolled in the third, sixth or eighth

grades and attended summer school during the first three years of the program (1997, 1998 and

1999), (b) took both the math and reading exams in the Spring, (c) were subject to the

accountability policy, and (d) enrolled in the CPS the following Fall.6 Table 1 presents summary

statistics for our sample, with columns 1, 5 and 9 describing the full baseline sample of third, sixth

and eighth graders respectively. We see that students in the CPS are drawn from a highly

disadvantaged and minority population. More than half of all students are black and nearly one-

third of students are Hispanic. Over three quarters of the students qualify for free lunch. Of the

remainder, many receive reduced price lunch. Other striking statistics include the substantial




6
  In creating this baseline sample, we exclude roughly 9 percent of students who did not take the math or reading exam
in the Spring, an additional 11 percent who were not subject to the accountability policy due to bilingual or special
education placements, and an additional 2 percent who did not return to the Chicago Public Schools in the Fall
immediately following the Spring exam.


                                                          7
fraction of students that have attended bilingual programs, are in foster care, or live with a non-

parent relative.7

        In the analysis, we focus on a subset of these students. First, we focus on the students who

failed the promotional cutoffs in the Spring, and were therefore at-risk of retention. Second, we

limit our analysis to those students who took both the math and reading exams in August, since this

was the criteria on which the retention decision was made. Finally, because our analysis is based

on a comparison of students who barely passed the promotional criteria with those who just missed

passing, we limit our analysis sample to the set of students who scored within a 1.5 grade

equivalent range surrounding the cutoff.8 As we show below, our results are robust to alternate

choices of this range around the cutoff.

        Our final analysis sample includes 8,573 and 5,402 sixth and eighth grade students

respectively. Summary statistics for this sample is shown in columns 2, 6 and 10. Not

surprisingly, the students in our analysis sample are even more disadvantaged than the overall CPS

population. Students in our analysis sample are more likely to be black, qualify for free lunch, and

to have performed poorly on their May tests. Within this sample, just over forty percent of students

are ultimately retained. These retained students are quite similar in observables, however, to the

students in our analysis sample who are ultimately promoted.

        Our primary outcome measure is whether students have completed high school by Fall

2005. With the exception of the latest sixth grade cohort, we are measuring dropout status at least


7
  The relatively low percentage of students in special education or bilingual programs is a result of our sample
construction which excludes the majority of students in these programs since they are not subject to the promotional
policy. The relatively small number of students in these programs who were subject to the policy are included.
8
  Specifically, we focus on students who scored from one grade equivalent below the cutoff to one-half grade
equivalent above the cutoff. The asymmetry in the ranges above and below the cutoff is due to the fact that the CPS
did not perfectly enforce the grade retention policy for students scoring just below the cutoff. For this reason, the
probability of retention slopes downward in a small region below the cutoff. Thus while there is a broader range below
the cutoff than above, the range around this marginal region is roughly similar.

five years following the start of high school for all sixth and eighth grade students.9 Students who

were retained as sixth graders in 1998-99, however, will be enrolled in 12th grade in Fall 2005,

assuming that they have continued in school and progressed normally following their retention in

sixth grade. If a large fraction of students dropout in their senior year or later, including this cohort

may understate the effects we estimate. Based on the experiences of earlier cohorts, it appears that

the majority of students who leave high school do so prior to their senior year. For this reason, we

include the 1999 sixth grade cohort. We later show results excluding this cohort, which yield

qualitatively comparable results.



4. Empirical Strategy

Identification

           Prior studies have attempted to ascertain the effect of grade retention by estimating some

variant of the following basic regression:

(1)        Yi = β retaini + ΓX i + ui + ε i

where Y is the outcome, X is a vector of demographic and past performance variables, and retain is

a binary variable that takes on a value of one if a student is retained and zero otherwise, u

represents unobserved (to the researcher) student ability, ε is an error term. However, if students

are selected for retention on the basis of factors that are unobservable to the researcher and also

influence educational outcomes, such as maturity or parental involvement, then β is likely to be

biased.

           We address these selection concerns by using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to

identity the effects of grade retention. By tying student promotion to performance on standardized

9
    The third graders in our sample have progressed far enough in school to examine dropout rates.


                                                            9
tests, the Chicago accountability policy created a highly non-linear relationship between a student’s

current achievement and her probability of moving on to the next grade. In particular, students

who scored below predetermined cutoffs in either reading or math at the end of the school year

were assigned to attend summer school. Those who failed to achieve these cutoffs at the end of

summer school were required, in principle, to repeat the grade.

        August test scores, therefore, became the gatekeeper for determining promotion. Figure 1

shows the relationship between the August reading score (relative to the cutoff) and the probability

of grade retention for students who passed math and failed reading prior to summer school on the

initial May exam. The graphs are based on the three cohorts of students included in the analysis –

students who attended these grades between 1997 and 1999, who took the Spring math and reading

exams, and were included under the accountability policy. The solid line maps the predicted

probability of retention from a lowess regression with a smoothing factor of .2. The circles reflect

the actual average probability of retention for each August test score group, where the size of the

circles reflects the number of students in the group. Had the policy been strictly enforced, all

students below the cutoff would have been retained. In practice, however, some students just

below the reading and math cutoffs were promoted. Additionally, a few students who scored above

the cutoffs were retained for other reasons (e.g., failure to attend classes). Imperfect compliance to

the stated state policy led to the non-linear, though not discontinuous, relationship that we observe

in the figures.

        Three distinct regions are apparent in the graphs. Above the cutoff, nearly all the students

were promoted. Between the cutoff and .3 or .4 grade equivalents below, students had a positive

but declining probability of grade retention. We will refer to this as the marginal area. Finally,

nearly all students scoring worse than .3 or .4 grade equivalents below the cutoff were retained.



                                                  10
Roughly 24 percent of students who scored below the cutoffs at the end of summer school were

promoted, while 3 percent of students who scored above the cutoffs were retained. If we limit the

sample to those close to the cutoff, roughly 29 percent who scored below the cutoffs at the end of

summer school were promoted, while 3 percent of students who scored above the cutoffs were

retained.

       The imperfect adherence to the retention policy makes it impossible to implement a strict

regression discontinuity design (RDD). Under such a strategy, we would estimate the causal

impact of grade retention by simply comparing the outcomes of those students just below the

cutoff, all of whom were retained, to the outcomes of those just above the cutoffs, who were

promoted. In lieu of a strict RDD, however, we can take advantage of the nonlinearity between the

August scores and retention probability to employ a “fuzzy” regression discontinuity design. This

amounts to a two-stage least squares procedure in which we instrument grade retention with a

nonlinear function of the August test scores. In the second stage we control linearly (or with a

polynomial) for the same test scores. Identification arises from differences in the functional form

between the first and second stages.

       This identification strategy relies on two fundamental assumptions. First, this approach

assumes that we have appropriately accounted for the underlying relationship between August test

scores and our outcomes of interest. Even in the absence of the retention policy, student

achievement scores are clearly associated with student outcomes such as high school completion.

Since our instruments are nonlinear functions of August test scores, we must control adequately for

these same scores in our second stage models. If our choice of functional form is inadequate, our

instruments will be correlated to the residual and our strategy will yield biased treatment effect

estimates. This assumption is most likely to be satisfied if we focus our analysis on a sample of



                                                  11
individuals close to the cutoff, where the relationship between test-scores and the probability of

dropout can be well approximated with a linear or low-order polynomial function.

       Second, this strategy assumes that once we have controlled for continuous measures of

August achievement, the nonlinear measures we use as instruments are not correlated with any

unobserved student characteristics that could independently influence the outcome of interest. This

assumption is closely related to the first. In most RD designs, the specific concern here is that

participants can strategically influence the measure that determines treatment. McEwan and

Urquiola (2005), for example, show that more advantaged schools in Chile were able to

intentionally manipulate their grade level enrollments so that they were just below the number at

which a new classroom would be required in order to avoid the expenditures associated with an

additional teacher. The result was a sharp discontinuity in unobservable school characteristics at

exactly the cutoff that one might use to examine the effect of class size on student achievement,

which may violate this identifying assumption.

       In our case, there is little reason to believe that students had the ability or incentive to

precisely manipulate their test scores. Teacher cheating, however, may be a possible avenue of

such manipulation (Jacob and Levitt 2003). In order to test for the presence of such manipulation,

Figure A1 shows kernel density plots of the August test scores. If such manipulation occurred, we

would expect to find a discontinuity in the density function near the cutoff. For example, if

teachers edited student answer keys to ensure that the children were not retained, we might expect

to find an unusually large fraction of students scoring just above the promotional cutoff. We find




                                                   12
no unusual discontinuity immediately above or below the cutoff, suggesting that no such

manipulation occurred.10

         While Figure 1 focuses on the individuals who passed math in May and thus were only

required to pass reading in order to be promoted, our data actually offers three separate experiments

that can be used for estimating the impact of grade retention on the dropout rate:

     1. Individuals who passed math in May and needed only to pass reading in August to be

         promoted. In this case, the index that determines treatment assignment is the August

         reading score.

     2. Individuals who passed reading in May and needed only to pass math in August to be

         promoted. In this case, the index that determines treatment assignment is the August math

         score. Figure 2 shows the relationship between August math scores and the likelihood of

         grade retention for this sample. The relationship closely mirrors that seen for Group 1, the

         sample of students who failed reading.


10
  While we are not relying on a sharp RDD that involves the comparison of groups immediately below and above the
cutoffs, it is helpful to understand the magnitude of differences in skill that are suggested by students scoring at
different ranges on the exams. The reading exam focuses explicitly on comprehension and consists of 36, 44 and 50
questions for third, sixth and eighth grade respectively. In the area relevant for students at risk of retention (i.e.,
students scoring between the 10th and 20th percentile on the national distribution), there is a one-to-one correspondence
between grade equivalents and raw scores but not all GE are possible. On the 1997 exam, for example, eighth grade
students answering 16 items correctly scored a 6.7 GE while students answering 17 items correctly scored a 6.9 GE.
This means that students who scored just above the reading cutoff correctly answered just 1 or 2 items more than their
peers who scored in the marginal area, though this reflects a difference of roughly one-quarter to one-half a year’s
worth of learning. The math exam is composed of three different subsections, each of which are normed separately
and then aggregated so that the total math score is based on between 110-160 items, and there is not always a one-to-
one mapping between total raw score and total grade equivalent score. At the same time, this means that scores are the
math exam are likely a more precise measure of a student’s underlying skill. In the area relevant for students at risk of
retention, a change in 0.1 grade equivalents corresponds to two raw points for third graders and roughly 1.5 raw points
for sixth and eighth graders. Students scoring just above the cutoff answered approximately 4-8 more items correctly
than students scoring in the middle of the marginal area, which also translates to one-quarter to one-half of a year’s
worth of learning. Unlike some standardized exams, the ITBS grade equivalent (GE) scores are not created using item
response techniques (IRT), but are simply a transformation of the total raw score. For this reason, the GE metric does
not take into account that a correct response on a more difficult item may reflect greater knowledge than a correct
response on a less difficult item. Given information on the underlying item responses for each student, it would be
possible to construct an IRT score that more truly reflects a student’s underlying ability. Using this measure, one
might be able to create more precise RDD estimates by, for example, comparing students with the same IRT score who
scored just above and below the GE-based cutoff.


                                                           13
      3.   Individuals who failed both reading and math in May and thus need to pass both subjects in

           August for promotion. For this group, both math and reading scores in August determine

           promotion. Figure 3 shows the relationship between August math and reading scores and

           the likelihood of retention for this sample. As described below, we use a non-linear

           function of August scores in both subjects to instrument for grade retention.



           Though these groups differ in the particulars of how assignment to grade retention is made,

the intuition underlying our identification strategy is identical – we will exploit the sharply

nonlinear relationship between August test scores and retention controlling in a flexible manner for

the underlying relationship between achievement scores and the outcome of interest.



Estimation

           For those students in group 1 who passed math but failed reading in May, we model the

likelihood of retention as:

(2)        retain = γ 1passed reading + γ 2 marginal reading + f ( reading , math ) + ΓX + η ,

where f ( reading , math ) is a smooth function of the student’s August reading and math scores, X is

a vector of student demographic characteristics including the student’s May math and reading

scores, and η is an error term. The exogenous instruments in the equation are dummy variables

that indicate whether a student’s August reading score was at or above the cutoff (“passed

reading”) or whether the student’s August score fell just below the cutoff in what was described as

the marginal area (“marginal reading”).11


11
  We achieve the virtually identical results if we construct instruments that allow the probability of grade retention to
fall within the marginal area. Doing so, however, greatly multiplies the number of instruments used without providing
any measurable improvement in statistical efficiency.


                                                           14
       For those students in group 2 who passed reading but failed math in May, we estimate a

nearly identical first stage equation where the exogenous instruments are dummy variables for

scoring in the passing or marginal area for math in August.

(3)     retain = γ 1passed math + γ 2 marginal math + f ( reading , math ) + ΓX + η ,

       Finally, for those students in group 3, the likelihood of retention is determined by both

reading and math scores in August. While it is possible to specify this non-linearity in multiple

ways, a simple set of variables indicating whether the student passed or was marginal in each

subject captures the majority of the variation quite well. For this reason, we estimate the following

first-stage equation:

        retain = γ 1passed both + γ 2 passed reading, marginal math
(4)            +γ 3 passed math, marginal reading+γ 4 marginal both ,
               + f ( reading , math ) + ΓX + η

The exogenous instruments in this equation correspond to the different areas in Figure 3, which

maps each instrument into a location on the plane of August reading and math scores. “Passed

both” corresponds to area E, “passed reading, marginal math” to B, “passed math, marginal

reading” to C, and “marginal both” corresponds to area D. The omitted category is area A in which

students failed both reading and math.

       For the purposes of increasing our precision, we stack the data and estimate a single

treatment effect using variation from all three groups. We later show the estimates separately by

group to explore whether the effect of retention differs. To estimate the full model on the stacked

data, we run a fully interacted regression model that allows the coefficients on all of the covariates

and on the August test scores to vary by group. We constrain only the coefficient on grade

retention to be the same across groups. In the first stage, this approach is equivalent to running

completely separate specifications for each group. Our second stage, however, takes the form


                                                   15
(5)      Y = β1retain + f ( reading , math ) + λ1 group + BX + ΓW + ε ,

where Y is the academic outcome of interest, group is a set of dummy variables that index the

whether the student failed reading, failed math or failed both math and reading in May, X are

student demographics and W is a vector that includes the full set of interactions between X or f and

group.



Interpretation

         Given the nature of our identification strategy, it is particularly useful to discuss the

interpretation of the treatment effects we estimate. Imbens and Angrist (1994) emphasize the

importance of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), which they define as the average effect

of an intervention on those individuals who were induced to participate on account of variation in

the instruments. In our analysis, the instruments induced students who scored just below the cutoff

to be retained. Thus, our estimates reflect the treatment effect for those individuals who received

treatment because they scored in the marginal area of reading and/or math, which corresponded to

roughly the 12-14 percentiles in math and 20-22 percentiles in reading. Since grade retention is

generally targeted at very low-achieving students, our estimates should be particularly relevant for

policymakers.12

         Given the likelihood of heterogeneous treatment effects, it is unlikely that our estimates

capture either the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) or even the effect of Treatment-on-the-Treated


12
  It is also worthwhile pointing out that identification of the retention effect also depends on the fact that the treatment
effect does not vary over the range of reading performance below the cutoff that we use in estimation. If this treatment
effect varies greatly with reading performance below the cutoff, we will be unable to identify the baseline relationship
between current and future performance. This is because the relationship between current and future performance
below the cutoff will reflect the effect of reading performance on the efficacy of treatment. In practice, this is likely a
fairly weak assumption because the range of data we use to estimate the retention effect is still quite small, generally
less than + or – 1 grade equivalent from the cutoff. If this assumption holds, the estimated coefficient corresponds to
the LATE for those individuals who received treatment because they scored a given distance below the cutoff.


                                                            16
(TT). Unless one is willing to assume that the treatment effect is constant or does not vary

according to prior reading and math ability, one cannot use our estimates to say what would have

occurred if all students had been treated. 13 In the following sections, we examine the heterogeneity

of treatment effects across a variety of observable student characteristics such as race, gender, SES

and prior achievement.

         Several additional features of the Chicago program should also be considered when

interpreting the estimates. First, because the cutoffs were binding for a large number of children,

the social promotion policy changed the peer ability distribution for retained and promoted

students, particularly in schools where large numbers of students were held back. To the extent

that improving peer ability levels benefits students who are promoted, one might expect our

estimates to overstate the negative effects of retention associated with a more modest program.

Although even this is unclear, since students who barely passed the cutoff and were promoted are

likely to be substantially behind their peers and may struggle if the teacher is able to move more

quickly through class material. Second, the district provided some additional financial resources to

help retained students. While these allocations were modest, it is possible that they could have

improved student outcomes. Third and perhaps most importantly, under the Chicago accountability

system, retained students had multiple mechanisms through which to catch up with their peers.

While this policy may well differ from the informal retention policies used in many schools in the

past, it is likely quite similar to the large scale accountability programs being implement in cities

such as New York and Los Angeles.




13
  Similarly, if social stigma is a factor in retention, it may have been mitigated in this context by the large number of
retentions that occurred. Retaining a small number, even those with roughly the same achievement levels, may have a
different impact.

5. Results

        In this section, we discuss the effects of retention on school completion and academic

achievement. To begin, we examine the impact of sixth and eighth grade retention on the

likelihood that a student completes high school. In addition to examining dropout rates, we explore

the age at which the student left school and the number of credits she accumulated prior to leaving.

Finally, we examine the long-run effects of retention on academic achievement.



The Impact of Retention on High School Completion

        To begin, it is useful to examine the simple OLS estimates of the relationship between

grade retention and the likelihood of dropping out of high school. To maximize comparability

across designs, we limit the OLS analysis to the RDD sample described above. Note that the

outcome variable takes on a value of 1 if the student dropped out of the CPS and a value of zero if

the student graduated from the CPS. For the relatively small percent of students who left the CPS

prior to graduating or dropping out, we have set this outcome to missing.14 Of course, if retention

influences attrition from the CPS, this may bias our estimates. We show that this is not a concern

in the section below. We also included dummy variables indicating whether the observation came

from the “failed reading,” “failed math,” or “failed both” samples.

        The OLS estimates are shown in Table 2. In columns (1) and (4), we present estimates

from that include no controls. The resulting point estimates imply that grade retention is associated

with a 3 percentage point increase in the probability of dropping out for students retained in the

sixth grade and an 8 percentage point increase for students retained in the eighth grade. Given the


14
  All students in our sample should have graduated by the Fall 2005. In practice, there are a handful of students who
appear to still be enrolled in the CPS even after 5 or 6 years in high school. We have kept these observations in the
data, but excluding them does not change our results.


                                                          18
baseline probability of grade retention for sixth and eighth grade promoted students in the sample

of 53 and 57 percent respectively, these estimates suggest that grade retention increases the

likelihood of dropping out by 6 to 14 percent.

       In columns (2) and (3), we redo the analysis adding linear controls for the students’ August

reading and math scores. For sixth grade students, the point estimate on grade retention falls to

0.00. For eighth grade students, the point estimate falls by forty percent to 0.05. This suggests that

even for the relatively homogeneous group of students we examine in the RDD sample, prior

performance is significantly correlated with the likelihood of retention as well as the probability of

dropping out. Interestingly, the inclusion of a host of other demographic and prior achievement

controls in columns (3) and (6) does not significantly change the point estimates.

       The OLS analysis suggests that observable student characteristics are correlated with both

the probability of being retained and of dropping out of high school. To the extent that unobserved

characteristics are similarly correlated, the OLS estimates are likely biased. We address this

concern by estimating the RDD models described above.

       Table 3 shows the results from our first stage regression. In the interests of brevity, we

show only the coefficients on our instruments, though we control for August and earlier math and

reading scores as well as the full set of demographic characteristics and prior achievement

measures described earlier. All of the instruments are individually significant. As expected, for

students who failed reading and passed math in May, scoring in the marginal area in reading in

August is associated with large reductions (23 to 54 percentage points) in the risk of grade

retention. For students in this group who score at or above the reading cutoff in August, the

reduction in the probability of grade retention is even larger (between 68 and 87 percentage points).

Examining the coefficients for the students who failed math or failed both reading and math in



                                                  19
May, we see very similar results. Overall, the table suggests that our instruments have strong

power for predicting the probability of grade retention. The F-statistics of our instruments are

138.31 for sixth graders and 367.14 for eighth graders, suggesting that there is little cause to worry

that our estimates suffer from bias associated with weak instruments. The larger F-statistics for the

eight grade students is attributable to closer compliance on the part of the school district to the

stated policy for this group.

       Table 4 shows the second stage RDD estimates. For comparison, column (1) and (4) show

our OLS estimates with the full set of covariates. Columns (2) and (5) show the RDD estimate in

which we only control for linear measures of the August test scores. Note that we include

interactions to allow the effect of August math and reading scores to differ by summer school

group. For example, the relationship between August math scores and the future probability of

dropping out may be different for the failed reading group relative to the failed math group if the

former did not take the August math test seriously. Similarly, one might suspect that the

relationship between August scores and the likelihood of dropping out differs for the group that

failed both reading and math in May since this group was noticeably lower achieving than either

the failed math only or failed reading only groups. The final columns show the RDD estimates that

control for past test scores as well student demographics. The comparison between the RDD

estimates with and without covariates provides a useful check on the validity of our instruments. If

the exclusion restriction is met, once we control for smooth measures of August test scores, the

non-linear terms of August test scores that we use as instruments should not be correlated with any

unobserved factors that determine our outcome of interest. If our estimates change significantly




                                                   20
with the inclusion of other covariates, this would suggest that our instruments may be picking up

some factors that determine the likelihood of dropping out independent of retention.15

         Consider first the results for the sixth graders. The point estimate shown in column (2) is

actually negative, though very small in absolute value at -0.02. Adding the covariates in column

(3) yields a point estimate of -0.04, which is not significantly different from the prior specification.

This provides evidence to support our identifying assumption. The standard error on the estimates

in column (3) implies a confidence interval between -.12 to .04. Given the baseline dropout rate of

53 percent, we can reject that grade retention increases the drop out rate by more than 8 percent. It

therefore seems plausible that grade retention in the sixth grade has little substantive effect on the

probability a student drops out.

         Finally, it is perhaps worth noting that while the difference between the estimates in column

1 and 3 are not statistically significant at conventional levels, the direction of the change suggests

that the OLS estimates may be biased upward. Given the formulaic nature of the retention policy,

this must come about as a result of teachers and administrators either (a) providing waivers to

students who have unobservable good attributes or (b) retaining students for reasons other than test

scores (recall that a small number of students were retained for poor attendance or grades).

Another possible explanation for the difference between the OLS and the RDD estimates involves

the heterogeneity in effects. The RDD estimates reflect the impact of grade retention on those

students who are retained as a result of scoring just below the marginal area on the August exam,

whereas the OLS estimate captures the average effect for all students within the sample.




15
  Of course, the true concern is that our instruments are correlated with unobservable factors. However, to the extent
that the instruments are correlated with the observable covariates, one might be concerned that they are also correlated
with unobserved determinants of dropping out.


                                                           21
       For eighth graders, the picture is somewhat different. The RDD estimates shown in column

(6) suggests that grade retention increases the probability of dropping out by 8 percentage points, or

roughly 14 percent. Again the specification is largely invariant to the set of covariates that are

included. It thus appears that eighth grade retention is more harmful than sixth grade retention,

possibly due to the greater social dislocation caused by preventing students from moving to high

school with their peers.

       As described above, if grade retention influences the propensity to leave the CPS, the

dropout estimates above may be biased by differential attrition. Table 5 examines this possibility.

We show RDD estimates of the impact of grade retention on the likelihood that a student will move

to another public school district or transfer to a private school. In our sample, roughly 10-15

percent of promoted students switch public school districts and 2-3 percent transfer to a private

school. The RDD estimates are uniformly small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that

differential attrition is not a concern in the analysis. In addition, results presented in Appendix

Table A1 demonstrate that our main findings are not sensitive to a variety of alternative

specifications, including the addition of second and third order polynomials or changes in the area

around the cutoff we use for the estimation.

       Table 6 examines the heterogeneity of effects across a variety of subgroups. Several

interesting facts emerge. First, it appears that there was little effect of retention for the 1997

cohort, the first group of children to experience the policy. Second, for the eighth graders, it

appears that the largest impact of retention occurred among African-American girls who failed both

reading and math in May. To the extent that students who failed both reading and math were

noticeably lower achieving than those students who failed only one subject, these results suggest

that retention is most harmful to the very lowest achieving students in the system. The



                                                   22
disproportionate effect on girls is interesting as well. Girls have substantially lower dropout rates

than boys across the ability distribution in general, and in our RDD sample as well. For example,

in our sample of low-achieving students, 49 percent of girls who are promoted in eighth grade drop

out compared with 66 percent of promoted boys. The point estimates suggest that grade retention

has virtually no effect on the likelihood that boys will drop out of school. Hence, the retention

effect of 16 percentage points for girls implies that retention is simply moving girls up to the

dropout likelihood of boys. Finally, the fact that retention seems to affect African-American

students more dramatically than Hispanic students is interesting, although we do not have any good

explanation for it at this point.



Understanding the Dynamic Impacts of Grade Retention on Academic Progression

        While the analysis above provides a reduced form estimate of the impact of grade retention

on high school completion, it is important to consider why the effect sizes may differ for retention

in the sixth and eighth grades. In addition, by examining the impact of grade retention on academic

progression, we can gain some insight into how retention interacts with the subsequent educational

environment to mitigate possible adverse effects. For these reasons, we examine the following

additional questions: (1) How does grade retention in the sixth grade affect the probability of

retention in the eighth grade? (2) How does grade retention in the sixth and eighth grade affect the

age that students begin high school? (3) What is impact of grade retention on the age of high school

completion? (4) What is the effect of retention on the age of dropout? (5) What impact does

retention have on the number of credits a student has obtained at the time she leaves school, either

by graduating or by dropping out?




                                                  23
       Table 7 presents some estimates that address these questions. In the first panel, we see that

retention in the sixth grade is associated with a 9 percentage point decline in the probability of

retention. This suggests that students held back in an early grade are indeed more prepared to be

successful when they ultimately advance to subsequent grades. Examining the next column, we see

that students retained in the sixth grade begin high school only 0.21 years later than similar

students who are promoted. This suggests that over three years, we observe massive convergence

of the retained students with their original cohort. This is due both to the existence of multiple

accountability grades and to the fact that retained students were offered an opportunity to rejoin

their cohort by passing an exam in the following January (one semester into their retained year).

Given the rapid rate of convergence, it is perhaps unsurprising that we ultimately observe little

impact of sixth grade retention on total credits accumulated or the age that students leave school.

       Moving down to the next panel, we can examine how grade retention in the eighth grade

affects the progression of children through school. Interestingly, we see that retained students still

begin high school only 0.42 years later than promoted students. This suggests that the majority of

students who are retained in the eighth grade manage to rejoin their cohort before the next

academic year. This is entirely due to the opportunity provided by the January retest. Despite the

substantial convergence of retained students, retained students ultimately leave school at roughly

the same time as their promoted peers, having earned significantly fewer credits.

       The next panel focuses on those students who ultimately complete high school. Here we

are essentially splitting the sample on an endogenous (i.e., outcome) variable. Because retention

has no impact on high school completion for sixth graders, this does not introduce any

complications. When looking at the eighth grade result where we do find a modest impact of

retention on dropout rates, however, one should bear in mind that the results may be subject to



                                                  24
selection bias due to the impact of grade retention on the fraction of students who actually complete

high school.

       The impact of grade retention on the age when such students begin high school is similar to

that of the overall sample. For students retained in the sixth grade, those who ultimately graduate

do so approximately one-fifth of a year later than their promoted counterparts. This corresponds

closely to the delay they experience entering high school, suggesting that virtually no convergence

occurs after they actually begin high school. For students retained in the eighth grade who

ultimately graduate, they do appear to make up some time in high school—perhaps via summer

school classes. They graduate, however, with about five percent fewer credits than their promoted

counterparts.

       The final panels of the table examine the academic progression of students retained in the

sixth and eighth grades who ultimately drop out from high school. Examining those students

retained in the sixth grade, we see that their high school experience is delayed by about the same

amount as the overall sample. Furthermore, we see that there is little impact either on the total

credits accumulated or on the age when students drop out. These results are similar for students

retained in the eighth grade—grade retention appears to have little impact on either on the number

of credits accumulated or upon the age of dropout.



The Impact of Retention on Cognitive Skill

       Given that the effects of grade retention are only modest on school completion and years

attended, it is natural to examine whether grade retention affects the rate of learning. When

considering how grade retention influences academic achievement, it is critical to consider the

counterfactual. It is possible to compare retained and promoted students at the same grade when



                                                 25
retained students will be one year older, at the same age when retained students will be in a lower

grade, or at the time of when students complete or withdraw from school. The proper comparison

depends, of course, on the inference one hopes to draw. Most educators focus on the same grade

comparisons, consistent with the view that retention is intended to provide children extra time to

catch up with their peers. Such comparisons, however, do not tell us necessarily whether grade

retention increases the rate of learning or the ultimate amount of knowledge a student acquires at

the time she leaves (through graduation or dropout) high school. For our purposes, same age

comparisons are more useful as they indicate the impact of grade retention on the rate of learning.

Performance on a high school exit exam if universally administered would also be helpful as they

have the potential to measure the impact of grade retention on the total amount of knowledge

accumulated.

        For practical reasons, however, we are limited to same grade comparisons. In particular,

the incentives faced by test-takers in eighth grade (with high-stakes testing) are much greater than

is true in the seventh grade. Thus any same-age comparisons made for elementary school students

are likely to be biased. In high school, same age comparisons are impossible because standardized

tests are administered only in the eleventh grade. For these reasons we perform same grade

comparisons, bearing in mind that retained students will likely be older at the time they take the

exam.

        The first panel of Table 8 examines students who faced grade retention in the third grade

and were subsequently tested in the eighth grade. Examining the panel, we see that grade retention

had no impact on the probability that students actually took the exam. The fact that only 70 percent

of students who faced grade retention in the third grade took the eighth grade exam reflects the

mobility of the student population rather than dropout behavior. While grade retention has no



                                                 26
impact on the probability that students are tested, it does increase the age at which students take the

eighth grade exam. In particular, students retained in the third grade are just over a quarter of a

year older when they take the eighth grade exam. If retained students had no opportunity to catch

up with their peers and promoted students had no opportunity to fall behind at a later date, we

would expect retained students to be a full year older when taking the exam. The fact that retained

students are only a quarter of a year older indicates that, over the course of five years, most of the

retained students had the opportunity to catch up with their peers. Examining the achievement

effects, we see that retained students are performing at the same or higher level when they reach the

eighth grade than are promoted students.

       The bottom two panels present estimates of sixth and eighth grade retention on 11th grade

test scores. For both grades, we see that retained and promoted students were equally likely to take

the exam, but that retained students were slightly older at the time they were tested. As with the

third graders, the fact that the coefficients are considerably less than one suggests that retained

students were largely able to catch up with their peers. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, the

differences in achievement are quite small, and generally not significantly different than zero.



6. Conclusions

       Summarizing our findings, grade retention in the sixth grade appears to have few negative

long term consequences. In particular, retained students are no more likely to drop out than are

promoted students. Additionally, those students who ultimately drop out do so at the same time

regardless of whether or not they were retained. Retained students who complete high school

attend school for about 0.2 years longer than their promoted peers.




                                                  27
           In contrast, grade retention in the eighth grade reduces the probability that a student

completes high school by 8 percentage points or about 14 percent. This suggests that grade

retention late in a student’s academic career can have a significant impact on academic attainment.

Examining the impacts of grade retention separately on those students who ultimately drop out, we

find no evidence that grade retention affects the timing of dropout. For students who ultimately

graduate, grade retention significantly increases the total amount of time spent in elementary and

secondary school. While interesting, these last two findings should be viewed as merely suggestive

for the 8th graders due to concerns regarding selection bias.

           To reconcile the difference between the sixth and eighth grade retention effects, we

examine how retention in these grades affects subsequent academic progression. In the Chicago

Public Schools, there exist multiple mechanisms for retained students to catch up with their original

cohort. Because sixth graders have more opportunities to converge with their cohort, they are able

to effectively mitigate the long-term impacts of grade retention.16 For example, by being retained

in the sixth grade, they are less likely to be retained in the eighth. Retained sixth graders start high

school only one-fifth of a year after their promoted colleagues. Students retained in the eighth

grade, on the other hand, have fewer chances to catch up with their promoted colleagues, begin

high school later, suffer more in terms of high school completion.

           Our findings underscore the need of understanding educational interventions in the broader

context of subsequent interventions and optimizing behavior on the part of students, teachers, and

schools. An intervention in one period affects eligibility for subsequent interventions and may

change student incentives in ways that may attenuate any negative long term consequences. The

importance of institutional framework in understanding the long term effects of grade retention


16
     This assumes that the social stigma associated with retention is not the primary negative effect in this context.


                                                              28
suggest that our findings may not generalize to all settings. They are likely useful, however, for

understanding the impact of grade retention in other large districts with similar accountability

policies, including New York and Los Angeles.

Notes: The sample in columns 1 and 5 contains all students who were enrolled in the appropriate grades in the Spring of 1997, 1998 and 1999, were included
under the accountability policy, and took the May math and reading exam. The sample in columns 2 and 6 is limited to those students who failed the math
and/or reading exam(s) in May, attended summer school, took the August math and reading exams, and were either retained or promoted the following year.
The samples in columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 are subsets of the samples in columns 2 and 6 respectively.

Notes: Sample includes students in the RDD analysis sample. All models include main effects indicating the
student’s summer school group (i.e., failed math only, failed reading only, or failed both math and reading) along
with controls for August and May test scores in math and reading, prior student achievement, and student
demographics as well as interactions that allow the impact of all of these covariates to differ based on the summer
school group. As described in the text, the key instruments are a set of nonlinear measures of August test scores.
Huber-white standard errors are shown in parenthesis. Mean dropout rates of promoted students in each sample are
shown in square brackets. *=significant at 10% level. **=significant at 5% level.

Notes: The number of observations varies across specifications due to students dropping out. In addition, there are fewer observations included in the 8th grade
retention specifications because only students who were enrolled in 8th grade in the CPS for a full year were eligible for retention and some students who did not
drop out skipped 8th grade or left the system for this grade and later returned. Those with missing credit data are excluded from specifications in columns 2-6.
The number of observations in the last column is lower because students who are still enrolled in the CPS at the end of our time period are not included in the
estimation.

Notes: Sample includes students in the RDD analysis sample who graduated high school by Fall 2005. The number of observations in the samples is slightly
higher than the number of observations included in some specifications because a small number of students are missing credit information. All models include
main effects indicating the student’s summer school group (i.e., failed math only, failed reading only, or failed both math and reading) along with controls for
August and May test scores in math and reading, prior student achievement, and student demographics as well as interactions that allow the impact of all of these
covariates to differ based on the summer school group. As described in the text, the key instruments are a set of nonlinear measures of August test scores.

Notes: Sample includes students in the RDD analysis sample who dropped out of high school by Fall 2005. The number of observations varies across
specifications due to students dropping out. In addition, there are fewer observations included in the 8th grade retention specifications because only students who
were enrolled in 8th grade in the CPS for a full year were eligible for retention and some students who did not drop out skipped 8th grade or left the system for
this grade and later returned. Those with missing credit data are excluded from specifications in columns 2-6. The number of observations in the last column is
lower because students who are still enrolled in the CPS at the end of our time period are not included in the estimation. All models include main effects
indicating the student’s summer school group (i.e., failed math only, failed reading only, or failed both math and reading) along with controls for August and
May test scores in math and reading, prior student achievement, and student demographics as well as interactions that allow the impact of all of these covariates

Notes: Sample includes all students in the RDD analysis sample. The outcome measure for the third grade cohort is
the ITBS test scores the child received the first time that she took the 8th grade exam. The test score metric is a
developmental scale score. The outcome measure for the sixth and eighth grade cohorts is the 11th grade PSAE test
score that the child received the first time that she took the exam. The test score metric is a scale score. Within our
sixth and eighth grade RD analysis samples, roughly 80 percent of students who take the 11th grade test go on to
graduate high school. All models include main effects indicating the student’s summer school group (i.e., failed
math only, failed reading only, or failed both math and reading) along with controls for August and May test scores
in math and reading, prior student achievement, and student demographics as well as interactions that allow the
impact of all of these covariates to differ based on the summer school group. As described in the text, the key
instruments are a set of nonlinear measures of August test scores. Huber-white standard errors are shown in
parenthesis. *=significant at 10% level. **=significant at 5% level
