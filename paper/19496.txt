JEL No. I1,I12

                                            ABSTRACT

Non-compliance with medication therapy remains an unsolved and expensive problem for health care
systems around the world. Yet we know little about the factors that determine a patient’s decision
to follow treatment recommendations. This study uses a unique panel dataset comprising all prescription
drug users, physicians, and all prescription drug sales in Denmark over seven years to analyze the
contributions of doctor-, patient-, and drug-specific factors to the adherence decision. Our findings
have important implications for the design of incentive schemes targeted at improving chronic disease
management.

1    Introduction

Individual health behavior plays a vital role in determining the long-term health of the population.
Advances in medical technology and treatment breakthroughs cannot be fully realized if patients do
not adhere with the prescribed pharmaceutical therapy or implement the recommended changes in
lifestyle that accompany it. The important role of patient medication non-adherence as a contributor
to preventable morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated in numerous studies and across many
conditions (see review by Krueger et al, 2005). Non-adherent patients with heart failure are more
than twice as likely to have been admitted to a hospital and to die from heart failure (Miura et al,
2005). Similarly striking differences in health outcomes have been reported across adherence levels
with beta blockers, asthma medication, and anti-psychotics (Kruger et al, 2005). Non-adherence
imposes significant monetary costs on the health care system1. Studies have found that between
one- and two-thirds of medication-related hospital admissions in the United States are due to poor
medication adherence, with a cost of around $100 billion per year (Osterberg and Blasche, 2005).

Past research has identified a range of factors that may affect the patient’s decision to follow the
prescribed medication regimen. These factors include but are not limited to: side effects, regimen
complexity, limited patient attention and cognition, ineffective provider-patient communication,
confusion about treatment instructions, misperception of the treatment’s necessity, lack of social
support, and financial burden (see review by Osterberg & Blasche, 2005). An important question for
policy is whether non-compliance can be addressed with appropriately designed incentives.

A review of the literature concludes that the existing evidence on the effects of patient- and
provider-centered incentive schemes on adherence is mixed (Health Affairs, 2012; Volpp and Pauly
2009). One reason for the mixed performance of incentive schemes is the lack of understanding of
the nature of the process that generates the medication adherence process. Indeed, an authoritative
recent review by RAND argues that there is little evidence on the relative contributions of factors
that affect patient adherence (Gallad et al, 2009). In particular, we do not know whether, or in what
situations, physicians are able to affect patient decisions to invest in their health. Moreover, it is not

1
  As a large contributor to health care costs, the problem of non-adherence has received significant attention in the
recent debate surrounding health care reform. Articles in popular media have presented anecdotal evidence and
proposed solutions to the problem. In discussing health care reform for the New York Times, Sandeep Jauhar wrote
that “Patient noncompliance with medical recommendations undoubtedly contributes to poor health, but it is as much a
function of poor communication, medication costs and side effects, cultural barriers and inadequate resources as it is of
willful disregard of a doctor’s advice.”
                                                            2
clear how different might be the patient response to physician effort and whether the ultimate
success of medication therapy can be entrusted solely to either one of these two agents.

This research contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we analyze the determinants of
patient adherence with prescribed therapy using administrative data from Denmark, comprising the
complete medication histories of the entire adult Danish population during the period 2004-2010.
The record of medical encounters is matched to the registry of Danish primary care physicians. As a
result, we are able to trace outpatient health care utilization and the formation of doctor-patient
matches during the period. The panel nature of the data allows us to analyze the sources of both
across- and within-patient variation in medication compliance. The universal nature of health
insurance provided by the Danish government presents a rare opportunity to study population level
determinants of adherence in a context not affected by financial barriers to health care.

Second, we study the relative contribution of provider- and patient-level factors to compliance with
therapy prescriptions. Our results show that physicians exert substantive influence on patients’
health behavior. However, we also find that a sizeable component of the variation in compliance
cannot be explained by time-invariant patient or doctor characteristics, suggesting that the quality of
the match between doctor and patient plays a role in compliance. Further analysis reveals that the
match quality induces substantial variation in adherence over time within a physician-patient pair.
In other words, adherence to the assigned therapy is in large part specific to a doctor-patient match
and evolves together with the doctor-patient relationship.

Third, we estimate the effects of medication cost on the adherence decision, contributing to the
large literature on price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs. We find that patients do respond
to higher drug prices by reducing day to day adherence rates, but the effects of medication price are
small relative to other factors.


2   Background
There are very few empirical studies on the role of physicians in fostering health-promoting patient
adherence behavior (reviews by Kruger et al, 2005 and RAND, 2009). We are not aware of any
large-scale, nationally representative research that evaluates the relative contribution of physician-
level factors to patient medication adherence. Still, some theoretical work on the issue exists. The



                                                   3
idea of rational non-adherence has been previously formalized as a “health belief model”2. The
model predicts that patients are more likely to comply with doctors’ orders when they feel
susceptibility to illness, believe that the illness will have serious consequences for their well-being,
and do not anticipate side effects. Johnston-Roberts and Mann (2003) examine patients’ diaries to
find intentional skipping of medications to avoid side effects, despite awareness of the health risks
associated with such behavior. At the extreme, non-compliance can manifest as dropping out of
treatment (non-persistence) or changing the doctor altogether3.

There are only a few empirical studies that use panel data on large populations of patients to
examine non-cost-related factors that affect patient adherence. Work by Lamiraud and Geoffard
(2007), Neslin, Rhoades and Wolfson (2009), Simeonova (2012, 2012) aim at discerning patient
characteristics (age, gender, race, type and severity of the disease) and drug characteristics
(financial cost, length and complexity of the regimen, side effects) that help explain the observed
variation in compliance across patients. A major reason for the dearth of such studies is the lack of
large-scale, individual level data, combined with information on physicians, visits and therapy
prescriptions. This study analyzes the determinants of patient medication compliance in a unified
framework that includes doctor-, patient-, and drug-specific information in a population-level panel
dataset.

Institutional Setting

This subsection discusses some salient features of the Danish insurance, pharmacy, and health care
systems. Denmark has universal and tax financed health insurance run by the government. All
individuals residing in Denmark are automatically equipped with a social security number and a
health card. The health card ensures free access and treatment at general practitioners, specialists, as
well as free in-hospital stays. All services provided to an individual are then registered via the social
security number and all expenses are picked up by the national health insurance.

General practitioners

The Danish public health insurance provides visits and services at the general practitioner (GP) free
of charge. In Denmark, GPs serve as gate-keepers to the rest of the health care system. Referrals to

et al. (1999)

  As dicussed in Philipson and Hedges (1998), Chan and Hamilton (2006), Neslin, Rhoades and Wolfson (2009)
                                                        4
specialists and hospital admissions go through the general practitioner. All individuals have a
choice of GP, as long as the GP practice is located within 15km from the patient’s home. Changing
to a different GP costs a fee of 150 DKK4, and can be done only if the new doctor is open for
patient intake.

There are approximately 3,500 general practitioners in Denmark. From these, 2,200 are organized in
single-practices. In order to get reimbursed by the national insurance, the physician needs to
acquire a clinic-ID (ydernummer). The number of clinic licenses is controlled by the government,
based on factors such as the population density in different areas. A clinic can deny to list new
patients when they reach enrollments of over 1,600 patients per doctor in the clinic. After reaching
more than 2,700 listed patients per doctor, the clinic needs to make a special application to the
government to add more patients.

The GPs are responsible for a large portion of the patient’s medication therapy. The GP has no
financial incentives to choose specific medication brands. First-choice medication recommendations
are issued by the national health authorities, but practitioners can choose a different therapy if they
consider it more appropriate. Prescription drugs are sold at government licensed pharmacies only.
All information about purchases is registered in a database at the Danish Medicines Agency
(DMA).

Pharmaceutical prices

Prescription drugs are partially covered by the national insurance. The extent of coverage depends
on the accumulated drug expenditures during the subsidy year (which does not correspond to the
calendar year). The actual scheme may vary by year. For instance, in 2004 the expenditures in the
interval 520 – 1,260DKK had coinsurance of 50%, in the interval 1,260 – 2,950DKK it was 25 %,
and above 2,950 DKK it was 15 %. Accumulated expenditures are based on a subsidy price, which
is the price of the cheapest alternative of a specific drug.

The price setting for prescription drugs operates in a two-week cycle. Every 14 days,
pharmaceutical companies report their wholesale prices to DMA, who then sets retail and subsidy
prices in its pharmacies nationwide. If a drug is still under patent protection, the retail and subsidy
price will be identical. If generic substitutes are available, the entire market is auctioned off to the

lowest-price bidder, who will procure the necessary drugs to Danish pharmacies during the next two
weeks. The auction price will become the official subsidy price, on which the coinsurance schemes
are based. If a patient prefers a branded (more expensive) version of a drug, he or she will have to
pay the difference out of pocket5. For further information on the institutional background of the
Danish subsidy scheme for prescription drugs, see Simonsen et al (2013).

For all drugs considered in this study, generic alternatives were available during the study period;
therefore, the government auction was the relevant price setting mechanism.

3     Data and descriptive evidence
We focus the analysis of patient adherence with four drug groups – ace inhibitors, beta blockers,
statins, and oral anti-diabetics (hypoglycemics). All of these medications are intended for chronic
use and have frequently been the subject of medication adherence studies (RAND, 2009). Patients
whose medication regimen includes one of these drug groups are expected to continue this regimen
for the rest of their lives. Ace inhibitors and beta blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension
and heart disease; oral anti-diabetics are the first line of defense against early-stage diabetes
mellitus; and statins are prescribed to lower cholesterol levels and to prevent acute cardio-vascular
episodes such as heart attacks or strokes. The analysis dataset covers the period 2004-2010 and
includes all adults in Denmark who received at least two prescriptions within a 6-month period for
one of these drug groups6.

3.1    Definition of patient adherence with medication therapy
Any discussion of patient adherence with therapy must first spell out what is meant by a “therapy”.
While many notions are possible, in this study we take a narrow view of a therapy as continuous
and regular intake of medications from a given drug group by the patient. As a further refinement,
our notion of therapy is doctor-specific: it includes only prescriptions from a given doctor, and does
not include prescriptions from other doctors whom the patient might have seen in the meantime7.



5
  Example: A consumer has accumulated expenditures ensuring a 50 % coinsurance from the government and is about
to buy Medication A. The lowest price of Medication A placed by a pharmaceutical company is DKK 50 and the second
lowest price is DKK 100. If the consumer chooses to buy the product that cost DKK 100, she will have to pay the price
difference between the two out of pocket.
6
  This restriction was imposed to avoid cases of misdiagnosis, erroneous prescriptions, or one-time treatments with
particular chemical agents that are not intended to treat chronic conditions.
7
  Receiving a prescription form more than one physician at the same time happens very rarely, as we show below. This
is determined by the institutional setting.
                                                         6
This approach is consistent with the goal of our study, which is to examine determinants of
adherence within the context of the doctor-patient relationship.

Reviews of the related literature often deplore the diversity in medication adherence measures used
by researchers, which limits the comparability of results across different studies. Such heterogeneity
is explained by data availability – studies that report the results from interventions to improve
adherence usually monitor it more closely and accurately than do studies based on claims data. In
this study we also use electronic pharmacy records to measure adherence, but do so with high
accuracy thanks to the panel nature of the dataset and the ability to monitor all prescription
medication pickups in the Danish pharmacy system.

Patient adherence is calculated on the level of individual refill as the portion of days between the
current and the next refill during which the patient had access to medication (the “covered period”).
As such, it is a continuous measure, ranging between 0% and 100%. This adherence measure is
often called the medication possession ratio (MPR) in the literature. Defining compliance on the
refill level allows us to analyze changes in adherence during the course of the doctor-patient
relationship.

The covered period is calculated by taking the stock of drugs available to the patient and dividing it
by the daily dosage. The supply of medication available to the patient consists of two parts. First,
there could be leftover drugs from previous refills. Second, there is a stock of drugs obtained at the
latest trip to pharmacy. For example, if a patient had 1 week of medication supply left from a
previous refill, and received 2 weeks’ worth of medication on the current trip to the pharmacy, we
will consider this refill to be 100% adherent if the next observed refill happens within 3 weeks.
However, if the same patient did not have any leftover stock, she would be assigned only 66%
adherence rate for the current refill (only 2/3 of the period of three weeks between current and next
refill is covered).

An important consideration in the calculation of adherence rates is how to treat refills obtained
through prescriptions from other doctors who the patient has seen between visits to the main
prescriber. We consider the doctor from whom the patient received the largest number of
prescriptions during the year for the given condition as the main prescriber. As a general rule, we
treat cases when the patient received only one or two refills for the same ATC-5 code from another
doctor as visits to a “replacement doctor” and assign the adherence with these refills to the main
                                                  7
doctor. For example, if we see a sequence of prescriptions from doctors A and B as follows:
AAA…ABBAA…A, then we assign the two refills obtained from doctor B to the therapy
prescribed by doctor A. We do not calculate a separate patient adherence value with doctor B. But,
if the sequence of refills includes 3 or more refills prescribed by doctor B, as in
AAA…ABBBAA…A, even if they are followed by a another sequence of refills from doctor A, we
consider doctor B as a contributing physician and calculate a separate doctor-specific adherence for
refills prescribed by her. Note that cases of the type described above are very rare in the data. If a
patient has seen more than one physician, there is usually a clear break from the first doctor visited,
after which she visits only the second doctor and does not go back.

3.2    Summary statistics of adherence rates
Table 1 shows that mean adherence rates in this study are quite high, around 90%. In Panel (1) we
use the default adherence measure in the study, taking into account any leftover stock of medication
from previous refills. In Panel (B) we calculate adherence rates that disregard any leftover
medication supply. Ace inhibitors have the highest compliance levels, followed closely by statins
and oral hypoglycemics, while beta blockers exhibit the lowest adherence rates. Within a drug
group, the variation in adherence rates is substantial: the standard deviation is 1/5 of the mean. This
ensures that we will be able to identify factors that determine relative differences in adherence rates
across patients and disease types.

                                                          8
An alternative measure of adherence is the indicator measure of “on time” refills, where a refill is
considered 100% adherent (fully adherent) if picked up before the expiration of the previous refill’s
days’ supply and 0% adherent if the patient failed to pick up during the covered period. For all drug
groups, between 60% and 70% of all refills are fully adherent with this definition. Although such
adherence measure is intuitive and is often used, Table 1 suggests that this measure is too sensitive
to the way “covered period” is calculated – including or excluding potentially leftover stock from
previous refills.

In Panel (A), the adherence measure includes leftover stock of pills from previous refills. Such
inclusion utilizes all available information and improves the adherence measure, for example, by
distinguishing between patients with easier access to medication (drugs available at home) and
patients who would need to make another trip to the pharmacy in order to stay compliant. Naturally,
such approach results in higher average adherence levels: mean adherence rates in Panel (B), where
leftover stock in not included, are 3-4pp lower. The effect of this change in methodology on the
share of fully adherent refills is much more dramatic: this measure of adherence decreases by as
much as 20pp once the information on leftover stock is removed8.

In Table 2 we examine differences in average compliance rates by patient demographic
characteristics. Men are less compliant than women, and married people do better on average than
singles. However, these differences are small compared to the effects of age and birth origin. The
age gradient is quite steep: for ace inhibitors, every 10 years of age are associated with an increase
in adherence rate of 2-3pp, particularly at the younger age groups. A difference of similar
magnitude exists between patients who were born in Denmark and the foreign born. Even larger
differences are obtained if we compare patients born in predominantly Muslim countries9 with the
rest of the world: for beta blockers, the differential reaches 10 percentage points. Given that Danish
healthcare system provides care free of charge for all patients, such difference in outcomes is
surprising                   and                   requires                   further                  investigation.




8
  This result partially explains the difference to US-based studies (RAND, 2009), which report adherence rates between
20% and 80%.
9
  Needless say, Danish healthcare system does not differentiate patients by their religius affiliation. Therefore, our
distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim-born patients is only an imperfect proxy for the actual religius affiliation.

Table 3 presents differences in average adherence by socio-economic status. These differences are
much smaller than differences by age or birth origin. The correlation with income appears to be
negative, as patients at high levels of income exhibit worse average adherence than poorer
individuals. Differences across education levels are larger than those across income quartiles, but
we find no clear patterns. Lower educational level does not necessarily lead to lower adherence, as
demonstrated by adherence rates among individuals who did not graduate from high school.
Because in Denmark income and education have little effect on access to health care, the observed
differences may be due to unobserved behavioral traits, or simply due to selection. For instance,

higher educated patients may seek doctors that give them more autonomy, or doctors with less
“paternalistic” style.

Tertiary short term education includes theoretical educations of about 2 years of length. Tertiary medium term education
covers bachelor degrees that are very occupation specific, e.g. teachers, nurses, physiotherapists etc.

A significant proportion of the study population is heavily medicated. In the left panel of Figure 1
we show a histogram of patients by the number of different medication groups purchased during the
period under observation. A medication group is defined as a subset of pharmaceuticals with
identical Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC-5) codes. The list of exact
codes included in each drug group are presented in Appendix Table A1. Note that even though we
concentrate the analysis on users of four specific chronic medication groups, we include all drug
groups prescribed to these patients in Figure 1. Strikingly, about 15% of patients in our sample used
as      many         as       10       or        more         different       types         of     drug        groups.

In the right panel of Figure 1 we plot the means of average adherence with individual medication
groups as they relate to the total number of different medications prescribed to the patient during the
observation window. The total number of drug groups is substantially and positively related to the
average adherence rate. For example, a person who takes beta blockers in addition to pills from 3-4
other medication classes is on average 5 percentage points more adherent than someone who takes
only beta blockers. It is notable that differences in compliance rates across this dimension are much
larger than, for example, differences across educational levels.

Figure 2 considers adherence rates within the context of the doctor-patient relationship. The left
panel depicts average adherence by the length of the relationship as measured by total number of
prescriptions issued by a given doctor to the patient. We drop pairs where only 1 refill is observed.
Pairs that dissolve quickly, after 2 or 3 refills, demonstrate the lowest adherence rates. Among pairs
with more refills, adherence rates slowly increase with the length of the relationship. This finding
can be attributed to either positive selection (well-functioning doctor-patient pairs are more stable)
or to the accumulation of knowledge (longer histories allow doctors to make more informed
decisions), or both. The right panel on Figure 2 lends some support to the latter explanation:
regardless of the length of the relationship, each successive refill is on average associated with
higher adherence. The largest incremental gain in adherence happens in the beginning of the
relationship (between the first and fourth refill), with the gradient flattening at later refills. This is
consistent with previous evidence: Benner et al (2002) find that dropping out of statin therapy is
most likely to happen in the first 6 months.

Again we find significant differences in adherence patterns across drug groups. Ace inhibitors and
statins start out with initially higher compliance levels and remain on a higher level over time. Beta
blockers have the worst initial adherence.

3.3        Persistence with medication
An important distinction exists between patients who experience extended periods with no
medication supply and patients who may have missed only a few daily doses. The literature
differentiates between these cases with the concept of non-persistence, although scientific evidence
on the prevalence of non-persistence is generally lacking (RAND, 2009). For the purposes of this
study, we define an episode of non-persistence with medication as a period of three or more months
with no medication supply.10

Consistently with our definition of therapy as being doctor-specific, we do not take into account
drugs received by other doctors when identifying periods of non-persistence11. In other words, a
patient may be non-persistent with respect to the therapy prescribed by one doctor, but persistent
with respect to another’s – even though we find such cases to be infrequent. Our approach to
defining persistence on the level of doctor-patient pair is supported by models of physician-patient

   Note that we only consider a patient to be ”on” a therapy if they have at least two refills in the associated drug group.
Thus, we avoid confounding cases of non-persistence with cases of primary non-adherence. Primary non-adherence
happens when the patient receives a prescription, obtains the medication, but never refills again, thus dropping out of
the treatment altogether.
11
   Simlarly to our adherence measure, we assign ”temporary” refills obtained from another doctor to the main doctor.
For instance, a sequence of refills may look like ”AAA B AA” or ”AAA BB AA” – in both cases we assign refills from
doctor B to doctor A. In this way, we eliminate false instances of non-persistence when the patient is actually seeing a
replacement doctor. However, we do no such assignment for the sequence ”AAA BBB AA”, which will result in one
episode of non-persistence w.r.t doctor A.
                                                                  13
interaction (e.g. Ma and McGuire, 1997, Chalkley and Khalil, 2005). These models posit that
patient demand for treatment responds to physician effort. Thus, one potential interpretation of
episodes of non-persistence is as signals of perceived low physician effort, resulting in low demand
for treatment.

Similarly to adherence, we define non-persistence on the refill level, taking into account leftover
stock of drugs from the previous refill. A typical non-persistent observation is this: on May 28,
2008, a person visits a pharmacy to obtain 4 weeks’ supply of medication, while having 2 weeks’
supply at home, left from the previous refill. The resulting stock of drugs covers that person until
July 8, 2008. However, the next refill is observed only on October 20, 2008, which means the
person had no supply of the medication for more than 3 months. Therefore, the current refill (of
May 28, 2008) is considered as non-persistent. The persistence variable is not observed for the last
refill in a given doctor-patient pair12. Doctor-patient pairs that have experienced at least one episode
of non-persistence are labeled as “non-persistent”. As we will find out shortly, both definitions (on
the patient-doctor match level and on the refill level) of non-persistence are useful.

Non-persistence is fairly common in the data, and for many doctor-patient pairs we observe several
instances of non-persistence. Table 4 shows that most refills are persistent, from 93% for beta-
blockers to 96% for ace-inhibitors. At the same time, a much larger proportion of doctor-patient
pairs is affected by non-persistence. For example, among beta blockers, as many as 58% of pairs
have experienced at least one prolonged break in therapy. Taken together, these findings imply that
instances of non-persistence are not concentrated in a few “problematic” doctor-patient pairs, but
rather are distributed across all pairs. Note also that switching between doctors is institutionally
costly in Denmark, and thus episodes of non-persistence with one physician are typically not due to
the patient temporarily switching to another doctor, but rather reflect a complete break from
therapy.

 In principle, one may declare the last refill as being non-persistent, because it signifies an (infinite) break in therapy.
We do not take this view as we cannot hypothesize why the pair has broken up.

The next table provides further insight into the degree to which doctor-patient pairs are affected by
non-persistence. For such pairs, we identify “episodes of care” as strings of successive refills
uninterrupted by non-persistence. By definition, non-persistent pairs have at least 2 episodes of
care. Table 5 presents a breakdown of non-persistent pairs by the number of episodes of care. For
instance, out of 184,026 pairs that are non-persistent for ace inhibitors (see Table 4), 75.7% have
only one non-persistent refill, while 17.4% pairs have three episodes of care, or two instances of
non-persistence. Two or three instances of non-persistence is by far the most frequent occasion;
pairs with more frequent breaks in therapy are rare.

3.4    Relationship between adherence and persistence
The first and third column in Table 6 show that differences in average medication adherence rates
among persistent and non-persistent doctor-patient pairs are large: from 14 to 18 percentage points,
depending on the drug group. Since refills associated with non-persistence have by definition close
to zero MPR, it is not surprising that doctor-patient pairs affected by non-persistence demonstrate
lower average adherence rates than those that are not. A less obvious result is presented in columns
(E) and (F), which contain average adherence rates among persistent refills within non-persistent
doctor-patient pairs. Most refills in non-persistent pairs are actually adherent, i.e. they were made
relatively on time. We find that average adherence is lower in (E) than in (A), although the

                                                      15
difference is smaller than the one between (A) and (C). This finding implies that the definition of
non-persistence on the level of the doctor-patient pair is informative: even a single instance of non-
persistence in a doctor-patient relationship is enough to signal a somewhat different adherence
dynamic.

Further illustration of differences between persistent and non-persistent doctor-patient pairs is
presented in Figure 3, which plots cumulative distributions of refill-based adherence rates for beta
blockers (percentiles on horizontal axis, and adherence rate on vertical axis). For illustration
purposes, we include only “imperfect” refills, i.e. those with less than 100% adherence. Among
these refills, the median adherence rate is 30% if all doctor-patient pairs are considered, and this
rate falls to 15% among non-persistent pairs. Above we found that even a single incidence of non-
persistence in a doctor-patient relationship is correlated with lower average adherence; from Figure
3 we additionally find that the effect is particularly pronounced in the lower part of the distribution,
among pairs who already have issues with non-adherence.

4     Two-way analysis of variation in adherence

4.1    Model
We begin with a general question: what is the relative patient- and doctor-specific contribution to
the observed variability in patient compliance with prescribed therapy across doctor-patient
matches, and what portion of the residual variation is specific to the doctor-patient pair? There are
four major contributors to the variation in adherence rates. In the following table, we identify these
factors, together with appropriate measurements that can be taken given the available data:

Table 7. Factors of adherence: conceptual framework

Factor of adherence              Measurement                        Interpretation

                                                                    time;
(B) Doctor-specific influence    Doctor fixed effect                If doctor A is more capable of

                                                                    than doctors B and C, then that
                                                                    doctor A’s-own contribution will
                                                                    appear as the difference between
                                                                    average compliance across patients
                                                                    of doctor A and total average
                                                                    compliance rate (across A, B and C);
(C) Doctor-patient match         Average compliance across          The quality of doctor-patient

                                 doctor-patient pair, net of        negative complementarities between
                                 controlling for individual         doctor’s and patient’s own
                                 influences of the doctor and       adherence styles. As a result, the

                                                                       predicted by factors (A) and (B)
                                                                       alone.
(D) Changes in the course of        Deviation of compliance with       Possible factors include:
therapy and doctor-patient          individual refills from the        improvements in health status;
relationship                        average compliance in a            building trust; accumulation of
                                    given doctor-patient pair;         doctor knowledge about the patient,
                                                                       etc.


Mathematically, these factors can be combined into a model of adherence in the following way
                                                                                                       (1)
Where  i – patient fixed effect (component (a)),  j – doctor fixed effect (component (b)),  ij –

doctor-patient match quality (component (c)) and  ijt – deviation of compliance with refill t from

the average compliance within the doctor-patient pair (component (d)). A portion of the match-
specific component  ij can be explained by our match-specific controls X ijt , so that equation (1)

becomes:
                                                                                                       (2)
In practice, the estimation of equation (2) is achieved by including both patient and doctor fixed
effects, whose estimates are denoted by             and    . With that, the other parameters in equation (1)
can be expressed as:
                                                  1
                                                      ∑                                                (3)

The two-way fixed effects models of the type (2) have been extensively used in labor economics
(see, e.g., Abowd et al. (1999), Abowd et al. (2008)), but have not yet received wide adoption in the
doctor-patient setting (with an exception of Bennett et al. (2011)13). Medical studies have largely
adhered to multi-level analysis (see, e.g. Sixma et al (1998)14), where the outcome variable is

modeled as a result of GP-level factors and patient-level factors. Such models typically assume one-
way nests as a set of patients within a GP. Therefore, they cannot accommodate for changes in
patient outcomes due to switching between GP’s. As we have seen previously, average adherence
rates do change substantially when a patient changes doctors, contributing to the total variation in
adherence. Multi-level models miss those changes and may come to erroneous conclusions
regarding the relative contributions of patient- and doctor-level factors to the total variation.

Another advantage of the two-way fixed effect model is the higher efficiency of estimates of factors
related to the match value, as well as factors related to time variation in adherence rates. This is due
to the fact that all observed and unobserved patient-level factors are accounted for by the patient
fixed effect. In contrast, multi-level models do not allow for such a regressor, as it is not identified
within their structure (outcomes of patient A across doctors B and C are assumed to be
independent). With all these advantages, a two-way fixed effects model places higher demands on
the quality of the data: it requires a panel dataset with sufficient amount of doctor switching in order
to identify the doctor’s and patient’s own adherence styles15.

4.2       Graphical illustration of results from the two-way fixed effects model
The estimation of equation (3) results in as many estimated parameters             as there are primary care
doctors in the Danish health care system (minus one, as all doctor fixed effects are normalized
relative to the reference doctor). Doctor fixed effects are measured in the same units as adherence
rates, i.e. between 0% and 100%. These parameters capture the effects of individual heterogeneity
among physicians that affects all their patients in the same way. If physicians exert strong influence
on their patients’ adherence decisions, then some of them will have larger values of          than others.

Figure 4 plots the distribution of estimated doctor fixed effects in the population, separately for each
drug group (normalized to zero for better comparison). Most values are within              / 5 percentage
points from the average: a patient will gain 5 percentage points in adherence by switching from the
average to the best doctor. This is a large gain: for instance, it is sufficient to overcome the mean
adherence gap associated with age or birth origin (reported in Table 2).

The density plots in Figure 4 suggest that the amount of heterogeneity in doctor influences varies
across drug groups. For statins, the distribution is most concentrated around zero, meaning that a
smaller percentage of doctors are substantially away from the average. In contrast, the distribution

     and summarizes time-invariant factors of adherence: the doctor’s and patient’s own styles, as
well as the match quality. Using estimates of the model (4), we compute data variances of each
component:               ,       ,    . Note that generally the total variance of adherence is less than the
variance of its components:                                                        – because doctor and
patient fixed effects are negatively correlated (see Figure 5). Therefore we instead relate individual
variances            ,       ,       to their sum, separately for each drug group. Results are shown in the
following table.

ACE inhibitors                           59.8%                  12.5%                  27.7%
Beta blockers                            59.9%                  36.6%                  3.6%

Statins                                  62.6%                  8.2%                   29.2%

Patient heterogeneity is the largest contributor to the variation in therapy compliance across doctor-
patient pairs. Doctor’s influence and match quality take the back seat, and their relative
contributions vary across drug groups. Beta blockers and statins stand out as two extremes. For beta
blockers, doctor quality picks up the variance not explained by the patient’s own behavior, while
match quality does not seem to matter much. For statins, the match quality is very important, while
the doctor’s identity does not explain much of variation across pairs. In other words, there is a clear
quality “sorting” of doctors when it comes to adherence to beta blockers: moving a given patient to
a “better” doctor will most likely result in higher adherence. This does not apply to statins and to
some extent to ace inhibitors: for those drugs, one needs to know factors of the doctor-patient
relationship in order to predict whether adherence will improve upon moving from one doctor to
another.

We then turn to the evaluation of inter-temporal variation in adherence, and its contribution to the
total variation of refill-based MPR. With the raw data averages, we have seen substantial changes in
adherence across the cumulative number of refills (see Figure 2). However, raw data means must be
interpreted with caution, as selection is likely to play a role. The two-way fixed effects model
delivers a more precise measure of adherence dynamics, after doctor’s and patient’s own styles are
controlled for.


                                                       22
From the evidence presented in Table 9, it is clear that the dynamics of compliance with therapy
over the course of the doctor-patient relationship plays a major role in the total variation of
adherence rates: 56-57% of total variation is attributed to fluctuations of refill-based adherence rates
around the pair’s average (for beta blockers the associated number is 42%).

Beta blockers                     100%                     42.1%                  57.9%
Oral antidiabetics                100%                     56.3%                  43.7%

More than half of the observed variation in refill based adherence cannot be explained by the
individual-specific effects of doctors and patients, or any other time-invariant characteristics, such
as individual compatibility. This suggests that there is great potential for improvement of adherence
rates without breaking the existing doctor-patient pairs: for example, by monitoring and preventing
instances of non-persistence or by facilitating communication between doctors and patients.

5     Investigating factors affecting compliance

5.1    Econometric strategy
Patient adherence is crucial for the success of any prescribed therapy and can be thought of as a
component of the patient’s investment in health. Studies have demonstrated that the decision to
comply with doctor’s orders depends on the physician- and patient-level factors which are constant
across time, and on contextual variables. The latter include the level of familiarity between the
physician and the patient, patient knowledge about the medical condition and the therapy, and other
potentially unobservable time-varying characteristics (RAND, 2009; Osterberg and Blasche, 2005;
Krueger et al, 2005; Haynes et al, 2002).         We postulate an empirical model of medication
compliance that takes into account the different groups of factors:

                                                                        (5)

where i indexes the patient, j indexes the doctor, and t is the refill index (and also time index when
refill occurred). The outcome variable is Yijt - the medication possession ratio (MPR) for that

particular refill. The set of explanatory variables includes Pit - the patient’s demographic and socio-
                                                  23
economic characteristics as well as time varying characteristics: education, gender, birth origin,
annual income, age. In addition, Pit also includes variables related to Danish subsidy schemes as
they affect the particular patient i at time t: subsidy month (the month in the yearly subsidy cycle,
which does not coincide with calendar year), subsidy year (number of years for which subsidy was
received), the price of the drug (as measured in DKK for 1 days’ supply), and an indicator for the
first year of a particular treatment (a new patient). Further, D j represents a set of doctor fixed

effects.

Finally, the set of controls X ijt includes match-specific variables: whether the drug was prescribed

by the main physician and the number of previous visits associated with the same medication
therapy. The model is estimated by pooling data together and adding dummies for drug groups (ace
inhibitor, beta blocker, statin or anti-diabetic).

The inclusion of drug price into the adherence equation (5) deserves further discussion. The OLS
estimate of the effect of drug price on adherence could be biased for a number of reasons. Even
though the shelf price of medications is centrally set by the government every two weeks, the actual
price paid by the patient is affected by the amount of government subsidy received by that person.
Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the shelf and the actual price in DKK per day’s supply
of the medication paid by the patient over the subsidy year, for the four types of medications. The
blue dots show the average user price in DKK over the course of the subsidy year. The red dots
show the average government set price. The user price decreases over the course of the subsidy year
relative to the government price, as the patient’s consumption of drugs accumulates. The average
shelf price for a daily dose of medication is 2.9 DKK. The average out of pocket price is only 0.71
DKK. Appendix Table A2 presents the main descriptive statistics of the shelf- and out-of-pocket
prices observed in the data.

5.2   Regression results
In Table 10 we present results from several specifications of the empirical model of compliance,
following equation (5) above. Column (1) includes only patient-level controls, to which in column
(2) we add refill-level characteristics such as whether the prescription was written by the main
doctor, and an indicator for a refill written to a new patient. Further, in column (3) we add physician
fixed effects, which control for unobserved and time-invariant physician characteristics. Finally,
column (4) presents the results from the 2SLS specification of the physician fixed effects model in
(3), with a correction for potential endogeneity of drug price.

Beta blockers have much lower average adherence than any other medication class, followed by
oral hypoglicemics. Differences in adherence across demographic groups exhibit similar patterns to
what has been found in previous studies: older people are more likely to comply with prescribed
therapy, men have slightly more trouble keeping with the therapy regimen than women.
Quantitatively, the age gradient is quite strong (approximately two percentage points gain in
adherence for every 10 years), particularly at younger ages. Immigrants are less adherent than
Danes even after we include controls for socio-economic characteristics: they have on average two
percentage points lower adherence levels. This effect is smaller than the differences in sample
means between immigrants and Danes (see Table 2), but is nevertheless economically large and
remains so even after doctor fixed effects are included.

A different story emerges with respect to education and income. In the simple means presented in
Table 3, we found a negative relationship between income and adherence. As models (1) and (2)
show, including other patient controls, such as age (which itself is positively correlated with
income) does not alter this monotonicity. This finding is somewhat surprising, as US-based studies
typically (but not always) find a positive relationship between income and adherence, as well as
between education and adherence (DiMatteo, 2004). The model estimates in column (3) suggest a
possible explanation: negative matching between higher income patients and doctors. Indeed, once
doctor fixed effects are included, the relation between income and adherence disappears. The
interpretation is that well-to-do patients form matches with physicians whose patients on average



                                                  26
exhibit lower adherence levels. The reasons for the assortative matching are unclear – in the Danish
context, income has almost no relation to access to care – and remain a question for future study.

A further insight in the effect of doctor-patient matching is provided by the “main doctor” variable,
which is an indicator for the doctor from whom the patient has received the largest number of refills
in the current year. Compliance with the main doctor is on average 2.7pp higher than with
secondary doctors. A related result is that doctor-patient pairs with larger number of refills also
demonstrate higher levels of adherence.

Notes: Outcome variable is refill-based adherence rate, ranging between 0% and 100%. Omitted categories include: Ace
inhibitor for drug dummies; “Education N/A (not available, missing)” for education. Tertiary short term education
includes theoretical educations of about 2 years of length. Tertiary medium term education covers bachelor degrees that
are very occupation specific, e.g. teachers, nurses, physiotherapists etc.; First quartile for income; “Less than 30 years
old” for age. Calendar year fixed effects included in every specification.

Increases in the price of a day’s supply of the medication negatively affect adherence. The OLS
results imply that a price increase of 1 DKK will reduce the medication possession ratio by about
0.9 percentage points. A more intuitive way to interpret this result is that an increase of one standard
deviation in the price of a day’s supply (1.35DKK) reduces medication compliance by 0.06-0.07
standard deviations.

The OLS coefficient on the price variable could be biased due to a number of different factors. In
column (4) we report the coefficient estimates from the second stage of an instrumental variable
two-stage least squares regression16. The instrumental variables specification yields an estimate that
is about 10% larger than the OLS estimate, consistent with the presence of attenuation bias in the
OLS specifications. The estimated effect of cost on adherence is not negligible – it is of the same
order of magnitude as the coefficient on foreign birth origin. Changing the out-of-pocket price
encountered at the pharmacy from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the price distribution (from
0.02DKK to 2.7DKK per daily dose) would result in approximately 3 percent decrease in average
adherence.


16
  The coefficient estimates from the first stage are reported in Table A3 in the Appendix. Due to the medication subsidy
scheme, the relationship between the sticker price of a medication and the price paid by consumers could vary across
drug groups and time periods. To control for some of that heterogeneity, in the first stage we include interactions
between the government-mandated medication cost and drug dummies, as well as an indicator dummy for the first
month of the subsidy year. We find that the Danish government subsidizes between 70% and 95% of the price of
chronic medications.
                                                           28
It is important to emphasize that the elasticity of adherence that can be constructed based on this
estimate is not directly comparable to the price elasticities of demand reported in the related
literature (Manning et al 1987; Chandra et al, 2010; Simonsen et al, 2013; Skipper, 2013). There
are several important differences that preclude any direct comparisons. First, our adherence variable
is truncated at 100%. This excludes from the estimation variation arising from instances where
patients responded to price shocks by acquiring drug inventories exceeding the number of days
between subsequent refills. Second, we focus the adherence analysis on patients who purchase the
medication now or later. Therefore the implicit outside option is not refraining from the purchase
altogether, but postponing the purchase to a later date, thus stretching the current supply of
medication over a longer period. Studies of price elasticity of demand for drugs consider the no-
purchase option as the outside option. Third, it is well known that the price elasticity of demand
decreases when stockpiling of goods is accounted for, especially when the comparable static (no
stockpiling allowed) price elasticity estimate allows for substitution into the no-purchase option
(Hendel and Nevo, 2006).

VI. Conclusion

This paper presents the first analysis of the determinants of patient adherence with medication in a
unified framework using individual physician- and patient-specific population panel data from
Denmark. The Danish universal health insurance system allows us to analyze the contribution of
various demographic and SES patient characteristics to differences in average adherence rates
across population subgroups, net of financial constraints to obtaining care.

Similarly, we analyze the physician contribution to medication compliance in a system where
doctors have no financial incentives to prescribe one course of therapy over another. Physicians can
influence patients’ health investment. However, there are significant heterogeneities in doctors’
contributions to patient compliance both across physicians and across medication classes. Further,
we find significant variation in adherence over time within a physician-patient pair. The patient’s
decision to follow the recommended therapy evolves with the doctor-patient relationship. Thus, a
one-size-fits-all approach to improving average compliance by offering physician (or patient)
incentives is likely to yield suboptimal results.
