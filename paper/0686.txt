        Aggregate Spending and the Terms of Trade: Is There a

                        Laursen-Metzler Effect?



                               Abstract


     This paper investigates the spending and current—account effects of

permanent terms—of—trade shifts in a model where households maximize

utility over an infinite planning period. In the framework we adopt,

an economy specialized in production must experience a fall in aggregate

spending and a current surplus wh the terms of trade permanently deteriorate.

The model thus provides a 'ounter—arnple to the argi.rnent of Laursen and

Metzler (1950) and Harberger (1950) that a permanent worsening

in the terms of trade must produce a current—account deficit.

      In their classic 1950 analysis of the international transmission

 of business cycles under flexible exchange rates,' Svend Laursen and

 Lloyd A. Metzler hypothesized a relationship between aggregate spend-

 ing and the terms of trade that has come to occupy an important place

 in open—economy macroeconomics. This Laursen-Metzler effect was cen-

 tral to the early post—war writing on the theory of devaluation--notably

that of Harberger [1950] and Alexander [19521--and has, more recently,

emerged in discussion of the external adjustment problem accompanying

s:ifts   in the   1n'.at!7e prc3 of mnufàctured and prima:7 commod.ties. 2

It predicts that an adverse movement in the terms of trade between domestic and

foreign goods will cause a rise in the home-goods value of expenditure, and, under con-

ditions of complete specialization in production, a current-account deficit.

     Laursen and Metzler based their hypothesis largely on statistical

evidence that seemed to confirm Keynes' "fundamental psychological law"

positing a stable relationship between current real income and consump-

tion.3 According to this law, individuals adjust only gradually toa de-

cline in real income, reducing saving as well as spending in an attempt

to smooth their consumption stream. While recognizing that "a wide

variety of different relations is consistent with rational behavior

on the part of producers and consumers," Laursen and Netzler nonetheless

adopted the Keynesia.n assumption, arguing that a deterioration of the

terms of trade, which lowers real income, must lower saving as well.

     This paper takes as its .starting point the proposition that the

question raised by Laursen and Metzler can be answered only in a con-

text of explicit, intertemporal utility maximization. To this end, we
                                        2




describe an economy in which households consume a non-produced exportable

good and an imported foreign good, face given terms of trade, and maximize

an integral of discounted instantaneous utilities over an infinite horizon

by optimally allocating income each moment between current consumption and

the accumulation of real claims on foreigners. The results of a permanent, unantic-

ipated terms-of-trade change in this setting throw doubt on the general validity of

the Laursen—Metzler relationship, for a worsening of the terms of trade between

exports and imports is found to occasion a surplus, and not a deficit, in the

current account. This implies that when net claims on future units of the

foreign good are zero, so that the Laursen—Metzler assumption of complete

specialization is valid, aggregate spending measured in units of the domestic

good must fall.

      The analysis pursued here is based on some special assumptions, due to

Uzawa [1968], on the determination of agents' subjective rate of time prefer—

ence; and its applicability is narrowed further by the exclusion of all but a

single asset. Different assumptions about the structure of preferences and

the range of assets may yield different results, and so, the outcome described

here should be viewed only as an example of how the Laursen—Metzler effect may

be reversed.4 Nonetheless, the economic principle underlying this example is

worth emphasizing, as it extends beyond the present context to any discussion

of the relation among aggregate spending, income, and wealth. An unanticipatec'

change in real income conveys new information about future consump-

tion possibilities, and thus calls for a complete revision of the previous

lifetime expenditure plan. The new plan may well entail a sharp change

in current consumption, in contrast to the gradual adjustment implied by the
                                       3




Keynesian "psychological law." Barring further surprises, the path of future con-

 sumption will be smooth. But the arrival of new informatIon renders all previous

 consumption levels irrelevant, if, as is assumed here, these have no

 influence on the household's welfare over the remainder of its lifetime.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the lifetime

maximization problem of the typical household in a world of two consumption

goods and perfect capital mobility, and derives necessary conditions for an

optimal plan. Section II proves that there is a unique convergent path

satisfying these necessary conditions, and that this path is optimal in the

class of feasible paths. Section II uses this fact to determine the economy's res-

ponse   to a permanent worsening in   the terms of rade b-eten in.poLs anc exports.

Section IV extends the model to the case in which the home country faces an

imperfectcapital market, showing that the previous results are essentially
unchanged. Finally, Section V presents some concluding remarks.

                            I.   The Model

      The economy consists of identical households, each maximizing its

utility over an infinite lifetime. Instantaneous utility is derived

from consumption of two goods, one of which must be imüorted from abroad

and one of which is available at home in fixed supply. Households may

save by foregoing consumption and accumulating instead an internationally

traded bond, assumed, without loss of generality, to be indexed to the

foreign good.5The economy is small, in the sense that it can influence

neither the terms of trade between home and foreign goods nor the world

rate of interest. Finally, it is assumed that these prices are expected

to remain fi::ed forever. ny price changes take households by suprise.6

      The representative household's instantaneous utility is a function



          =      fh
              U(ct,ct)


of its consumption of foreign and home goods. U is taken to be positive,

strictly increasing in both its arguments, strictly concave, and twice

continuously differentiable. To avoid non—interior solutions to the

household's lifetime consumption problem, we postulate that



(1)   urn Uf = urn U h =
      cO t c±O t
      The household's objective is to maximize the discounted sum of

future instantaneous utilities

                             ds
          t is
                 0


 and       is the instantaneous Subjective discount rate at time s. Like Uzawa

 [1968], we suppose                     to be a function



            =




of     utility at time s, where cS(.) 4s positive and has the properties



 (3)      '(U) ,     S   (U) — U6 '(U)        (U) > 0.



While the conditions (3) are not the only ones consistent with the

assumption of endogenous time preference, they turn out to be quite

convenient in the present context. The reasons for imposing them

will become clear during the course of our analysis.7

        At each instant, the representative family is bound by a flow

constraint linking any divergence between its income and its

expenditure to its accumulation of claims on future units of the foreign

good. Letting b denote bond holdings at time t, p the price of foreign

goods in terms of domestic goods, y the family's (fixed) endowment of

the home good, and r the international rate of interest, we may write

this constraint as



(4)     bt =    y/p      -
                             c    -
                                      c/p + rbt.
                                            6




The condition implies that for the economy as a whole, the capital-

account deficit must equal the excess of income over expenditure.

      The household is also bound by a second, less obvious, constraint

on its program of saving and spending. The discounted sum of lifetime

expenditure (measured indomestic goods, say) must be no greater than

the capitalized value of lifetime income plus initial bond holdings,



(5)   y/r + ph0   >
                      J
                          e rt[pcf +
                                       c]   dt.




The importance of this constraint can best be appreciated by contrast-

ing the present infinite-horizon planning problem with a finite-horizon

problem whose planning period ends at time T. In the latter setting, the

family's budget constraint clearly implies that bT is nonnegative, for

any lifetime borrowing must be repaid before death. But an infinitely-

lived family facing a perfect capital market may borrow and consume

arbitrarily large amounts while always meeting its interest payments.

Unless a condition such as (5) is imposed, its lifetime utility will be

unbounded: no optimal program will exist.

      To rule out this "paradox of borrowing" we shall impose the feasi-

bility constraint that at each moment, the family's capitalized future

income must exceed its indebtedness,



(6)   y/r +   pbt . 0.


This restriction eliminates the option of running up an infinitely large

debt. As we shall see in the next section, (6) is sufficient to ensure
                                            7




 the existence of an optimal path satisfying (5)

        The household's problem is to choose paths for c, h and b that



 (7)    maximize U(c,c')et dt

                                       c,
                                            -
                                                Ct/p + rb,

                  (iii) c, c > 0,

The number of households is for convenience taken to be 1, so that the

consumption and saving paths chosen by the representative household may

be identified with those of the economy as a whole.

       A few simplifications will facilitate solution of this maximiza-

tion problem. In order to maximize lifetime welfare, the household must

at each moment maximize its instantaneous utility, given relative prices

and its chosen level of expenditure on consumption goods in general. Our

first simplification is to replace the utility function in (2) with the

indirect utility function



       V(p,z)   max {U(cf,ch) pc +              =   z}.


This device both reduces the dimensionality of our problem and allows

us to focus on the variable of primary interest, expenditure in terms
                                             8




of the domestic good, z.

      A second simplification is achieved by noting that assumption

(1) implies constraints (iii) and (iv) can never be binding along an

optimal trajectory, and may thus be ignored in deriving necessary

conditions for optimality. In particular, spending on both goods must

be zero whenever constraint (iv) binds, for at such a point, current

income just suffices to meet interest payments on previous borrowing.

      A final simplification is obtained by changing variables in (7)

from t to A,    using    the fact that



      dA =   S(V(p,z))   dt.




This reduces the family's problem to finding paths for b and z that



(8,   maximize I
                  f   V(p,z) e—A dA
                 J    S(v(p,z))

                               5(V(p,z))



      Necessary conditions for a solution to (8) are readily derived

using the Maximum Principle, provided that the problem's maximand is

concave. That V(p,z) is concave in z under our assumptions (so that

V2 < 0)      is demonstrated in the appendix. This fact, together with the

restrictions (2) on the time preference function S(),     is   sufficient

to imply that
                                                9




                  V(p,z)         =   ( — V5')   (rSV    —25'(v)2) — VS"5(V)2
         dz2   6(V(p,z))




 is negative.

         To apply the Maxirnurn Principle, we introduce the costate variable

 X, which may be interpreted as the imputed value or shadow price of

 saving.        An optimal plan must at each moment equate the marginal

 utility of spending to the imputed value of an additional unit of

 saving, and must thus maximize the Hamiltoniari



                                        - z)/p
(9)   H(b,z,X) = V(p,z) + A1(y                      + rb]
                                S(V(p,z))


The chosen expenditure path therefore has the property that



                  0




at all 1x, that is, that



(10) X =   pV(l   —
                      v('/6))/(l + vc'/) fy -               z +   rpb}).


      In   addition, the costate variable evolves according to the law of

motion



      d(eX)       — -   (eH)
                           Th


or, reversing our initial change of variables,
                                               10




(11) A =    Xt((v(p,zt))          -   r).

This condition states that the marginal rate of time preference must at

each instant equal the rate of return on bonds plus "capital gains" A/A.

Differential equation (11), together with the flow constraint




(12) bt =    ( - zt)/p + rbt,

must be satisfied by any optimal path.

     While conditions (10), (ll)7and (12) are necessarily satisfied by

an optimal program, they are not in themselves sufficient to guarantee

optirnality. The stock of bonds inherited from the past is predetermined

at time t = 0, and this fact provides one initial condition for the

system. But an initial value of A is also required, and unless this

shadow price is chosen correctly, a path that at each instant equates

the marginal utility of consumption to the imputed value of saving will

be suboptimal. Again, the problem is due to our assumption that the plan-

ning unit has an infinite life. If this life instead ended at time T, the

terminal condition bT             0 would enable us to solve backward for A0. But

in the present context, no such restriction is available; and this dif-

ficulty calls into question the existence as well as the uniqueness of

an optimal plan.

     It is natural €0        focus our attention on the unique stationary

state (b,z) of the economy, defined by the conditions



     A =    A(5(V(p,z)   -   r)       =   0,
                                           Li.




ensuring that the marginal rate of time preference equals the rate of

interest, and



      b = (y -   z)/p   +   rb   =   0,


ensuring external balance. The reason for doing so is that paths which

converge to the stationary state satisfy the sufficiency condition for

optimal controls,



      lim [y/rp +
                    b]eX = 0,
and so, are optimal.1° We shall now show that there exists a unique

convergent path, and that no divergent path is optimal. This, in turn,

will guarantee that the economy's response to any change in the param-

eters it faces is uniquely determined.



                                 II. The Optimal Path

      Our analysis can be simplified by transforming the differential

equations (11) and (12) into a system involving only b and z. The neces-

sary condition (10) shows that            can be written as a function of bt and

zt,



        =
            A(bt,zt),

which may be differentiated and equated to (11) to yield



      Xbbt +            X(bt,zt)((V(p,zt))
                                                 -   r).
                                              12




This irnDlies the equation of motion for zt,



               X(bt,zt)(5(V(p,zt)) —          r)    -
                                                         Ab(bt,zt)((y
                                                                        -
                                                                            z)/p   + rbt)

Of course, f'(b,z) =         0.

       We now derive the system's phase portrait in a neighborhood of the

stationary state by expanding (13) about (b,z). The resulting linear ap-

proximation is

the current account is to remain     balance. To the left of this schedule,

income falls short of spend.g and bond holdinçs are dec'easthg; to its

right, they are increasing. We note for future reference that the points

(0,y) and (-y/rp,0) always lie on the b = 0 locus.
     The stationary state or long-run equilibrium (b,z) is a saddlepoint because of
                                                           function.11 The path
our assumptions regarding the shape of the time preference
SS in Figure 1 is the unique convergent path. From the sufficiency
theorem for optimal controls cited above, we know that, given an initial

value of b, it is optimal for the economy to choose an expenditure level

placing it on the saddlepath SS. But it is now clear, in addition, that

any other choice will be suboptimal.     Paths originating below SS with z0

< z and b0 > b are dominated by the saddlepath; if z0 > z and b0 >

such a path is dominated by one that coincides with the original path until

Zt =   z and remains at z thereafter; and if b0 < b, a path coinciding with
the original one until the b = 0 schedule is crossed but holding spending

constant thereafter dominates. Paths originating above SS entail a

rising level of consumption over time. But consumption rises so quickly

that the feasibility constraint that y/rp + b be nonnegative eventually

becomes binding. Thereafter, expenditure z must fall sharply to zero in

order to prevent any further growth in indebtedness, and this, by assump-

tion (1), is not consistent with optimality. The unique path SS con-

verging to long-run equilibrium at (b,z) must thus be the path the economy
                     12.
actually chooses.

      The two panels of Figure I together show how long-run equilibrium is

determined. From the law of motion for ), (11) , we see that the long—

run utility level U is fixed by the relation




(16)     (U) =


and so,is     independent of the   teirs of trade. i-e.i terms. o trade p, the:i,

the    economy's   stationary-state expenditure level z must allow it to attain

utility level U, so that



 (17) V(p,z) = U.




Equation (17), which gives long-run expenditure in terms of domestic

goods as a function of the terms of trade, is plotted in the left-hand

panel of Figure I. By Roy's identity,



        =   - vcPrz)/v(Piz)   =     (p,U),


showing that the function has the concave shape displayed in the dia-

gram. Having found z, we find the stationary stock of bonds•b by noting

that for every choice of long-run consumption, there is only one

level of bond holdings consistent with external balance. The b = 0
                                    15




schedule of Figure i shows this relationship. A rise in stationary-

state consumption must be financed by a higher stationary-state

level of interest payments from abroad. This entails a higher stock

of claims on foreigners in long-run equilibrium.

     We observe, 'finally, that the saddlepath SS does satisfy the

intertemporal budget constraint (5). After substituting for z

using (12) and integrating by parts, we find that



     I                     -rt   dt =   urn Pbe

This limit is certainly zero if bt ÷ b <          .
              iii.     Aggregate Spending and the Terms of Trade

     In this section we analyze the effects of a permanent terms—of-trade

deterioration on aggregate expenditure measured in home goods and

on the current account. The initial income effect of this price movement

depends, of course, on the size and sign of the economy's stock of

claims on future units of the foreign good. For simplicity, we begin

by assuming that bond holdings are zero.            This corresponds to the case

of complete specialization in production assumed by Laursen and Metzler

and their contemporaries.

     The hypothesized situation is depicted in Figure II. At the initial

long-run equilibrium E, the economy enjoys terms of trade p and derives

all its income from its fixed endowment y of the home good.           Consider

now a rise from p to p' in the relative price of the foreign good. The

slope of the b = 0 schedule rises from rp to rp', the point (O,y) re-

mains consistent with external balance, and so the schedule rotates about

E in the counterclockwise sense. The left—hand panel shows that the

stationary expenditure level rises to z', and the new external balance

locus shows the unique level b' of bond holdings consistent in the long

run with that level of spending. The convergent path leading to the post—

disturbance stationary—state E' necessarily passes below the initial

position E. The stock of net foreign claims cannot change instantane-
                                             the saddlepath when the terms
ously, so the economy jumps to point E' on

of trade deteriorate. Contrary to the Laursen—Metzler presumption, the

optimal response to the terms—of—trade shift requires a fall in the

domestic—goods value of aggregate spending and a current—account surplus.

     The intuition behind this finding is easy to grasp. By (16), the

economy will choose a transition path that allows it in the long run

to attain its original utility level, U. This implies that the

permanent level of expenditure must rise from z to z'. The current

account must eventually be in balance, however, and domestic spending

measured in home goods cannot be higher in the new stationary state

unless income is higher as well. A rise in income can be accomplished

                                           interest-earning claims on
only through the gradual accumulation of

foreigners. The terms—of-trade shift (in the present case) leaves the

domestic—goods value of output unchanged, and so the required surplus

must be accommodated by a fall in the domestic—goods value of expendi-

ture. Figure    shows how consumption and bond holdings grow over time

along the transition path to E'.

     It is instructive to ask why this reversal of the outcome

predicted by Laursen and Metzler is possible. The Keynesian
consumption function upon which the Laursefl-MetZler argument is based

posits a mechanical relationship between realized income and spending,
                                 17




 according to which the household smooths the path of its consumption

 stream by reducing saving as well as spending in response to a worsen-

 ing of the terms of trade. The result is a current—account deficit.

 However, an examination of the household's lifetime problem (8) shows

 why this reasonirg is invalid in the present framework. Given its view of future

 prices, the family smooths the path of its future consumption streaih; previous

 levels of real income are irrelevant. The point can be put another

 way. Expenditure will respond smoothly only to anticipated changes

 in real income. Unanticipated changes will convey new information and

 so dictate a revision of the lifetime consumption plan and a sharp

 change in spending. It is this sudden shift in expenditure that gives

rise to a current-account surplus in the present setting.

     We now consider the cases in which th economy's claims on the

rest of the world are nonzero when the disturbance occurs. These

may be thought of, of course, as cases of incomplete specialization

in the exported commodity. When bond holdings are negative, the terms-

of—trade shift leads to a fall in the export value of income, and the

export value of spending must decrease by a greater amount to deliver

the current surplus required for the return to long-run equilibrium.

But when net bond holdings are positive, the export value of in-

come rises when the terms of trade turn against the home country, and

so,an increase in the export value of consumption need not entail

a current deficit. Figure iii shows a case in which a positive expendi-

ture response results from a sufficiently large endowment of claims on

the foreign good. While in this instance the Laursen-Metzler spending

effect is verified, nonspecialization is a necessary condition and a

                       IV.   An Imperfect Capital Market

         In this section we relax the assumption that the home
                                                                 country
    has access to a perfect world capital market willing to lend or borrow

    any amount at the going world rate of interest. We suppose instead

    that the cost of borrowing faced by the home country is an increasing

    function of is indebtedness to the rest of the world. This extension

   adds to the complexity as well as the realism of our analysis. While

   under perfect capital mobility, the representative household's eventual

   utility level U is a constant determined by e fixed world intest

   rate r alone, our new assumption implies that U and r are jointly

   determined. In addition, we must describe how expectations regarding

   the future path of the interest rate are formed.

     We assume now that the number of households in the economy is 1, that



(18) r =   r(b),    r'(bt) <   0,


and that the realized path of interest rates, {rt}, is a perfect—foresight

equilibrium path. Under the last assumption, {rt} has the property that

when households behave competitively and maximize lifetime welfare in the

belief that rt} is the path of interest rates that will prevail, the chosen

path of bond holdings, b} ,    satisfies r =   r(b),   for all t.14 To find the

set of paths consistent with the maximization hypothesis and the perfect—fore--

sicht assumption, note that the necessary conditions (12) and (13) remain

applicable under competitive behavior. We need only substitute rt for r using

(18) in order to take into account the dependence of the interest rate on the
                                            19




  stock of bonds. The stationary—state (b,z) of the resulting system

  continues to be characterized by the equality of the marginal rate of

  time preference and the interest rate,



       S(V(p,z)) =r(b),



  and by external balance.

       To inves'tigate the system's dynamic properties in a neighborhood

  of the stationary—state, we may once again linearize (12) and (13)

  about (b,z), this time taking aOount of (18). The resulting approxi—

 mation is

                                              20




  of the system (19) is negative.15 Since the latter is the product

  of the system's characteristic roots, (19) must possess one negative

  root and one positive root, implying the existence of a unique saddlepath

  converging to the stationary position (b,z). It is straightforward

  to show that this'convergent path is the sole
                                                           perfect-foresight equi-
 librium path for the economy. 16

       Once again, the saddlepath satisfies the intertemporal budget

 constraint, which is now written as



                                dt -                t dt = 0,
  (20) b0 +   f (y/p)ePt               J   (z/p)e



where Pt -    f(b)       ds. The left-hand side of (20)         ,   after   a change of
variables from t to p, becomes



      b0 +
              J   ( - b)e         dp =     urn ben.


This limit is zero provided b              converges to a finite value.

     In Figure     Iv   we depict the joint determination of the long-run

equilibrium interest rate r and utility level U. Let (r) be the level

of bond holdings associated with interest rate r. The equation



(21) U = V(p,y +        r(r))

shows that a higher long-run utility level requires a higher long-

run level of interest payments from abroad and so (because                  ru
                                                                                 <   1) a
lower long—run interest rate. This gives the downward sloping rela—

 tionship BB shown in Figure IV. The upward-sloping relationship reflects

 the equality of the interest rate and rate of time preference that must

 obtain in the stationary state. Long-run equilibrium must be consistent

 with both of these relationships. The long-run values of utility and

 the interest rate ate thus determined by the intersection of the two

 schedules at E.

     We now consider the effects on the stationary utility level and interest rate of

 a permanent, adverse shift in the terms of trade. From (21)    ,   the
 position of the EB schedule depends on p. If p rises to p', the economy

 will enjoy a lower long—run utility level for any level of interest in-

 come, and so the EB schedule shifts leftward to B'B'   as   Figure V shows.

Thus, a rise in the relative price of imports leads to lower utility and

a lower interest rate in stationary-state equilibrium.

      Recalling our result that the system's stationary state is a saddle—

point, it is easy to characterize the dynamics of the transition path

leading there. A lower long—run interest rate implies higher net bond

holdings than before the disturbance, and the terms-of-trade shift must

therefore cause a current—account surplus on impact. Whether spending in

terms of exportables rises or falls will again depend on the economy's

initial holdings of claims on foreign output. When net claims are zero,

so that the economy is, in effect, specialized, a current surplus requires

a fall in the export value of expenditure.

    Consideration of the case where the capital market is imperfect re-

inforces our earlier conclusions regarding the effect of terms-of-trade

change on absorption and the external balance. In addition, it shows

how a fall in the relative price of exports may cause a decline in the

                          V. Conclusion

         This paper has studied the expenditure and current-account effects of a

 permanent terms-of-trade deterioration in an economy of infinitely-lived,

utility-maximizing families.    In this context of explicit, intertemporal

optimization, we found that the well—known Laursen-Metzler relationship

predicting a current deficit and a rise in the export value of spending

is invalid. A deterioration in the terms of trade, in our setting, leads

to a current surplus as households acquire interest—bearing claims on

foreigners in order to restore their stationary-state real income to

its original level. This entails a fall in the home-good value of

spending when initial bond holdings are zero, but may be coupled with

a rise in that variable when initial claims on future units of the import

are positive.

          These findings have arisen under a particular set of assumptions

 concerning preferences and the opportunites for transforming present utility

 into future utility. And, indeed, the interernporal transformation possibilities

 assumed here have differed form those assumed by Laursen and Metzler, who en-

visioned a monetary economy with a floating exchange rate, unable to borrow or

lend abroad. The validity of the Laursen-Metzler prediction depends in general

on the economy's intertemporal utility possibiuites and its menu of assets.

We have analyzed only one of many possible cases.

         Nonetheless, the example analyzed here throws doubt on the notions

underlying   the Keynesian consumption function   from which the Laursen—Metzler

prediction   is derived. Aggregate relationships that link consumption only to
                                       23




 measured income or wealth fail to account for the impact of unanticipated

                                                  constraint, changes that call for
 changes in the perceived lifetime budget

 a revision of the entire planned future consumption path. Recent

 discussion of the current—account "adjustment problem associated

 with terms-of-trade shocks to the industrialized economies has,

 for the most part, ignored this point




                                  App endix
        In this appendix, we show that the indirect utility function V(p,z)

is concave in z when the underlying utility function U(cf,ch) is concave.

To see this, write indirect utility as



        V(p,z) = max {U(c,z — pc)     }.

X c [0,1]. Then

      2. Johnson [1967] includes a survey of previous writing on the Laursen—

Metzler relationship, while Mussa [1979] and Dornbusch [1980] provide more re-

cent treatments. Interest in the macroeconomic consequences of terms-of—trade

disturbances has until recently been "crowded out" by the one-good paradig-m

associated with the monetary approach to the balance of payments. An excep-

tion is Rodriguez [1976], who attempts to deal with terms-of-trade questions

within the framework of the monetary approach.

      3. Keynes [1936], p. 96.

      4. This paper's assumption that the subjective rate of time preference

is a function of contemporaneous utility allows the small economy described

in Section I to attain a stationary state under perfect
                                                          capital mobility.

Findlay [1978] provides another example of this type of assumption, and a dis-

cussion. The economy described in Section IV could attain a stationary state

even if the subjective rate of time preference were constant, as is usual in optimal


 control problems. But the resulting model would have the unrealistic implication

 that a terms—of—trade change has no effect on the current account when the

 economy is initially in external balance. Svensson and Razin [1981] ,   in
 a two—period model, show that the current-account effect of a permanent

 terms—of—trade change depends on whether the subjective time preference

 rate is increasing or decreasing in the level of instantaneous utility.

 We make the former assumption in (3), below; the latter assumption

 excludes the possibility of a convergent optimal accumulation path

 in an infinite—horizon setting (see n. 11 below) , and thus renders our small-

 country assumption untenable. Note also that we have not analyzed the

 effects of transitory terms-of-trade shocks in this paper.

      5. If we allowed some lending to be indexed to the home good as. well,

 the economy would be able to vary its endowment of both goods. But this would

have no bearing on the results derived below.

      6. This assumption allows us to speak of 'the" rate of interest.

      7. It may be helpful to note that if instantaneous utility is constant

at level U, discounted lifetime utility is U/5(U), and the second inequality

in (3) asserts that this quotient rises as U rises.

      8. This is the solution proposed by Arrow and Kurz [1969], who provide

a more detailed discussion of the problem raised by perfect capital markets.

   saddlepath. If we define "total assets" as the sum of bond holdings

   plus the discounted future flow of the home good, a
                                                             b +   y/rp,   the


   flow constraint may be written a
                                       =
                                           ra - z/p.    Carrying out the

   optimization exercise (7) with a instead of b as state variable, we

   obtain necessary conditions identical with those appearing in the

   text. But since (7) imposes the constraint a > 0,
                                                     the condition

                      0 is sufficient for optimality.

 home goods is given by the "Metzlerian" function pe(b -                  b),   where e =

 (r   —
          /r2_4Tb/)/2
                        <   0.   Of course, this formula is applicable only so

 long as no unanticipated disturbances move the optimal path.



      13. There exit terms of trade so adverse that the "home" good

 becomes an import in the stationary state. But the long-run level of

 bond holdings must rise as long as the home good is being exported initially.

      14. Our assumption of competitive behavior implies that the interest

 rate perceived by households will differ from the economy's true marginal

rate of transformation between future and present goods. This type of

divergence is familiar from the optimal tariff literature, and can

he corrected by appropriate government fiscal intervention. The

government's problem is a dynamic one in the present context, however.

            The determinant is



            -                    =
                                     (1 -   2) (V )2( - V')'r - V(6 -
                    +

which is clearly negative provided                   <   1.

      16.    Because the saddlepath is convergent, it satisfies the optimal

control sufficiency theorem (cf. n. 10) and is thus a perfect—foresight

equilibrium path. Feasible, non convergent paths entail ever—rising in-

come but perpetually falling consumption. They therefore cannot be equi—

librium paths, for agents would never willingly pick the paths of bond

holdings generating the associated paths of the interest iate.
