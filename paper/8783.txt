Self-Validating Optimum Currency Areas

NBER Working Paper No. 8783
February 2002
JEL No. E5, F4



                                             ABSTRACT


        In this paper we show that a currency area can be a self-validating optimal policy regime, even
when monetary unification does not foster real economic integration and intra-industry trade. In our
model exporters choose the degree of exchange rate pass-through onto export prices given monetary
policy rules, and monetary authorities choose optimal policy rules taking firms' pass-through as given.
We show that there exist two equilibria, which define two self-validating currency regimes. In the first,
firms preset prices in domestic currency only, and let foreign-currency prices to be determined by the law
of one price. Optimal policy rules then target the domestic output gap and floating exchange rates support
the flex-price allocation. In the second equilibrium firms optimally preset prices in local currency, and
a monetary union is the optimal policy choice for all countries. Although business cycles are more
synchronized with a common currency, flexible exchange rates are superior in terms of welfare.

1       Introduction
In the vast literature on optimum currency areas (OCAs), an influential con-
tribution by Frankel and Rose [1997, 1998] suggests that a monetary union
may become optimal ex-post, even though the individual countries that join it
do not meet the optimality criteria ex-ante. The argument is that the elimina-
tion of foreign exchange transaction costs has real effects and foster economic
integration. To the extent that economic integration enhances intra-industry
trade rather than product specialization, national business cycles become
more synchronized, since sectoral demand shocks and productivity innova-
tions affect all countries at the same time. Higher national output correlation
then reduces the need for exchange rate adjustments to stabilize national em-
ployment and prices, and minimizes the welfare costs of giving up national
currencies. Using thirty years of data for twenty industrialized countries,
Frankel and Rose [1997, 1998] provide empirical evidence that countries with
closer trade links exhibit more tightly correlated business cycles. Rose and
Engel [2000] show that membership in a common currency area increases
international business cycle correlations by a significant amount.
    In this paper, we offer a distinct argument for a theory of endogenous op-
timal currency areas, with conceptual roots in the Lucas critique. We show
that — independent of economic integration — the adoption of a common
monetary policy can be self-validating: when the private sector chooses pric-
ing strategies that are optimal in a monetary union, such strategies make a
currency area the optimal monetary regime from the vantage point of the na-
tional policymakers as well. In other words, there is no incentive for monetary
authorities to pursue independent strategies of national output stabilization.
As a result, even if there is no structural change in fundamentals (e.g., no
increase in intra-industry trade), national outputs become more correlated.
    In this paper we analyze endogenous optimal monetary unions within
a general-equilibrium two-country, choice-theoretic stochastic setting where
national welfare is measured by the utility of each country’s representative
household.1 The key elements of our approach are imperfect competition
in production, nominal rigidities in the goods markets, and forward-looking

area when political factors influence monetary policy see Neumeyer [1998].

price-setting by firms. Drawing on our previous work (Corsetti and Pesenti
[2001a]), our setup allows for imperfect pass-through of exchange rate onto
export prices. In what follows, the degree of pass-through is endogenously
chosen ex-ante by exporters, in the form of a rule of limited price flexibility
contingent on exchange rate movements.
    To distinguish our theory from the previous argument for endogenous
optimal currency areas, we rule out a priori structural change: countries are
perfectly specialized in the production of one type of good before and after the
monetary union. Firms optimally choose prices and pass-through elasticities
based on information on shocks and policy rules. Taking firms’ pricing and
pass-through strategies as given, monetary authorities choose optimal state-
contingent monetary policy rules. In a world equilibrium, both the degree
of pass-through and monetary policy are jointly determined by optimizing
agents.
    We show that there are two equilibria, which can be Pareto ranked. While
exporters could in principle choose any intermediate level of pass-through, in
equilibrium pass-through is either 100 percent or zero as producers optimally
choose ‘corner’ pricing strategies to prevent their markups from being affected
by exchange rate fluctuations.2 There is one equilibrium in which firms
choose to preset prices in domestic currency, and let the foreign price adjust
according to the law of one price. With complete pass-through, monetary
policies are fully inward-looking: they implement stabilization rules that
close national output gaps completely in every period. This equilibrium is
inconsistent with fixed exchange rates, and implies low correlation among
output levels — depending on the cross-country correlation of fundamental
shocks. The exchange rate plays the role stressed by Friedman [1953]: it
brings about the required relative price adjustments that are hindered by
the presence of nominal price rigidities.
    But there is another equilibrium in which firms preset prices in consumer
currency. With zero pass-through in the world economy, monetary policies
are perfectly symmetric across countries, that is, they both respond to the
same average of national shocks. This equilibrium is consistent with an
OCA: there is no cost in giving up monetary sovereignty because, even if
   2
     Related literature focuses on the choice of pricing strategies where monetary authori-
ties are assumed to implement non-optimizing, noisy policies (as in the work by Bacchetta
and Van Wincoop [2001] and Devereux and Engel [2001]) rather than optimal rules.



                                            2
national monetary authorities remained independent, they would still choose
to implement the same monetary rules, moving interest rates in tandem
and responding symmetrically to world-wide shocks. National outputs are
perfectly correlated even when shocks are asymmetric.
    In welfare terms, the optimal monetary union is Pareto-inferior to the
Friedman-style arrangement in the first equilibrium. Although the private
and the public sector ‘do the right thing’ — in terms of policy and pricing
strategies — once the equilibrium with a monetary union is selected, there
is still room for welfare improvement by creating conditions for relative price
adjustment via changes of the exchange rate. A move toward more volatile
rates and less synchronized business cycles would bring about the appropriate
change in firms’ pricing and pass-through strategies, which in turn would
validate the floating regime as optimal.
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model. Sec-
tion 3 studies price-setters’ optimal behavior and endogenous pass-through
strategies for given monetary policies. Section 4 focuses instead on optimal
monetary policies given firms’ pricing strategies. The previous two pieces
of analysis are brought together in sections 5 and 6, which characterize the
equilibrium of the economy. A final section discusses our main results.


2     The model
2.1    Preferences, technology and budget constraints
Following Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a] we model a world economy with two
countries, H (Home) and F (Foreign), each specialized in one type of traded
good. Each good is produced in a number of brands defined over a continuum
of unit mass. Brands are indexed by h in the Home country and f in the
Foreign country. Each country is populated by households defined over a
continuum of unit mass. Households are indexed by j in the Home country
and j ∗ in the Foreign country.
    Home agent j’s lifetime expected utility W is defined as:
                        ∞
                        X
      Wt−1 (j) ≡ Et−1          β τ −t [ln Cτ (j) − κ`τ (j)]   0 < β < 1, κ > 0   (1)
                        τ =t

where β is the discount rate. The instantaneous utility is a positive function

                                            3
of the consumption index C(j) and a negative function of labor effort `(j).
Foreign agents’ preferences are similarly defined: the discount rate is the
same as in the Home country, while κ∗ in the Foreign country need not
coincide with κ in the Home country.
    For each agent j in the Home country, the consumption indexes of Home
and Foreign brands are defined as:
                                                 θ                                                           ∗
             ´Z       1                       µ θ−1              ´Z       1                             µ θ∗θ−1
                                      θ−1                                                 θ ∗ −1
CH,t (j) ≡                Ct (h, j)    θ    dh      , CF,t (j) ≡              Ct (f, j)     θ∗     df             θ, θ∗ > 1.
                  0                                                   0
                                                                               (2)
where Ct (h, j) and Ct (f, j) are respectively consumption of Home brand h
and Foreign brand f by Home agent j at time t. Each Home brand is an
imperfect substitute for all other Home brands, with constant elasticity of
substitution θ. Similarly the elasticity of substitution among Foreign brands
is θ∗ . The consumption indexes in the Foreign country, CH,t
                                                           ∗
                                                             (j ∗ ) and CF,t
                                                                         ∗
                                                                             (j ∗ ),
are analogously defined.
    We assume that the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign
types is one, thus smaller than the elasticity of substitution between brands
of the same type of good produced in each country, θ and θ∗ . Under this
assumption the consumption baskets of individuals j and j ∗ can be written
as a Cobb-Douglas function of the Home and Foreign consumption indexes:

 Ct (j) ≡ CH,t (j)γ CF,t (j)1−γ , Ct∗ (j ∗ ) ≡ CH,t
                                                ∗
                                                    (j ∗ )γ CF,t
                                                             ∗
                                                                 (j ∗ )1−γ                          0 < γ < 1 (3)

where the weights γ and 1 − γ are identical across countries.
   We denote the prices of brands h and f in the Home market (thus ex-
pressed in the Home currency) as p(h) and p(f ), and the prices in the Foreign
market (in Foreign currency) as p∗ (h) and p∗ (f ). Given the prices of brands,
we can derive the utility-based price indexes PH , PF , P and their Foreign
analogs.3 In particular, the utility-based CPIs are:
           γ                       ¡γ ∗ ¡1−γ
         PH,t PF1−γ     ∗
                                ∗
                              PH,t    PF,t
   Pt =          ,t
                    , Pt =                           γW ≡ γ γ (1 − γ)1−γ . (4)
             γW                      γW
  3
     For instance, the utility-based price index PH,t is defined as the minimum expen-
diture required to buy one unit of the composite good CH,t and is derived as PH,t =
hR                    1

    Each brand h is produced by a single Home agent and sold in both coun-
tries under conditions of monopolistic competition. Output is denoted Y .
Technology is linear in household’s h labor, `(h). The resource constraint for
brand h is:
                                Z 1               Z 1
                       `t (h)
              Yt (h) =        ≥     Ct (h, j)dj +     Ct∗ (h, j ∗ )dj ∗    (5)
                         αt      0                 0

where α is a country-specific productivity shock. The resource constraint for
Foreign brand f is similarly defined as a function of the productivity shock
in the Foreign country, α∗ .
    Home agent j receives a revenue R(j) from the sale of the good she pro-
duces. Since each agent is the sole producer of a specific brand, we associate
individual j with brand h. The sales revenue of agent j, expressed in Home
currency, is:
                             Z 1                         Z 1
             Rt (j) ≡ pt (h)                       ∗
                                 Ct (h, j)dj + Et pt (h)     Ct (h, j ∗ )dj ∗ (6)
                               0                           0

where E is the nominal exchange rate, defined as Home currency per unit of
Foreign currency.
   Home agents hold two international bonds, BH and BF , denominated in
Home and Foreign currency, respectively.4 Both international bonds are in
zero net supply. The individual flow budget constraint for agent j in the
Home country is:

            BH,t+1 (j) + Et BF,t+1 (j) ≤ (1 + it )BH,t (j) + (1 + i∗t )Et BF,t (j)
                       Z 1                     Z 1
            +Rt (j) −      pt (h)Ct (h, j)dh −     pt (f )Ct (f, j)df                (7)
                         0                        0

In the expression above the short-term nominal rates it and i∗t are paid at the
beginning of period t and are known at time t − 1. The two short-term rates
are directly controlled by the national governments.5 Similar expressions
hold for the Foreign country, after associating household j ∗ with brand f .
   4
     We adopt the notation of Obstfeld and Rogoff [1996, ch.10]. Specifically, our timing
convention has BH,t (j) and BF,t (j) as agent j’s nominal bonds accumulated during period
t − 1 and carried over into period t.
   5
     The adoption of a cash-less economy framework is merely motivated in terms of an-
alytical convenience. All the results of this model go through when money demand is


                                            5
    Taking prices as given, Home agent j maximizes (1) subject to (7) with
respect to consumption and asset holdings. A similar optimization problem
is solved by Foreign agent j ∗ . In our analysis below we focus on symmetric
equilibria in which at some initial point in time t = 0 all agents have zero net
financial wealth. As shown in Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a, b], in equilibrium
wealth is zero at any subsequent point in time: Home imports from Foreign
are always equal in value to Foreign imports from Home. Since agents are
equal within countries (though not necessarily symmetric across countries)
we can drop the indexes j and j ∗ and interpret all variables in per-capita
(or aggregate) terms. As trade and the current account are always balanced,
countries consume precisely their aggregate sales revenue:

                         Rt − Pt Ct = 0,          Rt∗ − Pt∗ Ct∗ = 0.                    (8)

2.2     Nominal rigidities, exchange rate pass-through and
        price setting
It is assumed that individual firms set the nominal price of their product one
period in advance, and stand ready to meet demand at given prices for one
period. In terms of our notation, Home firms selling in the Home market
choose pt (h) at time t − 1 by maximizing (1) subject to (7) with respect to
pt (h), accounting for (5) and (6).6 As shown in Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a],
explicitly considered. Liquidity demand could easily be introduced in the model through
a cash-in-advance constraint of the type Mt (j) = Pt Ct (j) and Mt∗ (j) = Pt∗ Ct∗ (j ∗ ), or
through a money-in-utility-function framework. In both cases money demand would be
residually determined in equilibrium as a function of nominal interest rates.
    6
      Standard intratemporal optimization yields agent j’s demand for brand h as a function
of the relative price of h and total consumption of Home goods:
                                                       −θ
                             Ct (h, j) = (pt (h)/PH,t )     CH,t (j)

Similar expressions can be derived for the other brands. Accounting for the demand
functions above, we can rewrite the resource constraint for agents h in the Home country
as:                                                               ¡θ ∗
                    `(h)/αt ≥ pt (h)−θ PH,t

                                            CH,t + p∗t (h)−θ PH,t

                                                                    CH,t
and sales revenue as:
                                                                       ¡θ

in an environment in which national agents are symmetric (i.e. all prices pt (h)
are equal and pt (h) = PH,t ), Home firms optimally set domestic prices equal
to expected nominal marginal cost M Ct (equal to καt Pt Ct in our model),
augmented by the equilibrium markup θ/ (θ − 1):
                                θ                       θ
             pt (h) = PH,t =       Et−1 [καt Pt Ct ] =     Et−1 [M Ct ]                 (9)
                               θ−1                     θ−1
    Home firms selling abroad also set nominal prices one period in advance.
Different from most models in the literature, however, we do not impose a
priori the restriction that export prices are set in Home currency, implying
that all unexpected fluctuations in the exchange rate are ‘passed through’
one-to-one onto export prices in Foreign currency (in the literature this sce-
nario is referred to as ‘Producer Currency Pricing’ or PCP). At the same
time, we do not impose a priori the opposite restriction that export prices
are set in Foreign currency, implying that Foreign-currency prices of Home
goods do not respond at all to unexpected exchange rate fluctuations (i.e.
the case of ‘Local Currency Pricing’ or LCP). We consider instead the more
general case in which Home firms preset export prices in Foreign currency
but are able to modify them after observing exchange rate changes. In our
setup, the extent to which Foreign-currency prices of Home exports adjust
contingent on the realization of the exchange rate is a choice variable, deter-
mined by Home firms at time t − 1. In other words, the elasticity of exchange
rate pass-through can endogenously be zero (as in the LCP case), one (as in
the PCP case), or any intermediate number.
    Formally, Foreign-currency prices of Home brands are modelled as:
                                        p̃t (h)
                            p∗t (h) ≡     η∗
                                                      0 ≤ ηt∗ ≤ 1                      (10)
                                         Et t
where p̃t (h) is the predetermined component of the Foreign currency price
of good h that cannot be adjusted to variations of the exchange rate during
period t and ηt∗ indexes the degree of pass-through in the Foreign market.7
Home firms choose p̃t (h) and ηt∗ one period in advance at time t − 1 in order
to maximize (1), while the actual p∗t (h) depends on the realization of the
  7
    For instance, if η ∗ = 1, pass-through in the Foreign country is complete — as in the
PCP case. If η ∗ = 0, we have p∗t (h) = p̃t (h) which coincides with the price chosen by the
Home producer in the LCP case.

exchange rate at time t. Clearly, depending on firms’ choice, the degree of
pass-through may vary over time.8
   In equilibrium, we obtain:

                                              h                 i                   h             i

                                                                     =                   η∗

Interpreting (11), domestic firms set p̃t (h) such that at the margin the ex-
pected disutility from an increase in labor effort is equal to the expected
utility from consumption financed by additional sales revenue.
    Analogous expressions can be derived for the prices set by Foreign firms
in the Foreign and the Home market. Define the function:

                              pt (f ) = p̃∗t (f )Etηt ,       0 ≤ ηt ≤ 1.                     (12)

The degree of pass-through in the Home country, ηt , need not be equal to
that in the Foreign country, ηt∗ . The optimal pricing strategy is such that:

        ∗         θ∗                                        θ∗     ηt           ∗ 1−ηt
                       Et−1 [M Ct∗ ] ,
                                                                           ¢           £
       PF,t =                                   PF,t =           Et   Et−1  M Ct Et           (13)
                θ∗ − 1                                    θ∗ − 1

   Clearly, Home firms are willing to supply goods at given prices as long as
their ex-post markup does not fall below one:

                                                           ∗       M Ct
                                  PH,t ≥ M Ct ,           PH,t ≥                              (14)
                                                                    Et
Otherwise, agents would be better off by not accommodating shocks to de-
mand. In what follows, we restrict the set of shocks so that the ‘participation
constraint’ (14) and its Foreign analog are never violated.
   8
    The model could be easily extended to encompass the case in which the pass-through
elasticity is a non-linear function of the exchange rate (e.g., η ∗ is close to zero for small
changes of the exchange rate E but close to one for large exchange rate fluctuations).




                                                      8
2.3     Monetary policy and the closed-form solution of
        the model
Before deriving the general solution of the model, it is helpful to introduce
an index of monetary stance µt such that:
                                            ²      ³
                        1                      1
                           = β(1 + it+1 )Et                              (15)
                        µt                    µt+1
or, integrating forward,
                                           N −1
                      1             N   1 Y
                         = Et lim β             (1 + it+τ +1 )                       (16)
                      µt     N →∞     µt+N τ =0

This expression shows that the index of monetary stance is a function of both
current and future expected Home nominal interest rates: Home monetary
easing at time t (a higher µt ) reflects either an interest rate cut at time t
(i.e., a lower it+1 ) or expectations of future interest rates cuts. A similar
expression holds for the Foreign country.
    Note that in equilibrium µt is equal to Pt Ct 9 (and µ∗t is equal to Pt∗ Ct∗ ): a
monetary expansion delivers increased nominal spending. A monetary union
in our framework is defined as a regime in which it+1 = i∗t+1 for all t. If both
countries adopt the same numeraire, this implies µt = µ∗t .
    Table 1 presents the general solution of the model, in which all endogenous
variables (17) through (26) are expressed in closed form as functions of real
shocks (αt and αt∗ ) and monetary stances (µt and µ∗t ).10
    Interpreting Table 1: since the equilibrium current account is always bal-
anced (see (8) above) and the demand for imports is proportional to nominal
expenditures Pt Ct and Pt∗ Ct∗ , the nominal exchange rate Et in (17) is propor-
tional to Pt Ct /Pt∗ Ct∗ , that is, a function of the relative monetary stance.11
The relations (18) link marginal costs to macroeconomic shocks and mone-
tary policy. Domestic prices of domestic goods are predetermined according
   9
     This result can be obtained by comparing the Home Euler equation with logarithmic
utility, 1 = β (1 + it+1 ) Et (Pt Ct /Pt+1 Ct+1 ), with (15).
  10
     Algebraic details can be found in the Appendix of Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a]. Note
that the solution does not hinge upon any specific assumption or restriction on the nature
of the shocks besides the participation constraints (14) and their Foreign analogs.
  11
     Note that the exchange rate is a forward-looking variable, as it depends on current
and expected future changes in short-term nominal interest rates in the world economy.

ing on the degree of exchange rate pass-through according to (20) and (21).
Equilibrium consumption is determined in (23) and (24). Finally employ-

3        Optimal exchange rate pass-through for given
         monetary policy
What is the optimal degree of exchange rate pass-through onto export prices
of Home goods in the Foreign market? Taking monetary stances and policy
rules as given, Home firms choose η ∗ as to maximize (1). In a symmetric
environment with p∗ (h) = PH∗ the first order condition is:13
                                                        ∗
                         θ κ Et−1 (αt Pt∗ Ct∗ ln Et ) /PH,t
                                   ¢                        £
                   1=                                                 (27)
                        θ−1            Et−1 [ln Et ]

Comparing (27) with (11), it follows that the optimal pass-through η ∗ is such
that:                                      h        ∗
                                                          i

                      h           i   Et−1 αt µt Et ln Et
                               η∗
                 Et−1 αt µ∗t Et t =                                       (28)
                                           Et−1 [ln Et ]
or, rearranging:                        h                        i
                                                   1−η ∗

   This is a key condition. At an optimum, the (reciprocal of the) markup in
the export market must be uncorrelated with the (log of the) exchange rate.
Trivially, if E is constant or fully anticipated, any degree of pass-through is
consistent with the previous expression. But if E is not perfectly predictable,
the optimal degree of pass-through will depend on the expected monetary

policies and the structure of the shocks.14 By the same token, the optimal
pass-through chosen by Foreign firms selling in the Home market requires:

                     Covt−1 M Ct∗ Et1−ηt , ln (1/Et ) = 0.
                                                     ¡

    To build intuition, suppose that the Home marginal cost is uncorrelated
with the exchange rate (this would be the case if Home monetary policy
were deterministic and Foreign monetary policy did not respond to Home
shocks). In this case the optimal pass-through chosen by Home firms is
100 percent: Home firms let their export prices absorb fluctuations of the
exchange rate in order to avoid uncertainty of markup and profitability in
the Foreign market. Suppose instead that domestic marginal costs move
one to one with the exchange rate (this would be the case if there were no
Home productivity shocks and Foreign monetary policy were deterministic).
In this case the optimal pass-through for Home firms selling abroad is zero:
maintaining export prices constant in Foreign currency is the best strategy
to avoid fluctuations in export markups.
    Patterns of endogenous intermediate pass-through can emerge, as the
following example illustrates. If the Home monetary authority adopted the
                      −1
policy µt = (αt2 µ∗t ) , then it would be optimal for Home firms to choose
ηt∗ = 0.5. Abroad, we would need M Ct∗ Et1−ηt to be uncorrelated with the
exchange rate. This would be the case, for instance, if µ∗t = αt4 / (αt∗ )5 and
ηt = 0.6.

Consider now the policymakers’ problem in a world Nash equilibrium where
national monetary authorities are able to commit to preannounced rules, tak-
ing the pass-through coefficients as given.15 The problem faced by the Home
  14
     When monetary policy is exogenous (suboptimal) and firms are only allowed to choose
between zero and 100 percent pass-through (that is, between local-currency and producer-
currency pricing), the formula above is consistent with the analysis of Devereux and Engel
[2001] and Bacchetta and van Wincoop [2001].

The Foreign authority faces a similar problem. Table 2 presents the closed-
form reaction functions, the solution to which is the global Nash equilibrium.16
To facilitate an intuitive understanding of the formulas, each reaction func-
tion is written in two ways: as a function of marginal costs and markups, or
as a function of employment gaps and deviations from the law of one price.
    An optimal policy requires that the Home monetary stance be eased (µ
increases) in response to a positive domestic productivity shock (α falls).
Absent a policy reaction, a positive productivity shock would create both an
output and an employment gap. In fact, ` would fall below (θ − 1) / (θκ).
Actual output Y would not change, but potential output, defined as the
equilibrium output the economy could reach if prices were fully flexible, would
increase. In light of this, optimal monetary policy leans against the wind and
moves to close the employment and output gaps.
    In general, however, the optimal response to a Home productivity shock
will not close the output gap completely. Home stabilization policy, in fact,
induces fluctuations in the exchange rate that add uncertainty to Foreign
firms’ sales revenue from the Home market. For instance, a depreciation of
the Home currency reduces the revenue of Foreign firms exporting to Home,
as PF /E falls by a percentage 1 − η with the movement in the exchange
rate. If Foreign marginal costs do not move in tandem with export sales
revenue, Foreign firms’ profit margins shrink. Ex-ante, Foreign agents will
require compensation for the additional risk they face in the Home market.
They will therefore preset higher prices on their exports, lowering Home
consumption on average.
    This is why the Home monetary adjustment required to close the domestic
output gap is not optimal. Relative to such stance, domestic policymakers
can improve utility by adopting a policy that equates, at the margin, the
benefit from keeping domestic output close to its potential level with the loss
  16
     As well known, in this class of models optimal monetary rules such as the reaction
functions of Table 2 do not provide a nominal anchor to pin down nominal expectations.
The issue can be addressed by assuming that governments set national nominal anchors
(such as target paths for PH and PF∗ ) and credibly threaten to tighten monetary policy
if the price of domestic goods deviates from the target. Such threats, however, are never
implemented in equilibrium. See e.g. Woodford [2002] and the Appendix of Corsetti and
Pesenti [2001a].

from lower consumption (due to the effects of exchange rate volatility on the
level of import prices).
    As long as η is below one, the Home monetary stance tightens when
productivity worsens abroad and loosens otherwise. Rising costs abroad (an
increase in α∗ ) lower the markup of Foreign goods sold at Home. If Home
policymakers were not expected to stabilize the markup by raising rates and
appreciating the exchange rate, Foreign firms would charge higher prices onto
Home consumers. Only when η = 1 do Foreign firms realize that any attempt
by the Home authorities to stabilize the markup is bound to fail as both PF
and the exchange rate fall in the same proportion.

   With complete pass-through in both countries, the policies in a Nash
equilibrium are:

                                Et−1 (αt µt )                Et−1 (αt∗ µ∗t )

Monetary authorities optimally stabilize marginal costs and markups. Out-
put gaps are fully closed and employment remains unchanged at the potential
level (θ − 1) / (θκ) or (θ∗ − 1) / (θ∗ κ∗ ). Both domestic and global consump-
tion endogenously co-move with productivity shocks. Thus, the Nash opti-
mal monetary policy supports the same allocation as would flexible prices.
This result provides an extreme version of the case for flexible exchange rates
made by Friedman [1953]: even without price flexibility, monetary authorities
can engineer the right adjustment in relative prices through exchange rate
movements. In our model with PCP, expenditure-switching effects makes
exchange rate and price movements perfect substitutes.
    The Nash equilibrium will however not coincide with a flex-price equilib-
rium when the pass-though is less than perfect in either market. Consider for
instance the case of LCP.17 In this case the optimal monetary policy in each
country cannot be inward-looking, and must instead respond symmetrically
to shocks anywhere in the world economy. The optimal monetary policy in
Table 2 can in fact be written as:
                                                                 µ−1

expressions that imply µ = µ∗ .
    In our model, the exchange rate is a function of the relative monetary
stance µ/µ∗ . Our analysis then suggests that exchange rate volatility will
be higher in a world economy close to purchasing power parity, and lower in
a world economy where deviations from the law of one price are large. In
fact, if the exposure of firms’ revenue to exchange rate fluctuations is lim-
ited, inward-looking policymakers assign high priority to stabilizing domestic

output and prices, with ‘benign neglect’ of exchange rate movements. Other-
wise, policymakers ‘think globally’, taking into account the repercussions of
exchange rate volatility on consumer prices; hence, the monetary stances in
the world economy come to mimic each other, reducing currency volatility.
    The characterization of optimal monetary unions is a simple corollary of
the analysis above. We define a monetary union µt = µ∗t as optimal if the
single monetary stance µt is optimal for both countries. It is straightforward
to show that when shocks are perfectly correlated, the optimal allocation
is such that M Ct = Et−1 (M Ct ) and M Ct∗ = Et−1 (M Ct∗ ) regardless of the
degree of pass-through. Optimal monetary policies support a fixed exchange
rate regime and an optimal monetary union while fully closing the national
output gaps. If shocks are asymmetric, a monetary union is optimal only
when both countries find it optimal to choose a symmetric monetary stance,
that is, when pass-through is zero worldwide.


5     Optimal exchange rate pass-through and mon-
      etary policy in equilibrium
Recapitulating: Home and Foreign firms choose the levels of pass-through ηt∗
and ηt on the basis of their information at time t−1 regarding marginal costs
and exchange rates at time t, by solving (29) and (30). Home and Foreign
monetary authorities take the levels of pass-through ηt∗ and ηt as given and
determine their optimal monetary stances by solving the conditions (31) and
(32). We now consider the joint determination of µt , µ∗t , ηt and ηt∗ satisfying
the four equations above in the non-trivial case in which the shocks αt and
αt∗ are asymmetric.
    The following allocation is an equilibrium:

                    M Ct = Et−1 (M Ct ) , M Ct∗ = Et−1 (M Ct∗ )
                    ηt = ηt∗ = 1                                            (36)

Purchasing power parity holds and there is full pass-through of exchange rate
changes into prices. Monetary policies fully stabilize the national economies
by closing output and employment gaps. Exchange rates are highly volatile,
their conditional variance being proportional to the volatility of αt∗ /αt . We
will refer to this equilibrium as an optimal float (OF).

                                       16
    The logic underlying the OF case can be understood as follows. Suppose
Foreign firms selling in the Home market choose η = 1 and let Home-currency
prices of Foreign goods move one-to-one with the exchange rate, stabilizing
their markups. Then the Home monetary authority chooses as a rule to
stabilize Home output fully, no matter the consequences for the exchange
rate (the volatility of which does not affect Foreign exporters’ profitability
and therefore does not affect, on average, the price of Foreign goods paid
by Home consumers). Note that when η = 1, Home output stabilization
implies that M C is a constant. But this implies that the marginal costs
of Home firms are uncorrelated with the exchange rate. Thus, Home firms
will optimally set their pass-through abroad and choose η ∗ = 1 in order to
stabilize the markup on their exports to the Foreign country. Since Home
firms are now fully insulated from exchange rate fluctuations, the Foreign
monetary authority optimally chooses to stabilize Foreign output with benign
neglect of the exchange rate, so that M C ∗ is a constant. But in this case
Foreign firms optimally choose η = 1 as we had assumed initially: the OF
case is an equilibrium.
    Consider now the following allocation:
                     M Ct                   M Ct∗
         1 = γ                 + (1 − γ)               ,   Et = const
                  Et−1 (M Ct )           Et−1 (M Ct∗ )
         ηt   = ηt∗ = 0                                                  (37)

This is the LCP scenario brought to its extreme consequences: there is no
pass-through of exchange rate changes into prices, but this hardly matters
since the exchange rate is fixed! Optimal national monetary policies are fully
symmetric, thus cannot insulate the national economies from asymmetric
shocks: it is only on average that they stabilize the national economies by
closing output and employment gaps — the most apparent case of an optimal
currency area.
    To see why the previous scenario an equilibrium, note that if Home and
Foreign firms choose η = η ∗ = 0, Home and Foreign authorities are concerned
with the price-distortions of exchange rate volatility. They will optimize
over the trade-off between employment stability and consumers’ purchasing
power. While they choose their rules independently of each other, the rules
they adopt are fully symmetric, thus leading to exchange rate stability. But
if the exchange rate is constant, the choice of the pass-through is no longer

                                       17
a concern for Home and Foreign firms: zero pass-through is as good as a
choice as any other level of η and η ∗ . Such weak preference implies that the
monetary union is an equilibrium.
     Would the two allocations above still be equilibrium allocation if national
authorities could commit to coordinated policies, maximizing some weighted
average of expected utility of the two national representative consumers?
This is an important question, as one may argue that policymakers in a
monetary union would set their rules together (taking private agents’ pricing
and pass-through strategies as given), rather than independently. By the
same token, if there were large gains from cooperation in a floating exchange
rate regime, there would also be an incentive for policymakers to design the
optimal float in a coordinated way. One may conjecture that, once coopera-
tive policies are allowed for, the equilibrium allocation becomes unique.
     Remarkably, it turns out that the possibility of cooperation does not
modify at all the conclusions of our analysis. It can be easily shown that
optimal policy rules conditional on η, η ∗ = 1 are exactly the same in a Nash
equilibrium and under coordination: there are no gains from cooperation
in the PCP scenario which replicates the flex-price allocation.18 Also, as
shown in Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a], optimal policy rules conditional on
η, η ∗ = 0 are identical with and without cooperation: since exchange rate
fluctuations are the only source of international spillover, there cannot be
gains from cooperation when non-cooperative monetary rules already imply
stable exchange rates!19 While there are policy spillovers for any intermediate
degree of pass through (0 > η, η ∗ > 1), they disappear in equilibrium under
the two extreme pass-through scenarios. In the only two cases relevant for
our equilibrium analysis, optimal monetary policy rules are exactly the same
whether or not the two national policymakers cooperate with each other.
  18
     See Obstfeld and Rogoff [2000a,b] and Corsetti and Pesenti [2001a].
  19
     With LCP, expected utility at Home is identical to expected utility in the Foreign
country up to a constant that does not depend on monetary policy. For any given shock,
consumption increases by the same percentage everywhere in the world economy. Even
if ex-post labor moves asymmetrically (so that ex-post welfare is not identical in the two
countries, as is the case under PCP), ex-ante the expected disutility from labor is the same
as under flexible prices.

6     Endogenous OCAs: Macroeconomics and
      welfare analysis
Can a monetary union be a self-validating OCA? Our model suggests that
the answer is yes. Policy commitment to monetary union — i.e., the adop-
tion of the rules (34-35) — leads profit-maximizing producers to modify their
pricing strategies, lowering their pass-through elasticities. Such behavioral
change makes a monetary union optimal, even if macroeconomic fundamen-
tals and the pattern of shocks (αt and αt∗ in our framework) remain unchanged
across regimes.
    A crucial result of our analysis is that, under an OCA, output correla-
tion is higher than under the alternative OF equilibrium. In fact, under OF,
monetary policies are such that employment in both countries is always sta-
bilized (both ex-ante and ex-post) at the constant levels ` = (θ − 1) / (θκ)
and `∗ = (θ∗ − 1) / (θ∗ κ∗ ). This implies that output correlation under OF
depends on the degree of asymmetry of the fundamental shocks:

where W f lex is independent of monetary regime, and equal to the utility that
consumers could expect to achieve if prices were fully flexible. By Jensen’s
inequality, the term in square brackets is always non-negative: expected
utility with price rigidities is never above expected utility with flexible prices.
At best, what monetary policy rules can do is to bridge the gap between the
two.
    Observe that under the OF equilibrium (36) the term in square bracket
becomes zero and W OF = W f lex . But this implies that W OF ≥ W OCA ,
an inequality that holds with strong sign when shocks are asymmetric. It
follows that an optimal currency area is always Pareto-inferior vis-à-vis a
Friedman-style optimal flexible exchange rate arrangement.


7     Discussion and conclusion
The theory of optimal currency areas, from the classic contributions by
Mundell [1961], McKinnon [1963], Kenen [1969] and Ingram [1973] to its mod-
ern applications and revisions,20 stresses that asymmetric, country-specific
shocks represent a key element in the choice of exchange rate regime. Specif-
ically, asymmetric real shocks weaken the case for a common currency, as
member states of a monetary union lose their ability to use domestic ex-
change rate and interest rate policies for stabilization purposes. Conversely,
business cycle synchronization and macroeconomic convergence make a cur-
rency area an optimal monetary arrangement, other things being equal, by
reducing the scope for asymmetric policy responses to the disturbances hit-
ting the union-wide economy. In terms of our model, an exogenous increase
in the correlation of the real shocks leads to closer co-movements in optimal
monetary stances for any level of exchange rate pass-through.
    The argument for an endogenous optimal currency area emphasizes that
the monetary union itself could act as a catalyst of business cycle synchroniza-
tion, essentially by reducing foreign exchange transaction costs and therefore
by promoting trade integration across countries. Not everyone agrees with
this argument: for instance Eichengreen [1992] and Krugman [1993] stress
that monetary integration could lead to greater specialization in production,
  20
     Those include, among others, Eichengreen [1990, 1992], Dowd and Greenaway [1993],
Tavlas [1993], Bayoumi and Eichengreen [1994], Melitz [1996] and Bayoumi [1997]. See

thus lowering output correlation and making regions more vulnerable to local
shocks. On an empirical basis, however, the evidence presented by Frankel
and Rose [1998] supports the view that trade links raise income correlations.
The conclusion is that the OCA criterion may be satisfied ex-post even if it
fails ex-ante.
    But what would happen if monetary integration fails to boost economic
convergence and intra-industry trade? Would it still be possible for a mone-
tary union to satisfy ex-post the OCA criterion when monetary and real inte-
gration fail to move in tandem? In this paper we have shown the existence of
two equilibria in a standard open-economy model where the alternative be-
tween pricing-to-market and law of one price depends on endogenous choices
by firms. This result suggests that credible policy commitment to monetary
union may lead to a change in pricing strategies, making a monetary union
the optimal monetary arrangement in a self-validating way.
    It is worth emphasizing that a common monetary policy is optimal be-
cause, for given producers’ pricing strategies, the use of the exchange rate
for stabilization purposes would entail excessive welfare costs, in the form
of higher import prices and lower purchasing power across countries. Once
a monetary union takes off and firms adapt their pricing strategies to the
new environment, the best course of action for the monetary authorities is
to avoid any asymmetric policy response to asymmetric shocks. As a re-
sult, even in the absence of the structural effects of monetary integration
stressed by Frankel and Rose [1997, 1998] (e.g., even without an increase in
intra-industry trade), the correlation of national outputs increases. In sum,
the best institutional device to guarantee a credible policy commitment to a
monetary union is to have the monetary union itself in place.
    But our model also suggests that the argument for self-validating optimal
currency areas could be used in the opposite direction, as an argument for
self-validating optimal floating regimes. For a given pattern of macroeco-
nomic disturbances, in fact, policy commitment to a floating regime may be
the right choice despite the observed high synchronization of the business
cycle across the countries participating in a monetary union: in equilibrium
there will be an endogenous change in pricing strategies (with higher pass-
through levels in all countries) which support floating rates as the optimal
monetary option. In fact, the two institutional corner solutions for exchange
rate regimes can be Pareto-ranked in welfare terms, leaving the optimal float
the unambiguous winner.
