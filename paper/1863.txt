            Tax Loss Carryforwards   and Corporate Tax Incentives

                                  ABSTRCT

      This paper investigates the extent to which loss-offset constraints affect

 corporate tax incentives. Using data gathered from corporate annual reports, we

 estimate that in 1984 fifteen percent of the firms in the nonfinancial corporate

 sector had tax loss carryforwards. When weighted by their market value, how—

ever, these firms account for less than three percent of this sector, suggesting

 that loss carryforwards are concentrated among small firms and affect relatively

few large corporations. For those firms with loss carryforwards, however, the

incentive effects of the corporate income tax may differ significantly from

those facing taxable firms. We demonstrate this by calculating the effective

tax rates on equipment and structures for both types of firms. Our results

suggest that firms which are currently taxable have a substantially greater

incentive for equipment investment than firms with loss carryforwards, but that

loss carryforwards have a relatively smaller effect on the tax incentive for

investing in structures. Overall, firms with loss carryforwards receive a

smaller investment stimulus than taxable firms.

      The U.S. corporate income tax provides only limited tax relief to firms

 which report tax losses. Firms which have paid positive taxes during the three

 years prior to the loss year may "carry back" their losses and receive a tax

 refund, provided it does not exceed their taxes in those three years. For some

 firms, however, current losses exceed potential carrybacks. This may happen

when a firm experiences losses in several consecutive years, or when it incurs

an especially large loss in a single year. Firms which exhaust their potential

carrybacks must carry losses forward, using them to offset future taxable ear-

nings. For these firms, the marginal tax rate on current earnings as well as

the value of tax deductions depends critically upon when, and if, they regain

their taxable status. Firms which anticipate persistent loss carryforwards will

in effect face very low marginal tax rates.

     Imperfect loss—offset provisions may substantially alter the incentive

effects of the corporate income tax. Two features of the tax, the incentive to

undertake new investment and the incentive to use debt as opposed to equity

finance, are particularly sensitive because loss carryforward firms may be

unable to claim the benefits of depreciation or interest tax shields.

     Standard analyses o-f corporate investment incentives assume that firms

claim depreciation allowances and investment tax credits as they accrue. For

firms with loss carryforwards, however, accrual and realization occur at dif-

ferent dates. This timing difference can change both the relative tax incent-

Ives for investments in plant and equipment, and the overall investment incent-

ive facing the firm. For assets with high tax burdens, typically those with

long depreciation lives such as structures, a loss carryforward firm may have a
                                     —2-


greater incentive to invest than a currently taxable firm.   This occurs because

the 9am from postponing the tax payments on the asset's earnings exceeds the

loss from postponing its tax depreciation benefits. The opposite result may

obtain for assets with highly accelerated depreciation allowances, such as

equipment. For these assets, the cost of delayed realization of the depre—

ciation benefits may exceed the gain from deferring taxes on the project's pro-

fits, and loss carryforward firms may therefore face smaller investment incent-

ives than taxable firms.

     Loss offset provisions may also exert an important influence on corporate

financing choices. Interest deductions are worth less to a loss-carryforward

firm than to a currently taxable firm, so a firm with a tax loss carryforward

has a smaller incentive to use debt finance than a currently taxable firm. In

addition, a firm's probability of experiencing future loss carryforwards may

depend upon its financial policy, since higher interest deductions lower taxable

profits and raise the chance of realizing losses. This has led some to propose

a theory of corporate capital structure based on the proposition that firms

borrow until the expected marginal cost of additional debt due to the increased

probability of becoming non-taxable and losing pre-existing tax shields equals

the expected marginal benefit of additional deductions when taxable. This

theory implies that tax systems with more generous loss-offset provisions pro-

vide a greater incentive for corporate borrowing.

     Several recent studies have suggested that the loss-carryforward provisions

of corporate tax codes are of more than academic interest. Cordes and Sheffrin

(1983) analyzed the distribution of corporate marginal tax rates on additional

interest deductions, and estimated that only fifty-six percent of corporate
                                     —3-


receipts accrued to firms which paid the maximum statutory corporate tax rate on

marginal earnings. This is due to the combined effect of tax loss carryforwards

and binding income-linked constraints on the use of investment and foreign tax

credits.1 In Canada, Mintz (1985) reports that only half of the investment in

manufacturing is undertaken by currently-taxable firms, and the incidence of

loss—carryforward firms is much higher in some other sectors, such as mining.

For Great Britain, Mayer (1986) cites evidence that during the early 1980s, only

forty percent of British companies were paying corporation tax on marginal pro-

fits. The stock of tax loss carryforwards in the U.K. was nearly three times as

large as the annual revenue yield of the corporation tax.

    This paper presents new evidence on the importance of tax loss carryforwards

in the United States. It uses a new data set gathered from corporate annual

reports and 10-K forms to investigate the incidence of loss carryforwards, and

then examines how loss offset constraints affect effective tax rates on dif-

ferent assets. The most important finding is that tax loss carryforwards are

relatively unimportant in the U.S. corporate sector as a whole. Although nearly

fifteen percent of the firms in our sample had tax loss carryforwards in 1984,

when weighted by market value they accounted for only three percent of the

sample. Loss carryforward firms do, however, account for a significant fraction

of some industries. Analyzing the effect of the corporate income tax on tax-

loss firms is therefore essential to understanding investment and financing

incentives in these industries. We estimate the persistence of loss carryfor-

wards and use the results to calculate effective tax rates on new investments in

structures and industrial equipment for both currently—taxable and loss-carry-

forward firms. We find that the presence of a tax loss carryforward has a
                                     -4-


dramatic effect on a firm's incentive to invest in equipment, but it has

relatively little impact on the incentive to invest in structures.

     The paper is divided into five sections. The first outlines the tax rules

governing loss carryforwards and carrybacks. It also explains the difficulties

which arise in using standard data sources to measure tax loss carryforwards,

and describes our new data set. The second section presents our basic findings

on the importance of firms with tax loss carryforwards, and examines the per-

sistence of loss carryforwards for the firms which experience them. Section

three outlines how loss offset constraints alter the effective tax rates on

various assets, and describes our numerical procedures. The fourth section pre-

sents our calculations of the effective tax rates on plant and equipment invest-

ment for both currently-taxable and loss-carryforward firms. A concluding

section discusses the implications of our results for understanding the alloca-

tive effects of the corporate income tax, and suggests a number of directions

for future work.

 1.    The Def,nition and Measurement of Tax Loss Carryforwards


       Loss offset constraints restrict a firm's ability to obtain tax refunds

when it generates negative taxable profits. A firm which realizes a tax loss

may carry the loss back against tax payments in the previous three years, pro-

vided it does not claim current refunds in excess of total tax payments in those

years. Firms which have exhausted their carrybacks may carry unused losses for-

ward for a maximum of fifteen years, after which the losses expire and can no

longer be used to reduce tax liability. Prior to 1981, loss carryforwards

expired in five years. For firms with loss carryforwards, an additional dollar

of taxable income has no effect on current tax liability. The marginal tax bur-

den on an additional dollar of taxable earnings depends upon when the firm

becomes taxable again in the future.

      It is important to distinguish between firms with loss carryforwards and

"firms that pay no taxes."2 A firm with a tax loss carryforward in a given

year pays no tax, but it may receive a refund if it can carry part of the loss

back against previous tax payments. A marginal change in the firm's taxable

earnings, however, will have no effect on its current tax liability. Its

current marginal tax rate is zero, although if it expects to exhaust its loss

carryforwards in the near future, it will face an effective marginal tax rate

which differs from the statutory tax rate only by the price of an interest free

loan for the duration of its remaining tax-loss period.

      Not all firms with negative current tax payments have loss carry-forwards,

however. Some firms which are carrying-back current losses may not have ex-

huasted their carryback potential. For these firms, the marginal tax rate on
                                     —6-


additional income is the statutory tax rate, because an additional dollar of

earned income will reduce the amount of their carryback. These firms face the

statutory marginal rate even though their current tax payments are negative.

     Loss carryforwards are not the only factor that may cause a firm's margi-

nal tax rate to differ from the statutory rate. Cordes and Sheffrin (1983)

explain how constraints on the use of tax credits and the corporate minimum tax

also affect the distribution of marginal corporate tax rates.3 Unfortunately,

publicly available information is not detailed enough to enable us to measure

the marginal tax rates facing individual corporations. This would require

information on each firm's current tax credits, its credit and loss carryfor-

wards, and even its previous tax payments to calculate its carryback potential.

These data can only be obtained from a firm's past and present tax returns,

which are confidential.4   One type of tax data which can be gathered from pub-

lished sources is the identity of firms with tax loss carryforwards. Corporate

annual reports and 10-K filings typically contain some information on carryfor-

wards, so we focus on this source of variation in marginal corporate tax rates.

    Data limitations prevent us from assessing the significance of firms with

tax credit carryforwards. Most of the firms which we identified as having tax

loss carryforwards also reported credit carryforwards.   There may be other

firms, however, with credit carryforwards but no loss carryforwards; Cordes and

Sheffrin (1983) suggest that these credit carryforward firms account for a

substantial fraction of the firms facing marginal corporate tax rates below the

statutory levels. We implicitly assume that firms either encounter loss and

credit carryforwards simultaneously, or that they encounter neither. Future

work using tax return information could extend our analysis of effective tax
                                      —7-


 rates to consider the possibility of separate credit constraints as well.

     The standard source of machine-readable information on corporate accounts is

 the COMPUSTAT data base compiled by the Standard and Poor's Corporation. Al-

 though the data Set contains a company's tax loss carrryforward if the annual

 report includes one, there are several serious problems with these data. First,

 there are two distinct ways of calculating a firm's tax loss carryforward. One

 is for tax purposes, the other is for financial reporting purposes. One

 important difference between the two is that in computing financial reporting

 loss carryforwards, firms exclude depreciation allowances in excess of straight

 line depreciation. Financial loss carryforwards may therefore be smaller than

tax loss carryforwards, because accounting profits are larger than taxable

profits. The two measures also differ in the treatment of discontinued

operations, write-offs, and many other activities. A firm which decides to

write down its investment in an unprofitable subsidiary may book a substantial

loss but receive no tax benefits for the transaction, thereby leading financial

reporting losses to exceed tax purpose losses. The relevant measure for

analyzing corporate incentives is the tax purpose loss; unfortunately, if a

firm reports both tax and financial loss carryforwards, COMPUSTAT records the

financial purpose carryforward. This may lead to spurious classification of

firms. Second, COMPUSTAT aggregates foreign tax loss carryforwards along with

U.S. carryforwards. For multinational firms, the data may therefore provide an

unreliable description of current tax status.

     Firms with loss carryforwards typically report both financial and tax

purpose data in their annual reports or 10-K statements. These published data,

although not available in machine-readable form, provide the basis for our
                                     -8-


study. We began with the list of COMPUSTAT firms reporting loss carryforwards

for any of the fiscal years 1981-1984. We then consulted the annual reports for

each of these firms; when available, we recorded the tax purpose carryforward.

We also investigated all of the firms on COMPUSTAT with either negative federal

tax payments or zero investment tax credits. In some cases, we found that firms

with COMPUSTAT carryforwards did not have U.S. tax basis carryforwards; these

were reclassified as loss-free firms. In other cases, the firms reported only

one measure of their loss carryforward and did not indicate whether it was a tax

or financial number. These firms (of which there were very few) were deleted

from our sample. We also deleted all foreign-based firms before investigating

the pattern of loss carryforwards.5 Our data set includes 1425 firms, of whom

228 experienced tax loss carryforwards at some point between 1981 and 1984. The

total market value of the firms in our sample is roughly three quarters of the

total market value of the nonfinancial corporate sector.

     There are several potential biases in our data sample which should be

recognized at the outset. First, COMPUSTAT does not include all of the cor-

porations which file tax returns; there were over three million such firms in

1982! The firms on COMPUSTAT are large, publicly traded firms. If losses tend

to be more prevalent among smaller or start—up firms, then we may understate the

number of firms with tax loss carryforwards. Second, the data set follows

COMPIJSTAT in including only firms which were active in 1984. Some corporations

which encountered tax loss carryforwards in earlier years may either have been

taken over or gone bankrupt, and the end-of-sample sampling rule imparts a clear

selection bias. This may cause us to understate the number of loss carryforward

firms in 1981 through 1983, although this bias is likely to be small given the
                                      -9-


relatively low rate of both bankruptcy and takeover for firms on the COMPUSTAT

tape. A third source of bias arises because not all firms with losses may

report them. Firms are required to report loss carryforwards only if they are

"aateriaP'; since some firms with small carryforwards may not appear as carry-

forward firms on COMPUSTAT, we may understate their importance. Of course,

for these firms the tax consequences of the loss carryforward are   likely   to be

especially small.

     A final problem with loss carryforward data gathered from annual reports

and 10-K filings is the divergence between the divisions of the firm which are

included on its consolidated tax return and those which are included on the

financial statements. For example, as Dworin (1985) explains, some firms do not

include their finance subsidiaries in their financial statements although for

tax purposes these subsidiaries are consolidated with the parent corporation.6

We may therefore classify a parent firm as having a tax loss carryforward even

though the total taxpaying entity has no carryforward. This problem is

impossible to overcome when using data published in annual reports.7

2.   The Importance and Persistence of Loss Carryforwards


     This section uses our annual report data set for the post-1981 period, as

well as accounting-purpose loss carryforward data available on COMPUSTAT for a

longer sample period, to explore the economic significance of tax loss carry-

forwards. We ask how many firms have carryforwards, and then examine the per-

sistence of these losses.


21 The Importance of Loss-Carryforward Firms

     Table 1 presents summary evidence on the importance of firms with tax loss

carryforwards in the years since 1981. It considers the total population of

nonfinancial firms, as well as some particular industries. The table shows that

although about fifteen percent of all firms are in the loss carryforward regime,

they are disproportionately small firms; when weighted by the value of their

outstanding common stock, only 2.4 percent of the firms (in 1984) show loss

carryforwards. Although equity-value weights are attractive because they are

market-determined and not subject to accounting biases, weighting firms this way

may bias our calculations against finding that loss carryforwards are statisti-

cally important. Declining profitability may drive a firm into a loss-carry-

forward position while also reducing its market value. To address this issue we

weighted firms by their 1984 net book assets, an alternative size measure. We

found that 5.9 percent of all assets were held by loss-carryforward firms;

while larger than our equity—based calculations, this still suggests the limited

Importance of loss carryforwards.

     Table 1 also shows that there is substantial concentration of carryforward

firms in some industries. In the oil industry (SIC codes 1311 and 2911) for cx-
                                     -12-

ample, nearly a quarter of the firms accounting for two percent of the common

stock had loss carryforwards in 1984. In 1982 and 1983, forty percent of the

firms accounting for about ten percent of the value of outstanding common stock

in SIC classification 3711, motor vehicles and car bodies, reported tax loss

carryforwards. In the steel industry, the findings suggest a third of the firms

have losses, and in this case, they are not small firms. The firms with loss

carryforwards account for half of industry's outstanding equity value. Finally,

for airlines we also find a high incidence of loss carryforwards: forty percent

of the firms, accounting for roughly one tenth of the industry's equity value.

     Table 2 shows the total value of the loss carryforwards for the firms in

our sample. These carryforwards aggregated to 5.1 billion dollars in 1981, 10.0

billion in 1982, 15.1 dollars in 1983, and 12.8 billion dollars in 1984, These

carryforwards can be compared to corporate tax receipts of roughly sixty billion

dollars in 1984. The U.S. stock of carryforwards is therefore small relative to

that in either the U.K. or Canada. The center panel in Table 2 relates the

value of the tax loss carryforwards to the market value of the affected firms.

In 1984, the nominal value of the carryforwards equalled forty—eight percent of

the firms with these carryforwards. In some industries, notably steel, autos,

and airlines, tax loss carryforwards actually exceed the equity value of the

loss-carryforward firms. The bottom panel of Table 2 relates the value of loss

carryforwards to the market value of all firms in particular industries. In

steel, carryforwards are eighty percent as large as the outstanding market value

of the industry. The comparable statistic is twenty—eight percent in airlines,

but below five percent in the other industries we consider.

     To provide additional perspective on the problem of loss-carryforward firms,

Table 3 displays the twenty largest loss-carryforward firms in our sample,
measured by equity value, with their tax loss carryforwards for 1983. The

table depicts the same industry concentrations described above: the twenty

firms include three railroads, four auto or heavy machinery manufacturers, four

steel companies, and two copper companies. Although most firms on the list

experienced tax losses because of poor profit performance, some firms (Storer

Communications and Turner Broadcasting, for example) appear because substantial

investment programs generated depreciation allowances significantly greater than

taxable earnings from current operations.


2.2 The Persistence of Tax Loss Carryforwards

     The extent to which the restricted loss—offset provisions in the corpor-

ation tax affect investment and financing incentives depends upon the duration

of non-taxable spells. If firms with loss carryforwards can expect to recover

their taxable status within a year or two, then the absence of loss offset pro-

visions will have relatively little effect on incentives. If firms with carry-

forwards tend to be constrained for many years, however, then they may face

incentive effects which are substantially different from those of taxable firms.

     We adopt two different approaches to analyzing the persistence of tax loss

carryforwards. First, we use our data for the last four years to fit simple

$arkov models for transitions into and out of the loss carryforward state. This

provides the basis for our analysis of effective tax rates in later sections,

but it is limited by the fact that our data span a period of only four years.

Moreover, since these years include a very deep recession, transition probabili-

ties from the recent period may be unrepresentative of those confronting firms

over a longer horizon. To obtain information on long-term persistence of loss

carryforwards, we therefore perform the same calculations using a second data

source, the partially contaminated accounting loss carryforward data from

COMPUSTAT, for the period 1968-1984. These data are also used to construct

empirical distributions of the number of firms with losses which persisted for

one year, two years, three years, etc. Although the differences between tax and

book loss carryforwards make these tabulations an imperfect source of

information on persistence, they do permit us to compare the recent experience

with that in prior years.

     Table 4 reports summary statistics, based on our post-1981 data sample, for

transitions into and out of loss-carryforward status. The top panel shows pro-

babilities based on the first-order Markov assumption, i.e. treating a firm's

current status as containing all relevant information about it's transition

prospects. These estimates show that for the 1983-1984 period, the probability

that a firm which did not experience a loss carryforward in period t would

experience one in period t + 1 is .026. For a firm with a loss carryforward in

period t, the probability of remaining in the loss-carryforward state at t +    1


is .913.

     In calculating simple Markov probabilities, we are implicitly assuming

that all firms have identical transition probabilities and that these probabil-

ities did not vary between 1983 and 1984. Neither assumption is realistic, and

these results should therefore be regarded as a simple way of summarizing the

data rather than as parameters of a structural model of transition behavior.

     There are two significant reasons why the transition probabilities are

likely to vary across firms: different firms have loss carryforwards of dif-

ferent   sizes, and there are probably differences in the stochastic processes

driving their taxable income streams. Auerbach (1983) estimated a model for tax

status in which the firms' tax loss carryforward was modelled as a continuous

variable. This requires imputing potential carrybacks to firms with no loss

carryforwards, and it also necessitates complicated numerical integration in

evaluating effective tax rates. The Markov model used here yields great

simplification in computing tax incentives. Both procedures may be sensitive to

missing information about the vintages of carryforwards, since two firms with

loss carryforwards of identical size, one whose losses were generated fifteen

years ago and the other whose losses were generated last year, have radically

     The second source of heterogeneity, potential differences in profit

processes, is more difficult to treat because it invalidates our assumption of a

simple Markov process. A firm's characteristics, and potentially lagged values

of its loss carryforward status, may affect its transition probability.8 We

introduce some additional flexibility in our transition matrix by estimating a

second-order Markov process.

     The results of estimating the second-order process are shown in the second

panel of Table 4. We tested the assumption of a first-order Markov process

against the alternative of a second-order process (see Anderson and Goodman

(1957)) and rejected the first-order assumption at the .10 level but not the .05

level. The x2(2) statistic was 5.02, with a .05 critical value of 5.99. We use

the second-order process in later sections to calculate effective tax rates.

     Two important conclusions emerge from Table 4. First, it is very unlikely

for a firm without a tax loss carryforward to incur one. Second, it is also

unlikely for a firm with a tax loss carryforward to "escape" and become taxable

  again. These findings are important, because they suggest that the burden of

 the tax code's asymmetry is not borne uniformly, but rather falls heavily on the

 relatively few firms with tax loss carryforwards. This also implies that stand-

 ard calculations of effective tax rates which neglect the role of loss

 carryforwards may conceal important interfirm variations in tax incentives.

      The most significant drawback of our post-1981 data is that we cannot exa-

 mine the long-term persistence of tax loss carryforwards. We can address this

 issue using the data on accounting tax loss carryforwards drawn from the

 COMPUSTAT tape, however. To evaluate the potential biases associated with these

 data, we compared their second-order Markov transition probabilities for the

 1983-1984 period with those obtained from our annual reports data. The probabi-

 lity that a firm with two previous years of loss carryforward would remain in

the loss carryforward state was .928 in the COMPUSTAT data, compared with .917

 in the annual reports data. The probability of remaining carryforward-free

after two years of being currently taxable was .966 rather than .977. The

COMPUSTAT data therefore probably overstate the persistence of tax losses

because the chances of experiencing a tax loss in a given year, for both firms

which have and have not experienced them in the past, are higher in these data.

This is consistent with our finding that financial purpose loss carryforwards,

because they include asset write-offs and other losses, may appear more

significant than the comparable tax—purpose losses.   Nonetheless, the close
agreement between the COMPUSTAT and annual report-based data suggest that

valuable information can be obtained by studying COMPUSTAT transition

probabilities over time..-

 sample.   It reports our estimates of the four basic transition rates for each

 year between 1968 and 1984, as well as the probabilities for the full sample

 period and two subsamples. Two Conclusions emerge. First, the probability that

 a firm with loss carryforwards in the two previous years will experience another

 year of tax loss increased substantially in 1981. We denote this probability as

LLL' where the subscripts refer to the tax status -in   periods   t—2, t-1, and t,

 respectively. The Subscript takes the value L for loss carryforward, and T for

currently taxable. The probability LLL' which never exceeded .90 in the years
prior to 1980 and which was frequently below .80, averages .928 since 1981. The

probability of remaining in the loss position rises between 1981 and 1983, then

declines in 1984, reflecting in part changing business cycle conditions. There

is also a discontinuity in 1981 in the probability that a firm which has

experienced a taxable year followed by a loss year will remain in the loss

state, TLL in our notation. From a pre-1981 average of .787, the parameter

changes to a post-1981 value of .909.

     The table also shows a substantial post-1981 increase in the
                                                                     probability
that a taxable firm will experience a loss carryforward. From .024 before 1981,

TLL increased by nearly forty percent to .034. There is a smaller increase in

the chance that a firm which has experienced a loss carryforward year followed

by a taxable year will re-enter loss status. These movements in the Markov

transition probabilities correspond to changes in the steady state distribution

of firms with respect to tax status. The pre-1981 probabilities imply that in

the steady state, 10.9 percent of all firms have tax loss carryforwards. The

comparable steady-state value for the post-1981 probabilities is 33.5 percent, a

striking increase.9 This undoubtedly overstates the long-run effect of the 1981
                                          -22-

tax reform,   since it   is   difficult to disentangle the effects of the 1981 tax

reform from the post-1981 recession.

     Our estimates of second-order Markov transition rates are incomplete

because they shed no light on the behavior of firms which have experienced

losses for many periods. One way to study this long-term persistence is by cal-

culating the probability that a firm with a loss in a particular year will

experience losses for one more year, two more years, etc. Table 6 presents

calculations of these long-term transition rates from the COMPUSTAT data sample

for the period 1974_1983.b0 The table shows that a significant fraction of firms

which experience tax losses in a given year will continue to have such losses

for at least four more years. The probability of this much persistence has

also risen over time, from .32 in 1974 to .50 in 1980, the last year for which

it is possible to calculate the four—year—later transition rate.

     The estimates presented in this section are at best a rough characterizat-

ion of the transition probabilities confronting firms. In the next two sec—

tions, we calculate effective tax rates for hypothetical firms whose movements

into and out of the tax loss state are given by our estimates. This analysis,

which is primarily illustrative, demonstrates the potentially important effect

of loss offset provisions on effective tax rates.

3.   The Incentive to Invest in the Presence of Tax Losses


     Unlike more direct forms of investment subsidy, tax loss carryforwards are

likely to affect different firms and asset types differently. A firm with

substantial unused tax benefits may appropriately view itself as temporarily

"tax exempt," while a firm with a small carryforward which it expects to utilize

during the next year regardless of its current decisions should take no account

of it in making investment decisions. The differences across asset type stem

from differences in the timing of taxable income. Many assets, such as equip-

ment under current law, may be expected to generate negative taxable income in

their initial years. If a firm has unused tax benefits when the project begins,

this will decrease the asset's after-tax income. Since the accruing losses must

be carried forward until the firm achieves a positive tax liability, some

investments may actually be discouraged by the presence of unused tax benefits.11

This section describes our methodology for quantifying these incentive effects.

     There are a number of approaches to measuring the impact of tax law asym-

metries on investment incentives. Ideally, one would specify a dynamic model of

firm value maximization in which risky investment would be affected by, and in

turn would affect, the magnitude of unused tax benefits present at different

dates in different states of nature. This problem is complicated by the joint

endogeneity of investment and the firm's tax status.12 To make the problem more

tractable, if less general, one may restrict the endogeneity of either the

firm's investment behavior or its tax status. The former approach is taken by

Majd and Myers (1985,1986). They value the tax payments associated with risky

projects, taking account of the project's impact on the firm's future tax sta-
                                        —25-

 tus.    Their approach highlights the interaction between the project's risk and

 the risk of other random changes in the firm's tax status, but it ignores poten-

 tial changes in corporate behavior which may result from variation in tax status.

        An alternative approach, the one taken here, assumes that the probability

distribution of future tax status is determined by the firm's history alone.

This can be interpreted as treating the marginal investment project as small

relative to the rest of the firm, so that the firm's tax status is determined by

the stochastic returns on its prior investments. The assumption that the proba—

bility distribution of tax status is invariant with respect to marginal decis-

ions is justified if this distribution is the direct result of firm optimization

decisions. This interpretation highlights one of this approach's shortcomings,

however, in that it is necessarily restricted to partial equilibrium analysis of

changes in tax rules or other components of the economic environment. We cannot

predict how a change in tax regime would affect the incentive to invest, since

it could both change the firm's statutory tax benefits holding its investment

decisions fixed and alter the probability distribution of its future tax status.


3.1. Effective Tax Rates with Loss Offset Limits

        The summary statistic used throughout our analysis is the effective tax

rate on a marginal investment project, calculated as the percentage difference

between the internal rates of return on expected cash flows before and after

tax. We assume that these marginal investments are inherently risk-free, and

that the only source of uncertainty is the time profile of future tax payments.

We designate the project's before-tax rate of return as p, which is set equal to

.06 in all calculations. The asset depreciates at a constant rate, 5, so an
                                          -26-.

investment made at the beginnng of period 0 yields a gross return in period t
of (p +   o)(l_a)t1    per dollar of initial investment.

      We assume that the investment tax credit and the first half-year depreciat-

ion allowance accrue at date 0. Thus, the firm's project-specific accrued tax

liability (Bt) at date t 15:


                                 —                         t > 0
                                     Dt(l_i)t)
(1) Bt

               t.-k-TD0                                    t=0

where T   is   the corporate tax rate, k the investment tax credit, Dt is the nomi-

nal date t depreciation allowance, and i is the inflation rate. These express-

ions describe an equity-financed project; with debt finance, interest deduct-

ions would also enter the formula for Bt.

      Under a symmetric tax system with full loss offset, equation (1) would

describe actual tax payments. The project's after-tax internal rate of return,

r, would be defined implicitly by the expression:




(2) -B0 +                t(4616)tl - B]           ti(l+tt+(lo)tl) - T(r)         =    1

               ti(l+
where T(r) denotes the present value of tax payments computed using discount

rate r.    After simplification, equation (2) yields the more familiar user cost

of capital expression:


(3)            p + 6 =   (r+ö)(1—k—Tz)/(1-T).
                                        -27-

We use z to denote the present value of depreciation allowances discounted at r.

The value of r which solves (2) is used to define the effective tax rate:


 (4)          ETR = (p -   r)/p

which is just the difference between pre-tax and post—tax rate of return,

measured as a fraction of the pretax return.

       When the tax system imposes limitations on the deduction of losses, actual

tax payments may differ from Bt. This requires us to amend equation (2) before

r and the effective tax rate can be calculated. Each accrued tax liability

gives rise to a distribution of expected tax payments, since the firm may not be

taxable when the tax liability or benefit accrues. In some states of nature,

the firm will be taxable in period t and the accruing tax, B. can then be

realized immediately. If the firm has a tax loss carryforward and Bt is posi-

tive, its loss carryforward will be reduced and the firm will experience an

increase in its tax payments in the year when it exhausts its carryforward and

becomes taxable. If Bt is negative, loss carryforwards will increase and there

will be a reduction in the firm's tax payments in the (future) year when the

firm begins paying taxes again.

       To describe the distribution of tax payments corresponding to a tax accrual

in period t, we need some notation. We define 1rLST to be the probability that a

firm with a loss carryforward in year t returns to being taxable in year t +   s.
The subscripts denote the firm's tax status in the years beginning in year t, and

a T subscript indicates a taxable year while an L indicates a year with a loss

carryforward.13 Thus,        is the probability that a firm with a loss carryforward

in year t will become taxable in the next year. Both LLT and iiL2T represent

the probability that a firm with loss a carryforward in period t will remain non-
                                      -28-


taxable for one more period, and then return to current taxable status two

periods in the future. These probabilities, which we will ultimately derive

from our Markov transition parameters, enable us to compute the expected tax

payments corresponding to a tax accrual in period t.

     Our analysis so far has omitted two important features of the tax system.

First, since there are limits on the number of years (N) an accrued tax payment

can be carried forward, the distribution of tax payments from an accrual at t

will be truncated after t + N.   Second, we have ignored the role of loss carry-

backs. Once carrybacks are permitted, each expected tax payment increases the

firm's potential ability to subsequently carry back future tax losses. We will

use v.1 to denote the shadow value of additional tax payments in year t + s,

viewed from the perspective of year t. With these complications, the present

expected value of tax payments, 1, becomes



(5) T(r) =
             to 5t(h)t [(1-1)S       LST('tSfl

The term in brackets is the expected present value of a one dollar tax accrual

in period t. Equation (5) defines 1(r), which can in turn be substituted into

(2) to compute effective tax rates based on expected tax payments.14



3.2. ComputinQ the Time Distribution of Tax Payments

     To implement these effective tax rate calculations, we need the probability

distribution of tax payment dates for each accrued tax liability. We compute

these distributions from the second order transition probabilities in Tables 5

and 6. These calculations are facilitated if we introduce new variables corres-
                                       -29-


 ponding to the probability that a firm is in each of the four possible states,

 TI, TL, LI, and LL, in a given period. We use q. to represent these probabi-

 lities. For a firm which is known to have a tax loss in the period before, and

 period of, a new project investment, q =         I   and    =
                                                                 q q=     =   0.   In gen-

eral, the probability that a firm will be taxable in period one is


 (6)       ir =        +        =             +              +
                  LT                                                      +




The second part of the equation shows how the year one probabilities can be

built up recursively from the starting conditions, the q°, and the transition

probabilities which were discussed in the last section. Similar calculations

permit us to derive the probabilities of finding the firm in other tax states in

period one.

       The probability that the firm will carry its taxes from the investment year

forward exactly one period is ir1 =               +              Parallel calculations

show that the unconditional probability of carrying taxes forward for two years

or more is LL =             +          and the probability of carrying a loss for-

ward for exactly two years is LLT =                    Probabilities corresponding to
                                       LLTLL
longer carryforwards can also be calculated recursively.

       While these calculations have considered the distribution of tax accruals

from period zero, it is straightforward to apply this approach to compute the

distribution of tax payments corresponding to accruals later in the project1s

life. The initial conditions are just the {qt•} corresponding to the firm's

probabilities of being in each tax state at the beginning of period t.             These

can be calculated recursively from the {q9.} and the transition probabilities as

in equation (6). As we iterate forward, however, the firm's tax status in year

zero becomes less important as a predictor of its period t status and the it          vec-
                                       -30-


tor converges to a steady state value. In practice, we truncate our calculated

r vector after twenty elements and let the twenty-first element capture all of

the remaining probability.15

    We incorporate loss carryforwards by assuming that all deferred tax

payments may be carried forward N years, where N is the statutory maximum f or

carrying losses forward.16     Incorporating carrybacks is more complicated, since

the opportunity to carry losses back has the effect of making every tax payment

potentially valuable in facilitating the accelerated deduction of future tax

losses. This imparts a shadow value to tax payments; we calculate this shadow

value in two stages. First, we compute a distribution of expected tax payments

under the assumption that there are no carrybacks. Then, we account for carry-

backs by reducing each dollar of estimated tax payments by a shadow value which

depends upon the firm's current tax status and the estimated transition probabi-

lities. The calculation of the carryback shadow value is described in greater

detail in the Appendix.


3.3. Qualifications

     All of the analysis in this section presumes that the effective tax rates

which apply to a firm's investment choices are a function of its own tax status.

This need not be the case. Leasing arrangements are one example of a channel

through which the effective tax rates of the firms using and owning an asset can

be separated. These institutions have been particularly popular in some of the

Industries with a significant incidence of tax losses, such as airlines. It is

important to realize however that although leasing can reduce the present value

of tax payments for a èonstrained firm, its impact on the firm's incentive to
                                        —31-


invest in new capital is less clear. A firm which has a loss carryforward would

be better off if it could utilize this tax benefit right away, since it the

associated tax benefit loses value over time and may expire. Given that the

firm cannot use this tax benefit, however, it may be encouraged to invest more,

since additional taxable income generated by new investment will enable it to

offset part of the loss carryforward.

    A second limitation inherent to our analysis is its exclusive focus on tax

policies. For some of the large firms who have tax loss carryforwards, taxation

is just one of the many ways in which the goverment and the firm interact.

Examples of other policies which clearly affect the performance of the firms and

the welfare of their shareholders include direct loan guarantees, regulation

(especially for airlines and railroads), tariff policy, and in some cases

(such as General Dynamics) goverment purchasing policy. Analyzing changes in

tax rules without considering the offsetting changes which might occur in the

other policy instruments is therefore necessarily incomplete.

4.   Empirical Results


     This section presents numerical calculations illustrating how tax losses

affect investment incentives. We consider general industrial equipment and

industrial buildings, and estimate the effective tax rates associated with each

under the tax regimes of 1965, 1975, and 1985. We then explore the sensitivity

of these tax rates under current law to changes in both the tax code and the

economic environment.


4.1. Changes in Effective Tax Rates Over Time

     In 1965, the corporate tax rate was .48 and the investment tax credit,

which was available only on equipment, was 0.07 with no basis adjustment. The

equipment class could be written off over twelve years using the double-

declining balance method with an optimal switch to straight-line, while struc-

tures received the same treatment over twenty-nine years. Tax losses could be

carried forward for five years and back for three.

     By 1975, the ITC on equipment had been raised to 0.10 and, due to the

introduction of the Asset Depreciation Range System, equipment could be written

off in ten years. In addition, structures had been restricted to using the 150

percent declining balance method. The corporate tax rate was still .48, and the

carryforward and carryback provisions were the same as those in 1965.

     Through tax changes in 1978, 1981, 1982, 1984, and 1985, equipment now

receives a 10 percent ITC with 50 percent basis adjustment and depreciation over

five years following the pattern established by the Accelerated Cost Recovery

System (ACRS). Structures may be written off over 19 years using the 175 per-

cent declining balance method with switchover to straight line. In 1981, the
                                            -33-

 carryforward   period for losses was increased to fifteen years. The
                                                                             statutory
 corporate tax rate in 1985 was .46.17

      We estimate the pattern of before-tax cash flows for each asset assuming

 that the before-tax rate of return, net of depreciation, is six percent and that

 the asset depreciates at the rate estimated by Hulten and Wykoff (1981): 3.61

percent per year for buildings, 12.25 percent per year for equipment. We set

the inflation rate at four percent throughout our calculations, and use a real

discount rate of .03 to compute the shadow values of potential carrybacks.18

     A firm's tax burden is critically dependent on the vector of probabilities

describing the number of years which will elapse before its first passage into

currently-taxable status. Using the transition probabilities estimated for the

COMPUSTAT sample in the 1968-1984 period, we calculate this vector for two

hypothetical firms. The first has just experienced its second consecutive year

of tax losses (q =     1),   while the second is "the representative firm" in the

sense that it has probabilities of being in states LL, LI, TL, and TT

corresponding to the Markov process' steady state.

     Table 7 shows the it    vectors   for each of these firms. The it   vector   reports

the probability that each firm will experience tax loss spells of different

lengths. The low probability of switching states leads very little of the

representative firm's weight to be in states IL or LT. In the steady state,

83.2 percent of firms are taxable in both the current and the previous year,

while 12.1 percent of firms have had tax loss carryforwards in both years.

Alternatively, roughly 85 percent of all accrued tax payments will accrue to

firms which can deduct them immediately.19 Firms which are non-taxable remain

non-taxable for long periods, however. A firm with tax losses in the previous

two years is more likely than not to wait at least four years until paying a

currently accruing tax liability.

     Table 8 presents our effective tax rate calculations for the years 1965,

1975, and 1985 based on the assumption that each asset is entirely equity-

financed. The table shows the general trend toward reduced effective tax rates

on equipment over this time period, with the ETR for a taxable firm falling from

27.5 percent in 1965 to —5.0 percent in 1985.   The dramatic reductions in the

ETRs for taxable firms are however not reflected in the ETRs for tax loss carry-

forward firms, where the reduction is from 30.8 percent in 1965 to 15.0 percent

in 1985. For structures, the differences between taxable firms and loss-carry-

forward firms are much smaller. This is of course due to the much longer life-

time of these assets, and the consequent tendency for initial differences in tax

status to be damped out over the project horizon.20

     The effect of asymmetric treatment of gains and losses on effective tax

rates is ambiguous, as noted in Auerbach (1983). Having a loss postpones all

tax liabilities, but especially the earliest ones which may be negative. The

latter effect is most important for equipment, where the currently taxable firm

faces a much lower effective tax rate than the loss-carryforward firm. The

impact on structures, for which immediate tax benefits are smaller, is in the

opposite direction.

     The results also confirm the common view that tax losses prevent firms from

receiving the full incentive to invest intended by increases in accelerated

depreciation and the investment tax credit over recent years. While holding

inflation at four percent the hypothetical firm under symmetric taxation had its

effective tax rate on equipment reduced by 33.4 percentage points in the last

 two decades. The taxable firm enjoyed a similar decline of 32.5
                                                                 percentage
 points, but the reduction was just 15.8 percentage points for the nontaxable

 firm. It therefore received less than half of the full statutory benefit.

      Our earlier results suggesting the high concentration of tax loss firms in

 a few industries also indicate that previous estimates of effective tax rates by

 industry21 may be misleading. For steel, airlines, and automobiles, for example,

 it is essential to recognize that a substantial fraction of firms have tax loss

 carryforwards and therefore face effective tax rates different from those facing

 taxable firms. In these industries, there are also likely to be important

 interfirm differences in effective tax rates due to variation in corporate

histories and tax status.

     Our algorithm also computes the shadow value of carrybacks and the value of

a dollar of accruing tax losses for a firm which has just entered the untaxed

state. For 1965 and 1975, when the carryforward period was five years, the sha-

dow value of a carryback to a firm which had been taxable for two years was

.040; for a firm which had been nontaxable in   the   previous year and was taxable

in the current year, this value was .072. The expected present value of a

dollar of currently accruing losses to a firm which had just incurred a tax loss

carryforward for the first time was .479 dollars. In 1985, with the longer

period for carrying losses forward, these three parameters were respectively

.026, .044, and .661.

     The magnitude of the carryback shadow values suggest the limited usefulness

of current carryback provisions. This is because most losses accrue to firms

which experience several years of losses, and because most future losses will be

recovered through the carryforward provision. Allowing firms the option of
                                        -38-


carrying losses back typically accelerates the recognition of tax benefits, but

does not enable the firm to claim tax benefits which would otherwise have

expired unused. By contrast, the length of carryforward provision does appear

to have a substantial effect on the expected value of a dollar of accruing tax

losses. The longer carryforward period in 1985 both raises the value of a

marginal dollar of carryforwards, and lowers the value of the carrybacks since

accelerating the recovery of a tax loss is less critical with the expiration

constraint relaxed.


4.2. Sensitivity of Effective Tax Rates

       Our results in Table 8 may actually underestimate the dispersion of effec-

tive tax rates facing corporations. Table 9 presents calculations for a number

of alternative assumptions about economic conditions, corporate behavior, and

tax policy. The second row of each panel shows the effect of an inflation

shock which raises the inflation rate from .04 to .10. This causes a large jump

in   all   of the calculated effective tax rates, the largest for taxable firms

investing in equipment. The effective tax rate rises by more in each case for

currently taxable than for non-taxable firms. This is because loss-carryforward

firms are already receiving their depreciation allowances at later dates than

currently taxable firms. This reduces the contribution of the depreciation

allowances to the project's present value, and hence lowers the sensitivity of

the effective tax rate to inflation shocks which further erode the value of

these allowances.

       The third row of each panel shows the effective corporate tax rate, net of

interest deductions, when investments support real interest payments equal to a

historically   typical ten percent of before-tax investment returns. With the

addition of interest deductions the value of being taxable increases, par-

ticularly as inflation rises. The use of partial debt-finance lowers the

expected corporate tax bill, although its effect on total corporate and indivi-

dual tax payments is probably smaller given the individual tax advantage to

holding equity. It is of greatest benefit for taxable firms. The effective tax

rate reductions for equipment and structures are 15.0 and 12.5 percentage points

for the firm with no losses in the last two years, compared to 10.0 and 10.9

points for the firm with two consecutive loss years and 16.6 and 14.1 points for

the firm facing perfect loss-offsets. Overall, the addition of this moderate

level of interest expense amplifies the advantage of being taxable. The effect-

ive tax rates on structures are very close while taxable firms enjoy a substan-

tial advantage in equipment. Taking interest deductions into account, being

nontaxable probably discourages marginal investment and induces a shift away

from equipment investment.

     The last two sets of calculations in Table 9 consider the impact of

altering the tax provisions regarding the loss carryforwards themselves. The

first set estimates the effect of permitting unlimited car.ryforwards, while the

second examines the impact of eliminating the ability to carry losses back. Our

earlier calculations suggested that increasing the time limit on the use of tax

losses from five to fifteen years in 1981 substantially increased the expected

present value of a dollar of loss carryforwards. Extending the limit beyond

fifteen years appears to be less important. For taxable firms, the effective

tax rates on both equipment and structures are only changed in the second deci-

mal place, and for equipment, there is a small (0.8 percent) change in the
                                        -41-


 effective tax rate for non-taxable firms, as a result of allowing unlimited

 carryforwards. Similarly, disallowing carrybacks has a relatively small impact.

 The largest change in an effective tax rate is for structures, where the ETR on

 a nontaxable firm rises 1.6 percent and that for a taxable firm increases 1.2

 percent. Both types of firms experience smaller effects on the equipment effec-

 tive tax rate. Structures are more affected because the chance of a firm having

 an opportunity to use a loss carryback provision is
                                                       substantially greater due to
 the asset's longer life.

      The pattern of ETR changes associated with carryback and carryforward

 reforms underscores the interaction between these provisions. Eliminating

carrybacks raises the effective tax rate on all assets except equipment invest-

ment by taxable firms, where the ETR declines.   Equipment investments initially
had a negative effective tax rate, and the ETR becomes more negative. All of

the other asset/firm status combinations had positive ETRs, and they become more

positive. This is because eliminating carrybacks raises the shadow cost of tax

payments and lowers the the shadow value of tax benefits. When carrybacks are

permitted, the firm's shadow cost of a tax payment is less than the actual

payment because it may be used to carryback future losses. Eliminating
                                                                          carry-
backs removes this option, and thereby raises the present value of the tax

payments for all assets with initial positive tax rates. Since tax payments are

now more costly, those assets with mostly positive tax payments are reduced in

value. By comparison, the value of those assets with net tax benefits (i.e.,

equipment purchased by a currently taxable firm) increases, because the shadow

value of receiving a tax deduction has also increased. This reduces still

further the negative effective tax rates.
                                     -42-


    Allowing for unlimited carryforwards has no noticeable effect on any effec-

tive tax rate except that for nontaxable firms investing in equipment, where the

effective tax rate rises. This occurs even though the firm carrying losses for-

ward will be better off with an extension of the time limit, because positive

marginal tax payments that otherwise might have been entirely avoided may now

have to be made.

     The results in this section have all been derived using the average tran-

sition probabilities estimated over the 1968-1984 period. These suffer from

several drawbacks, as suggested in the second section. Table 10 reports the

baseline current-law effective tax rate and sensitivity calculations using the

second s well as the sen-order transition probabilities estimated for the

1981-1984 period. The results are strikingly similar to those in Table 9, with

the one significant exception being the effective tax rate on structures for

firms with tax loss carryforwards. Using the full sample probabilities, this

effective tax rate was 39.2 percent. In Table 10, it is only 24.2 percent. The

difference arises because using the post-1981 transition probabilities, a firm

with two years of loss carryforward has a greater chance (.913) of remaining in

the untaxed state than under the full sample probabilities (.830). This

increases the persistence of tax loss carryforwards and raises the probability

that a loss firm will defer the tax payments on the structure's earnings, as

well as the (less important) depreciation allowances. This deferral reduces the

effective tax rate.

     There are other minor differences between the results in Tables 9 and 10.

Using the post-1981 probabilities, the equipment ETR for a firm with tax loss

carryforwards is 8.3 percent, compared with 15.0 percent if the full—sample

probabilities   describe the transition matrix. The loss carryforward firms are

also much less sensitive to the inflation rate under the post-1981 probabili-

ties, primarily because the chance that these firms will ever return to taxable

status is lower and so the present value of the tax allowances, the part of the

calculation which can be sensitive to the inflation rate, is much reduced.

 5.   Conclusions


      This paper has explored the recent incidence of tax loss carryforwards

amongst nonfinancial corporations. Although fifteen percent of all firms report

loss carryforwards, when weighted by market value, these firms account for only

about three percent of the corporate sector. There are, however, some

industries in which losses are being carried forward by a significant minority

of firms; in these industries, current loss offset restrictions may have a

significant effect on corporate tax incentives.

      A firm's current tax status is a key determinant of its investment incen-

tives. For firms with tax loss carryforwards, effective tax rates on plant and

equipment may be significantly different from those for taxable firms which are

able to utilize tax deductions as they accrue. For equipment investments under

present law, taxable firms face lower effective tax rates than do firms with

loss carryforwards. The opposite is true for structures. These findings,

coupled with the concentration of losses in some industries, suggest that pre-

vious attempts to estimate interindustry differences in effective tax rates

neglect an important source of tax rate variation. The differences between

firms in the same industry, depending on their current tax status, may be even

more substantial.

      Our calculations may understate the economic importance of tax loss carry-

forwards for several reasons. First, we have modelled the incentive effects

assuming that all firms face the economy-wide probabilities of transiting bet-

ween taxable and non-taxable states. If some firms have precise knowledge about

the pattern of tax liabilities they are likely to face, this may induce much
                                     -46-


larger swings in their investment and financial behavior as they take advantage

of intertemporal changes in tax rules. Second, our calculations of the inci-

dence of loss carryforwards may not reflect the steady state to which the eco-

nomy will move if the post-1981 depreciation schedule remains in effect. Since

the presence of highly accelerated depreciation allowances increases the chance

that firms will generate tax losses, there may be long-term shifts in the frac-

tions of taxable and non-taxable firms which cannot yet be detected.

     Finally, data limitations preclude us from considering firms with tax cred-

it carryforwards. Although many of the loss carryforward firms in our sample

also report either investment or foreign tax credit carryforwards, there may

also be substantial numbers of firms with credit carryforwards but no loss

carryforwards. For these firms, the marginal tax rate on additional income may

be substantially different from the statutory marginal tax rates. By omitting

these firms we understate the importance of firms whose marginal tax rates

deviate from statutory values. If the stochastic process governing transitions

into and out of credit carryforward status is similar to that for tax loss

carryforward status, however, our effective tax rate analyses may still describe

the incentives facing these firms.

     Our effective tax rate calculations embody a number of strong assumptions

about the stochastic process determining firms' tax status. In particular, we

maintain the fiction that firms face identical, time-invariant, exogenous proba-

bilities of moving into and out of periods during which tax losses are carried

forward. Each of these assumptions is unrealistic, and could usefully be

relaxed in future work. Perhaps the most intriguing direction for future work

concerns the endogeneity of a firm's tax status. There are a wide range of cor-
                                      -.47 -



porate   actions which affect marginal tax rates, ranging from the traditional

investment and financing choices (see Cooper and Franks (1983) and Auerbach

(1986)) to less-frequently-analyzed accounting choices (see Watts and Zimmerman

(1986)). We know relatively little about what firms do in both the real and

financial domains in order to alter their tax status. The potential response of

these corporate decisions are however fundamental for analyzing the incentive

effects of the corporate tax.

     The substantial differences across firms in expected future tax status may

provide a useful source of variation which can be used to study how taxes affect

financing and investment decisions. If the magnitude of debt tax shields are an

important influence on firms' capital structure as for example in DeAngelo and

Nasulis (1980), then we should observe different borrowing policies from firms

with substantial tax loss carryforwards and those which have large accumulated

potential carrybacks and are currently taxable. The latter has a larger tax

incentive for borrowing than the former, and this may yield testable predictions

of how taxes affect financing choices.

                                  Footnotes

    1. Cordes and Sheffrin (1983) calculate marginal tax rates using corporate
tax return data but they assume that firms cannot carry back either losses or
credits. This biases their findings toward the result that many firms face tax
rates below the statutory maximum.

    2. For an excellent summary of the recent debate surrounding average tax
rates on large corporations, see the series of essays in Tax Notes 9 December
1985. The claim that sizable numbers of large corporations pay no tax is due to
McIntyre and Folen (1984) and McIntyre and Wilhelm (1986). Their calculations
are based on the ratio of current tax payments to earnings, which bears no
necessary relation to the firm's marginal tax status.

    3. The extent to which firms can claim investment tax credits, foreign tax
credits, R&D credits, and a number of other credits depends upon their taxable
income. The ITC, for example, is limited to $25,000 + .90*max[0,Tax-25,000].
Additional taxable earnings for a firm bound by this constraint would raise
tax liability by only .10*T, where T is the statutory tax rate.

    4. Cordes and Sheffrin (1983) were affiliated with the Office of Tax
Analysis when they used the Treasury Corporate Tax Model to calculate the
distribution of corporate marginal tax rates.

    5. We also tried to find examples of loss carryforward firms which did not
appear in the COMPUSTAT sample. For example, we examined the 50 firms with the
smallest current tax payments in McIntyre and Folen (1984) and found no cases of
firms with loss carryforwards which were not in our sample.

    6. Stickney, Weil, and Wolfson (1983) provide a detailed analysis of one
firm, General Electric's, accounting for its financial subsidiary.

    7. It is difficult to gauge the importance of omitting the financial sub-
sidiaries of some firms. We studied the published financial statement of
several large financial subsidiaries, those of General Motors, Chrysler, General
Electric, Ford, and Westinghouse, and in no case did we find evidence of tax
loss carryforwards in the subsidiary; this suggests the biases from annual
reports which exclude these subsidiaries may not be too severe.

    8. Although in principle we could model firm heterogeneity and estimate
separate transition probabilities for firms with similar characteristics, the
sparseness of some off-diagonal cells in our transition matrices suggests that
it would be difficult to obtain precise estimates. For example, there are
only 14 firms which make the Taxable-Loss Carryforward-Taxable transition in
1983-1984, and only 20 firms in the Loss Carryforward-Taxable-Taxable cell.
Another possibility is using a mover-stayer model to describe the data, allowing
some firms to be "stayers" in the taxable state. This might be explored in
future work.

    9. The steady state probabilities are defined as follows: q =

    10. The transition probabilities in this table are not directly comparable to
 those in Table 5 for two reasons. First, in looking at COMPUSTAT data over a
 period of many years, we confront the problem of missing values for the tax
 loss variables. We assume (very conservatively) that all missing values corres-
 pond to taxable years; this substantially overstates the chance of escaping from
 the tax loss state. Second, the sample selection problem alluded to in the text
 with respect to firms which merged or went bankrupt is likely to be much more
 important in this analysis of transitions over a long time period than in our
 previous tabulations which spanned only four years. The net effect of this bias
 is unclear.

   11. An asset need not have a negative total tax liability for this to occur.
Consider a project with negative taxable earnings in its early years, followed
by significant taxable income later in its life. Even if the project's tax
payments have a positive net present value, the cost of foregoing tax benefits
in the near-term may exceed the gain from postponing tax liabilities later in
the project.

   12. Previous work treating this endogeneity has considered only very simple
models; see, for example, Auerbach (1986).

   13. The notation L5 refers to s consecutive years of tax loss carryforwards.

   14. By focusing on expected returns, we are implicitly assuming that tax-
status risk is entirely nonsystematic. In practice, most firms are more likely
to experience tax loss carryforwards during recessions; this imparts a poten-
tially important systematic component to these tax streams.

   15. We also truncate project returns and accrued tax liabilities after forty
years. The results are insensitive to these truncations.

    16. This overstates the effect of carryforward provisions. When a non-
taxable firm incurs a tax liability, there are two possibilities concerning its
current income: it may be negative, adding to previous losses, or it may be
positive but completely offset by previous losses. In the former case, the
additional tax liability (if negative) will add new losses to be carried for-
ward. If the additional tax liability is positive, it will reduce the new
losses carried forward. In either case, the tax liability will have a limit of
fifteen years during which it can be realized. After that time, the marginal
impact on the stock of loss carryforwards disappears. In the case where the
firm is currently offsetting some of its previous tax losses, however, the
Situation is more complicated, since the marginal impact of the accrued tax
liabilities will be to increase or decrease the working off of old loss carry-
forwards. The marginal contribution of a new gain or loss to the tax losses
carried forward therefore has fewer than N years to expiration.

   17. An additional restriction which has been changed over the years governs
the extent to which firms can use investment tax credits to offset taxable
                                    —50-



income before credits. To model this provision, we would have to modify our
analysis to include an intermediate state between taxable and nontaxable, in
which a firm pays taxes but has tax credits carried forward. Unfortunately,
because our data limitations prevent us from estimating transition probabilities
with respect to this state, we must omit it.

   18. Ideally, the rate used to discount the components in the carryback shadow
price would be the after-tax rate of return for the project. However, this
would have required an iteration procedure which seemed inappropriate given the
parameter's minor role.

   19. This is higher fraction initially in a taxable state than was found in
Auerbach (1983). The difference is probably due to the different specification
of the transition process.

   20. We assume that structures are only depreciated once when they are pur-
chased. Gordon, Hines, and Summers (1986) conclude that "churning" is not pro-
fitable for corporations, although it may be attractive to partnerships. We
also ignore asset-related differences in leverage capacity. If structures can
carry more debt than equipment, as is commonly supposed, then loss carryforward
firms may face greater disincentives to purchasing structures than we have
reported.

         APPENDIX: COMPUTING THE SHADOW VALUE OF TAX PAYMENTS WITH CARRYBACKS


        This appendix describes our procedure for calculating the shadow value

of tax payments which arises from their possible future use in permitting loss

carrybacks. A dollar of tax payments is valuable because, according to current

 law, it may be used to offset a tax loss occurring in the following three years.

However, its value is less than the present value of such deductions because

there is some probability that the loss that is made deductible in the next

three years would have been offset through carryforwards at some future date.

Tax losses foregone in future periods also have a shadow value because the

associated increase in taxable income will in turn lead to the possibility of

eventual carryback.

        To compute the value of the carryback option, consider a taxable firm and

define TT as the expected carryback value of a one dollar tax payment made in

the second of a pair of adjacent taxable years. Define LT in parallel fashion.

Let TL denote the present value of the future deductions foregone when a loss

is realized; it is also the present value of the tax payments which result from

a one dollar increase in taxable income for a firm which was taxable in the pre-

vious year but is currently not taxable. This follows from the fact that a

carryback is used as soon as possible, which means the first year in which there

is insufficient taxable income. The value of                is given by:

(A.l) VIT =       TTL + TTTTT1             +



              =
                  TTL1      +
                                 TTT   +



where     =   (1-i)/(1+r)       denotes the discount factor applied when shifting a tax

payment one year into the future. Equation (A.l) denotes the expected present
                                           —54—


value of the carrybacks associated with a one dollar tax payment. By the same

logic, we can define



(A.2) LT =             + LTTTTL      +
                                         PLTTPTTTPTTL)(lWTL)

for currently-taxable firms which were not taxable last year. Each of these

expressions depends upon TL' which is in turn given by


                                                              +
(A.3) WTL =   PTLT(l   VLT) +   TLLLLT 'LT +

where N is the maximum number of periods for which a loss may be carried for-

ward. Solving these three equations for v11, VLT and WTL yields:



(A.4) v = [aTT(1_aTL))/(l_aLTaTL)


(A.5) 'LT =   [aLT(1aTL)]/(1aLTaTL)

(A.6) WIL =   [aTL(1CLT))/(laLTaTL).

where alT =            + TTT    +
                                    TTT'    aLT =   LTL   +
                                                                  LTTTTL
                                                                           +
                                                                               LTTTTTTTL'
and alL =
            1LTTLT TLLLLT +                +        +


    These shadow values are used in calculating the expected present value of

tax liabilities. To account for firms' ability to carry losses back, we

multiply each of the expected tax payments generated by the no—carryback analy-

sis by either (1_vTT) or (1vLl)1 depending on the firm's tax status. When a

firm accrues a tax liability with a distribution of expected payments across
                                        —55-


many periods, the concurrent value of          determines the fraction of the

expected tax payment which will be paid immediately in a state following a

taxable year. This amount is multiplied by 'TT• All of the remaining corn—

ponents associated with this accrued liability are multiplied by
                                                                        (1VLT), since
they occur in states where the firm will have just re—entered taxable status.

In the notation of section three, this implies



                   VLT                                       s>t
(A.7)          =
                     t        t
                          +             t
                                               + q)
                                                 t
                                                             S   = t.
This can be substituted into equation (5) to evaluate the internal rate of

return, r, and then the effective tax rate.
