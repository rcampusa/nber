The Decline of African-American and Hispanic Wealth since the Great Recession
Edward N. Wolff
NBER Working Paper No. 25198
October 2018
JEL No. D31,J15

                                         ABSTRACT

The ratio in standard net worth NW between African-Americans and (non-Hispanic) whites was
the same in 2007 as in 1983 (0.19) but then fell to 0.14 in 2016, while that between Hispanics and
whites climbed from 0.16 to 0.26 but then plunged to 0.19. Minorities had much higher debt-net
worth ratios in 2007 – 0.55 for blacks, 0.51 for Hispanics, and 0.18 for whites. Minorities also
had a higher share of assets in homes than whites – 0.54 and 0.53 versus 0.31. Decomposition
analysis reveals that the lower return on wealth for minorities explained a large share of the
widening wealth gap between 2007 and 2010. From 2010 to 2016, the return was higher for
minorities but this was offset by larger dissavings. Adding pension and Social Security wealth to
standard wealth substantially lowers the wealth gap. The racial ratio of mean augmented wealth
AW (net worth, pension, and Social Security wealth) was 0.27 in 2016 and the ethnic ratio was
0.28. The racial gap was the same in 2016 as in 1989, while the ethnic ratio increased from 0.25
to 0.28. In 2016, NW inequality was considerably higher for blacks and Hispanics than whites
(by 0.120 and 0.093 Gini points, but AW inequality was considerably lower (by 0.098 and 0.067
points). While AW inequality increased by 0.067 Gini points for whites from 1989 to 2016, it fell
by 0.046 points for blacks and by 0.015 points for Hispanics. Social Security was the principal
factor.

1. Introduction
        This paper documents the more or less steady deterioration in the income, wealth holdings, and
the homeownership rate of black and Hispanic relative to white households from 1983 to 2016,
particularly since the onset of the Great Recession. It is also the case that the gap in wealth between the
minorities and whites was considerably greater than the gap in income. Using decomposition analysis, I
show that differences in capital revaluation explain much of the racial/ethnic wealth gap with savings,
wealth transfers, and other factors accounting for the remainder. I also standardize wealth trends using a
constant racial/ethnic mix to see how changes in race/ethnicity composition affect overall time trends.

         The paper focuses mainly on how the different racial and ethnic groups fared in terms of wealth
over years 2007 to 2010 during one of the sharpest declines in stock and real estate prices and over years
2010 to 2016 as asset prices recovered. The wealth gap between African-American and white families
was much the same in 2007 as in 1983 but it lessened considerably for Latinos over these years. 1 The
relative indebtedness of minorities exploded from 1983 to 2007, making their finances very fragile in
2007. The racial and ethnic disparity in wealth holdings widened considerably in the years between 2007
and 2010, a period often referred to as the Great Recession. Hispanics, in particular, got hammered over
these years in terms of net worth. However, during the recovery period, from 2010 to 2016, the racial
wealth gap remained largely unchanged, though there was some diminution of the ethnic wealth gap.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section, Section 2, provides some
historical background. Section 3 offers a brief literature review and Section 4 discusses the measurement
of household wealth and describes the data sources used for this study. Section 5 presents results on time
trends on wealth holdings by race and ethnicity. Section 6 highlights differences in portfolio composition
among the three groups and reports on the results of a decomposition analysis of racial and ethnic wealth
differences. Section 7 adds pension and Social Security wealth to the household portfolio for years 1989
to 2016. 2 A summary of results and concluding remarks are provided in Section 8.
2. Historical background on asset price movements
        The last two decades have witnessed some remarkable events. Perhaps, most notable was the
housing value cycle which first led to an explosion in home prices and then a collapse, affecting net
worth and helping to precipitate the Great Recession, followed by a strong recovery. The median house
price remained virtually the same in 2001 as in 1989 in real terms. 3 However, the home ownership rate
shot up from 62.8 to 67.7 percent. Then, 2001 saw a recession (albeit a short one). Despite this, house
prices suddenly took off and over the years 2001 to 2007 housing prices gained 19 percent. 4 The home

 The Case-Schiller 20-City Composite Home Price NSA Index showed a rather different trend. It advanced by 35.0
percent from January, 2001, to January, 2004, and then by 33.5 percent from January, 2004, to January, 2007 (the

ownership rate continued to expand, though at a somewhat slower rate, from 67.7 to 68.6 percent.

         Then, the recession and associated financial crisis hit. The recession officially began in December,
2007, and “officially” ended in June, 2009. 5 Over this period, real GDP fell by 4.3 percent and then from the
second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2013 it gained 9.2 percent. After that it grew by another 6.8
percent through the third quarter of 2016. 6 The unemployment rate shot up from 4.4 percent in May of 2007
to a peak of 10.0 percent in October of 2009 but by October of 2016 it was down to 4.9 percent. 7

         One consequence was that asset prices plummeted. From 2007 to 2010, the median home price
(in constant dollars) nose-dived by 24 percent, and the share of households owning their own home fell
off, from 68.6 to 67.2 percent. This was followed by a partial recovery, with median house prices rising
7.8 percent through September 2013, though still far below its 2007 value. However, the homeownership
rate continued to contract, falling to 65.1 percent. In contrast, median home prices in real terms jumped
by 18.4 percent from 2013 to 2016, though the homeownership rate continued to fall to 63.7 percent.

         In contrast to the housing market, the stock market boomed during the 1990s. On the basis of the
Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 index, stock prices surged 159 percent in constant dollars between 1989 and
2001. 8 Stock ownership spread and by 2001 over half of U.S. households owned stock either directly or
indirectly. However, the stock market peaked in 2000. It was then down from 2000 to 2004, rebounded
by 2007, with the S&P 500 rising by 6 percent from 2001 to 2007. However, the stock ownership rate fell
to 49 percent. Then came the Great Recession. Stock prices crashed from 2007 to 2009 and then partially
recovered in 2010 for a net decline of 26 percent. The stock ownership rate also once again declined, to
47 percent. The stock market continued to rise after 2010 and by 2013 was up 39 percent over 2010 and
above its previous high in 2007. However, the stock ownership rate continued to drop, to 46 percent.
Once again, the stock market continued to boom from 2013 to 2016, up by 27.9 percent in real terms 9,
but in this case the stock ownership rate rebounded to 49.3 percent.

        What have all these major transformations wrought in terms of the distribution of household
wealth by race and ethnicity? This is the subject of the remainder of the paper.

are so different between the two sources. However, the Case-Shiller index is based on data from the largest 20
metropolitan areas, whereas the National Association of Realtors index is much broader based, covering some 160
metropolitan areas. For my purposes here, the latter is a more reliable indicator of national housing price movements.

3. A Brief Literature Review
         A vast literature in economics has examined the economic progress of African Americans over
the past century. Most of these studies have focused on income -- or on even narrower measures of
economic well-being such as earnings -- and have sought to assess the extent to which any gains that
were made relative to other race groups can be attributed to factors such as declining race discrimination,
affirmative action policies, changes in household composition and other demographic characteristics,
shifts in industrial composition, a narrowing of the gap between the educational levels of African
Americans and the rest of the population, and the like. Much less is known, however, about how African
Americans have fared in terms of wealth, an important measure of economic well-being that is more
informative in many respects than those derived from income flows during a particular year. While a
number of studies have examined inequality by race in wealth levels, little attention has been paid to
differences by race in patterns of wealth accumulation. To fill this gap, I examine wealth changes over
the period 1983-2016, showing how the races differ in terms of the main components of wealth growth:
savings, capital gains and inheritances.

         While studies of earnings and income are important for assessing the extent to which labor
market discrimination exists and the ability of African Americans to move closer to whites in terms of
acquiring the skills and connections that are currently rewarded by the markets, they provide what is
clearly an incomplete picture. It is evident that the economic positions of two families with the same
incomes but widely different wealth levels are not identical. The wealthier family is likely to be able to
better provide for the educational and health needs of its children, to be living in a neighborhood
characterized by more amenities and lower levels of crime, to have greater resources that can be called
upon in times of economic hardship, and to have more influence in political life.

         Previous research on explaining the racial/ethnic wealth gap has tended to focus on three topics:
(1) the role of differences in demographic characteristics; (2) disparities in homeownership; and (3)
differentials in inheritances. The major contribution here is to focus on differences in portfolio
composition between the three groups and on the role of pension wealth and Social Security wealth in
explaining differences in augmented wealth (the sum of net worth, pension wealth, and Social Security
wealth).

         The handful of recent studies on racial differences in wealth have paid little attention to patterns
in wealth accumulation, focusing instead almost exclusively on trying to explain gaps in wealth levels.
The typical approach has been to employ a Blinder-Oaxaca means-coefficient analysis (Blinder 1973),
using regressions estimated separately by race, to calculate how much of the gap can be attributed to
differences in characteristics that are associated with wealth accumulation, such as family income and
education (Blau and Graham 1990; Oliver and Shapiro 1995; Menchik and Jianakoplos 1997; Avery and
Rendall 1997; and Conley 1999). The resulting estimates, however, turn out to vary widely depending on
whether coefficients are used from the regression equation estimated for whites or that from African
Americans. That is, because the wealth of whites rises more steeply than that of African Americans with
increases in such characteristics as income and education, the lower mean levels of these characteristics
for African Americans “explain” much more when the coefficients for the whites are used. Altonji and
Doraszelski (2005) find this to be true even when long histories are used to construct improved income
and demographic variables. 10 Maroto (2016) examined demographic and economic factors accounting
for racial and ethnic wealth disparities at different points of the wealth distribution and found that
demographic and income differences mattered more for high-wealth households but differential access to
credit markets and homeownership were more important among low wealth households. Lerman (2017)

10
 Barsky et al. (2001) demonstrate that the discrepancies are related, in part, to parametric assumptions about the
wealth functions.




                                                                                                                     4
investigated changes in differences in family structure between blacks and whites over years 2007 and
2013 and found that they were too small to play a large role in explaining trends in the racial wealth gap.

         The fact that the explanatory power of this exercise depends on the coefficients used is less than
satisfying, however, as a more complete understanding of the forces behind the racial wealth gap as well
the efficacy of various public policies designed to narrow it hinge on what causes the wealth functions to
differ so much by race in the first place. That is, do white families have higher levels of wealth than
African American families at comparable age levels because they have received greater amounts of
inheritances and other intergenerational transfers, because they devote larger amounts of income to
savings, or because they earn higher rates of returns on assets? Unfortunately, with data on family
wealth for only one point in time, it is difficult to do more than speculate as to which of these three
categories holds the key to racial wealth inequality.

        Hurst, Luoh and Stafford (1998) also contains some analysis of racial differences in wealth
accumulation, but this subject is not the main focus of their study. While they do assess whether overall
wealth changes vary by race, they do not attempt to decompose these changes into the three key
components of wealth accumulation noted above, nor do they examine differences by race with respect to
these components.

         Gittleman and Wolff (2004), in contrast, do examine wealth changes over the period 1984-1994,
showing how the races differ in terms of the main components of wealth growth: savings, capital gains
and inheritances. Making use of panel data from the PSID, they find, as expected, that inheritances raise
the rate of wealth accumulation of whites relative to that of African Americans. But, while whites devote
a greater share of their income to savings, racial differences in savings rates are not significant, once
income is controlled for. They also do not find evidence that the rate of return to capital is greater for
whites than for African Americans, at least for this period.

         Why might patterns of wealth accumulation differ by race? Most obvious is that racial wealth
gaps in the past imply that younger generations of African-American families will inherit from their
parents smaller amounts than their white counterparts (Menchik and Jianakoplos 1997; Avery and
Rendall 1997; and Williams 2017).

         The rate of return to capital may vary by race because of a combination of differences in
portfolio composition and differences in the rate of return to specific assets. African Americans may
face barriers to the acquisition of homes and business because of discrimination in mortgage and small
business credit markets, customer discrimination, limited access to information about investment
opportunities and other factors (Munnell, et al. 1996; Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman 1998).
Moreover, if children’s asset allocations are influenced by those of their parents, the historically lower
likelihood of African Americans to hold such financial assets as stocks and transaction accounts will
persist over time (Chiteji and Stafford 1999).

        Though the substantial differences by race in asset allocation that I document below are well
known, the evidence on rate of return by asset type is rather scanty. A partial exception is the housing
market, where earlier research, summarized by Blau and Graham (1990) concluded that homes in African
American neighborhoods have appreciated at a lower rate than those in predominantly white areas.
However, in an examination of mean housing prices by race using the decennial Censuses for 1960 to
1990, Denton (2001) finds that the ratio of the value of African American to white homes, while still well
below unity, reached its highest level in 1990. 11 Williams (2017, Chapter 3), on the other hand, in a
11
     Blau and Graham (1990) conclude on the basis of a simulation that differences in rates of return could not account




                                                                                                                      5
review of the pertinent literature concludes that white households enjoy higher returns on assets than
black families. This is particularly so for the appreciation of housing prices and this may be largely due
to racial segregation of neighborhoods. Moreover, Chiteji (2010) finds in her study that African
Americans pay higher interest rates on auto loans, home mortgages, and education loans than do whites.

         Interestingly, economic theory does not offer unambiguous predictions about the effect of racial
discrimination in the small business credit market with respect to the rate of return to business ownership
for blacks relative to whites. If such discrimination occurs in the form of higher credit costs, it can lower
the relative rate of return. If, however, a lack of access to credit causes African Americans to be unable
to start businesses that a similarly qualified white would be able to, then, on average, African American
entrepreneurs able to start businesses would be expected to be better qualified than their white
counterparts, and thus have a higher rate return.

         The various models that have been developed to study the behavior of consumption have
implications for the pattern of household saving rates by race (Browning and Lusardi 1996; Browning
and Crossley 2001). Life-cycle models predict that, because African Americans have shorter life
expectancies and larger families, they will consume at a faster rate than whites. Though economists have
not yet reached a consensus on the importance of precautionary savings and the appropriate proxy for the
uncertainty that generates it (Browning and Lusardi 1996; Carroll, Dynan and Krane 1999), African
Americans experience greater income uncertainty (Gittleman and Joyce 1996; Mazumder 2001). In
buffer-stock saving models, the volatility of income increases the necessity of building up savings, but
also makes it more likely that reserves will have to be drawn down (Carroll 1997).
         Differences by race may also emerge because savings as a proportion of current income tend to
rise with current income, and whites have higher levels of current income than do African Americans. In
standard models, this relationship between saving rates and current income may occur because
households with high levels of transitory income may be saving at a faster clip to offset expected lower
income in the future (Dynan, Skinner and Zeldes 2000). A number of other economic explanations have
also been offered in addition to an array of psychological and sociological theories (Beverly 1997;
Carney and Gale 1999). These explanations include that relative to the rest of the population, low-
income households may be more impatient (Lawrance, 1991), have a higher Social Security replacement
rate, and have more limited access to institutionalized saving mechanisms such as 401(k) plans. Further,
the saving behavior of African Americans may be more affected than that of whites by the presence of
asset-based, means-tested social insurance programs, because of the higher concentration of African
Americans in the low-income population. Programs such as AFDC/TANF and Medicaid may depress
savings by providing a consumption floor and thereby reducing income uncertainty and thus the need for
precautionary savings, and by imposing assets limits that, in some circumstances, effectively tax assets at
a rate of 100 percent for those who are income-eligible for a program but have savings above the
threshold (Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes 1995).

4. Data sources and methods
        The primary data sources used for this study are the 1983, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004,
2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) conducted by the Federal Reserve
Board. Each survey consists of a core representative sample combined with a high-income supplement. In
1983, for example, the supplement was drawn from the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income

for much of the racial difference in wealth levels in their sample. Though their analysis was not based on actual rates
of return, Menchik and Jianakoplos (1997) calculated a specific rate of return for each household on the basis of the
actual portfolio composition of each household. They concluded that racial differences in rates of return were not
important in explaining racial differences in wealth levels.




                                                                                                                      6
data file. Starting in 1989, the high income supplement was selected as a list sample from statistical
records (the Individual Tax File) derived from tax data by the Statistics of Income Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (SOI). This second sample was designed to disproportionately select families
that were likely to be relatively wealthy (see, for example, Kennickell, 2001). Typically, about two thirds
of the cases come from the representative sample and one third from the high-income supplement.

        The principal wealth concept used here is marketable wealth (or net worth), which is defined as
the current value of all marketable or fungible assets less the current value of debts. Total assets are the
sum of: (1) housing; (2) other real estate; (3) bank deposits, certificates of deposit, and money market
accounts; (4) financial securities; (5) the cash surrender value of life insurance; (6) defined contribution
pension plans, including IRAs, Keogh, and 401(k) plans; (7) corporate stock and mutual funds; (8)
unincorporated businesses; and (9) trust funds. Total liabilities are the sum of: (1) mortgage debt, (2)
consumer debt and (3) other debt such as educational loans.

         This measure reflects wealth as a store of value and therefore a source of potential consumption.
I believe that this is the concept that best reflects the level of well-being associated with a family's
holdings. Thus, only assets that can be readily converted to cash (that is, "fungible" ones) are included.
As a result, consumer durables such as automobiles, televisions, and the like, are excluded here, since
these items are not easily marketed, with the possible exception of vehicles, or their resale value typically
far understates the value of their consumption services to the household. Another justification for their
exclusion is that this treatment is consistent with the national accounts, where purchase of vehicles is
counted as expenditures, not savings. As a result, my estimates of household wealth will differ from those
provided by the Federal Reserve Board, which includes the value of vehicles in their standard definition
of household wealth (see, for example, Kennickell and Woodburn, 1999).

        Also excluded in the concept of net worth is the value of future Social Security benefits the
family may receive upon retirement ("Social Security wealth"), as well as the value of retirement benefits
from private pension plans ("pension wealth"). Even though these funds are a source of future income,
they are not in their direct control and cannot be marketed. The value of these two components will be
included in a measure of augmented wealth as detailed in Section 7.

        I also use a more restricted concept of wealth, which I call “financial resources” or FR. This is
defined as net worth minus net equity in owner-occupied housing (the primary residence only). FR is a
more liquid concept than marketable wealth, since one's home is difficult to convert into cash in the short
term. Moreover, primary homes also serve a consumption purpose besides acting as a store of value. FR
represents what a household can draw down without lowering its standard of living. Thus, it excludes
homes (and vehicles) and reflects the resources that may be immediately available for consumption
expenditure or various forms of investments. 12

5. The racial divide widens over the Great Recession
        4.1 Trends from 1983 to 2007
        Striking differences are found in the wealth holdings of different racial and ethnic groups. In
Table 1, households are divided into three groups: (i) non-Hispanic whites, (ii) non-Hispanic African-
Americans, and (iii) Hispanics. 13 In 2006, while the ratio of mean incomes between non-Hispanic white

  However, it does include miscellaneous assets like artwork, since this can be sold without significantly lowering a
family’s standard of living. As a result, FR is not a 100 percent pure concept since it reflects a mixture of savings and
consumption motives.

      The residual group, American Indians and Asians, is excluded here because of its small sample size.




                                                                                                                       7
(“white”) and non-Hispanic black (“black”) households was an already low 0.48 and the ratio of median
incomes was 0.60, the ratios of mean and median wealth holdings in 2007 were even lower, at 0.19 and
0.06, respectively, and those of FR still lower, at 0.14 and 0.01, respectively (also see Figures 1a – 9b). 14
The homeownership rate for black households was 49 percent in 2007, a little less than two thirds the
rate among whites, and the percentage of black households with zero or negative net worth stood at 33.4,
more than double the corresponding percentage among whites. The Gini coefficient for net worth among
whites was 0.818 whereas it was considerably higher among blacks at 0.848 and among Latinos at 0.880.
         [Table 1 and Figures 1a – 9b about here]
         Between 1982 and 2006, while the average real income of white households increased by 42
percent and the median by 10 percent, the former rose by only 28 percent for blacks and the latter by 18
percent. As a result, the ratio of mean income slipped from 0.54 to 0.48, while the ratio of median income
rose from 0.56 to 0.60. The contrast in the time trends for the ratio of means and that of medians reflects
the fact that a relatively small number of white households increased their incomes by a huge amount
over these years – a result of rising income inequality among white households.

         Between 1983 and 2001, average net worth (in constant dollars) climbed by 73 percent for whites
but rose by only 31 percent for black households, so that the net worth ratio fell from 0.19 to 0.14. Then,
between 2001 and 2007, mean net worth among black households gained an astounding 58 percent while
white wealth advanced only 29 percent, so that by 2007 the net worth ratio was back to 0.19, the same
level as in 1983. In the case of median wealth, the black-white ratio increased from 7 percent in 1983 to
10 percent in 2001 but then dipped to 6 percent in 2007, a little less than the ratio in 1983. In this case,
median wealth among white households grew by 37 percent between 1983 and 2001 but more than
doubled among black households. However, between 2001 and 2007, median net worth among black
households actually crashed by 26 percent, reflecting in part the rising share of black households with
zero or negative net worth.

        Average financial resources, FR, also increased about the same for black and white households
between 1983 and 2001, so that the ratio remained basically unchanged. Between 2001 and 2007, it
increased somewhat faster for blacks so that the ratio increased to 0.14. Median FR of black households
also increased, from virtually zero in 1983 to a positive $1,400 in 2001, and the corresponding ratio also
grew, from zero to 3 percent. However, from 2001 to 2007, median FR among blacks toppled to only
$600 and the corresponding ratio fell to only 1 percent. The reason for the decline was the faster growth
of non-mortgage debt among black middle class households than among whites.

        The homeownership rate of black households grew from 44.3 to 47.4 percent between 1983 and
2001 but relative to white households, the homeownership ratio slipped slightly to 0.64 in 2001. From
2001 to 2007, the black homeownership rate went up a bit more to 48.6 percent, while the white
homeownership rate moved up to 74.8 percent, so that the homeownership ratio increased to 0.65. The
percentage of black households reporting zero or negative net worth fell from 34.1 percent in 1983 to
30.9 percent in 2001 (and also fell relative to white households). However, by 2007, the share was up to
33.4 percent (though a bit lower relative to whites). Wealth inequality was uniformly higher among black
than among white households. This difference largely reflects the higher share of blacks with zero or
negative wealth. While there was moderate increase in the Gini coefficient among the former, from 0.781
in 1983 to 0.818 in 2007, there was almost no change among black households over this period.

 14
    It should be stressed that the unit of observation is the household, which includes both families (two or
more related individuals living together), as well as single adults. As is widely known, the share of female-
headed households among African-Americans is much higher than that among whites. This difference
partly accounts for the relatively lower income and wealth among African-American households.




                                                                                                                8
         The picture is somewhat different for Hispanics. The ratio of mean income between Hispanics
and (non-Hispanic) whites in 2007 was 0.50, almost the same as that between blacks and whites.
However, the ratio of median income was 0.70, much higher than the black-white ratio. The ratio of
mean net worth was 0.26 compared to a black-white ratio of 0.19, and the ratio of mean FR was 0.19,
compared to 0.14. However, the ratios of medians were 0.06 and 0.01, respectively, almost identical to
those between blacks and whites. The Hispanic homeownership rate was 49 percent, almost identical to
that of black households, and 34 percent of Hispanic households reported zero or negative wealth, almost
the same as among African-Americans.

        Progress among Hispanic households over the period from 1983 to 2007 was generally a positive
story. Mean household income for Hispanics grew by 18 percent and median household income by 16
percent, so that the ratio of mean income slid from 60 to 50 percent while that of median income
advanced from 66 to 70 percent. Between 1983 and 2001, mean wealth almost doubled for Hispanic
households and mean FR grew almost four-fold. As a result, the Hispanic-white ratio of mean net worth
advanced somewhat from 16 percent in 1983 to 17 percent in 2001, and the ratio of mean FR jumped
from 7 to 14 percent. Another wealth surge occurred from 2001 to 2007 for Hispanics with mean NW
almost doubling again and mean FR up by 60 percent and the corresponding ratios climbed to 26 and 19
percent, respectively, quite a bit higher than those between black and white households. The upturn in
Hispanic wealth can be traced to a five percentage point jump in the Hispanic homeownership rate.

        From 1983 to 2007, median wealth among Hispanics remained largely unchanged, as did median
FR (at virtually zero!), so that the ratio of both median wealth and median FR between Hispanics and
whites stayed virtually the same. In contrast, the homeownership rate among Hispanic households
climbed from 32.6 to 49.2 percent and the ratio of homeownership rates between the two groups grew
from 0.48 to 0.66.

         The percentage of Hispanic households with zero or negative net worth fell rather steadily from
40.3 percent in 1983 to 33.5 percent in 2007, and the share relative to white household tumbled from a
ratio of 3.55 to 2.30. Wealth inequality was also uniformly higher among Hispanic households than
among both whites and blacks over these years. This difference once again largely reflects the higher
share of Hispanic households with zero or negative wealth than white or black households. While there
was moderate increase in the Gini coefficient among whites and no net change among blacks between
1983 and 2007, there was a substantial jump among Latinos over these years, from 0.791 to 0.880. The
time trend among Latinos likely reflects the successive waves of new Latino immigrants arriving in the
U.S. over these years with little or no net worth (see Love and Schmidt, 2017, for example).

         Despite some progress from 2001 to 2007, the respective wealth gaps between African-
Americans and Hispanics on the one hand and whites on the other were still much greater than the
corresponding income gaps in 2007. While mean income ratios were of the order of 50 percent, mean
wealth ratios were of the order of 20 to 25 percent. Median FR among black and Hispanic households
was still virtually zero in 2007 and the percent with zero or negative net worth was around a third, in
contrast to 15 percent among white households (a difference that appeared to mirror the gap in poverty
rates). All three racial/ethnic groups saw an increase in their debt to asset ratio from 2001 to 2007.

        4.2 Trends from 2007 to 2016
        The racial/ethnic picture with regard to wealth changed radically by 2010. While the ratio of both
mean and median income between black and white households changed very little between 2007 and
2010 (mean income, in particular, declined for both groups), the ratio of mean net worth dropped from
0.19 to 0.14 and that of mean FR from 0.14 to 0.10. The proximate causes were the higher leverage of



                                                                                                           9
black households and their higher share of housing wealth in gross assets (see Table 2). In 2007, the ratio
of debt to net worth among African-American households was an astounding 0.553, compared to 0.154
among whites, while housing as a share of gross assets was 54 percent for the former as against 31
percent for the latter. The ratio of mortgage debt to home value was also much higher for blacks, 0.49,
than for whites, 0.32. The sharp drop in home prices from 2007 to 2010 thus led to a relatively steeper
loss in home equity for black homeowners, 26 percent, than for white homeowners, 24 percent (see
Tables 3 and 4), and this factor, in turn, led to a greater fall in mean net worth for black than white
households. 15 The annual real rate of return on the net worth of black families over years 2007 to 2010
was a -9.9 percent, compared to -7.1 percent for white households (see Table 6). Moreover, the higher
leverage of African-American households relative to white households and the broad decline in asset
prices led to greater relative losses in mean FR for the former than the latter. 16

        The Gini coefficient for net worth shot up from 0.848 to 0.948 among black households. The rise
was more moderate for white households, from 0.818 to 0.844. In the case of white households, the
increase likely reflects both the rise in the share with non-positive net worth and the much steeper decline
in median wealth than mean wealth. For the latter, the main reason appears to be the relatively steeper
decline in median than mean wealth, since the share with non-positive wealth showed little change.

         The Great Recession hit Hispanics harder than blacks in terms of wealth. Mean income among
Hispanic households rose a bit from 2007 to 2010 and the ratio with respect to white households
increased from 0.50 to 0.57. On the other hand, the median income of Hispanics fell, as did the ratio of
between Hispanic and white households. However, the mean net worth in constant dollars of Hispanics
fell almost in half, and the ratio relative to whites plummeted from 0.26 to 0.15. The same factors were
responsible as in the case of black households. In 2007, the debt-net worth ratio for Hispanics was 0.51,
compared to 0.15 among whites, and housing as a share of gross assets was 53 percent for the former as
against 31 percent for the latter (see Table 5). The ratio of mortgage debt to home value was also higher
for Hispanics, 0.452, than for whites, 0.324. As a result, net home equity dropped by 47 percent among
Hispanic homeowners, compared to 24 percent among white homeowners, and this factor, in turn, was
largely responsible for the huge decline in Hispanic net worth both in absolute and relative terms. Indeed,
the annual real rate of return on the net worth of Hispanic families over these years was -10.8 percent,
compared to -7.1 percent for white households. The high overall leverage among Hispanics was also
mainly responsible for the nearly 50 percent decline in mean FR and the fall in the ratio relativwe to
whites from 0.19 to 0.11.

         There are two reasons that might explain the extreme drop in Hispanic net worth. First, a large
proportion of Hispanic home owners bought their home in the interval from 2001 to 2007, when home
prices were peaking. This is reflected in the sharp increase in their home ownership rate over this period.
As a result, they suffered a disproportionately large percentage drop in their home equity. Second, it is
likely that Hispanic home owners were more heavily concentrated than whites in parts of the country like
Arizona, California, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada where home prices plummeted the most.

         There was also a drop in the homeownership rate among Hispanic households of 1.9 percentage
points from 2007 to 2010. Indeed, after catching up to white households in this dimension from 1983 to

15
  Unfortunately, there are no data available from the SCF to separate out actual declines in house prices for white,
black, and Hispanic homeowners.
16
  There was almost no change in the relative homeownership rates of the two groups – both experienced moderate
losses – while the share of households with non-positive net worth actually increased more in relative terms for white
households than black ones.




                                                                                                                   10
2007, Hispanic households fell back in 2010 to the same level as in 2004. These results accord with those
of Wolff, Owens, and Burak (2011) showing that Hispanics had by far the highest percentage of
homeowners who were delinquent in their mortgage payments in 2009 of any group.

        The Gini coefficient for net worth climbed steeply from 0.880 to 0.960 among Latinos, as it did
for blacks. The main reason appears to be the much steeper decline in median than mean wealth, since
the share with non-positive wealth showed little movement.

         Was there any improvement over the recovery period, 2010-2013? Black households continued
to suffer moderate losses in both mean and median household income in absolute terms and relative to
whites from 2010 to 2013. The mean net worth of black households also continued to fall, in this case by
9 percent, and the ratio of mean net worth between black and white households dipped further to 0.13
from 0.14. Their median net worth actually fell from $6,700 to $1,700, and the ratio relative to white
households plunged from 0.06 to 0.01. Their mean FR increased slightly but the ratio relative to white
households remained the same, while their median FR declined slightly and also relative to whites.

        One of the most notable developments was a sharp fall in the black homeownership rate from
47.7 to 44.0 percent, which followed a more modest 0.9 percentage point decrease from 2007 to 2010,
and a decline in the homeownership rate relative to white households from 0.64 in 2010 to 0.60 in 2013.
Equally striking was the steep uptick in the share of black households with no net worth, from 33 percent
in 2010 to 40 percent in 2013. Thus, by almost all indicators, the absolute and relative position of black
households deteriorated even further from 2010 to 2013.

         The absolute and relative decline in the net worth of black households over these years actually
seems surprising in light of the fact that the annual yield on the portfolio of black households was 7.14
percent, compared to 6.12 percent for white households. The key is the sharp decline in their
homeownership rate. Indeed, this led to a considerable loss in home equity in the black portfolio, which
fell by 26 percent overall and 20 percent among black homeowners (see Table 4).

        The Gini coefficient for net worth among black households continued its steep ascent between
2010 and 2013, from 0.948 to 1.010(!). 17 There was basically no change for white households. In the case
of black households, the increase likely reflects both the sharp rise in the share with non-positive net
worth, from 32.9 to 40.0 percent, and the much more precipitous fall in median wealth than mean wealth.

        Income developments were very similar for Hispanics but wealth developments were different.
Mean incomes of Hispanics were down 15 percent from 2010 to 2013, and the ratio relative to white
households plunged from 0.57 to 0.45. The story was similar for median income. On the other hand, the
mean net worth of Hispanic households remained stable from 2010 to 2013, as did their position relative
to white households, though their median wealth fell from $2,900 to $2,000. Their mean FR remained
unchanged from 2010 to 2013, as did their relative position, and their median FR increased slightly.

         However, like black families, their homeownership rate continued to fall, in this case from 47.3
percent to 43.9 percent (back to where it was in 1992), and their homeownership rate relative to white
households also slipped from 0.63 to 0.60. The percent of Hispanics with non-positive wealth actually
fell slightly from 2010 to 2013. Overall, Hispanic households had an average annual rate of return on
their portfolio of 7.48 percent, compared to 7.14 percent for black households (see Table 6). The main
difference with respect to black households was a much smaller decline in home equity – only 5 percent
overall – and an actual 1.6 percent increase among Hispanic homeowners alone. The Gini coefficient for
17
     The Gini coefficient is no longer bounded between zero and one if a variable can take on negative values.




                                                                                                                 11
net worth among Hispanic households showed little change from 2010 to 2013, as it did for white
households. This trend was partly a reflection of the fact that the share with non-positive net worth
showed little change.

        Things generally turned around for the two minority groups from 2013 to 2016. Incomes of black
and Hispanic households recovered and by 2016 had either equaled or surpassed their 2007 peaks.
Moreover, the ratio of mean income between blacks and white households jumped from 0.42 to 0.46 and
that between Hispanic and white households from 0.45 to 0.48, while the ratio of median incomes
between black and white households increased a bit from 0.56 to 0.58 and that between Hispanics and
whites shot up from 0.59 to 0.65

         The mean net worth of both groups showed a remarkable recovery. It grew by 45 percent among
black households and 64 percent among Hispanic households, though the 2016 levels were still below
their 2007 peaks. In contrast, the net worth of whites surpassed its 2007 peak. However, the wealth gap
did attenuate somewhat during these years, with the racial wealth ratio increasing from 0.13 to 0.14 and
the Hispanic-white ratio climbing from 0.15 to 0.19. Median net worth among the two minority groups
showed some recovery also, though relative to white households the ratios remained close to zero. Mean
FR of black households rose by 51 percent and mean FR of Hispanics by a huge 81 percent. In the case of
black households, mean FR in 2016 slightly surpassed its previous peak in 2007 but in the case of
Hispanics it was still below its previous peak. Mean FR for whites in 2016 was way above its 2007 peak.
The ratio of mean FR between blacks and whites advanced slightly from 0.10 to 0.11 while that between
Hispanics and whites climbed from 0.11 to 0.15. However, median FR of the two minority groups
remained close to zero. The homeownership rate picked up somewhat for Hispanics, remained unchanged
for black households, and fell for whites. As a result, the homeownership rate of black households
relative to white households was up slightly and that of Hispanics relative to whites up more strongly,
from 0.60 to 0.63. The percentage of households with non-positive wealth fell for all three groups,
particularly among Hispanics. Partly as a result of this factor, the Gini coefficient for wealth fell sharply
for both blacks (by 0.038 points) and Hispanics (by 0.022 points), though it was up slightly for whites.


6. Portfolio Composition and Decomposition Analysis
         6.1 Changes in Portfolio Composition
         I first look at the year 2007 for all households (see Table 2) Owner-occupied housing was the
most important household asset in the average portfolio breakdown for all households in 2007,
accounting for 32.8 percent of total assets. However, net home equity -- the value of the house minus any
outstanding mortgage -- amounted to only 21.4 percent of total assets. Real estate, other than owner-
occupied housing and business equity comprised another 31.3 percent. Demand deposits, time deposits,
money market funds, CDs, and the cash surrender value of life insurance (collectively, “liquid assets”)
made up 6.6 percent and pension accounts 12.1 percent. Bonds and other financial securities, corporate
stock, mutual funds, and trust fund equity collectively amounted to 15.5 percent. Debt as a proportion of
net worth was 18.1 percent, and the debt-income ratio was 1.187. The ratio of home mortgage debt to
home value amounted to 34.9 percent. Stocks directly or indirectly owned through mutual funds, trusts,
IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other retirement accounts comprised 16.8 percent of all assets.
         [Table 2 about here]
         There are striking differences in portfolio composition among the three groups. The breakdown
of assets owned was not surprisingly very similar for white households as for all households. The debt to
net worth ratio was slightly lower, at 0.154, as was the ratio of debt to income, at 1.090. Stocks directly
or indirectly owned as a share of gross assets was slightly higher at 18.3 percent.

        As noted above, black households invested a much higher share of their assets in their home,




                                                                                                          12
54.0 percent. Liquid assets as a share of total assets was slightly higher and the share of pension accounts
was about the same as overall. The proportion of assets invested in financial securities, corporate stock,
mutual funds, and trust fund equity was correspondingly lower, at only 3.4 percent, as was the share
invested in non-home real estate and business equity at 20.9 percent. Stocks directly or indirectly owned
amounted to only 5.0 percent of total assets. African-American households as noted above, had much
higher levels of relative indebtedness – a debt to net worth ratio of 0.553 and a debt-income ratio of
1.522. The ratio of home mortgage debt to home value was higher than overall, at 49.4 percent, and as a
consequence net home equity amounted to 27.3 percent of assets, only moderately greater than the
overall ratio.

        Among Hispanics, homes comprised 52.5 percent of their assets, roughly the same as among
black households, though the share in liquid and pension assets was smaller, at 3.9 and 7.7 percent
respectively. The share invested in non-home real estate and business equity was 32.9 percent, close to
the overall average. The ratio of home mortgage debt to home value was somewhat lower than that for
black households, 45.2 percent, and as a result the ratio of net home equity to assets was a bit higher at
28.8 percent.

 There were some important changes in the composition of household wealth over years 1983 to 2016.
First, among white households, the share of housing in total assets declined from 35.6 percent in 1983 to
23.1 percent in 2016 (see Table 3). Second, net home equity also fell almost continuously from 27.0 to
16.6 percent of assets. Third, mortgage debt as a proportion of homeowner's property increased from 24.0
to 32.6 percent. Fourth, pension accounts rose from 3.9 to 15.7 percent. This increase largely offset the
decline in the share of liquid assets in total assets, from 12.2 to 6.8 percent. Fifth, total stocks directly or
indirectly owned climbed from 8.4 percent of assets in 1989 to 23.5 percent in 2016. Sixth, the debt-net
worth ratio first fell from 16.6 percent in 1983 to 13.0 percent in 2001, climbed to 18.0 percent in 2010,
and then dropped off to 12.2 percent in 2016, while the debt-income ratio surged from 66.9 percent in
1983 to 125.8 percent in 2010 but then declined to 90.7 percent in 2016.
         [Table 3 about here]
         The large rise in relative indebtedness among white households between 2007 and 2010 could be
due to a rise in the absolute level of debt and/or a fall off in net worth and income. Both mean net worth
and mean income fell over the three years and there was a slight increase of debt in constant dollars of
3.2 percent. The steep rise in the debt-net worth and debt-income ratio over the three years was almost
entirely due to the reduction in wealth and income. In contrast, from 2010 to 2013, relative indebtedness
declined. In this case, both net worth and income showed a modest increase, so that the proximate cause
was a sizeable reduction in household debt of 12.6 percent. Once again, from 2013 to 2016, there was a
steep reduction in relative indebtedness. However, in this case average debt in constant dollars remained
relatively unchanged, so that the proximate cause was sharp increases in both average income and
average wealth.

          As noted above, the homeownership rate among white households first expanded from 65.1
percent in 1983 to 74.8 percent in 2007 but then remitted to 71.9 percent in 2016. Almost a third of white
households owned a pension asset in 1983 and this ratio expanded to almost three fifths in 2016. A
quarter of white households held corporate stock, mutual funds, financial securities or a trust fund in
1983 and this share expanded to 38.1 percent in 2001 and then fell off to 28.9 percent in 2016. In 1983
37.5 percent of white households reported owning stock either directly or indirectly, and this proportion
expanded to a peak of 57.5 percent in 2001, fell of somewhat to 53.9 percent in 2013, and then
rebounded to 57.5 percent in 2016. If we exclude small holdings of stock, then the ownership rates
dropped off sharply – in 2013, for example, from 53.9 percent to 44.2 percent for stocks worth $5,000 or
more and to 39.8 percent for stocks worth $10,000 or more.




                                                                                                             13
         Among African-American households, first, the share of housing wealth in total assets bounced
around a bit before reaching 54.0 percent in 2007 (see Table 4). It then fell sharply to 43.1 percent in
2016. Second, net home equity rose from 35.5 percent of total assets in 1983 to 39.9 percent in 1989, slid
to 23.5 percent in 2001 and then rose slightly to 23.9 percent in 2016. This pattern partially reflected the
trend in mortgage debt as a proportion of homeowner's property, which rose from 23.5 percent in 1983 to
52.6 percent in 2013 before diminishing to 44.6 percent in 2016. This latter figure was considerably
higher than for white households at 32.6 percent. Third, as among white households pension accounts as
a share of assets rose over time, from 3.0 percent in 1983 to 13.9 percent in 2016. Fourth, unlike white
households, the share of liquid assets in total assets first increased, from 9.7 percent in 1983 to 13.5
percent in 2001 but then fell off, to 7.0 percent in 2016. Fifth, stocks directly or indirectly owned jumped
from 3.3 percent of assets in 1989 to 14.9 percent in 2001 but then diminished to 9.3 percent in 2016.
         [Table 4 about here]
         Sixth, unlike white households, the debt-net worth ratio first increased over time from 24.8
percent in 1983 to 60.9 percent in 2013 but then dropped sharply to 44.5 percent in 2016, while the debt-
income ratio first climbed from 46.9 percent in 1983 to 152.2 percent in 2007 but then ebbed to 104.3
percent in 2016. Over the whole stretch from 1983 to 2016, the debt-net worth ratio among black
households surged by a factor of 1.8 and the debt-income ratio by a factor of 2.2, whereas the former
actually declined among white households, by 26 percent, and the latter was up by only 36 percent.
Between 2007 and 2010 there was a huge increase of 43.4 percent in the absolute level of debt. These
increases were much greater than among white households. From 2010 to 2013, while debt levels
diminished among white households, total debt was up by 7.5 percent. Between 2013 and 2016, mean
overall debt of African-Americans continued to increase, by 4.7 percent, while it rose by only 1.7 percent
among whites.

          As noted above, the homeownership rate among black households bounced around a bit from
49.4 percent in 1983 to 48.6 percent in 2007 and then dropped to 44.0 percent in 2016. About a fifth of
black households held a pension account in 1983, the share reached 38.9 percent in 2001 but then fell off
to 34.0 percent in 2016. In comparison the share of white households with a pension asset increased
sharply between 1983 and 2001, leveled off until 2013, and then climbed to 59.6 percent in 2016. The
share of black households owning stock either directly or indirectly rose from 10.1 percent in 1983 to a
peak of 34.2 percent in 2001 but then dropped to 29.7 percent in 2016. If small holdings of stock are
excluded, then the ownership rates diminished – in 2013, for example, from 27.5 percent to 16.2 percent
for stocks worth $5,000 or more and to only 12.1 percent for stocks worth $10,000 or more – but time
trends are very similar.

         Portfolio changes among Hispanic households generally paralleled those of black households
(see Table 5). First, the share of housing wealth in total assets actually fell sharply from 66.2 percent in
1983 to 47.6 percent in 2001, bounced back to 56.8 percent in 2010 but ebbed again to 44.2 percent in
2016. Second, net home equity declined rather continuously from 48.7 percent of total assets in 1983 to
24.9 percent in 2016. This pattern generally reflected the trend in mortgage debt as a share of
homeowner's property, which increased from 26.5 percent in 1983 to 55.4 percent in 2010 and then
dropped to 43.7 percent in 2016. This latter figure was considerably higher than for white households at
32.6 percent but about the same as for black households. A third change is that as among white
households pension accounts as a share of assets rose over time, from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 12.3 percent
in 2016. Fourth, unlike both white and black households, the share of liquid assets first fell from 8.4
percent in 1983 to 4.2 percent in 2013 but then rebounded to 8.1 percent in 2016. Fifth, stocks directly or
indirectly owned mushroomed from 1.6 percent of assets in 1989 to 10.6 percent in 2001, ebbed to 7.0
percent in 2013, and then climbed back to 12.9 percent in 2016.




                                                                                                         14
          [Table 5 about here]
          Fifth, in similar fashion to white households, the debt-net worth ratio increased from 40.4 percent
in 1983 to 68.3 percent in 2001 but then fell off sharply to 39.1 percent in 2016, while the debt-income
ratio, like that of black households, soared from 53.6 percent in 1983 to 187.9 percent in 2007 but then
plunged to 113.7 percent in 2016. Over the whole stretch from 1983 to 2016, the debt-net worth ratio
among Latinos was basically unchanged, compared to being up by a factor of 1.8 among black
households, and the debt-income ratio rose by a factor of 2.1, compared to 2.2 among black households.
Between 2007 and 2010, as for black households, there was a surge in the absolute level of debt by 93.0
percent. This change was much greater than among white households. From 2010 to 2013, while debt
levels diminished among white households and rose moderately among black households, average debt
were down by about 23 percent in absolute terms. From 2013 to 2016, average debt dropped by 7.5
percent, while it rose slightly for black and white households.

        As noted in Section 5, the Latino homeownership rate rose rather continuously from 42.8 percent
in 1983 to 49.2 percent in 2007, fell off sharply to 43.9 percent in 2013 but then rebounded to 45.4
percent in 2016, though still well below its 2007 peak. The proportion of Hispanic households with a
pension account increased moderately from 28.3 percent in 1983 to a high point of 32.0 percent in 2007,
fell somewhat to 25.6 percent in 2013, but then climbed back to 30.8 percent in 2016. The share of
Latinos with stock either directly or indirectly owned rose from 12.4 percent in 1983 to a high point of
28.0 percent in 2001, dropped off to 19.5 percent in 2013, but then rose back to 26.3 percent in 2016.

         All in all, there was a sizeable sell-off of assets between 2007 and 2016 among minorities.
Among black households, the homeownership rate fell by 4.7 percentage points. Much of this reduction
was due to forced sales of homes either through short sales or foreclosures. The ownership rate of
pension accounts by 2.6 percentage points, and that of securities, stocks, and trusts by 3.2 percentage
points. In the Latino community the homeownership rate tumbled by 3.8 percentage points, the fraction
holding pension accounts by 1.2 percentage points, and that of securities, stocks, and trusts by 1.2
percentage points, but the share with stocks directly or indirectly owned was up by 3.9 percentage points.

        6.2 Rates of Return
        Table 6 shows average annual real rates of return for both gross assets and net worth by race and
ethnicity over the period from 1983 to 2016. Results are based on the average portfolio composition over
the period and assume that all households receive the same rate of return by period and asset type.
Though there is some evidence reported in Section 3 above that white households receive higher returns
on some assets, particularly homes, than black households, there is no systematic evidence that this is the
case across all asset classes. Moreover, Gittleman and Wolff (2004) also concluded that rates of return
were similar for the two groups, at least for the 1984-1994 period. 18

        It is first of interest to look at the results for all households (see Appendix Table 1 for the source
data). The overall average annual rate of return on gross assets rose from 2.32 percent in the 1983-1989
period to 3.01 percent in the 1989-2001 period and then fell slightly to 3.10 percent in the 2001-2007
period before plummeting to -5.98 percent over the Great Recession (2007-2010). This was followed by a
substantial recovery to 4.60 percent over years 2010 to 2013 and then to 5.42 percent over 2013-2016.

18
  If whites, say, receive a higher return on their stock holdings than, say blacks, and/or experience higher
appreciation on their homes, then the estimated rate of return for whites on the basis of this assumption will be biased
downward and that for blacks biased upward. As a consequence, in the decomposition analysis discussed below,
capital appreciation will be understated for whites and overstated for blacks and correspondingly savings will be
overstated for whites and understated for blacks.




                                                                                                                    15
         [Table 6 about here]
         As shown in Appendix Table 1, the largest declines in asset prices over the years 2007 to 2010
occurred for residential real estate and the category businesses and non-home real estate. The value of
financial assets, including stocks, bonds, and other financial securities, registered an annual nominal rate
of return of “only” -1.33 percent because interest rates on corporate and foreign bonds continued to
remain strong over these years. The value of pension accounts had a -0.20 percent annual nominal rate of
return, reflecting the mixture of bonds and stocks held in pension accounts. From 2010 to 2013, all asset
classes with the exception of liquid assets made a robust recovery. This was led by financial assets which
recorded a 11.6 percent annual nominal return and businesses and non-home real estate, which
experienced a 7.4 percent annual nominal rate of return. Returns on these assets, again with the exception
of liquid assets, remained strong in 2013-2016.

         The average annual real rate of return on net worth among all households also increased from
3.31 percent in the first period to 3.97 percent in the second and then to 4.04 percent in the third before
falling off sharply to -6.81 percent in the 2007-2010 period. Once again, there was a strong recovery to
5.91 percent in the 2010-2013 period and 6.46 percent in 2013-2016. It is first of note that the annual
returns on net worth were uniformly higher – by about one percentage point – than those of gross assets
over the first three periods and the last two periods when asset prices were rising. However, in the 2007-
2010 period, the opposite was the case, with the annual return on net worth about one percentage point
lower than that on gross assets. These results illustrate the effect of leverage, raising the return when
asset prices rise and lowering the return when asset prices fall. Over the full 1983-2016 period, the
annual return on net worth was 0.84 percentage points higher than that on gross assets.

        There are striking differences in rates of return by race and ethnicity. The highest returns on
gross assets were registered by white households except for the 2001-2007 period. In the 1983-1989,
1989-2001, and again the 2010-2013 periods, returns for blacks and Hispanics were quite a bit lower than
for whites and in a virtual tie between the two groups. In the 2001-2007 period, Hispanics registered the
highest returns, followed by whites and blacks who in this case were in a virtual tie. In 2013-2016, whites
had the highest return on gross assets but the differential between them and the two minorities was very
small (because of a sharp rise in house prices). Years 2007 to 2010 saw negative rates of return for all
three groups but they were highest (least negative) for whites, followed by blacks and then Hispanics.
Over the full 1983-2016 period, the average annual return on gross assets for white households was 0.76
percentage points greater than that of black households and 0.72 percentage points greater than that of
Hispanics. The differences reflected the greater share of high yield investment assets like stocks in the
portfolios of whites and the greater share of housing in the portfolio of the two minorities.

         This pattern is generally reversed when we look at returns on net worth. In this case, in the first
three periods and the last two when asset prices were rising, higher returns were recorded by the two
minority groups than whites but in the 2007-2010 period, when asset prices were declining, minorities
registered lower (that is, more negative) rates of return than whites. The exception was the first period
when African-Americans had the lowest return, though Hispanics enjoyed a higher return than whites.
The reasons were the substantial spread in returns on gross assets between whites and the two minority
groups – over one percentage point – and the relatively low debt-net worth ratio of black households
(24.8 percent), which mitigated the leverage effect.

        Differences in returns between whites and minorities were quite substantial in some years. In the
2001-2007 period, the average return on net worth was 6.00 percent for blacks, 6.51 percent for
Hispanics, and only 3.87 percent for whites – a difference of 2.13 percentage points between blacks and
whites and of 2.64 percentage points between Hispanics and whites. The spread was less over years 2010
to 2013, only 0.98 and 1.20 percentage points, respectively, and over years 2013 to 2016, 2.21 and 2.01



                                                                                                           16
percentage points, respectively. The smaller differences in 2010-2013 compared to 2001-2007 were due
to the much higher returns on the gross assets of whites than of the two minority groups in the later
period. However, in the 2013-2016 period, returns were only modestly higher for whites than either
blacks or Latinos. On the other hand, over years 2007 to 2010, when asset prices declined, the return on
net worth was -6.57 percent for whites, -9.76 percent for blacks, and -10.61 percent Hispanics – a
differential of 3.18 percentage points in favor of whites relative to blacks and 4.04 percentage points of
whites relative to Hispanics. The spread in rates of return between white households on the one hand and
minority households on the other reflects the much higher leverage of the minority groups. In 2007, for
example, the debt-net worth ratio of black households was 0.553 and that of Hispanics was 0.511 while
that of white households was only 0.181 (see Table 2).

         The huge negative return on net worth of both blacks and Latinos was largely responsible for the
precipitous drop in their mean net worth between 2007 and 2010, as we shall see below. This factor, in
turn, was due to the steep drop in housing prices and their very high leverage. Likewise, the very high
return on net worth of the two minorities over the 2001-2007 period played a large role in explaining the
robust advance of their mean net worth, despite the sluggish growth in their income. This in turn, was a
result of their high leverage coupled with the boom in housing prices. However, somewhat puzzling is the
fact that the rate of return on net worth of the minority groups was very high over years 2010 to 2013 – in
fact, the second highest of any period – and yet their wealth stagnated over these years. We shall return to
this issue below with a more formal decomposition.

         The substantial differential in returns on net worth between whites and the two minority groups
(three to four percentage points lower) helps explain why the wealth differential rose sharply between
2007 and 2010 despite the fact that income differentials changed relatively little (actually, the ratio of
mean income between Hispanics and whites rose over these years). Likewise the variation in rates of
return over the 2001-2007 period (a spread of over 2 percentage points in favor of the minority groups)
helps account for the relative gains in mean wealth among the two minority groups despite no change in
the gap in mean incomes (though the ratio of median income between blacks and whites did advance
from 0.57 to 0.60 and that between Hispanics and whites from 0.54 to 0.70). The higher rate of return of
the two minorities relative to white households over years 2010 to 2013 also helps account for the
relative constancy in the mean wealth gap despite the widening of the income differential. From 2013 to
2016, the racial and ethnic income gaps narrowed, as did the wealth gap, though particularly for
Hispanics relative to whites. I return to these issues below.

        6.3 Decomposition Analysis
        What are the factors that affect both movements in mean wealth and those of wealth differences
between groups? To analyze these trends, I conduct a decomposition analysis of wealth trends into a
savings, capital gains, and net wealth transfer components. I begin with the basic wealth relationship as
established in Wolff (1999):

(1)    ΔWt ≡ Wt - Wt-1 = rtWt-1 + stYt + Gt.

where Wt = net worth (in constant dollars) at time t, r = real rate of return on wealth, Y* = household
income net of capital gains and property income (in constant dollars), 19 s = savings rate out of gross
income Y* (not disposable income), and G = net inheritances and gifts (in constant dollars).


19
  Though the standard SCF income measure includes realized capital gains, this component as well as property
income, is excluded here since it is already partially captured in the term rtWt-1.




                                                                                                               17
        On the basis of Equation (1), the change in wealth over a period can be decomposed into capital
revaluation (existing wealth multiplied by the rate of return), savings, and net intergenerational transfers.
The analysis will be divided into six sub-periods: 1983-1989, 1989-2001, 2001-2007, 2007-2010, 2010-
2013, and 2013-2016.

         The same decomposition can be used for mean wealth by racial/ethnic group. For my inequality
analysis, I will consider changes over time in the ratio of mean wealth between black and white
households on the one hand and that between Hispanic and white households on the other. I can then also
determine what portion of the change in this ratio is due to capital gains and what portion is due to
savings and net wealth transfers. It should be noted that race/ethnicity remains constant over the lifetime
for an individual but once again since this category is based on the household head, changes in marital
status may affect the classification of a household over time.

         There are several important methodological issues regarding the implementation of this model
that should be addressed before the actual results are shown.
         6.3.1 Aggregate wealth changes
         Let us first consider changes in aggregate household wealth from time t to t+1. Wt is the total
wealth held by households living in the U.S. at time t and Wt+1 is the total wealth held by households
living in the U.S. at time t+1. If this were a closed economy, then generally speaking the only sources of
change, ΔWt, would be from savings and capital appreciation. However, there may be some “leakages”
and additions for a few reasons. First, a household could make a charitable contribution, which would
subtract from current household wealth. Second, someone could die in this time interval and pay estate
taxes or leave a charitable bequest. However, bequests from the decedent to a living individual would not
change aggregate household wealth. Likewise gifts from one person to another would not alter aggregate
household wealth.
         Third, there may also be outflows if an American resident emigrates from the U.S. and takes
wealth out of the U.S. over this interval. Fourth, there may be additions to the stock of household wealth
if immigrants bring new wealth in. This issue may be particularly germane for Latino households during
the 1980s when there was a large influx of Mexicans and Central Americans into the U.S. However, if
these effects are small, then changes in aggregate wealth are due generally to only savings and capital
gains on wealth at time t (see equation 1). 20

         The situation is different when one considers mean household wealth. In this case, the death of a
person living alone will reduce the household count and, if the estate is fully given to other individuals,
raise mean household wealth. (The death of a married spouse, on the other hand, will not affect the
household count.) New households may also form over a time period. If a married couple gets divorced,
the household count would increase by one. If two individuals living on their own get married, on the
other hand, the household count would go down by one. Of course, if two individuals living with their
parents wed, this will increase the household count by one. Likewise, a single leaving a parental home
and setting up his or her own home will increase the household count.

        Another source of change in mean wealth is that over time a given group of households gets
older (“ages”) and, normally, their wealth rises. A comparison of mean wealth in the two years would

20
  Zucman (2013) presented convincing evidence that substantial wealth was transferred from domestic accounts to
foreign ones over time (“offshoring”). In principle, offshoring should not present a problem for the SCF data since
the SCF asks questions to domestic respondents about asset holdings in foreign accounts. This problem appears more
germane to aggregate data like the Financial Accounts of the United States since these accounts are based on only
domestically held assets.




                                                                                                                18
thus reflect not only this aging process but the entry of new households into the population. Of course,
new household entrants over a time period are likely to be relatively young, so that it is likely that the age
distribution of households tends to remain relatively constant over time. However, if this is not the case,
it is possible that the decomposition in equation (1) will be biased. Below I shall incorporate changes in
the age distribution of households into the decomposition analysis. 21

         6.3.2. Gifts and inheritances
         The SCF contains several questions on (inter-vivos) gifts and inheritances received as well as
gifts given to others and donations made to non-profits and other charitable organizations. Questions on
inheritances and gifts are asked in two different ways. First, there are several questions on what are
called "general wealth transfers." These questions presumably refer to any type of gift or inheritance.
Second, there are specific questions on inheritances and gifts of real estate and businesses. These are
asked in the sections of the questionnaire which deal specifically with the value of homes, other
properties, and businesses. The recall or recollection method is likely to have under-reporting problems
and estimates of inheritances reported below are very likely to be biased downward. However, it is
difficult to ascertain whether there is a systematic bias in under-reporting by wealth class, by income
class, or by demographic characteristics of the respondent. Net wealth transfers are defined as gifts and
inheritances received minus gifts and donations given. The data are available in the SCF from 1989
onward. 22

         6.4 Decomposition results
         Results shown in Table 7 indicate that capital revaluation generally explained the bulk of the
change in overall mean net worth, NW, by race/ethnicity. Over the 1983-1989 period , the mean net
worth of white households gained $67,000 (in 2016 dollars). Capital appreciation on their wealth
holdings in 1983 by itself would have led to a $70,600 increase in their average wealth holdings, thus
accounting for 105 percent of its actual change (Panel B). For blacks, the corresponding figure was 280
percent and for Hispanics 106 percent. Over 1989-2001, the figures were, respectively, 131 percent, 285
percent, and 139 percent. In the 2001-2007 period, while capital revaluation accounted for 133 percent of
the net addition to the mean wealth of white households, it contributed only 75 percent to that of black
households and 59 percent to Hispanics. From 2007 to 2010, average wealth among white households
lost $88,900 and capital losses by themselves would have caused their mean holdings to decline by
$135,100, more than fully accounting for the actual loss in mean wealth. In contrast, among blacks,
capital losses accounted for 78 percent of the actual reduction in their mean holdings and among
Hispanics, even less, at 57 percent. From 2010 to 2013, there was very little change of mean net worth
for the three groups according to the SCF data, and capital gains and savings offset each other in the
three cases. From 2013 to 2016, the mean NW of white households rose by $199,500, with capital gains
contributing 71 percent. Among black and Hispanic households, capital gains accounted for 65 percent
and 44 percent, respectively.
         [Table 7 about here]
         Net wealth transfers were generally relatively small in dollar terms in each of the five periods for
all three groups. 23 The residual is then computed as the change in net worth minus capital appreciation

21
  Another possible, more subtle, issue is that since households are classified according to the age of the household
head, a death of the household head may change the age class of the surviving spouse over the period.
22
   Inheritances and gifts are recorded in five-year intervals. In the 1989 SCF, for example, wealth transfers cover
years 1985 through 1989. I use this information to estimate net wealth transfers received over the period from 1983
to 1989.
23
   Generally speaking, for the population as a whole, total gifts given would equal total gifts received. However,
there are two offsetting factors in the computation of net wealth transfers. First, since the simulations are performed




                                                                                                                     19
and minus net wealth transfers (see equation 1). The residual is presumably mainly savings. Its
contribution to wealth growth was generally much lower than that of capital gains. In the first period,
1983-1989, it accounted for virtually none of the growth in mean wealth for whites and Hispanics and -
$1,100 out of the $3,700 change for blacks. In the second period, 1989-2001, the residual made a
negative contribution for all three groups, which partially offset the positive contribution of capital
appreciation. Over years 2001 to 2007 capital gains accounted for over 100 percent of wealth gains made
by white households while savings made a negative 41.2 percent contribution. For blacks and Hispanics,
in contrast, savings were positive, accounting for 38.4 percent and 39.1 percent of wealth gains over the
period.

         Mean wealth fell for all three groups during the next period, 2007 to 2010. For white households,
the residual amounted to $48,500 but capital losses were $135,100, resulting in a $88,900 net decline in
mean wealth. Black households suffered a $46,400 loss in mean wealth, with capital losses accounting
for 77.7 percent of the decline and the residual for another 12.8 percent (net wealth transfers were
negative and made a 9.5 percent contribution). Among Hispanics, mean wealth dropped by a staggering
$94,800, with 56.7 percent due to capital losses and 39.7 percent to the residual (presumably, mainly
dissavings). For years 2010 to 2013, the change in mean wealth was quite small for all three groups
according to the SCF data. Capital gains made a positive contribution but this was largely offset by a
negative residual. Wealth then rose for all three groups from 2013 to 2016. Among whites 70.7 percent
of the gain was attributable to capital gains and 28.2 percent to the residual. Among blacks, the
respective figures were 64.6 percent and 24.7 percent, and among Hispanics 44.4 and 53.3 percent.

         6.4.1 Decomposing changes in wealth inequality
         The next step is to decompose changes in wealth inequality over time into three components:
capital revaluation, net wealth transfers, and a residual. As far as I can tell, there is no simple analytical
decomposition of equation (1) into these three components. As a result, the technique I use is to add the
change in the between-group wealth ratio emanating from each component to the actual wealth ratio. The
difference between the original wealth ratio and the newly re-computed simulated change is then the
measure of the contribution of that component to the change in the net worth ratio. As might be apparent,
the three components do not necessarily add up to the actual change in the wealth ratio over the period.

         For the most part, as shown in Table 6, rates of return on net worth have been higher for
minorities than whites. As a result, the effect of adding capital gains to initial wealth should have the
effect of lowering wealth ratios between whites and the two minority groups. As shown in Table 8, the
ratio of mean wealth between African-Americans and whites dropped modestly from 0.188 to 0.168, or
by 0.021 between 1983 and 1989. Of the 0.021 decline in the ratio, 0.007 or 33 percent was due to the
higher relative contribution of capital gains for white households, reflecting the relatively higher rate of
return received by white households compared to black households (this period is a bit of an anomaly);
0.014 or 67 percent was attributable to the relatively higher net wealth transfers of white households
(actually less negative net wealth transfers); and 0.003 or 13 percent was due to the relatively higher
residual (presumably savings) of white households. From 1989 to 2001, the mean wealth ratio between
blacks and whites fell again, from 0.168 to 0.142 or by 0.025. Of this decline, 129 percent could be
attributed to the difference in net wealth transfers (positive for whites but negative for blacks) and 84
percent to the higher residual (savings) of whites, but this was offset somewhat by the slightly higher rate

over time, it is possible for an inheritance to be received over the period with no corresponding negative entry since
the household is no longer in the population. Second, donations to charities are subtracted in the calculation of net
wealth transfers received. The net wealth transfer figures are adjusted so that the total gifts reported received in a
given year for the full population are equal to the total gifts reported given (aligned to the greater of the two figures).




                                                                                                                        20
of return on the net worth of black households, which explained -35.2 percent. Between 2001 and 2007,
the wealth ratio reversed course and increased from 0.142 to 0.188 or by 0.046. Of this, the higher
residual of black households was the most important factor, accounting for 103 percent of the increase.
The higher rate of return received by black households relative to white households (2.1 percentage point
gap) explained another 43 percent of the increase, while the higher net wealth transfers among white
households (again positive for whites but negative for blacks) offset the rise by 28 percent.
         [Table 8 about here]
         Over years 2007 to 2010 the ratio of mean wealth between whites and blacks reversed once again
and collapsed from 0.188 to 0.144 or by 0.045. In this case, the rate of return was 3.18 percentage points
higher (that is, less negative) for white households than black households and this factor accounted for 39
percent of the decline. However, though the gap in returns was quite high, the principal factor accounting
for the large drop in the racial wealth gap was the discrepancy in the residual (savings), which explained
42 percent of the change (the remainder was due to the less negative net wealth transfers for whites
compared to blacks). The racial wealth ratio continued to fall from 2010 to 2013 (by 0.015). In this case,
the gap in the residual made the largest contribution, 113 percent. This was offset in part by the gap in
rates of return in favor of black households, 29 percent. The higher net wealth transfers of white
households (they were again positive for whites but negative for blacks) also added 44 percent to the rise
in the net worth ratio. From 2013 to 2016 the racial wealth ratio increased a bit, by 0.016. In this case,
differences in rates of return would have caused the ratio to rise by 0.009 but this was offset by the
higher residual of white households, which caused a 0.034 drop in the ratio.

         The pattern of results for Hispanics was different from that for blacks except for the 2001-2007
and 2007-2010 periods. Between 1983 and 1989, there was virtually no change in the Hispanic-white
wealth gap (the black-white ratio fell by 11 percent). From 1989 to 2001, the wealth ratio increased by a
very modest 0.007, with gaps in capital appreciation and savings making a positive contribution and
differences in net wealth transfers (positive for white households but negative for Hispanics) offsetting
these two effects. Wealth growth among Hispanic households was a stunning 82 percent from 2001 to
2007. Of the increase, capital gains made up 59 percent (because of the very high 6.51 percent per year
rate of return) and the residual 39 percent (with 2.4 percent from net wealth transfers).

         Hispanic mean wealth then collapsed by 48 percent from 2007 to 2010. Capital losses in this case
accounted for the bulk of the drop (57 percent) and the residual for 40 percent (with the other 3.6 percent
from negative net wealth transfers). The very large negative rate of return on the wealth holdings of
Hispanics (-10.61 percent per year) was not enough to explain the full decline in their wealth. As a result,
the residual was highly negative (it was moderately negative for black households). Over years 2010 to
2013, the mean wealth of Hispanic households remained largely unchanged, with positive capital gains
and offsetting negative savings. Hispanic wealth then took off from 2013 to 2016, growing by 64
percent, with 44 percent due to capital gains and 53 percent to the residual.

        The ratio of mean wealth between Hispanics and whites climbed by 0.089 from 2001 to 2007.
The higher rate of return for Hispanic households (2.64 percentage point gap) explained a third of the
increase, while the higher residual among Hispanic households accounted for the majority -- 84 percent
(the sum is greater than one). Between 2007 and 2010 the mean worth ratio reversed, as it did for black
households, and collapsed by 0.107. In this case, the return was 4.04 percentage points less negative
among whites and this factor explained 28 percent of the decline. However, once again, the primary
factor was the difference in the residual (savings), which accounted for 58 percent of the change (with
3.4 percent due to differences in the net wealth transfers). The wealth ratio was basically unchanged from
2010 to 2013, with differences in capital appreciation making a positive contribution and being offset by
differences in savings. However, from 2013 to 2016, the Hispanic-white wealth ratio climbed by 0.040.
Both differences in capital gains and savings made positive contributions but the lion’s share came from



                                                                                                         21
the residual (127 percent) and differences in capital gains contributed only 23 percent.

        6.4.2 The Age Distribution and the Racial Wealth Gap
        There was a dramatic aging of households over years 1983 to 2016 (see Table 9). Among white
households, the share under age 45 fell from 49 to 33 percent while the proportion aged 55 and over
increased from 36 to 50 percent. 24 Their mean age climbed from 47.4 to 53.6 and their median age from
45 to 55. Aging was a little less dramatic among black and Hispanic households. Among blacks, the share
under age 45 dropped from 53 to 41 percent while the proportion aged 55 and over rose from 31 to 38
percent; and their mean age went from 45.4 to 49.3 and their median age from 43 to 49. Among
Hispanics, the proportion under age 45 fell from 62 to 51 percent while the share 55 and over picked up
from 22 to 26 percent. Their mean age advanced from 41.8 to 45.8 and their median age from 39 to 44.
The time trend in the age distribution of Hispanics living in the U.S. partly reflects trends in immigration.
There was a large influx of young Mexicans and Central Americans into the U.S. during the 1980s and
1990s, and the proportion of Hispanic-Americans under the age of 45 increased from 62 percent in 1983
to 65 percent in 2001 while the share aged 55 and over fell from 22 to 16 percent. Immigration softened
after 2001 and the share under age 45 fell off to 51 percent in 2016 and the percentage aged 55 and over
advanced from 16 to 26 percent.

         Differences in the age distribution are quite pronounced across the three groups. White
households were the oldest, African-Americans were in the middle, and Hispanics were the youngest. In
2001, for example, the median age was 48 for white households, 43 for black households and 40 for
Hispanics. The share of households under age 45 amounted to 65 percent for Hispanics, 53 percent for
blacks and 41 percent for whites, while the proportion aged 55 and over was 38 percent for whites, 26
percent for blacks, and only 16 percent for Hispanics.

         Differences in the age distribution explain part of the differential in mean wealth holdings
between groups and time trends over time since older households hold more wealth, on average, than
younger ones. Whereas there is a straightforward analytical decomposition of the difference in mean
wealth between groups into an age effect and a wealth difference effect, 25 there is none available, as far
as I can tell, for the ratio in mean wealth between groups. As a result, the analysis is conducted by
standardizing the age distribution across groups and then re-computing the mean wealth for that group on
the basis of the group’s mean wealth by age group. Three choices are used to standardize the age


24
     Households are classified into age group on the basis of the age of the household head.
           25
                The mean wealth of group i is given by

           Μ1 = ∑ µi1 a i1
                g

where Μ1 is the mean wealth of group 1, µi1 is the mean wealth of age class i in group 1, a i1 is the percentage of
households in group 1 in age class i, and g is the number of age classes. Then

          Μ1 - Μ2 = ∑ (Δµi) a*i     + ∑ µ*i Δai ,

where a*i is the average share of households in the two groups in age class i, µ*i is the average wealth in the two
groups in age class i, and Δ is the difference between the two groups.




                                                                                                                      22
distribution: (1) group 1’s age distribution, (2) group 2’s age distribution, and (3) the average age
distribution of the two groups.

         Results are shown in Table 10. Standardizing the ratio of mean wealth between African-
Americans and whites by the age distribution of white households raises the mean wealth of the former
since white households are, on average, older than black ones. The ratio increases by 0.031 in 1983 and
0.018 in 2016. It is interesting that there does not appear to be a clear relation between the degree to
which the wealth ratio is increased by standardizing the age distribution and the difference in mean or
median age between whites and blacks. On average, over the seven years, differences in the age
distribution between black and white households (that is, the fact, that black household are on average
younger than white households) accounted for 10.6 percent of the overall black-white wealth ratio. On
net, the change in the mean wealth ratio between black and white households is augmented by age
standardization. For the whole 1983-2016 period, while the actual wealth ratio fell by 0.044, the
standardized ratio fell more, by 0.057.

         Next, standardizing by the age distribution of black households lowers the wealth of white
households and once again raises the wealth ratio between the two groups. On average, over the seven
years, differences in the racial age distribution explained 11.1 percent of the overall black-white wealth
ratio. The change in the wealth ratio is lowered in some periods – 1983-1989 and 2007-2013 – but raised
in 1989-2001, 2001-2007, and 2013-2016. Over the whole period, the change in the mean wealth ratio
based on the standardized age distribution is slightly lower than the change in the actual wealth ratio -- -
0.042 versus -0.044. Finally, standardizing by the average age distribution of black and white households
once again raises the wealth ratio in all years. On average, differences in age distribution by race
explained 10.7 percent of the overall black-white wealth ratio. In this case, the standardized wealth ratio
falls by 0.049 from 1983 to 2016, compared to its actual decline of 0.044.

         Results are rather different for the ratio of mean wealth between Latinos and whites. However,
once again, standardizing the wealth ratio by the age distribution of Hispanic households, that of white
households, and the average age distribution raises the mean wealth ratio between the two groups in all
years compared to the actual wealth ratio. In this case on average over the seven years differences in the
age distribution between Latino and white households (that is, the fact that Latino household are on
average younger than white households) has a much greater effect than standardizing the racial age
distribution, accounting for about 40 percent of the overall Hispanic-white wealth ratio. Over the whole
1983-2016 period, standardizing by the age distribution of white households leads to a 0.083 jump in the
overall Latino-white net worth ratio, compared to the actual increase of 0.027. Standardizing by the
Latino age distribution results in a 0.053 rise and by the average age distribution a 0.070 increase.
Between 2001 and 2007 age standardization leads to a much greater jump in the ethnic wealth ratio and
from 2007 to 2013 a substantial plunge.

        6.4.3 The Racial/Ethnic Composition and overall wealth trends.
        How does the changing racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population affect trends in
overall household wealth? To answer this question, I standardize the racial/ethnic distribution for year
2001 (about the midpoint over the time series). I then reweight net worth in each year by the
corresponding 2001 share of households in each group and re-compute mean and median net worth and
the Gini coefficient. Results are shown in Table 11. Since the share of Hispanics rose sharply over the
years 1983 to 2016, from 3.5 to 11.3 percent of all households, and the share of black households
increased from 12.7 to 15.9 percent, reweighting decreases median and mean net worth in years before
2001 and increases them in years after 2001 since Hispanic and black households hold less wealth than
whites. The reweighted results still indicate strong growth in both median and mean wealth from 1983 to
2007, a substantial collapse in median wealth from 2007 to 2016, and a positive but relatively slow



                                                                                                         23
 increase in mean wealth over the later period.

          However, the rate of change of both median and mean net worth (NW) is higher with
 standardization by race and ethnicity than in actuality. Standardized mean NW gained 140 percent
 between 1983 and 2016, compared to a 113 percent rise in actual mean NW, and standardized median
 NW showed a 22.4 percent gain, compared to a 2.9 percent fall in actual median NW. The reason is that
 a rising share of minorities in the total population lowers the growth in mean and median wealth, ceteris
 paribus, since these groups hold lower wealth than white households. If the racial/ethnic composition had
 remained constant over time, both mean and median NW would have grown faster than in actuality.

          Standardizing the population weights on the basis of the 2001 racial and ethnic composition
 makes a very small difference in estimated Gini coefficients. Standardization gives greater weight to
 minority and hence poorer households before 2001 and lesser weight to white and hence richer
 households. The former effect seems to dominate for the Gini coefficient calculation in 1983 but the
 latter effect seems to dominate for 2001. After 2001, standardization gives greater weight to richer, white
 households and lower weight to minorities. In this case, the former effect appears to dominate in 2010,
 2013 and 2016, lowering the Gini coefficient. Over the full 30-year period, the Gini coefficient
 standardized for changes in the racial/ethnic composition advances by 0.069, a bit less than the actual
 increase of 0.078.

 7. Including retirement wealth in the household portfolio lowers the wealth gap.
          In the last stage of the analysis I add in defined benefit (DB) pension wealth and Social Security
 wealth to the household portfolio. How does the inclusion of these two components affect the estimated
 racial/ethnic wealth gap and its trend over time? The SCF provides considerable detail on both pension
 plans and Social Security contributions. The SCF also gives detailed information on expected pension
 and Social Security benefits for both husband and wife.

            The imputation of both defined benefit pension wealth (DBW) and Social Security wealth (SSW)
involves a large number of steps. These are discussed in detail in Appendix 1. As with the concept of household
net worth, there are alternative formulations of both DBW and SSW and none is necessarily the “correct”
measure (see Wolff, 1992, for further discussion of this point). I have elected to use the standard gross measure,
since it is the conventional formulation. Kennickell and Sunden (1999), for example, use net Social Security
wealth, the difference between the gross value of expected Social Security benefits and the discounted value of
future Social Security contributions. This formulation is also quite legitimate. The distributional effect of net
SSW is likely to be smaller than that of gross SSW since its average value will be smaller. I prefer to use gross
SSW since this is the standard concept and its use will make it easier to compare my results with those of the
vast majority of other research on the topic.

         It should also be noted that the definition of DBW and SSW is based on the conventional “on-going
concern” treatment. It is assumed that employees continue to work at their place of employment until their
expected date of retirement. An alternative is to use the accrual value in which DBW and SSW are valued as
of the current year on the basis of work experience up to that date only. The accrual method will produce
lower values of both DBW and SSW for current workers. The accrual method and the on-going concern
treatment represent two extremes in the valuation of DBW and SSW. The latter treatment, in particular,
relies on the assumptions that (1) the firm or organization remains in existence over time and (2) the
employee continues working at the enterprise.

        I define “non-pension wealth” NWX be as marketable household wealth (NW) minus defined
contribution wealth (DCW):
          (2) NWX = NW – DCW.



                                                                                                             24
Total pension wealth, PW, is given by:
        (3)   PW = DCW + DBW.
Private augmented wealth PAW is then defined as:
        (4)   PAW = NWX + PW.
        The term “private augmented wealth” is used to distinguish contributions to wealth from private
savings and employment contracts with both private and government employers from those of social
insurance provided by the state – notably, Social Security. Retirement wealth is defined as the sum of
pension and Social Security wealth:
          (5) RW = PW + SSW
  and augmented household wealth, AW, is given by
         (6) AW = NWX + PW + SSW.

         7.1 Time trends for all households
         My earlier work on the subject (Wolff, 2011), found that, not surprisingly, the addition of DBW and
SSW to the household portfolio reduces the measured wealth gap between minorities and whites. That is to
say, the ratio of AW between the two groups was higher than the ratio of NW. Moreover, the degree to
which the addition of DBW and SSW to standard NW lowered the wealth gap increased over years 1989 to
2007 (the analysis ended in 2007). The principal effect came from the addition of SSW. However, in the
earlier analysis, African-Americans and Hispanics were grouped into a single category Here, I present
separate estimates for African-Americans and Hispanics and update the empirical results to 2016.

         I begin the empirical analysis by looking at pension wealth for all households. One of the most
dramatic changes in the retirement income system over the last three decades or so has been the replacement
of many traditional DB plans with DC pensions. The first focus of this part is to analyze the effects of the
changeover in the pension system on the growth of pension wealth from 1989 to 2016. The picture that
unfolds is a precipitous drop in DB coverage among all households largely compensated by a sizeable
increase in DC coverage, at least until 2007 (see Table 12). Moreover, while mean pension wealth gained
rapidly in the 1990s, its growth slowed down considerably in the years 2001 to 2007, showed an absolute
decline over years 2007 to 2010 but a recovery in 2013 and again in 2016.
         [Table 12 about here]
         The share of all households with DC pension accounts more than doubled over the years 1989 to
2001, from 25.1 to 53.7 percent (see Panel A). The picture changed from 2001 to 2007 when there was
virtually no change in the DC coverage rate. Trends are different for DB pension wealth. The share with a
DB pension plan fell by 12 percentage points between 1989 and 2001. 26 There was little change from 2001
to 2007. The share of all households covered by either a DC or a DB plan increased from 58.6 to 67.5
percent between 1989 and 2001. However, from 2001 to 2007, the share declined by 0.6 percentage points.

        There were huge increases in the average holdings of DCW (DC pension wealth), with the average
value among all households increasing by a factor of 9.7 between 1989 and 2001 (see Table 13). The rise in
DCW slowed down from 2001 to 2007, with the mean increasing by (only) 22 percent. Opposite trends are
again evident for DBW. The mean rose by only 2.6 percent between 1989 and 2001. The years 2001 to 2007
again saw a small rise, 5.5 percent. Did the spread of DC type pension plans adequately compensate for the
decline in traditional DB pension coverage? Average pension wealth PW (the sum of DCW and DBW)


 26
   Figures on DBW and SSW cannot be estimated for households under age 47 in 1983 and, correspondingly, for all
 households as well. As a result, I show results for the period from 1989 to 2016 only.




                                                                                                             25
climbed by 80 percent from 1989 to 2001. 27 The growth in PW slowed down markedly from 2001 to 2007,
with mean PW up by 14.2 percent. Median PW among holders only did worse than mean PW from 1989 to
2001, rising 39 percent, but better than mean PW from 2001 to 2007, gaining 19 percent.
        [Table 13 about here]
        What happened over the Great Recession and its aftermath? From 2007 to 2010, the share of all
households with a DC account fell off by 1.2 percentage points and then another 1.1 percentage points from
2010 to 2013 as firms discontinued 401(k) plans and the like, start-ups of IRA plans slackened, and, in some
cases, workers closed down IRA accounts in response to the financial stress of the Great Recession. By
2013, the ownership share was down to 51.6 percent. However, there was a rebound of 3.0 percentage points
from 2013 to 2016, and the share with DC accounts reached 54.7 percent, slightly below its peak value in
2007. The DB coverage rate also fell off, by 7.5 percentage points from 2007 to 2010, down to 28 percent in
2010 but it then recovered to 35 percent in 2016, about the same as in 2007. The share covered by either a
DC or a DB plan also dropped, by 2.1 percentage points from 2007 to 2010, but then recovered to 67 percent
in 2016, a little above its level in 2007.

         Mean DCW, somewhat surprisingly, continued to expand over the Great Recession, by 6.5 percent..
It then expanded by another 25.7 percent to $119,100 in 2016. Mean DBW was down by 21.9 percent from
2007 to 2010, but then was up by 49.0 percent from 2010 to 2016 to $82,700. As a result, mean PW first fell
by 6.0 percent from 2007 to 2010 and then recovered by 34.3 percent, to $201,800 in 2016. Over the whole
period, 1989 to 2016, mean PW advanced 160 percent. This compares to a 102 percent gain in net worth.
The growth in PW was led by DCW, which climbed almost ten-fold. DBW, on the other hand, rose by 26.3
percent. Median PW among holders of PW wealth only grew slower, 69 percent. It too showed robust gains
from 1989 to 2007, a sharp drop from 2007 to 2010, and then a recovery from 2010 to 2016. In this case, the
2016 value was greater than the previous 2007 peak.

        Mean SSW rose by 47.7 percent from 1989 to 2007, dipped by 8.1 percent over the Great Recession,
and rebounded by 26.6 percent from 2010 to 2016. All told, it advanced by 72.0 percent from 1989 to 2016,
about half as fast as mean PW. Median SSW grew a bit slower, 62.4 percent, from 1989 to 2016. Mean
retirement wealth (RW) had a similar pattern. It increased robustly, by 69.5 percent, from 1989 to 2007,
dropped 7.1 percent from 2007 to 2010, and then recovered by 30.2 percent from 2010 to 2016. Over the
whole time span, it more than doubled. Median RW, on the other hand, saw only a 68.4 percent gain.

        As shown in Table 14, mean NWX (net worth excluding DCW) among all households gained 58
percent over the whole time period from 1989 to 2016. With DCW now included, mean NW showed a
higher advance, 86 percent, to $667,900 in 2016. Mean PAW (net worth plus DBW) grew a bit more slowly,
77 percent, because of the relatively smaller gains in DB pension wealth. All told, mean AW rose 76 percent
over these years to $973,400 in 2016. This increase was somewhat lower than that of net worth. For all four
variables, there were robust gains from 1989 to 2007, a sharp fall off over years 2007 to 2010 (from 15 to 20
percent), and then a recovery from 2010 to 2016 (around 30 percent). All four variables showed a net
increment from 2007 to 2016, though percentage gains were fairly low, varying from 3 to 20 percent.
        [Table 14 about here]
          Median values displayed quite a different pattern. Over the full time span, 1989 to 2016, median
  NWX collapsed by 38 percent. Even with DCW, median NW still showed an absolute loss of 9.3 percent,
  down to $78,100 in 2016. Median PAW also dropped by 9.9 percent. However, because median SSW
  was up, median AW showed a positive gain of 27.0 percent. For all four variables, the maximum value
  was reached in 2007. This was followed by a sharp drop-off from 2007 to 2010, though it was less severe
  for median AW, -26.9 percent, than for median NW, -43.9 percent. All four variables showed a recovery

   Median pension values among all households are strongly affected by the share of households with pension wealth
 and, as a result, are not shown here.




                                                                                                               26
from 2010 to 2016, though as noted above they were still down from their 2007 peak. Median AW did
better than median NW, down only 7.6 percent compared to a 34.2 percent plunge for median NW.

         Table 15 shows changes in the portfolio composition of AW. There was an almost steady rise in
the share of DCW in AW, from 2.2 percent in 1989 to 12.2 percent in 2016. In contrast, the share of
DBW fell, from 11.8 to 8.5 percent. Together, PW rose from 14.0 to 20.7 percent. SSW, on the other
hand, remained more or less constant as a share of AW – about 23 or 24 percent. Adding the two, we find
that RW rose by 6.2 percentage points from 37.4 to 43.6 percent. Consequently, the share of NWX in
AW fell by 6.2 percentage points, from 62.6 to 56.4 percent. Since DCW rose in relative terms over this
period, NW increased as a share of AW – by 3.8 percentage points to 68.6 percent. PAW as a proportion
of AW remained fairly constant as the relative rise in NW offset the relative decline in DBW.
       [Table 15 about here]
         As shown in Table 16, the Gini coefficient for PW remained steady over time and was almost
exactly the same in 2016 as in 1989 (0.798). The Gini coefficient for SSW was much lower than that for
PW and actually dropped a bit over these years, to 0.354 in 2016. The inequality of RW is essentially a
weighted average of that of PW and SSW. 28 In 2016, its Gini coefficient was 0.531 However, the
inequality of RW rose over these years, by 0.046 Gini points, because of the relative increase in higher
inequality PW than low inequality SSW. The inequality of NWX escalated over this period by 0.071 Gini
points to 0.905. When DCW is added, the Gini coefficient for NW comes down by 0.028 Gini points to
0.877 in 2016 since DCW tends to be more concentrated among the middle classes than NWX.
Moreover, the upturn in NW inequality is moderated, rising by 0.049 from 1989 to 2016.
       [Table 16 about here]
         The further addition of DBW to create PAW further lowers the Gini coefficient, by 0.031 to
0.846 in 2016 since DB entitlements tend to be concentrated in the middle of the wealth distribution.
However, the addition of DBW actually further intensifies the rise of inequality by 0.054 Gini points
because of its gradual diminution since 1989. Adding SSW to PAW to create AW has an even bigger
effect on lowering measured inequality – in this case by 0.135 points to 0.711. In similar fashion, adding
SSW to NWX lowers the Gini coefficient by 0.189 whereas adding PW to NWX reduces it by only
0.059. Thus the major equalizing effect of RW comes from SSW, not PW. Adding SSW to PAW lessens
the rise of wealth inequality to from 0.054 to 0.048 points. Likewise, adding SSW to NWX decreases the
rise in the Gini coefficient from 0.071 to 0.040, whereas adding PW to NWX lessens it to 0.054.

        7.2. Trends by race/ethnicity
        It is at once evident that whites were much more likely to have a pension plan than minorities. In
2016, 71.8 percent of white households held some form of pension wealth (see Table 12), compared to
only 50.2 of African-American households and 39.5 percent of Hispanic households. The difference in
the overall pension wealth ownership rate was 21.6 percentage points between whites and blacks and
32.3 between whites and Latinos. The gap in the ownership of DC plans was 25.6 percentage points
between whites and blacks and 28.7 between whites and Hispanics. The racial gap in entitlements to DB
plans was much smaller, 11.0 percentage points, as was the ethnic gap, 18.7 percentage points.

        The disparity in DC pension ownership widened considerably over time, as the take-up rate for
DC plans was much greater among white workers. DC ownership among whites expanded from 26.2
percent in 1989 to 59.6 percent in 2016, while among African-Americans it grew from 15.8 to 34.0 and
among Latinos from 12.6 to 30.8 percent. The gap in participation in DC plans between whites and
African-Americans thus rose from 10.5 to 25.6 percentage points and that between whites and Latinos
from 13.6 to 28.8. In contrast, the racial and ethnic gap in participation in DB plans fell quite
substantially over these years, as participation plummeted among all groups. As a result, the racial and
28
     There is also an interaction terms in the decomposition of RW into a PW term and a SSW terms.




                                                                                                        27
ethnic gap in the share of households with PW (either DC or DB) was about the same in 2016 as in 1989.

        Over time, from 1989 to 2016, mean PW in real terms rose for all three groups but more so for
whites than minorities – 184.8 percent for whites versus 87.2 percent for blacks and 115.5 percent for
Latinos. Mean SSW was also up for all three groups but in this case more so for the two minorities – 70.3
percent for whites, 133.9 percent for blacks, and 114.0 percent for Hispanics. Similar trends are evident
for median SSW. It is also of note that for blacks and Hispanics mean SSW was substantially greater than
mean PW – by a factor about three in 2016 – whereas the two were about equal for white households.

         However, minority households also had a lot less wealth accumulated in their pension plans than
white households. In 2016 the average pension wealth of black households was only 30 percent that of
whites. The biggest gap was in DC wealth – a 17 percent ratio. The ratio in DB wealth was 0.50.
Hispanics were even worse off in terms of pension wealth, with a ratio of 0.22. The ratio in DCW was
lower, 0.18, while the ratio in DBW was higher, 0.26. It is also of note that minority households were
better off in terms of pension holdings than in net worth. The ratio in NW between black and white
households was 0.14, and that between Hispanics and whites was 0.19. 29

         Over time, the racial and ethnic gap in PW expanded, with the ratio of mean PW between blacks
and whites dropping from 45 percent in 1989 to 30 percent in 2016. There was little change in the ratio
of DBW over these years but the ratio of DCW fell from 0.22 to 0.17. The PW ratio between Hispanics
declined from 0.29 to 0.22, with the DBW ratio falling from 0.30 to 0.27 and the DCW ratio from 0.23 to
0.18. Minorities did quite a bit better in terms of SSW. Between 1989 and 2016, the ratio in mean SSW
between blacks and whites advanced from 0.44 to 0.60 and the ratio of median SSW from 0.37 to 0.56.
Over the same years, the ratio of mean SSW between Hispanics and whites grew from 48 to 0.60 and the
ratio of median SSW from 0.48 to 0.63. Time trends in RW reflect trends in both PW and SSW. The ratio
of mean RW between blacks and whites was about the same in 2016 as in 1989 because mean SSW grew
faster for the former but mean PW grew slower. However, the ratio of median RW advanced from 0.33
to 0.48. The story is very similar for Hispanics, with the ratio of mean RW between Hispanics and whites
about the same in 2016 as in 1989 and the ratio of median RW advancing from 0.40 to 0.50.

        Mean AW in real dollar terms rose for all three groups from 1989 to 2016 – 87.7 percent for
whites, 87.9 percent for blacks, and 112.3 percent for Hispanics. All three saw robust growth from 1989
to 2007 and then a marked slowdown from 2007 to 2016 (an actual decline in the case of Hispanics).
Median AW showed smaller real growth than mean AW over the 1989-2016 period. Over years 2007 to
2016, median AW was up only 3.1 percent for whites but down by 17.3 percent for blacks and by 9.4
percent for Latinos.

        Even larger differences exist for total wealth than for retirement wealth. The ratio of average AW
between blacks and whites was 0.27 in 2016, as was the ratio of median AW (see Table 14). The gap in
mean AW was about half the gap in mean net worth – a ratio of 0.27 compared to 0.14 -- but larger than
the gap in income, a ratio of 0.46. Results are similar for Hispanics. The ratio of mean AW between
Hispanics and whites was 0.28, and the ratio of median AW was almost identical. Once again, the
disparity in mean AW was smaller than that of mean NW but larger than that of income. The smaller gap
in AW than NW is attributable mainly to the equalizing effect of SSW.

        The ratio in mean AW between blacks and whites first climbed from 0.27 in 1989 to 0.30 in 2007
but then fell back to 0.27 in 2016 and the ratio of median AW went up even more, from 0.24 to 0.34, over

29
     Since NW includes DCW, the ratios of NWX between minorities and whites were even lower.




                                                                                                       28
the first period but then retreated to 0.27 in 2016. Similar trends are evident for mean NWX, mean NW,
and mean PAW. Results for Hispanics are similar. The ratio of mean AW between Hispanics and whites
advanced from 0.25 in 1989 to 0.33 in 2007 and then fell off to 0.28 in 2016, though higher than in 1989,
and that of median AW from 0.25 to 0.33 and then to 0.28 on 2016, also higher than in 1989. Mean NW
converged between the two groups (the ratio rising from 0.16 in 1989 to 0.19 in 2016). While PW
diverged between the two groups, SSW converged, largely explaining the overall trends in the AW ratio.

         Indeed, as shown in the bottom panel of Table 14, adding DCW to NWX makes very little
difference in the time trend of the overall black-white ratio of mean AW. Adding DBW has a larger
effect, increasing the ratio by 0.04 to 0.05. The largest effect derives from the inclusion of SSW, which
enlarges the ratio by 0.05 to 0.09, and this effect itself increases over time from 1989 to 2016. The impact
is even greater on the ratio of median AW between blacks and whites. In this case, the addition of SSW
augments the ratio by 0.22 to 0.28, and here again this effect generally rises over time. The results are
very similar for the ratio of AW between Hispanics and whites. The largest effect on raising the ratio of
mean AW comes from the addition of SSW (0.07 to 0.10) and, particularly, on the ratio of median AW
(0.23 to 0.31). In these two cases, however, there is no evidence that the effects rise over time.

        The most salient difference in the portfolio composition of AW between the two minority groups
and white households is the much higher share of SSW among the former (see Table 15). In 2016, the
proportion of SSW in AW was 20.4 percent for white households, 45.9 percent for African-Americans,
and 43.7 percent for Hispanics. Black households also had a higher share of PW in their portfolio than
whites – 23.3 versus 20.8 percent. The difference was due to the fact that the former had a greater share
of DBW than the latter – 15.5 versus 8.3 percent. DCW made up a greater percentage of AW for whites –
12.5 versus 7.8. Consequentially, RW loomed larger for blacks than whites -- 69.2 percent as against 41.2
percent – and NWX was consequently greater for whites than blacks – 58.8 versus 30.8 percent. The
differential in the share of SSW in AW between blacks and whites expanded over time from 14.4
percentage points in 1989 to 25.5 percentage points in 2016, while that of PW contracted from 9.7 to 2.5
percentage points and that of NWX from -24.0 to -28.0 percentage points.

         In 2016, the share of SSW in AW was 43.7 percent for Hispanics – much higher than for whites
but slightly lower than for blacks. On the other hand, Hispanics held a smaller portion of their wealth in
PW, particularly DCW, compared to whites -- 16.2 versus 20.8 percent. As a result, RW assumed a
greater proportion of AW for Hispanics than whites -- 59.9 as against 41.2 percent – and NWX a smaller
proportion – 40.1 versus 58.8 percent. The percentage point gap in SSW widened between 1989 and
2016 from 20.9 to 23.3, that in PW fell from 2.3 to -4.6, and that in RW narrowed from 23.1 to 18.7.

         Table 16 shows how the difference in portfolio composition plays out in inequality trends.
Inequality in NW was considerably greater among the two minority groups – mainly a reflection of the
higher share with zero or negative NW. In 2016, the Gini coefficient for NW among blacks was 0.972,
compared to 0.852among whites – a gap of 0.120. PW inequality was also higher among blacks – 0.832
and 0.765, respectively, a difference of 0.067. The inequality of SSW was about the same for the two
groups – Gini coefficients of 0.350 and 0.332, respectively. However, since SSW inequality was much
lower than PW inequality and SSW had a much greater weight in the portfolio of black households, the
Gini coefficient for RW was lower among the latter – a difference of 0.035. NWX inequality was much
higher among blacks than whites – a difference of 0.161 Gini points. Adding DCW to create NW lowers
the differential to 0.120. The further addition of DBW to form PAW reduces the differential even more –
to 0.071. Finally, including SSW to create AW decreases the gap to -0.098. That is to say, AW inequality
was considerably smaller among blacks than whites – Gini coefficients of 0.601 and 0.699, respectively.

        The pattern is similar for Hispanics. In 2016, the Gini coefficients for NW among Hispanics and



                                                                                                         29
whites were 0.945 and 0.852, respectively – a gap of 0.093. PW inequality was likewise greater among
Hispanics – a difference of 0.114. The Gini coefficient for SSW was once again very similar for the two
groups. Because SSW was much more important in the portfolio of Hispanics, the Gini coefficient for
RW was much lower among Latinos – a differential of 0.077. Here too NWX inequality was much higher
among Hispanics than whites – a difference of 0.097 Gini points. The differential in NW inequality was
about the same, 0.093 Gini points, and that of PAW inequality only slightly lower, 0.084. Once again,
adding SSW to form AW had a major effect, reducing the gap to -0.091, and AW inequality was much
smaller among Latinos than whites – a Gini coefficient of 0.608 versus 0.699.

        Thus, the principal finding is that while NW inequality is notably higher among minorities than
whites, AW inequality is just the opposite. The primary reason is that minorities have a much bigger
share of SSW in their portfolio, which reduces their AW inequality relative to whites. That is to say,
SSW has much bigger impact on wealth inequality for minorities than whites because it is a larger share
of AW. In 2016, adding SSW to PAW reduces the Gini coefficient by 0.291 for blacks and 0.297 for
Latinos but only 0.122 for whites. Alternatively, adding SSW to NWX reduces the Gini coefficient by
0.473 and 0.394 for the two minority groups but only by 0.171 for whites.

         Over time, the differential in SSW inequality between blacks and whites plunged from 0.169
Gini points to 0.018. This was largely due to the sharp rise in the percentage of black households holding
SSW. The difference in PW inequality fell slightly, by 0.015 Gini points, and together the gap in RW
inequality declined by 0.183 points. By 2016, the Gini coefficient for RW was lower for blacks than
whites. In contrast, the Gini coefficient for NWX in 2016 was much higher for blacks than whites but in
this case the differential widened sharply over time, from 0.057 in 1989 to 0.161 in 2016. This trend
reflected primarily the notable jump in the share of black households with zero or negative NWX. In like
fashion, NW inequality was much greater for black households in 2016 and the gap rose from 0.086 to
0.120. However, the change in the racial differential was much smaller for NW than NWX (0.034 versus
0.105), indicating that the rise in DCW helped mitigate the racial gap in NW inequality. This is true
despite the fact that mean DCW increased faster for whites than blacks (931 percent as against 663
percent). The difference in PAW inequality rose from 0.052 in 1989 to 0.071 in 2016. However, this
increase (0.019 Gini points) was smaller than that of NW (0.034 points), indicating that increases in
DBW lowered the racial difference in inequality. This was the case even though mean DBW grew at
about the same rate for blacks and whites.

         Finally, while AW inequality increased substantially for whites from 1989 to 2016 (by 0.067
Gini points), it fell substantially for blacks (by 0.046 Gini points). Indeed, in 1989, AW inequality was
somewhat greater for black households than white ones (0.646 and 0.632, respectively) but this reversed
by 2016 (0.601 versus 0.699). The gap in AW inequality plummeted from 0.015 to -0.098. These results
illustrate the power of Social Security as a mechanism to level inequality. Whereas the racial differential
in PAW inequality between blacks and whites increased by 0.019 Gini points from 1989 to 2016, that in
AW inequality dropped by 0.113 Gini points. In similar fashion, the racial difference in NWX inequality
climbed by 0.105 Gini points, while that in the inequality of NWX+SSW plunged by 0.114 Gini points.

         It is also of note that between 1989 and 2007 there was a huge decline in the racial gap in SSW
inequality of 0.158 points. This was followed by a slight uptick from 2007 to 2016, so that all of the
diminution in the gap in SSW inequality occurred before 2007. A similar pattern is evident for the
difference in PW inequality, though the drop from 1989 to 2007 was much smaller (0.028). In the case of
the difference in RW inequality, most of the overall decline of 0.183 Gini points occurred before 2007
(0.146 points) but there was a continued reduction after 2007 as well (0.038 points), reflecting the
continuing increase of SSW among black households relative to white households (the difference in the
share of AW in SSW rose from 18.6 to 25.5 percent). From 1989 to 2007 there was also a decline in the



                                                                                                         30
racial differential in Gini coefficients for NW, so that all of the increase in the differential took place
after 2007. The story is similar for PAW but different for AW. In the latter case, most of the decline in
the racial differential in AW inequality took place before 2007 (0.092 out of 0.113 Gini points) but there
was an additional drop of 0.021 points after 2007. Once again the result for 2007-2016 is a consequence
of the relative rise in SSW among black households as compared to white households.

         Results for the differential in inequality between Hispanics and white are similar to those for
racial differences. From 1989 to 2016, the difference in SSW inequality between blacks and whites fell
from 0.073 to -0.020 as the share of Latino households with SSW rose. The differential in PW inequality
fell slightly, by 0.011 Gini points, and the gap in RW inequality plunged by 0.134 points. Once again, the
Gini coefficient for RW was lower for Hispanics than whites in 2016 though the opposite was the case in
1989. The Gini coefficient for NWX in 2016 was much higher for Latinos than whites, as was the case
for the racial difference, though in this case the differential fell somewhat over time, from 0.118 in 1989
to 0.097 in 2016. Likewise, NW inequality was much higher for Latinos in 2016 but the difference
reduced from 0.136 to 0.093. In 1989, the disparity in NW inequality was greater than that in NWX
inequality but in 2016 it was slightly lower. These results indicate that the rise in DCW helped close the
ethnic gap in NW inequality, despite the fact that mean DCW increased faster for whites than Hispanics
(931 versus 743 percent). The difference in PAW inequality declined from 0.112 in 1989 to 0.084 in
2016. This decrease (0.027 Gini points) was lower than that of NW (0.043 points). Adding DBW to NW
thus lowered the ethnic difference in PAW inequality by 0.024 points in 1989 but by only 0.009 in 2016
because mean DBW showed stronger gains for whites than Latinos over these years.

        Whereas AW inequality increased by 0.067 Gini points for whites over years 1989 to 2016, it fell
by 0.015 for Hispanics. The gap in AW inequality between Latinos and whites went from -0.009 to -
0.091. Once again SSW was the principal factor. While the differential in PAW inequality fell by 0.027
Gini points, that in AW inequality declined by 0.082 points. Likewise, whereas the difference in the Gini
coefficient for NWX dipped by 0.02, that for NWX+SSW dropped by 0.076 Gini points.

         The 2007-2016 period once again differed from 1989-2007. There was a sizeable decline in the
differential in SSW inequality of 0.113 points between 1989 and 2007, followed by a slight rise from
2007 to 2016, so that all of the reduction in the gap in SSW inequality occurred before 2007. Almost all
of the decrease in the differential in PW inequality also took place from 1989 to 2007, though the decline
was much smaller than that in the SSW inequality differential. Once again, most of the decrease in the
difference in RW inequality happened prior to 2007 but there was a continued decline after that because
of the continuing relative increase of SSW among Latinos (the share difference of SSW in AW increased
from 15.2 to 23.3 percent). Over 1989 to 2007, the difference in Gini coefficients for NW between
Latinos and whites fell but increased from 2007 to 2016. The same pattern holds for PAW. In contrast, of
the 0.082 reduction in the differential in AW Gini coefficients from 1989 to 2016, 0.036 occurred from
1989 to 2007 and 0.046 from 2007 to 2016. Here too the 2007-2016 trend is attributable to the relative
rise in SSW among Hispanic households.

8. Summary and Concluding Remarks
         In Wolff (2017, Chapter 3) I emphasize the role of differential leverage and the resulting
differences in rates of return on net worth in explaining the wealth gap between the rich and the middle
class. In this paper, these two factors play important roles in accounting for the relative collapse of the
wealth of minorities over the Great Recession. Capital revaluation also explained about three quarters of
the advance of mean net worth among black households from 2001 to 2007 and 78 percent of the ensuing
collapse from 2007 to 2010. Among Hispanics, the corresponding figures were 59 percent for the earlier
period and 57 percent for the later one. Differentials in rates of return accounted for 43 percent of the 32
percentage point gain in the net worth of black households relative to whites over years 2001 to 2007 and



                                                                                                         31
39 percent of the 24 percentage point decline in the wealth ratio over years 2007 to 2010. Disparities in
returns played a somewhat smaller role in explaining changes in the ratio of mean wealth between
Hispanics and whites. Over years 2001 to 2007, they accounted for 33 percent of the 52 percentage point
relative gain in the mean net worth of Hispanics and over years 2007 to 2010 for 28 percent of the 41
percentage point drop in the relative wealth of Hispanic households.

          The racial disparity in wealth holdings, after fluctuating over the years from 1983 to 2007, was
almost exactly the same in 2007 as in 1983. However, the Great Recession hit African-American
households much harder than whites and the ratio of mean wealth between the two groups plunged from
0.19 in 2007 to 0.14 in 2010, reflecting a 33 percent decline (in real terms) in black wealth. The relative
(and absolute) losses suffered by black households from 2007 to 2010 are ascribable to the fact that
blacks had a higher share of homes in their portfolio than did whites and a much higher debt-net worth
ratio (0.55 versus 0.15). These factors led to a wide disparity in annual real rates of return on their
respective portfolios (-9.92 versus -7.07 percent).

         Hispanic households made sizeable gains on whites from 1983 to 2007. The ratio of mean net
worth grew from 0.16 to 0.26, the Hispanic homeownership rate climbed from 33 to 49 percent, and the
ratio of homeownership rates with white households advanced from 48 to 66 percent. However, in a
reversal of fortunes, Hispanic households got hammered in years 2007 to 2010, with their mean net worth
plunging in half, the ratio of mean net worth with white households falling from 0.26 to 0.15, their
homeownership rate down by 1.9 percentage points, and their net home equity plummeting by 47 percent.
The relative (and absolute) losses suffered by Hispanic households over these three years were also
mainly due to the much larger share of homes in their wealth portfolio and their much higher leverage (a
debt-net worth ratio of 0.51 versus 0.15). These factors led to a large difference in real returns over years
2007 to 2010 (-10.76 versus -7.07 percent per year).

         When the definition of wealth is expanded to include defined benefit (DB) pension and Social
Security wealth, the picture of racial/ethnic wealth differences changes markedly. There was a profound
alteration of the private pension system after 1989, with a dramatic rise in defined contribution (DC)
pensions and a corresponding decline in DB pensions. However, the take-up rate in DC coverage was
much greater for whites than the two minorities. The share of white households with DC pensions
climbed from 26.2 percent in 1989 to 59.6 percent in 2016, among blacks the share rose from 15.8 to
34.0 percent, and among Hispanics from 12.6 to 30.8 percent. The differential in the share holding DCW
between whites and blacks escalated from 10.5 to 25.6 percent and that between whites and Hispanics
from 13.6 to 28.7 percent. The percentage with DB pensions declined for all three groups. All in all, the
share holding any pension wealth went up from 61.5 to 71.8 percent among whites, from 39.8 to 50.2
percent among blacks, and from 31.4 to 39.5 percent among Hispanics.

         All in all, there remained a big gap in RW and AW between minorities and whites. In 2016, the
mean PW of whites was 3.35 times as great as that of African-Americans. Mean DCW was six times as
large but mean DBW was just twice as high. These differences largely reflect disparities in pension
ownership. The gap in SSW was much smaller – a ratio of 1.67. Overall the mean RW of the former was
2.23 times that of the latter. The ratio of median RW was slightly smaller, 2.10. Over time, the black-
white ratio of PW went more or less steadily downhill, from 0.45 in 1989 to 0.30 in 2016. In contrast, the
ratio of mean SSW went fairly steadily uphill, from 0.44 to 0.60. As a result, the racial gap in mean RW
was about the same in 2016 as in 1989, while the ratio of median RW rose from 0.33 to 0.48. The gap in
mean PW between whites and Hispanics was even greater than the racial gap, with a ratio of 4.60 in
2016. The ethnic discrepancy in SSW was of the same order as the racial difference. The gap in mean
RW between whites and Hispanics was slightly greater than the racial disparity while the gap in median
RW was a bit smaller. Almost in parallel to the black-white discrepancies, the Hispanic-white differential



                                                                                                          32
in PW enlarged, that in SSW narrowed, the ratio in mean RW was about equal in 2016 and 1989, and that
in median RW lessened over time.

         The racial gap in AW was considerably smaller than that in NW. In 2016, the ratio of mean NW
between blacks and whites was 6.93 while the ratio of mean AW was about half of that, 3.75. More
dramatically, while the ratio of median NW in 2016 was 84.6, the ratio of median AW was only 3.65.
Over time, the black-white ratio of mean NW was lower in 2016 than in 1989 to 0.19, while the ratio of
AW was about the same in the two years. Social Security made the difference as can be seen by looking
at the trend in the ratio of mean PAW between the two races, which fell from 0.22 in 1989 to 0.18 in
2016. Likewise, while the ratio of median NW remained a tad above zero over the whole time period, the
ratio of median AW was higher in 2016 than in 1989. In similar fashion, the differential in AW between
whites and Hispanics was lower than that of NW – a ratio of 3.58 in mean AW in 2016 compared to 5.28
in mean NW and a ratio of 3.56 in median AW in contrast to 72.0 in median NW. In this case, the ethnic
ratio of mean NW was a bit higher in 2016 than in 1989, as was the ratio of AW. Whereas the ratio of
median NW was slightly above zero over the whole period, that of median AW rose from 1989 to 2016.

        The portfolio composition of AW is much more heavily tilted toward SSW among minorities
than among whites. In 2016, SSW comprised 46 percent of AW among blacks and 44 percent among
Hispanics but made up only 20 percent for whites. DCW was also notably higher as a share of AW
among white households (12.5 percent) than among black or Hispanic households (7.8, and 8.3 percent,
respectively).

         In 2016, NW inequality was considerably higher among blacks and Hispanics than whites, by
0.120 and 0.093 Gini points, respectively, but AW inequality was considerably lower, by 0.098 and 0.091
points, respectively. One of the main finding here is that the equalizing power of SSW rose considerably
over time among the two minority groups. While AW inequality increased by 0.067 Gini points for
whites from 1989 to 2016, it fell by 0.046 Gini points for blacks and 0.015 points for Hispanics. SSW
played the major role to level inequality. While the differential in PAW inequality between blacks and
whites grew by 0.019 Gini points from 1989 to 2016 and declined by 0.027 Gini points between whites
and Hispanics, that in AW inequality fell off by 0.113 and 0.082 Gini points, respectively.

        The results of this study highlight the importance of Social Security in the minority community.
In 2016, SSW made up 45.9 percent of the total (augmented) wealth of black households and 43.7
percent of AW among Latinos, in comparison to 20.4 percent for whites. SSW was a much greater
equalizer of AW for minorities than whites. On a policy note, efforts to curtail Social Security payouts
will have a much more deleterious effect on the finances and inequality of the two minority groups than
among whites.

                                        Appendix 1. Estimation of Retirement Wealth

           This appendix provides methodological details on the construction of estimates for both Social
  Security wealth (SSW) and defined benefit pension wealth (DBW). The imputation of both defined
  benefit pension wealth (DBW) and Social Security wealth (SSW) involves a large number of steps, which is
  summarized below. It should be noted that the standard definition of DBW and SSW is based on the
  conventional “on-going concern” treatment. It is assumed for this that employees continue to work at
  their place of employment until their expected date of retirement.
         A1.1 DB pension wealth
         For retirees (r) the procedure is straightforward. Let PB be the pension benefit currently being
received by the retiree. The SCF questionnaire indicates how many pension plans each spouse is involved in
and what the expected (or current) pension benefit is. The SCF questionnaire also indicates whether the
pension benefits remain fixed in nominal terms over time for a particular beneficiary or is indexed for
inflation. In the case of the former, DB pension wealth is given by:

                               109 -A
          (A1.1a) DBWr = ∫ 0 PB(1 - mt)e-δtdt

and in the latter case,
                               109 -A
          (A1.1b) DBWr = ∫ 0            PB(1 - mt)e-δ*tdt

where A is the current age of the retiree; mt is the mortality rate at time t conditional on age, gender, and
race; δ* is the real annual discount rate, set to 2 percent; γ is the inflation rate assumed to be 3 percent per
year; δ = δ* + γ is the nominal annual discount rate, equal to 5 percent; and the integration runs from zero to
the number of years when the retiree reaches an arbitrary age limit of 109.

         Estimates of DB pension wealth (as well as Social Security wealth) are quite sensitive to the choice
of inflation rate and discount rate. I choose a 3 percent inflation rate since it is very close to the actual
average annual change of the CPI-U index from 1983 to 2016. Moreover, I choose a 5 percent nominal
discount rate because it likewise is close to the actual average annual rate of return on liquid assets over the
same period. These two choices lead to a 2 percent real discount rate (the difference between the two rates).
A higher real discount rate will lead to lower estimates of DB pension wealth (and likewise Social Security
wealth), and, conversely, a lower discount rate will lead to higher estimates of these two variables. 30
 30
      I also used a 3 percent real discount rate to estimate both DB pension and Social Security wealth. The general




                                                                                                                       36
        Among current workers (w) the procedure is more complex. The SCF provides detailed information
on pension coverage among current workers, including the type of plan, the expected benefit at retirement or
the formula used to determine the benefit amount (for example, a fixed percentage of the average of the last
five year’s earnings), the expected retirement age when the benefits are effective, the likely retirement age of
the worker, and vesting requirements. Information is provided not only for the current job (or jobs) of each
spouse but for up to five past jobs as well. On the basis of the information provided in the SCF and on
projected future earnings, future expected pension benefits (EPBw) are then projected to the year of
retirement or the first year of pension eligibility. Then the present value of pension wealth for current
workers (w) is given by:
                     109-A
(A1.2)    DBWw = ∫ LR         EPB(1 - mt)e-δtdt

where RA is the expected age of retirement and LR = A - RA is the number of years to retirement. The
integration runs from LR to the number of years when the retiree reaches age 109. 31

          A1.2 Social Security wealth
          For current Social Security beneficiaries (r), the procedure is again straightforward. Let SSB be the
Social Security benefit currently being received by the retiree. Again, the SCF provides information for both
husband and wife. Since Social Security benefits are indexed for inflation, Social Security wealth is given by
                             109 -A
         (A1.3) SSWr = ∫ 0            SSB(1 - mt)e-δ*tdt

 where it is assumed that the current Social Security rules remain in effect indefinitely. 32

           The imputation of Social Security wealth among current workers is based on the worker's actual
and projected earnings history estimated by a standard human capital regression equation. The steps are
briefly as follows, First, coverage is assigned based on whether the individual expects to receive Social
Security benefits and on whether the individual was salaried or self-employed. Second, on the basis of the
person's earnings history, 33 the person's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) is computed. Third, on

 results contained in Section 6 above are not materially altered by the use of this higher discount rate (results not
 shown). Another crucial choice is the selection of which mortality rates to use in the calculation of DB and Social
 Security wealth. I have used here the standard ones from the Statistical Abstract of the United States based on age,
 gender and race. However, there are also available unofficial life expectancy estimates for individuals by age,
 gender, and income class (and even by educational attainment). As is well known, higher income (and more
 educated) individuals live longer on average than lower income (or less educated) ones. The use of mortality rates
 conditional on income will have the effect of increasing estimates of DBW and SSW of higher income individuals
 relative to lower income ones.
 31
   The mortality rate mt associated with the year of retirement is the probability of surviving from the current age to
 the age of retirement.
  32
     Separate imputations are performed for husband and wife. According to current and past rules, a
 spouse – say, the wife – is entitled to the greater of her own SS benefit or 50 percent of her husband’s SS
 benefit. An adjustment in the Social Security benefit is also made for the surviving spouse. According to
 current and past rules, a surviving spouse – say, the wife -- is entitled to the greater or her own SS benefit
 or her deceased husband’s.
 33
   This is based on retrospective information on work history provided by the respondent. In particular, each
 individual is asked to provide data on the total number of years worked full-time since age 18, the number of years
 worked part-time since age 18, and the expected age of retirement (both from full-time and part-time work). On the




                                                                                                                      37
the basis of the rules current at the time of the survey year, the person's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is
derived from AIME. Then,

                  109-A
(A1.4) SSWw = ∫ LR PIA(1 - mt)e-δ*tdt

As with pension wealth, the integration runs from the number of years to retirement, LR, to the number of
years when the retiree reaches age 109. 34




 basis of this information, it is possible to approximate the total number of full-time and part-time years worked over
 the individual’s lifetime and use these figures in the calculation of the individual’s AIME. It should be noted that
 though I can approximate the number of years of full-time and part-time work for a given worker, I can not
 determine when in his or her work history periods of non-employment occurred.
 34
   As with pension wealth, the mortality rate mt associated with the year of retirement is the probability of surviving
 from the current age to the age of retirement. Also, note that I use δ* in the equation since Social Security benefits
 are indexed to the CPI.

 Households are divided into four racial/ethnic groups: (I) non-Hispanic whites; (ii) non-Hispanic blacks;
(iii) Hispanics; and (iv) American Indians, Asians, and others. For 1995, 1998, and 2001, the classification
scheme does not explicitly indicate non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks for the first two categories
so that some Hispanics may have classified themselves as either whites or blacks.

Owner-Occupied Housing: The source for years 1989 to 2007 is Table 935 of the 2009 Statistical Abstract, US
Bureau of the Census, available at [http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/].For years after 2007, the source is:
National Association of Realtors, “Median Sales Price of Existing Single-Family Homes for Metropolitan Areas,”
available at: http://www.realtor.org/. The figures are based on median prices of existing houses
for metropolitan areas only.
Business and Non-Home Real Estate: Holding gains (taken from the Financial Accounts of the United States (FFA),
Table R.100, divided by equity in noncorporate business (taken from the FFA, Table B.100), available at:
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/Z1/20140605.
Liquid assets: The weighted average of the rates of return on checking deposits and cash, time
and saving deposits, and life insurance reserves. The weights are the proportion of these assets in
their combined total (calculated from the FFA, Table B.100). The assumptions regarding
the rates of return are: zero for checking deposits, the rate of return on a 1-month CD (taken from
the table “H.15 Selected Interest Rates” published by the Federal Reserve and available at:
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm) for time and saving deposits, and, one plus

the inflation rate for life insurance reserves.
Financial assets: The weighted average of the rates of return on open market paper, Treasury
securities, municipal securities, corporate and foreign bonds, corporate equities, and mutual fund
shares. The weights are the proportion of these assets in total financial assets held by the
household sector (calculated from the FFA, Table B.100). The assumption regarding the
rate of return on open market paper is that it equals the rate of return on 1-month Finance paper
(taken from the table H.15 “Selected Interest Rates” published by the Federal Reserve and
available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm). The data for the rates of return
on other assets are taken from the Economic Report of the President 2017, Table B-25, available at
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ERP-2017/pdf/ERP-2017-table25.pdf
The assumptions regarding Treasury securities, municipal securities, corporate and foreign bonds, and
corporate equities are, respectively, average of Treasury security yields, high-grade municipal
bond yield, average of corporate bond yields, and annual percent change in the S&P 500 index.
Mutual fund shares are assumed to earn a rate of return equal to the weighted average of the rates
of return on open market paper, Treasury securities, municipal securities, corporate and foreign
bonds, and corporate equities. The weights are the proportions of these assets in the total financial
assets of mutual funds (calculated from the FFA, Table L.123).

Pension (DC) Accounts: Weighted average of returns on stocks, bonds, and money market funds, where the
weights are based on the average portfolio composition of DC accounts over the period (for the 1983-89 period
period, the weights are based on 1989 data only).
