Aggregation and The Estimated Effects of Local Economic Conditions on Health

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper considers the relationship between local economic conditions and health with a focus on
different approaches to geographic aggregation. After reviewing the tradeoffs associated with more-
and less-disaggregated analyses–including an investigation of the migratory response to changing
economic conditions–I update earlier state-level analyses of mortality and infant health and then consider
how the estimated effects vary when the analysis is conducted at differing levels of geographic aggregation.
This analysis reveals that more-disaggregated analyses severely understate the extent to which downturns
are associated with improved health. Further investigation reveals that county economic conditions
have an independent effect on mortality but that state and regional economic conditions are stronger
predictors. I also leverage county-level data to explore heterogeneity in the link between county economic
conditions and health across states, demonstrating that local downturns lead to the greatest improvements
in health in low-income states.

1        Introduction

        Although Harvey Brenner’s pioneering research suggested that health deteriorates during

recessions (1973, 1975, 1979), follow-up work has revealed that estimates based on aggregate

time-series data are quite fragile (Forbes and McGregor 1984; McAvinchey 1988; Joyce and

Mocan 1993; Laporte 2004; Gerdtham and Johannesson 2005). As Ruhm (2000) points out,

this “fragility is not surprising since any lengthy time-series is likely to suffer from substantial

omitted variables bias.”1 In order to overcome such biases, researchers have since focused on

panel approaches that exploit local variation in economic conditions. Specifically, this “area

approach” estimates how an area’s health changes over and above changes occurring across all

areas when its economic conditions change over and above changes occurring across all areas

and routinely reveals that health improves during recessions. With few exceptions, nearly all

such studies using US data define “area” as a state.2 Should we prefer estimates that use

state-level data to estimates that use finer or broader definitions of area?

        There are several tradeoffs to consider when choosing the level of geographic aggregation.

First, a more-disaggregated approach allows one to explore heterogeneity more fully. For ex-

ample, we may wish to know whether local economic conditions are more-strongly related to

health for those who live in New York or for those who live in Louisiana. Since a time-series

analysis of each state is unlikely to be very compelling for the reasons described above, we can

only answer this question in a convincing fashion by disaggregating the data to a finer level

so that the area approach can be applied to each state. In addition, more-disaggregated data

makes it possible to separately identify the effects of local versus broader economic conditions.

        Another benefit to taking a more-disaggregated approach is that it can improve power.

In particular, it can leverage variation in economic conditions that may be masked in more-

aggregate measures as contractions in some areas are offset by expansions in others.

        At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that economic indicators are subject to

measurement error, which is especially problematic for fixed-effects estimators (Griliches 1977;

Griliches and Hausman 1986). The most common measure of economic conditions used in

this literature is the unemployment rate, produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
    1
     For example, it is problematic for this approach that penicillin became increasingly available as the United
States began to recover from the Great Depression.
   2
     To my knowledge, the only exceptions are Currie and Tekin (2011) who consider foreclosures at the zip-code
level in four states and Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) who consider unemployment rates and supplement their
state-level analysis with a county-level analysis of California.




                                                       1
However, as one considers smaller areas, one needs to be more and more concerned about

measurement error in unemployment rates since they are based in part on household surveys

(Bartik 1996; Hoynes 2000).3 For this reason, employment-to-population ratios are preferable

because they are based solely on administrative data. Still, one may have concerns about

measurement-error bias that may be influenced by the level of aggregation.

       It is also important to consider the fact that migration is influenced by economic condi-

tions (Blanchard and Katz 1992; Saks and Wozniak 2011), particularly among highly-educated

individuals (Bound and Holzer 2000; Glaeser and Gyourko 2005; Wozniak 2010; Notowidigdo

2011). This heterogeneity implies that the estimated improvements in health associated with

recessions will understate the true improvements in health if standard demographic controls do

not fully capture these sorts of compositional changes. That said, it is unknown whether edu-

cation and other characteristics associated with health are more- or less-strongly related to the

unemployment-migration relationship when one considers different types of moves and different

definitions of local economic conditions. As such, it is unclear whether this sort of composition

bias is likely to be of greater or lesser concern for more-disaggregated analyses.4

       Given the complexity of these issues, I take as my starting point that it is not at all clear

what level of geographic aggregation is preferred but that the tradeoffs deserve consideration

and that much can be learned by comparing the results of alternative approaches. As such,

after briefly reviewing the related literature (Section 2), I describe the different ways that

I define areas throughout the subsequent sections (Section 3). I then explore the extent to

which the migratory response to changes in economic conditions differs across socioeconomic

status and different approaches to defining areas using restricted-use data from the Panel Study

of Income Dynamics (Section 4). Next I replicate and update earlier state-level estimates of

the relationship between economic conditions and mortality (Ruhm 2000 and Stevens et al.

2011) and the relationship between economic conditions at the time of conception and infant

health (Dehejia and Lleras-Muney 2004) before considering how estimated effects vary when

the analysis is conducted at differing levels of geographic aggregation (sections 5 and 6). I
   3
     Angrist and Krueger (1999) provide intuition: “errors tend to average out in aggregate data.” Another
problematic aspect of unemployment rate data is that the BLS’s substate estimates prior to 1990 are no longer
considered “official BLS data” because they have not been revised to be consistent with the BLS’s current
estimation procedure.
   4
     The systematic outmigration that occurs when an area’s unemployment rises also highlights the importance of
well-measured population denominators in calculating mortality rates—population measures that do not account
for the systematic outmigration caused by economic downturns will lead to mechanical reductions in mortality
rates.




                                                       2
then leverage county-level data to gain additional insights into the economic-conditions-health

relationship by simultaneously estimating the effects of county, state, and regional economic

conditions; by obtaining separate estimates of the effects of county economic conditions for

each state; and by exploring whether heterogeneous effects on health outcomes across states

can be explained by state characteristics (Section 7).

    My main findings are as follows:

    1. High school graduates and those with relatively-high permanent incomes are dispropor-

      tionately likely to leave an area in response to a local downturn—there is not strong

      evidence that this empirical regularity differs across different definitions of areas.

    2. The estimated link between economic conditions and adult mortality is highly sensitive to

      the level of geographic aggregation, with more-disaggregated analyses routinely producing

      estimates that are smaller in magnitude. Estimates that simultaneously consider the

      effects of county, state, and regional economic conditions suggest that this is because

      broader measures of economic conditions are stronger predictors of health outcomes.

    3. State-specific estimates based on county-level data reveal that local downturns cause mor-

      tality to fall across a majority of the United States, but that there is substantial hetero-

      geneity. Moreover, local downturns appear to lead to the greatest improvements in health

      in low-income states.



2     Related Literature

    Studies exploring the relationship between economic conditions and health tend to fall into

one of two categories: those that focus on the effects of the specific economic circumstances

that an individual faces (income, employment status, etc.) and those that focus on the effects

of (usually local) macroeconomic conditions. One of the somewhat-puzzling aspects of this

broad and extensive literature is that job loss leads to poorer health among those losing their

jobs and their families (Sullivan and von Wachter 2009; Kuhn, Lalive, and Zwelmuller 2009;

Eliason and Storie 2009a, 2009b; Lindo 2011; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2012) while health

improves during recessions in developed countries (Ruhm 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007; Dehejia and

Lleras-Muney 2004; Johansson 2004; Neumayer 2004; Tapia Granados 2005; Gerdtham and

Ruhm 2006; Lin 2009; Miller et al. 2009; Stevens et al. 2011).


                                                 3
        While many authors note that these two results are not necessarily contradictory, it has

yet to be demonstrated precisely why and how they co-exist, and what that implies for our

understanding of broader questions regarding employment and health. Nonetheless, this con-

text is important for the interpretation of the results that follow. In particular, in order to

reconcile these two strands of literature, it must be the case that macroeconomic conditions af-

fect health through mechanisms besides one’s own employment status. For example, they may

affect an individual’s health via impacts on pollution (Chay and Greenstone 2003), the quality

of care (Stevens et al. 2011), traffic congestion, uncertainty about one’s future employment, the

availability of overtime, etc.



3        Defining Areas

        Throughout my analyses, I separately identify the effects of unemployment using data at five

different levels of geographic aggregation, from counties to regions. Except where replicating

earlier research, all of my analyses are based on data that are available at the county level to

ensure that all estimates are based on the same underlying sample. In particular, I do not

use data from: Alaska or Hawaii where county population data (described in greater detail

below) are unavailable prior to 1990; counties without at least one person of each age (0–85) in

1990 so that age-adjusted mortality rates can be calculated at the county level; Virginia where

there have been substantial changes to county definitions over time; the Great Lakes region in

1976 where BLS data for Illinois counties are unavailable; or the Southeast region in 2005 and

2006 where BLS data for several Louisiana counties are unavailable.5 Section 5 demonstrates

the trivial impact these sample restrictions have on the estimated effects of unemployment on

health.

        My most-aggregated analyses use region-level data based on the eight regions defined by the

Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): New England, Mideast, Great Lakes, Plains, Southeast,

Southwest, the Rocky Mountain, and Far West.6 These BEA regions were developed in the
    5
     In an additional an additional effort to achieve consistency in the data over time, for all years I combine the
counties of La Paz and Yuma (Arizona) which split in 1983; Washabaugh and Jackson (South Dakota) which
merged in 1983; and Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld (Colorado) from which Broomfield split off in 2001.
   6
     The state groupings are as follows. New England: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont. Mideast: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsyl-
vania. Great Lakes: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin. Plains: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota. Southeast: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia. Southwest: Arizona, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas. Rocky Mountain: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming. Far West: Alaska,
California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington.

1950s with the intention of grouping states with similar economic economic and social factors.7

        My next most-aggregated analyses use state-level data, followed by analyses that use data

at the BEA-Economic-Area level. The mapping of counties to BEA Economic Areas is depicted

in Figure 1. Johnson and Kort (2004), who provide a detailed account of the BEA’s procedure,

describe the 179 BEA Economic Areas as follows:

          “[They] define the relevant regional markets surrounding metropolitan or micropoli-

          tan statistical areas. They consist of one or more economic nodes—metropolitan or

          micropolitan statistical areas that serve as regional centers of economic activity—

          and the surrounding counties that are economically related to the nodes. These

          economic areas represent the relevant regional markets for labor, products, and in-

          formation. They are mainly determined by labor commuting patterns [based on the

          decennial census] that delineate local labor markets and that also serve as proxies

          for local markets where businesses in the areas sell their products. In less popu-

          lated parts of the country, newspaper readership data are also used to measure the

          relevant regional markets.”

        I also conduct analyses using data at the BEA-Component-Economic-Areas level. Compo-

nent Economic Areas are much the same as Economic Areas except they can be based on fewer

counties and fewer residents.8 Last, as mentioned above, I conduct analyses based on data at

the county level. Naturally, the sample restrictions described above reduce the number of states,

Economic Areas, Component Economic Areas, and counties below the number that exist.



4        Economic Conditions, Migration, and Socioeconomic Status

        In this section, I explore how the migratory response to economic conditions varies across

socioeconomic status. This analysis is intended to provide context to the sections below where

estimates of the effects of local economic conditions on health rely on the assumption that

readily available control variables are sufficient to capture the effect of economic conditions on

the composition of residents in an area (as the composition relates to health).
    7
     In contrast, the five regions used in the United States census were developed in the 1880s with similar
intentions.
   8
     For example, a Component Economic Area would be considered too small to form an Economic Area if
it consisted of fewer than three counties and fewer than 500,000 employed residents. Also note that 167 of
344 Component Economic Areas are sufficiently large that they also serve as independent Economic Areas; the
remaining 177 combine to create the remaining 12 Economic Areas.



                                                     5
       For this analysis, I use the entire sample of individuals in the PSID from 1968 to 1997 who

are above 23 years old, with the exception of the special “Latino Sample” that was surveyed

from 1990 to 1995.9 Migration across areas is measured by an individual’s residential location

each year. For example, if an individual reports living in California one year and Oregon the

next, they are coded as having moved states but are coded as not having moved to a new BEA

region.10

       In order to estimate the effect of economic conditions on migration, I use the following

linear-probability model

                                  M oveit = Epopit β + αt + γi + uit ,                                   (1)

where M oveit is an indicator variable that takes a one if an individual moves areas before the

next year, Epopit is the employment-to-population ratio in an individual’s area in the current

year calculated using county-level employment counts from the BLS and population counts from

the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER),

αt are year fixed effects, γi are individual fixed effects, and uit is a random error term that is

allowed to be correlated across t within i.11 The individual fixed effects control for the possibility

that certain types of individuals may be more mobile and also tend to live in areas with strong

economies.

       In order to explore heterogeneity across socioeconomic status, I use the following linear-

probability model


                       M oveit = Epopit β + (Epopit × SESi )φ + αt + γi + uit ,                          (2)


where SESi is a measure of socioeconomic status and the estimate of φ will reveal the extent

to which the economic-conditions-migration gradient varies across socioeconomic status.

       The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. Column 1, which simply considers the

effect of local economic conditions on migration, indicates that individuals are more likely to

move out of an area when its economic conditions worsen, whether one defines areas as a states,

BEA Economic Areas, BEA Component Economic Areas, or counties. That said, the results of

this analysis indicate that individuals are less likely to move regions when regional economic

     SEER population estimates are based on an algorithm that incorporates information from Vital statistics,

conditions worsen. Though this difference is interesting, for the purposes of understanding the

link between economic conditions and health, documenting whether migratory responses are

heterogeneous across individual characteristics that are known to be associated with health

outcomes is of primary concern. For this purpose, I focus on two measures of socioeconomic

status that cannot be reliably measured for small-area populations that can be measured using

the PSID: high school education and permanent income decile. The measure of education is

based on whether an individual has 12 or more years of education. An individual’s permanent

income is based on their average residuals from a regression of incomes on age and year fixed ef-

fects interacted with gender.12 Consistent with earlier research, the estimates in columns 2 and

3 routinely indicate that high-socioeconomic-status individuals are more likely to leave an area

when it experiences an economic downturn. Thus, the area approach to estimating the effects of

unemployment on health will likely understate the improvements in health caused by economic

downturns if the typical battery of demographic controls does not fully capture these composi-

tional changes. Of particular relevance to the analyses that follow, there is not strong evidence

that behavioral difference differs across different definitions of areas. As such, it seems un-

likely any migration-induced bias would generate differences in the economic-conditions-health

relationship when the analysis is conducted at different levels of geographic aggregation.13



5         Methodology and Updates to Earlier Research

         Before presenting estimates of the link between local economic conditions and health out-

comes using different definitions of areas in the next section, in this section I present the esti-

mated effects from prior state-level studies, adapt the estimation strategies in a way that allows

more-disaggregated analyses, consider how these changes alter the estimates, and then extend

the analyses to include additional years of data. I begin by focusing on mortality outcomes and

then turn to infant health outcomes.
    12
     Only years in which an individual is less than 62 years old and is the head of household or the ‘spouse’ of
the head of the household (as defined by the PSID) are used for this calculation.
  13
     Though racial composition can be measured reasonably well for small areas, I have also investigated the
extent to which there are racial differences in the migratory response to changing economic conditions. These
estimates reveal that whites are more likely to leave an area in response to downturns than non-whites, except
when considering moves across counties in response to changing county-level economic conditions.

5.1      Mortality

       In his highly influential study, Ruhm (2000) considers the effects of macroeconomic condi-

tions on health using mortality rates from Vital Statistics of the United States publications and

estimates of the unemployment rate from the BLS. In order to focus on within-area variation,

Ruhm’s estimates are based on the regression equation


                                Hat = Eat β + Xat δ + αt + γa + θa t + at ,                                 (3)


where Hat is a measure of health for area a in year t, Eat is a measure of economic conditions,

Xat is a vector of time-varying controls, αt are year fixed effects, γa are area fixed effects, and

θa t are area-specific time trends. To operationalize this identification strategy, Ruhm defines

a as a state, Hat as the natural log of the mortality rate (deaths per 100,000), Eat as the

unemployment rate, and Xat includes the fraction of the state population that is: less than five

years old, 5–64 years old, greater than 64 years old, black, hispanic, a high school dropout, has

some college, is a college graduate.14 In Column 1 of Table 2, I display the estimate based on

these data and definitions while clustering the standard error estimate on the state.15 The point

estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated

with a 0.54-percent decrease in overall mortality.

       As the starting point for my analysis, I begin with the approach used in Stevens et al.

(2011) who extend Ruhm (2000) in several ways. First, they create mortality rates using death

counts from Vital Statistics’ micro-record multiple-cause-of-death files and population data from

SEER (described above). Second, they pool monthly Current Population Survey data in order

to construct overall unemployment rates and unemployment rates for separate demographic

groups, which requires them to focus on data from 1978–2006. Third, they include a richer set

of controls for the fraction of a state’s population in various age brackets (less than 5, 5–17,

18–30, greater than 64) using the aforementioned population data, construct the fraction black

with the aforementioned population data, and use CPS data to measure the fraction Hispanic

and the fraction in each education group.16 Last, they replace the natural log of the mortality

rate with the natural log of the age-adjusted mortality rate to account for uneven changes in
  14
     These control variables are calculated by interpolating between decennial censuses. Additionally, estimates
are weighted by the population in each state.
  15
     As Ruhm (2000) did not present estimates that clustered standard errors, this estimate is taken from Stevens
et al. (2011) who replicate and extend Ruhm’s analysis.
  16
     The fraction in each age group is based solely off of individuals who are at least 25 years old.



                                                       8
the age distribution across states. The age-adjusted mortality rate is calculated by taking the

weighted average of the mortality rate for each age, using as weights the fraction of individuals

in each age category in the US in 1990. After making these changes, their estimate (shown in

Column 2 of Table 2) indicates that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate

is associated with a 0.33-percent decrease in overall mortality.

   In columns 3 through 9 of Table 2, I progressively make changes to this estimation strategy,

ultimately arriving at an approach that can also be used in more-disaggregated county-level

analyses. These changes are as follows:

   • Use state-level unemployment rates published by the BLS for convenience. This change

     has no impact on the estimated effect (Column 3).

   • Omit controls for the fraction Hispanic and the fraction in each education category, which

     cannot be reliably measured for small counties. This change has no impact on the esti-

     mated effect (Column 4).

   • Add data from 1976, 1977, and 2007 to the analysis. Incorporating the earlier years of

     data has a substantial impact on the estimate, causing it to fall from -0.0033 to -0.0044

     (Column 5). Adding 2007 data to the analysis has only a small impact on the estimate

     (Column 6).

   • Restrict the sample to individuals living in counties with at least one person of each

     age (0–85) in 1990 so that age-adjusted mortality rates can be calculated at the county

     level. Also, omit data from Alaska and Hawaii where county codes are unavailable in the

     early years of the data and from Virginia where there have been substantial changes to

     county definitions over time. So that the unemployment rates correctly correspond to the

     counties contributing to the state-level estimates, use county-level BLS data to construct

     unemployment rates. These changes have a negligible impact on the estimate (Column

     7).

   • Use the death rate as the outcome variable rather than the log of the death rate, which

     may be undefined in small counties. The semi-elasticity based on this estimate (Column

     8), calculated by dividing coefficient estimate by the mean of the outcome, is somewhat

     larger than the direct estimate in obtained in Column 7.

   • Use the employment-to-population ratio as the measure of economic conditions. The

                                                9
         semi-elasticity based on this estimate (Column 9) is smaller than the semi-elasticity for

         unemployment rates.


5.2      Infant Health

       Like Ruhm (2000), Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) conduct a state-level analysis—also

characterized by Equation 3—but instead focus on various measures of infant health and the

effects of economic conditions at the time of conception. As their primary outcome measures,

they consider the fraction of children who have low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) and

the fraction who have very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams), calculated at the race-by-

state-by-year level based on vital statistics birth records for white and black mothers at least

18 years old. As their primary measure of economic conditions, they use state unemployment

rates in the year of conception, which they base on the timing of the mother’s last menstrual

period. Column 1 of Table 3 displays their estimates, which indicate that a one-percentage-

point increase in the unemployment rate reduces the incidence of low birth weight 0.26 percent

and reduces the incidence of very low birth weight by 0.54 percent.17

       In columns 2 through 9 of Table 3, I progressively make changes to the estimation strategy,

ultimately arriving at an approach that can also be used in more-disaggregated county-level

analyses. In Column 2, I instead define a child’s year of conception as nine months prior to

birth and include in the analysis children born to mothers for whom information on the last

menstrual cycle is missing. The subsequent columns progressively include children classified as

“other race” to the analysis and an indicator variable for “other race” to the regression model

(Column 3); include children born to mothers of all ages (Column 4); collapse the state-by-year-

by-race level data to the state-by-year level while adding controls for the fraction in each race

category (Column 5); control for the age distribution of mothers with variables corresponding

to the fraction of mothers who are less than 18 years old, 18–22 years old, 23–28 years old, and

29–34 years old (Column 6); update the sample to include data from 2000–2006 (Column 7);

and then construct the sample based on data available at the county level, i.e., omitting data

from Alaska, Hawaii, and Virginia for the reasons described above (Column 8). These changes

tend to have only minor impacts on the estimated effects with one exception. When the data

is extended from 1976–1999 to 1976–2006 the estimated effect of unemployment increases by

approximately 60 percent, suggesting that effect of economic conditions on newborn health has

grown over time. Column 9 indicates that using the employment-to-population ratio as the

measure of economic conditions produces similar results.



6    Estimates of the Unemployment-Health Relationship Using

     Different Definitions of Area

    In this section, I explore how the estimated effects of economic conditions on health outcomes

vary with different levels of geographic aggregation using the identification strategy described

in the previous section. Though the convention in this literature is to cluster standard errors

at the area level, to the extent to which the errors may be correlated for adjacent areas, it may

instead be appropriate to cluster on broader areas where possible, e.g., clustering on regions

for state-level analyses. That said, it turns out that the standard error estimates based on the

conventional approach are either identical to or more conservative than estimates that cluster

on broader areas, except when the analysis is conducted at the county level. For county-level

estimates, clustering the standard errors at the state level yields the most conservative estimates.

As such, I use this approach where applicable.

    Column 1 of Table 4 focuses on how the estimated effects of economic conditions on overall

mortality varies with different levels of geographic aggregation across panels A through E.

Using the broadest definition of area, region, the estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point

increase in the employment-to-population ratio is associated with a 0.51-percent increase in

mortality. As we progressively consider more narrowly defined areas, there is a monotonic

decline in the magnitude of the estimated effect. In particular, the point estimate shrinks by

25 percent as we move from the region level to the state level; shrinks another 18 percent

as we move to the BEA-Economic-Area level; shrinks another 6 percent as we move to the

BEA-Component-Economic-Area level; and then shrinks another 69 percent as we move to the

county level. At the county level, the estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point increase

in the employment-to-population ratio is associated with a 0.09-percent increase in mortality.

Although this estimate is less than a third of the estimate based on state-level data, it remains

highly significant at conventional levels.

    Columns 2 through 4 take a similar approach but separately estimate the effects on youth

mortality (age 0–17), working-age mortality (age 18–64), and elderly mortality (age 65+). This


                                                11
exercise is motivated by Miller et al. (2009) who explain that, even though unemployment has a

similar percentage impact on younger and older individuals, the additional deaths that tend to

be observed during recessions largely consist of the elderly because their baseline mortality rate

is so high. Again, the magnitudes of the estimates are smaller in more-disaggregated analyses.

       Finally, columns 5 through 8 show estimated effects on five major causes of death: cardio-

vascular problems, cancer, disease (including respiratory, infections and immune deficiencies,

degenerative brain diseases, and kidney problems), motor-vehicle accidents, and suicides.18

Echoing earlier work, these estimates reveal that local downturns reduce deaths due to car-

diovascular causes and motor-vehicle accidents. That said, these estimates shrink in magnitude

in more-disaggregated analyses, though they remain significant due to increased precision. Inter-

estingly, only the region-level analysis indicates that economic downturns significantly increase

suicides.

       Table 5 presents a similar analysis but instead focuses on the effect of the economic conditions

at the time of conception on the incidence of low and very low birth weights. Though the

estimates are always positive, indicating that local downturns improve infant health, as in

Table 4 the magnitudes of the estimated effects decline as areas are defined more narrowly.

       Columns 3 through 5 address the extent to which changing economic conditions may affect

the composition of newborns. In particular, Column 3 shows the estimated effect of economic

conditions on the birth rate (defined as the number of births per 1,0000 women between the ages

of 15 and 44). This estimate is always positive (and highly significant in more-disaggregated

analyses), indicating that economic downturns reduce fertility rates.19 That said, the estimated

effects on the fraction of births to white mothers and the fraction of births to mothers under

the age of 18 are usually not significant, lending support to the notion that the improvements

in infant health observed during recessions are not due changes in the underlying composition

of mothers giving birth. The county-level estimates serve as an exception, however, as they

indicate that deteriorating economic conditions at the county level are associated with more

births to teen mothers and fewer births to white mothers, which we would expect to reduce the

incidence of low birth weight at the county level. As such, the fact that there is no significant

link between county employment-to-population ratios and the incidence of low birth weight is

something of a puzzle.
  18
     This is a subset of the categories considered in Stevens et al. (2011). See their appendix for cause-of-death
codes.
  19
     Schaller (2012) also finds that fertility is procyclical.



                                                       12
         The results discussed above clearly illustrate that the choice of geographic aggregation has

a dramatic influence on the estimated relationship between economic conditions and health.

In particular, more-disaggregated analyses severely understate the extent to which local down-

turns improve health. While simply establishing this fact is the main contribution of this paper,

it naturally raises the question why? Given that the economic-conditions-migration gradient

across socioeconomic status is similar across different definitions of areas (Section 4), two pos-

sibilities seem most likely. First, broader economic conditions may have greater impacts on

health. To the extent to which the effects may be driven by individuals’ perceptions of the eco-

nomic conditions they face, this explanation is quite plausible given that individuals may view

their ‘local’ labor market quite broadly and that broader changes in economic conditions are

likely to garner more media attention. That said, lacking a valid instrument for employment-

to-population ratios, we cannot rule out that this systematic pattern arises due to differences

in measurement-error bias at differing levels of geographic aggregation.20



7         Leveraging County-Level Data for Additional Insights

         In this section, I use county-level data to shed light on several questions that are difficult if

not impossible to answer using the state-level data used in prior studies.


7.1         Simultaneously Estimating Effects of More- and Less-Local Economic
            Conditions

         The fact that more-disaggregated analyses systematically yield estimates that are relatively

small in magnitude raises the question: do local economic conditions matter at all or do the

effects of local economic conditions simply reflect the effects of broader economic conditions?

To investigate this issue, I use county-level data to separately identify the effects of county

economic conditions, state economic conditions, and regional economic conditions. Because we

are interested in the effect of economic conditions in an individual’s own county versus the

effect of economic conditions in other counties in an individual’s state and region, for each
    20
     There are certainly alternative measures of economic conditions that could be used as instruments but none
seem satisfying. For example, employment counts produced by the BEA could be used to construct an alternative
measure of the employment-to-population ratio. However, despite the fact that the BEA and BLS independently
produce employment estimates, they largely use the same data; thus, the errors would not be independent.
Moreover, as fundamentally different measures of economic conditions—BLS measures employment for county
residents whereas the BEA measures the number of jobs in a county—the BEA measure may be independently
related to health outcomes. Other measures of local economic conditions would appear to suffer from similar
problems when considered as instruments.



                                                      13
observation the measure of statewide economic conditions is calculated using information from

the other counties in its state and the measure of regional economic conditions is calculated

using information from the other states in its region.

    Table 6 shows the results of this analysis for mortality outcomes. Though these estimates

continue to indicate that state and regional economic conditions are more strongly related to

mortality than county economic conditions, they do reveal that county economic conditions have

an independent effect on health. Similarly, these estimates indicate that state-level economic

conditions affect mortality independently of the effects of regional economic conditions.

    Table 7 presents a similar analysis for infant outcomes. Though the estimates corresponding

to the fraction of newborns with low birth weight and very low birthweight are intriguing,

potential composition bias makes interpretation difficult. That said, it is quite notable that

this analysis suggests that fertility is more strongly related to the measure of regional economic

conditions than to the measure of state economic conditions which is more strongly related

to fertility than the measure of county economic conditions. As before, all of these estimates

indicate that fertility is procyclical.


7.2    Do Local Downturns Improve Health Everywhere in the US?

    The area approach has been used to estimate the effect of economic conditions on health in

several different contexts since Ruhm (2000) and Dehejia and Lleras-Muney’s (2004) analyses

of the United States. In particular, local downturns have been shown to improve health using

data from 16 German states (Neumayer 2004), 50 Spanish provinces (Tapia Granados 2005),

8 Asia-Pacific countries (Lin 2009), 23 OECD countries (Gerdtham and Ruhm 2006), and 21

Swedish regions (Svensson 2010).21 With county-level data, we have the ability to separately

assess the extent to which local downturns improve health for each US state.

    Acknowledging that broader measures of economic conditions are more strongly related to

mortality than narrow measures, Figure 2 shows state-specific estimates of the link between

county employment-to-population ratios and overall mortality rates.22 The black squares plot

the estimated effects for each state and the whiskers show the associated confidence intervals.

Though these state-specific estimates are often too imprecise to reject zero, a majority of the

estimates are positive (31 of 47), indicating that local downturns reduce mortality for most
  21
     See Ruhm (2008) for an in-depth review of many of these and other related studies. As discussed in the next
section, the relationship often runs in the opposite directions for developing countries.

                                                      14
states. However, this figure illustrates that there is substantial heterogeneity and suggests that

local downturns increase mortality in some states.

       Though I present similar figures for each of the health outcomes explored in previous sec-

tions in Appendix A.1, they are usually similar to Figure 2 or too imprecise to be informative.

One exception is the figure depicting state-specific estimates for the effects of local economic

conditions on birth rates. These estimates are positive for a vast majority of the states con-

sidered (37 of 47) and are usually statistically significant (28 of 47), providing further evidence

that fertility is procyclical. Moreover, the increases in fertility are disproportionately due do

white mothers having more children, as the estimated effect on the fraction of white mothers is

also positively related to employment-to-population ratios for most states.


7.3      Income and The Unemployment-Health Relationship

       In this section, I conduct a meta-analysis of sorts using each of the state-specific estimates

from the previous section. In particular, using each state as an observation, I consider whether

state income levels can explain the extent to which mortality is procyclical. This exercise is

motivated by the fact that several studies have found that economic downturns lead to poorer

health in developing countries despite a wide body of evidence that downturns improve health

in developed countries like the United States.23 As such, we might expect the improvements in

health associated with recessions to be especially large in high-income states.

       To investigate this hypothesis, Figure 3 plots the estimated effect of county employment-

to-population ratios on mortality for each state against its median income (based on the 1990

Census). Perhaps in contrast to expectations, this figure reveals a clear negative relationship

(p-value=0.006). That is, it indicates that local downturns improve health most in relatively-

disadvantaged states. Of course, it should be noted that this correlation is based on a relatively

small sample. That said, Figure 4 shows that the same pattern is evident for all of the health

outcomes considered in this paper.

       Figures exploring the extent to which other measures of economic development predict the

effect of county economic conditions on health outcomes are—shown in Appendix A.2—largely

tell the same story. In particular, local downturns appear to improve health most in states with

low poverty rates and a large share of college graduates. That said, the fraction of a state that

8    Conclusion

    In this paper, I have demonstrated that the migratory response to fluctuations in local

economic conditions are an important consideration for studies that use the area approach to

estimate the effects of unemployment on health; however, because high-socioeconomic-status

individuals are more likely to leave an area when its unemployment rate rises, this phenomenon

will tend to result in estimates that understate the health improvements caused by recessions.

I have also demonstrated that there is much to be gained by conducting more-disaggregated

analyses of the effects of economic conditions on health, though the potential for measurement

error to bias estimates based on measures of economic conditions for small areas must be

acknowledged. With county-level data, we learn that broader measures of economic conditions

are stronger predictors of mortality than county measures; that there is substantial heterogeneity

in the extent to which declining county economic conditions are associated with reductions

in mortality; and that local downturns improve health most in states that have relatively-

disadvantaged populations. More broadly, the estimates presented in this paper suggest that

recessions improve health even more than we may have thought given the existing literature.

Notes: Estimates are based on the 1976–1997 waves of the PSID. For each year, the sample is restricted to individuals at least 24 years old who
are not a part of the PSID’s special “Latino Sample.” All estimates are based on models with individual fixed effects and year fixed effects.
Panel A uses an indicator for moving to a new BEA region as the outcome variable and the employment-to-population ratio in an individual’s
region as the regressor. Panels B uses an indicator for moving to a new state as the outcome variable and the employment-to-population
ratio in an individual’s state as the regressor. Panels C through E are similar but consider more-narrow definitions of area. See the text for
the construction of the measure of permanent income.

     Notes: Data aggregated to the area level, spanning 1976–2007, are based on labor force data produced by the BLS, population data produced by SEER, and death counts from restricted-use
     Vital Statistics’ micro-record multiple-cause-of-death files provided by the NCHS. All estimates control for year fixed effects, area fixed effects, area-specific trends, and demographics, and are
     weighted by the population in each cell. Standard-error estimates, shown in parentheses, are clustered on the area defined by the level of geographic aggregation, except for the county-level
     analyses where standard-error estimates are more conservative when clustered at the state level.
     †Disease category includes deaths involving respiratory problems, infections and immune deficiencies, degenerative brain diseases, and kidney problems.

Notes: Data aggregated to the area level, spanning 1976–2006, are based on labor force data produced by the BLS,
population data produced by SEER, and birth information from restricted-use natality files provided by the NCHS. All
estimates control for year fixed effects, area fixed effects, area-specific trends, and demographics (with the exception of
columns 3–5 which do not control for demographics), and are weighted by the population in each cell. Standard error
estimates, shown in parentheses, are clustered on the area defined by the level of geographic aggregation, except for the
county-level analyses where standard-error estimates are more conservative clustered at the state level.

Notes for all tables in Appendix A.1: Each black square represents the estimated

effect of county employment-to-population ratios on the outcome for a given state

while the whiskers represent the associated 95-percent confidence intervals. These

estimates are based on county-level data, control for year fixed effects, county fixed

effects, county-specific trends, and demographic characteristics while weighting es-

timates by the relevant population and clustering standard-error estimates at the

county level.

Additional State Characteristics and the Cyclicality of Health Outcomes

                  NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION


Notes for all tables in Appendix A.2: Each observation represents a state. Its hor-

izontal position is a measure of the state’s characteristics and its vertical position

is the estimated effect of county employment-to-population ratios on a health out-

come. The size of each observation is proportional to the size of the population that

it represents over the sample period. The reported correlations also uses population

weights. For additional notes on the state-specific estimates, see Figure 2 or Ap-

pendix A.1. For matters of convenience, state poverty rates are based on the 1990

Census and the fraction of a state’s adult population with a high school (college)

education is based on the CPS from 1978–2006.
