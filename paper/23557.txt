Investing in the Presence of Massive Flows: The Case of MSCI Country Reclassifications

                                         ABSTRACT

Almost $10 trillion is benchmarked to Morgan Stanley Capital International’s Developed,
Emerging, Frontier, and standalone market indexes. Reclassifications from one index to another
require thousands of investors to decide how to react. We study a comprehensive sample of past
reclassifications to inform this decision. On average, reclassified markets’ prices substantially
overshoot between the announcement and effective dates—prices fall when a market moves from
an index with more benchmarked ownership to one with less, such from Emerging to Frontier,
and vice-versa—but largely revert within a year. We identify alpha-maximizing responses to
reclassifications for both benchmarked and more flexible investors.

         Morgan Stanley Capital International’s Developed Markets, Emerging Markets,

and Frontier Markets Indexes provide benchmarks for stock markets at different stages of

development and international investability. The Indexes are used to allocate trillions of

dollars in equities by thousands of proper indexers, active asset managers, pension funds,

hedge funds, banks, and individuals around the world. Other major index providers also

classify equity markets into development levels, but the MSCI classifications are by far

the most followed for global equities investing (for example, see MSCI (2016a) and

Authers (2015)).

         The MSCI’s Index Policy Committee reclassifies markets when investability

conditions change. Its criteria encompass openness to foreign ownership, the ease of

capital flows, the efficiency of the operational framework, and the stability of the

institutional framework.2 Qatar and the United Arab Emirates graduated from Frontier to

Emerging status in June 2014 after institutional improvements, for example. Trinidad and

Tobago was declared unsuitable for even the Frontier index in February 2011, on the

other hand, and since June of that year has been tracked only as a standalone market.

Most recently, MSCI upgraded Pakistan to the Emerging index, effective May 2017.

Table 1 lists the major, non-partial reclassifications between 2000 and 2015.3

  Openness criteria include investor qualification requirements, foreign ownership limits, foreign room
levels, and the rights of foreign vs. domestic investors. Ease-of-Flows criteria include capital flow
restrictions and degree of currency market liberalization. Operational Framework criteria include
registration & account setup difficulty, market regulations, information flow, clearing and settlement,
custody, registry/depository considerations, trade execution, transferability, stock lending and short selling.
Also considered are the degree of competition among financial services providers and the stability of the
institutional framework. There is an additional requirement on gross national income per capita for
Developed status. See MSCI Global Market Accessibility Review (2016b).

  We exclude Serbia’s and Lithuania’s 2008 reclassifications. Their announcements conditioned the final
decision on aspects of market performance between the announcement and the potential effective date,
making it unclear what if anything investors should be doing in the meantime. In addition, the Frontier
index was introduced in 2007. We do not include the markets included at the inception of this index since
the announcement and effective dates were nearly contemporaneous and, presumably, the flows associated
with the classification would be small.


                                                       2
       Given the huge importance of the MSCI indexes and the fact that reclassifications

require thousands of asset managers to decide how to react, it is surprising that there has

been little systematic study of what happens around reclassification events. The most

closely related scholarly study is Saidi, Prasad, and Naik (2012), who focus on a small

number of Middle Eastern countries’ reclassifications between Frontier and Emerging

indexes, and the brokerage research we could find is also anecdotal or event-specific.

       In this short paper, we address these basic questions: What happens to returns

around market reclassification events? Should a benchmarked investor trade at the

announcement date? Wait a few months until the effective date? Wait for a year while the

dust settles? Break the tie based on non-alpha considerations such as tracking error? Does

it matter whether the investor tracks the new or old index? Are “upgrades” always good

and “downgrades” always bad? Are there opportunities for unbenchmarked investors? To

answer these questions, we study the 17 reclassifications between 2000 and 2015 listed in

Table 1. The sample, while small, is comprehensive for this sample period.

       It is not possible to observe flows directly, and abnormal trading volume is

difficult to measure given the changing circumstances of the markets involved and the

varying lengths of time between the announcement and effective dates, but the return

patterns we document appear to highlight the importance of flows. Using MSCI data on

the extent of benchmarking—which includes both passive indexers and active managers

who use an index as a benchmark—we find that when a market is moved from a less-

benchmarked to a more-benchmarked index, such as from Frontier to Emerging, its

MSCI country index rises between the announcement and effective date by around 15%.

By one year after the effective date, however, this upward price pressure appears to have




                                             3
fully reverted. We also find that the overshooting happens in reverse when a market is

reclassified to a less-benchmarked index.

       For investors, the large returns around reclassifications illustrate the importance

of properly accommodating the event. We delineate the alpha-maximizing policies for

benchmarked and more flexible investors. The results also shed broader light on market

resiliency and price pressures writ large, because MSCI reclassifications are uniquely

important events for the markets involved. The patterns are clearly inconsistent with a

simple “upgrades are good, downgrades are bad” hypothesis. If a reclassification is a

positive event, it should be permanently so. Instead, the results are most consistent with

differences in demand for the reclassified market by those benchmarked to the old and

new index causing short-run price pressures that eventually revert.



Supply, Demand, and Index Inclusion Effects



       It might surprise the layman that stock market prices are often studied at the

highest practitioner and academic levels with no explicit reference to supply and demand.

For many purposes in finance, that is a reasonable simplification, but it is hard to justify

in the context of the potentially large rebalancing-driven demand changes around market

reclassifications. What does prior research lead us to expect around these events?

       Efficient markets theory—embraced by many passive indexers—would, in the

extreme, imply that we will observe no price change. Under this view, reclassifications

are inconsequential because stock fundamentals are unchanged. They are simply

decisions made by a committee of non-investors who are not even attempting to evaluate




                                              4
investment merits and are using largely public information. Any observed change in

return properties such as risk or liquidity would be attributed to the structural changes

that drove reclassifications in the first place, not the reclassifications themselves.

       An alternative view, associated with inefficient markets and active management,

is that stock prices sometimes respond to supply and demand forces unrelated to

fundamentals. Adherents of this view would also acknowledge the structural and

operational changes leading to reclassification events, but they would suggest that the

trading of passive index funds—not to mention other categories of benchmarked

investors—might contribute to the very distortions that their investors deny.

       The accumulated evidence from other index inclusion settings suggests that we

should not be surprised if reclassifications cause price dynamics. The classic research in

this area involves S&P 500 inclusions. Harris and Gurel (1986) and Shleifer (1986) both

argue that such inclusions contain no information about stock fundamentals, consistent

with the stated position of the S&P Index Policy Committee, and both find that inclusions

are associated with price jumps of a few percentage points. An important point of

disagreement is that Harris and Gurel find that this jump eventually reverts.

       In October 1989, the S&P changed its announcement policy. It separated the

announcement date of a change from the effective date. Lynch and Mendenhall (1997)

find that this policy introduced a jump on the announcement, a further rise between the

announcement and effective date, and a partial reversion thereafter. Since the effective

date is even more plainly informationless than the announcement itself, this is compelling

evidence that inclusions induce price pressures.




                                               5
       More recently, Madhavan (2003) and Cai and Houge (2008) find inclusion effects

for the Russell 2000, and Petajisto (2011) finds that the S&P 500 inclusion effects have

grown since the early studies. Kaul, Mehrota, and Morck (2000) study a unique

experiment from the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 and find more evidence of demand-

induced price changes, thus extending the evidence on index inclusion effects to

international markets. In a setting closer to our own, albeit still involving individual

stock-level events and only a three-year time sample, Chakrabarti, Huang, Jayaraman,

and Lee (2005) find that inclusions into the MSCI country indexes beget a rise between

the announcement and effective date, which partially reverts. See Petajisto (2009) and

Wurgler (2011) for further overviews of this large literature.

       In modern, liquid markets, how can information-free inclusion effects persist?

Apparently, basic supply and demand considerations overwhelm short-term arbitrage

forces. Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2002) point out that Scholes’s (1972) classical

efficient markets argument—that sophisticated investors would elastically supply new

investor demand for the included stock because they can simply short an equivalent

stock—isn’t realistic. The vast majority of an individual stock’s variability is

idiosyncratic. There is no washing away of this risk through a long-short trade, and no

way to form a portfolio of inclusions when they are isolated events.

       The classical logic fails even more strongly at the level of MSCI country

reclassifications. Who would have shorted a basket of U.A.E. stocks to accommodate the

sudden demand from benchmarkers that followed its upgrade to the Emerging index?

What exactly would those investors buy in order to hedge the risk that U.A.E.

fundamentals improved while they were short? Put together, the theory and evidence




                                              6
suggest that we should not be surprised if MSCI country reclassifications generate

interesting price dynamics. How interesting presumably depends on how much demand

actually changes. We approach this question next.



Potential Flows Around Reclassifications



       In the case of MSCI reclassifications, thousands of benchmarked funds must

consider how to adjust their holdings in a short period of time, and passive indexers will

presumably do so fully. In light of the nearly $10 trillion now benchmarked to the MSCI

indexes, the collective action of these non-fundamental traders may be large.

       To get a sense of the magnitudes involved it is helpful to understand how MSCI

indexes are constructed. A highly simplified explanation, with some relevant caveats and

details noted later in the paper, is as follows. Each index involved is roughly value-

weighted (to be more precise, free-float weighted). MSCI country return indexes are

averages of a set of major stocks trading in the local market. Regional sub-indexes are

averages of a set of country indexes. Finally, the major indexes, including Developed,

Emerging, and Frontier indexes, are averages of combinations of the above.

       The tiered and approximately cap-weighted structure of the indexes allows us to

estimate the size of the potential flows associated with a reclassification. If benchmarked

investors hold shares at index weights, then, under idealized assumptions, the net

percentage flow driven by the reclassification itself is the difference between the fraction

of the new index held by index-tracking investors and the fraction of the old index held

by index-tracking investors.




                                             7
       Although actual flows driven by reclassification events are difficult to track, it is

possible to obtain some rough upper bounds using Table 2. The key data in Table 2 are

the estimates of net percentage index ownership from MSCI. For example, classification

as an Emerging Market entails inclusion not only in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,

where the percentage of benchmarked ownership is high (45% as of June 2014), but also

in the All Country World Index, where the percentage of benchmarked ownership is low

(6% as of June 2014). The cap-weighted structure of the Indexes implies that

approximately 51% of a given Emerging Market is owned by benchmarkers at that date.

       A further promotion from Emerging to Developed, on the other hand, may

actually cause a net decline in index-tracking ownership, at least in recent years. The

country’s ACWI status does not change, but—in the most recent data—it stands to lose

its 45% ownership from its Emerging index affiliation while replacing this with only

about 32% from its new inclusions into the World index, the Europe, Australasia and Far

East index, or (typically) either the Europe or Asia ex-Japan index. This net decline may

be contrary to intuition, given that so many more dollars are benchmarked to Developed

than Emerging, and perhaps a general intuition that an upgrade must somehow be better

than a downgrade. However, in the same way there can be a larger clientele for a

corporate bond at one rating than at the next-higher rating, whether a country is upgraded

or downgraded need have no fundamental bearing on aggregate demand by benchmarked

investors.

       Using these coarse estimates to calculate reclassification-driven flows should be

done with great caution. First, fund families that track the old index in one vehicle and

the new index in another may be able to transfer some of their holdings through internal




                                             8
accounting, which would not contribute any price pressure. Second, actively-managed

funds using an index as a benchmark may, as a group, overweight or underweight some

countries relative to their actual index weights. Third, benchmarkers may decide that the

reclassification event is too small to be worth responding to any time soon. In general,

any tracking error and portfolio alpha consequences of a reclassification will typically be

far greater for the followers of the lesser-developed index, given its smaller total cap.

Fourth, to the extent that investability criteria differ between the old and the new index,

an upgrade means that some stocks will be sold by those benchmarked to the old index

and not bought by those following the new index; conversely, a downgrade means that

some stocks will be bought by those benchmarked to the new index but are not being sold

by those benchmarked to the old index. For example, when a market is moved from

Frontier to Emerging, a few stocks that were included in the Frontier will not satisfy the

new and stricter liquidity and size criteria. For these stocks, the demand by benchmarked

investors will actually fall, rather than rise dramatically. We return to this point below.

Finally, benchmarking is often a matter of degree. Our data do not distinguish between

funds devoted to indexing strategies and funds that are more loosely benchmarked. How

this distinction would affect the results is an interesting topic for future research.

        In light of such limitations, it is most appropriate to regard the net flows to

reclassifications implied by Table 2 as directionally correct for the majority of stocks,

especially on a capitalization-weighted basis. However, it is an idealized estimate of the

net flows that follow reclassifications and is most likely overstated for many less-

developed markets. We therefore group events simply by the ordering of net demand by




                                               9
benchmarkers—Emerging (highest), Developed, Frontier, standalone (lowest)—and do

not attempt to make detailed estimates of demand elasticities.



Returns Around Reclassifications



        The ultimate question is whether, and how, reclassifications affect returns.

Typically, when a market’s accessibility has been improving or deteriorating, MSCI

announces that it has been placed on a watch list, gathers feedback from institutional

investors over the next several months, and then announces a decision to reclassify the

market or to remove it from the watch list. If the market is reclassified, MSCI specifies a

date, again several months down the road, at which the reclassification becomes

effective.

        For most investors, the relevant dates involve the announcement and effective

dates of reclassifications. We look for patterns between the announcement and effective

date (excluding both dates themselves) and, to detect reversion, between the effective

date (inclusive) and one year afterward. We do not examine price dynamics around the

watch list date because it has no clear investment implication for the majority of

benchmarkers.

        We measure alphas on the reclassified country’s index in two ways. For investors

using the old benchmark, a relevant notion of alpha is the country index return over that

benchmark. For investors in the new benchmark, a relevant comparison is with the new

benchmark. For reclassifications from (to) standalone status, we calculate the old (new)

benchmark as zero and track total returns. With such a small number of events and the




                                            10
question of how to take account of differences in risk across what are already benchmark

indexes, more detailed risk adjustments are difficult. The Appendix lists all sample

returns for the concerned reader.

       A limitation of our returns data is the use of MSCI country indexes rather than the

precise subset of stocks affected by a switch. MSCI changes the constituents of the

country index when the market is reclassified. In an upgrade, some companies that were

allowed into the old index may not make the cut. For them, the selling pressure from

those benchmarked to the old index is not offset by buying demand from those

benchmarked to the new index. Likewise, in a downgrade, stocks in the old index will be

affected but additional stocks will now meet the new, lower bar. This issue is somewhat

ameliorated by the value-weighted nature of the country indexes, since the largest stocks

in the country will always be included in either the upgrade portfolio or the downgrade

portfolio. In any event, the use of country indexes typically biases our results against

detecting an effect.

       Figure 1 presents the main results. In the top panel, we track the average returns

on country indexes for the nine reclassifications that, according to the estimates in Table

2, most likely resulted in less ownership by benchmarkers. In these cases, there was

likely to have been net selling pressure as investors adjusted. The results are indeed

consistent with short-term selling pressure which subsequently abated. The average total

return between the announcement and effective dates was -12.5%, but this loss was more

than recovered in the 23.3% total return in the year after the effective date. Using returns

relative to the original index or the new index—two notions of alpha—leads to the same

impression of a large fall followed by a substantial reversion.




                                             11
       In the bottom panel, we track the average returns for the eight reclassifications

that most likely resulted in more ownership by benchmarkers, and therefore net buying

pressure around the event. Here, and also strongly consistent with an overshooting price-

pressure pattern, we see the opposite pattern in returns. There is a 23.2% total return

between the announcement date and effective date, but this is to a large extent given back

by the -12.4% return after the effective date. (We view the similarity in returns reported

in this paragraph and the previous paragraph as coincidental.)

       These differences in average returns between less- and more-benchmarked

reclassifications are so large that they are statistically significant despite the modest

sample size. For example, the -12.5% announcement-to-effective date total return in the

less-benchmarked case is significantly lower than the corresponding 23.2% return in the

more-benchmarked case (t = -2.1). The 23.3% post-effective total return in the less-

benchmarked case is significantly greater than the corresponding -12.4% post-effective

date return in the more-benchmarked case (t = 2.6).

       We cannot rule out a complete return reversal. The sample is too small and

returns are too variable to reject the hypothesis that the initial drop is equal and opposite

to the subsequent rebound in Panel A. Likewise, we cannot reject that the initial rise is

equal and opposite to the subsequent drop in Panel B.

       How do upgrades and downgrades compare? Buying pressure tends to be higher

for upgrades, so one might ask whether it is the direction of the reclassification that really

matters. An upgrade would seem to increase visibility and liquidity, after all, and such

effects might be reflected in positive returns even after the event. In unreported results,

we split the sample between upgrades and downgrades. The results are similar to the split




                                              12
across predicted net flows. (In fact, they are slightly weaker, but the sorts are hard to

separate statistically because the direction of reclassification and the direction of new

flows by benchmarkers are highly correlated.) The fact that the two splits lead to similar

results tells us something important and consistent with only the price pressure story. If

upgrades were good for valuations, they should be permanently good. If downgrades

were bad for valuations, they should be permanently bad. Instead, the data show that

alphas between the announcement and effective dates tend to revert in the same pattern

that we see in the Figure 1 sorts. A simplistic “upgrades are good for returns, downgrades

are bad” view of MSCI reclassifications is not as consistent with our findings as a

temporary price pressure explanation.

       What happens right around the announcement and effective dates? If the action is

too fast then both the implications for market efficiency and the strategic investment

opportunities are narrower. To investigate this, we excluded short windows around the

event dates, but found that the results are only slightly weakened. For example, the

average total return between two days after the announcement date and two days before

the effective date is -9.2% for classifications that decrease benchmarked ownership and

21.3% for classifications that increase it. These closely resemble the numbers in Figure 1.

The post-effective reversion effects are also similar upon excluding short windows

around event dates.

       Finally, we examined risk and liquidity patterns around reclassifications. An

interesting possibility is that the reclassified country index’s beta with respect to the new

index increases over time and the beta with respect to the old index decreases. Vijh

(1994) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler (2005) document such a pattern for S&P 500




                                             13
changes. We did not find any significant changes in the MSCI reclassification setting,

however. We also looked at the first-order autocorrelation of country indexes as a proxy

for liquidity, but we found no changes in autocorrelations for upgrades or downgrades.



Implications



       Our core finding is that countries transitioning into a less-benchmarked

classification face net selling pressure, and negative alpha, between the announcement

and effective dates. After the move becomes effective and the selling pressure abates,

there is a reversion with positive alpha. The opposite is true when countries move toward

a more-benchmarked classification. In each case the long-run return is roughly flat.

       These patterns do not matter for passive indexers devoted solely to matching a

benchmark. Those investors must rebalance at, or very near, the effective dates. But there

are important implications for benchmarkers that have discretion. Table 3 summarizes the

alpha-maximizing strategies implied by the evidence.

       In some cases, the best trade is unambiguous. When a market is downgraded from

Emerging to Frontier, for example, those benchmarked to the Frontier index should buy

on the effective date. This not only eliminates the tracking error of buying early, it avoids

the low returns associated with the net selling pressure between the announcement and

effective dates. Conversely, for upgrades from Frontier to Emerging, those benchmarked

to Frontier should wait to sell on the effective date. This allows Frontier benchmarkers to

ride the net buying pressure before the effective date and, again, eliminates tracking error.




                                             14
       In other cases, the optimal strategy is less obvious, and alpha effects must be

balanced against tracking error. Consider a reclassification from Frontier to Emerging

from the perspective of Emerging benchmarkers. Buying at the effective date has the

benefit of no tracking error. But it also means buying at the peak: the buying-pressure-

driven return between announcement and effective has been missed, while any post-

effective reversion has still to be endured. There are two strategies to avoid negative

alpha. One is to buy at announcement and hold through both the run-up and the reversion.

The other strategy is to buy well after the effective date, when the cycle will have played

out. Both strategies involve accepting some tracking error.

       The advice for absolute return investors is straightforward enough to not be worth

tabulating. They should underweight the reclassified market in situations when its

expected returns are low and vice-versa. Figure 1 clearly identifies these situations.

       The alpha point estimates in Figure 1 are, as usual, upper bounds on what might

have been attainable in practice. The MSCI country index returns being analyzed are cap-

weighted, so they already emphasize the most investable and liquid stocks. As of this

writing, expense ratios for MSCI iShares are less than 100 basis points and inside spreads

are 25 basis points or less, including for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the two

most recent cases in Table 1, which also had the highest total return between the

announcement and the effective date. But it would have been difficult for a U.S. investor

to take a large position in, say, Trinidad & Tobago after it was downgraded from the

Frontier index. And, of course, if the abnormal returns are created by price pressure in the

first place, trading to take advantage of them would tend to reduce profits.




                                             15
       An interesting question for future research is the extent to which market

reclassifications also affect unreclassified markets. Downgrades may require those

benchmarked to the new index to sell existing markets to accommodate a new constituent

market which may enter with a very high weight, perhaps 20% of the reconstituted new

index. Likewise, upgrades may lead to significant buying pressure across the remaining

old index members. It is possible that global equities benchmarking is now pervasive

enough to produce such spillover effects.

       To wrap up, MSCI market reclassifications do not happen every day, but when

they do happen they can be important events for thousands of asset managers and tens of

millions of end investors. The analysis of past reclassifications sheds new light on the

effects of benchmark-driven ownership and identifies strategies to help benchmarked

investors take best advantage of large, predictable price pressures.

Appendix. Returns Around MSCI Market Reclassifications. Returns are calculated using daily MSCI Standard Country Indexes to
account for intramonth event dates. Excess returns are calculated relative to the MSCI FM, EM, DM Indexes except where the market
is tracked as a standalone, in which case only its total return is considered. The “+1 Year” return is based on the return over the next
365 calendar days.
