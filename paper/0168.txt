        Wage differentials have been a topic of interest to economists for

                                been conducted with respect to skill and industry
many years. Analyses have

        economics literature has focused on the     importance of wealth rather than
labor

income,    and   more  specifically on the conscious decisions that individuals
make which      alter the nature of their earnings stream.4 Thus, we do not view
two individuals with the same current measured incomes as having the same real
 incomes   if    one is on a job track that will yield him   $50,000 per year at age

 30 and the other is on a profile that yields him $10,000 per year at that

 same age. Individuals are clearly not indifferent between varying rates

   was the result of the
                                        changes causing blacks' wages to rise.

   The
   differentials. But particularly for young workers, ignoring the human capital

   or wage growth component of earnings may seriously disguise wage differentials

   and    trends   in them. For example, suppose that governmental legislation made
                                     —2—



it increasingly difficult to discriminate in the form of differential pecuniary

wages. Employers would raise the observed wage for blacks while at the same

time decreasing the unobserved (or more difficult to observe) human capital

component and thereby keep the true differential constant. Since most govern-

ment programs concentrate on entry level job discrimination, and since differen-

tial on—the—job training does not show up until later, examinIng the pecuniary

wage rate for young workers may greatly distort the true wealth differential.

Indeed, almost any conceivable model of optimal law evasion would suggest that

employers would respond to legislation requiring equal pecuniary wage rates

across non—whites and whites at least in part by altering non—pecuniary aspects

of the wage. On—the—job training is, at least for young workers, a large part

of the non—pecuniary component. Both Welch and Freeman would miss this by

their techniques. Indeed, this may help explain why Freeman finds a narrowing

of the differential for young workers that is absent among older cohorts.

Since older workers have flatter profiles, there is less room to take back in

wage growth what has been given in pecuniary wage levels. Employer resistance to

elimination of pecuniary differentials is likely to be greater with respect to

older workers.

      This paper will employ a method (devised in Lazear (1976) )     to   estimate

the unobserved component of wages. The size of this component will be calculated

for non—whites and whites separately and then compared. Since, as it turns out,

the component is larger for whites than non—whites, observed wage differentials

understate true differentials. Furthermore, comparison of the period between

1966—1969 with the 1972—1974 period reveals that this unobserved differential

Increased substantially over time. The results of this study suggest that

although the pecuniary non-white —   white   differential has narrowed substantially

between 1966 and 1974 for young men, the on—the—job training differential has

Increased by almost the exact same amount. This implies that in real wealth
                                           —3—




terms   there has   not   been any narrowing of the differential at all. This will

become more apparent in later years as those non—whites who were hired into

skilled jobs today fail to be promoted or obtain higher paying jobs elsewhere

at the same rate as their white counterparts.



I. ANodel
        Consider   an   individual who has          an observed   earnings   stream, f(t) .     His

 true. earnings stream may be written as 1(t) where 1(t) includes the
 value of han capital paid to him. The value of the unobserved human capital
 payment is then defined as H(t) 1(t) — f(t) . When one invests in
 on—the—job training, the         potential earnings of that individual will grow

 over   tIme. 1(t)        does not measure          the potential earnings, but will necessarily

 be   at least as large as potential earnings. The reason is as follows: Let
 potential earnings, i.e., the amount that                 the individual would receive in the

 absence of investment in         on—the—job training be written as $(t) .                If an
 individual      undertakes investment in on—the—job in period t,                 the   cost of that

 investment is c(t)           $(t)   —   f(t)   .     The value of that investment, H(t) is

 equal to the present value of the amount by which potential earnings are

 increased     over the lifetime, or

                                                                   is the return to the total
 where T is the age of retirement. But H(t)
  investment in period t          and total         return necessarily is greater than or


  equal   to   total cost.5       That is, investment in human          capital   can   yield   infra—


  marginal profits. The individual pushes the rate of investment in any period
  to the point where the cost of increas.ng that rate exactly equals the returns •
                                                —4—



On the last increment of rate increase no profits are earned, but they are

earned on all inframargina]. increases. Thus, lifetime wealth is increased by


JTtH(t)
             —   C(t)]etdt               as the result of investment in on—the—job training.


It is f(t) + H(t) that is received by the individual, however, and this is

th'3 amount          that   constitutes real earnings. If one could observe q(t)             ,   eq.       CL)

would allow H(t) and therefore f(t) + H(t) to be determined. But only

f(t) can be observed. However, although +(t)                      f(t) ,   under certain cir—

         Above, C(t) was defined to be t) —               f(t).   Thus

or

(3)      f'(t)         '(t) —    c'(t)
so that if C'(t) equals zero, f'(t) —                 '(t).   If investment in on—the—job

training is approximately constant over time, then f'(t) will approximate

4'(t).    Thus, using f'(t) for

(4)      F(t)         f(t) + H(t)
                                      T—t
                 =    f(t)   + f'(t) f   erTdT    .
                                                                            -


                                     0

          Now the point addressed in the introduction can be discussed more

 igorously. Cross—sectional analyses of wage differentials only consider

 differences in the observed values of f(t) at some point in time. Yet

 eq.   (4)   reveals that this only tells part of the story.                    A true measure of

 the   wage      different.ia.1. is P(t) —
                                                FNW(t)
                                                          where NW and W refer to non-

 whites and whites, respectively. Since it is likely7 that H.(t) >
                                                                                          H(t)         ,



 the   wage differential will be understated by f(t) —                             .   In.addition,
                                                                         LNW(t)
 it may well be that trends in true differentials are dominated by changes in
                                             —5—



                     over time so that examination of observed wages obscures the
L(t)
        —
            L(t)
true   picture.
        Empirical verification of the propositions outlined above may be obtained.

Following the method described in Lazear (1976), a wage growth equation can

be estimated so that one can ascertain f(t) and f'(t) .               Once that is done

it is   a simple matter to estimate "true" wages by the approximation of F(t)
given in eq. (4).


II. Estimation.

        Theory8    and   e.mpirical   evidence tell us that investment in human capital,
in the form of forxnai. schooling and on—the—job training, is larger for
younger individuals than it           is   for older ones. Age—earnings profiles are
generally observed to be steeper in the early part of life so that f'(t)
is   a decreasing function of          (t) .   Therefore differences between measured
wages and "true" wages are likely to be greatest during the first years of
work   experience. For this reason, the two data sets to be used provide

information exclusively on young individuals. The 1966—1969 period is

analyzed with the use of the National Longitudinal Survey on Young Hen,

14—24 years of age in 1966. The 1972—1974 period makes use of the National

Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of l92. The first part of

this section will be devoted to examination of the 1966—1969 NLS. In the

second part we will compare results from this earlier period to those

obtained for the later 1972—1974 period.

       Observations were dropped for which no wage rate in either 1966 or 1969

was reported or for which information               was incomplete. The motivation behind this
particular form is discussed in depth in Lazear (1976) and Lazear (1976a) and

will not be examined here. Suffice it to say that the included variables are

those suggested by human capital theory which entered significantly into the

regression. Equation (5) may             be   rewritten as



                 —
(6)
                     W66   exp(çj +......+ 812566(AE))

and   as   such is a genera]. form for a growth          equation.   Further, the specifica-

tion   in (5) has the          advantage that it differences out unobserved    ability com-
ponents which affect wages            in both years. That is, it is equivalent to

allowing     each individual to have his own constant term in a wage levels
equation. This implies that the estimates obtained from (5) are not as likely
to be biased by omitted ability variables.
      One point should be made. The t in equations (1) through (4) refers
to experience time rather than chronological time. That is the f'(t) that
is relevant is that wage growth which occurs as the result of job experience
per se. It is only this component of growth that can be couited as part of
the wage rate. Residual wage growth that occurs as one "ages" even in the
absence of job experience is not part of compensation received while on the
                                                  —8—


Job and   should       not be counted        in   the total return. Thus,               z(t) shOu.Ld De

(7)       =

and   f'(t)        becomes                since E equals E69 when E66 is defined

to be period zero. If wage growth takes the form expressed in eq. (6), then

The interpretation of these coefficients is provided elsewhere [see Lazear (1976)1.

Basically, they suggest that positive changes in the stock of human capital

positively affect wage growth. Thus, the coefficient on tS (changes In the

stock of schooling) is positive and substantial. For the mean individual,

wages are only about 51 percent of actual wages where the latter include

value    of   wage growth that results from job experience.                The sheer magnitude of

the wage growth value for young men suggests that examination of differences in

this number across individuals may be important. Therefore, the expression                     is
evaluated for whites and              non—whites   separately, taking the conditional mean
values of the variables and              substituting     them into (11)

                        —   284.6
The measured wage differential between white and non—white young men in 1966

was $2.14 — $1.56 = $.58            .   The estimate of the true wage differential, on

the other hand, is a much larger $423 — $2.84 = $1.39.                 Even in relative

terms, the ratio of white to non—white observed wages is 1.37. The ratio

of white to non—white true wages is 1.48. Thus, neglecting the value of

different experience—earnings profiles between whites and non—whites leads to

serious understatement of true wage differntia1s.
                                    —11—



       Even the above calculation is likely to understate the true differential

for two reasons, both of which have to do with differences in labor force

behavior between whites and non—whites. First, since whites are less likely

to suffer unemployment than are non—whites and since they typically retire at

a later date° the time period over which (12), (14), and (16) are integrated

should be longer for whites. Thus, the assumption that T —          t   45 for all

individuals is likely to cause the estimate of the value of wage growth for

whites relative to non—whites to be understated.

       Second, since in any given year a white worker is more likely to be

employed than a non—white worker (once he begins full—time participation

in the labor force) (t)I1 and
                                       F(t)10 might    reasonably be weighted by

the probability of obtaining that wage.      This, however, to be conceptually

correct, requires a great deal of information on the value of leisure. If

the   world were in   equilibrium, the marginal value of a minute   spent   in leisure

must equal the marginal value of a minute of employment; i.e., on the margin

the value of leisure equals the wage rate. However, as changes in time worked

come in discrete blocks, the value of leisure of that discrete block.

of time must necessarily be smaller than     earnings. (This is simply the
result   of the diminishing marginal rate of substitution between leisure and

goods as leisure increases). The amount by whIch it is smaller depends upon

the utility function itself. Without information on the parameters of that

function it is impossible to choose correct weights for white vs. non—white

wages. This notwithstanding, the estimates of wage differentials obtained

above are lower bounds to the true differentials since both of those labor

force participation effects work in the direction of increasing the true

differential.

2. Decomposition of wage growth

        It is useful to consider the individual components of the unobserved wage

differential. From (11), it is clear that differences in
                                                                         w69     between whites

and non—whites result either from differences in the average wage levels across

groups (i.e.,            W66[exp(80
                                      + ....+                  W69) or from differences in the

effect of experience itself on growth rates (i.e., 86+ 88TJ69                +
                                                                                 312S66+ 13D)
it turns out, the most important determinant of differences in wage growth is

the grade of schooling completed, S66 .                This variable operates in three ways.

First, it causes there to be differences in the initial wage level, W66, since

        is itself dependent upon schooling level. Second, changes in S66 affect

the difference between                 and
                                                     since W69 W66 exp (Bo+.. .+811S66+812S6E
+ 813D(E)). Third, differences in                   S66 affect the degree to which job

experience affects wage growth since S66 interacts with LE in the wage

growth equation. Let us consider each in turn.

        One cannot infer directly the effect of schooling on the wage level in 1966 from

eq. (9). However, elsewhere (Lazear [19761) an analogous wage level equation

was estimated for the NLS young men. There, it was found that


               1nW66
                             .0606
                    66



Thus,               66
               aS                     66
                    66


This amounts to


               aw66
               as66
                                                 —13—




If non—whites, whose mean level of s66 is 10.988 years had the whitest

average schooling of 11.464 years, their mean wages in 1966 would have been



(17)                                          +9.45(11.464 — 10.088)

                             —   l69 per       hour rather than 156 per hour.



           Second, by substituting 11.464 as opposed to 10.088 in


                                    +
                 exp(B + •••             8l31,

one obtains that exp(80 +                      +813D(AEY) 1.547 rather than 1.551. (The

negative effect of increased schooling through 811 exceeds the positive

effect of 812E .)

           Third, and most important, is that the effect of job experience itself

depends upon schooling level. Adjusting this for the higher level of

schooling yields (86 + 88U69 + 812S66) = .0795                    as opposed to .0537 ith

S66 —       10.088 . Thus, if non-whites had the same ].evei. of schooling as whites,

                                     —14—




Since                 12.80     and                        21.13   ,
                                                 I
                D=O                                  D=1

correcting for differencies in the initial level of schooling removes about

96 of the differential experience effect. In terms of true wage rates, it

1xnlies that non—white wages would be



(19)
                                                           +   f(o.78)TdT

                              = $3.74 per hour.



Since the average white's true wages were estimated to be $4.23 ,        this    cuts the

true wage differential from the estimated l39Q to 49. per hour.

        Another term that interacts with E is a dummy for union membership.

Although the effect of this variable is sizeable, the probability of being

in a union did not differ between the whites and non—whites in this sample.

of   non—whites, .246 had U69 = 1.        For whites, the proportion was .243.

        It should be noted that the coefficient on D(E) for this early period

is close to zero. The differential experience—induced wage growth between

whites and non—whites during this early period is the result of differences

In initial conditions. This is not the case in the later period analyzed

below. There, the coefficient a D(EXE) is large and positive. Other things

constant, whites enjoy larger experience—induced wage growth than do non-

whites in 1972—1974 although this is not true during the early period.
                                              —15—




            A final   point   on white—non—white differences in wage growth are in order.

Despite all that has been said above, it is not the case that during 1966—1969

white young men's wages grew at a more rapid rate than that for non—white

young meti.       On the contrary,
    •




               w69—w661 —        55
                         D0

whereas


              w69—w66 — 47
        •
                W66. D=l

This difference is reflected in the coefficient on D which is negative,

although insignificant. This is quite consistent with the scenario out-

lined above. If firms have responded to government pressure to reduce white —

non—white wage differentials by reducing the wage growth component for non—

ybites relative to whites, initial observed wages will rise relatively for

non—whites. That is, since the group in question consists of young men who

are predominantly at entry level jobs, pecuniary wages of non—whites will

 rise on these jobs at a more rapid rate for non—whites than whites. This

 is reflected in the negative coefficient on D. Yet once those initial jobs

 are obtained, non—whites' experience will have a differential effect on wage

 growth than whites' experience. In       this early period, the differential
 effect       appears to be the result of differences in initial conditions. In
 the later period to be analyzed below, the differential experience induced
wage growth occurs even in the            absence of differing initial conditions.

 3. Some details
       In this section, the validity of assumptions made initially are tested

empirically. Eq. (3) states that if C'(t) =           0, 4(t)      f'(t) .    The question

then becomes how small must c be in order for c(t + c)            — c(t)   to be approximately

zero. In this study, a three year time span was chosen in order to obtain suffi—

dent variation in right—hand variables. The minimum time span for which data

are present is c      = 1 year. If c(t + c)       < c(t),   this implies that f"(t) <   0.

Thus, an estimate of f'(t) based on (f(t + 3) —             f(t)]/3 will   be smaller than

f(t + )     — f(t).    In order to see that estimates of e'(t) are insensitive to

the choice of c       , two   regressions were run identical to eq. (9) except that

all variables with 1969 subscripts were replaced first with their 1968 values

and then with their 1967 values.

       The question then is, do the coefficients of primary interest with

respect to f', namely 86 8' 8I2 and l3' differ significantly across years.

To test this, theestimates of these coefficients obtained from eq. (9) were

jnserted into the 1966—68 and 1966—67 equations. Then after constraining the

coefficients to take on these values, the regressions were rerun and the

sum   of   squared residuals were compared to those obtained in the unconstrained

versions. For 1966—68, it was found that F(4,904)               1.030. For 1966—67,

the corresponding value was F(4,693)              .410. In neither case do 6'8' l2'

anid l3 taken jointly differ significantly from those obtained from the 1966—

69 regression. The conclusion is that the choice of                 3 years yields a

value of f' which is a good approximation for '.

       A second way to define             is in terms of life—cycle rather than

chronological time.           In   order to test the sensitivity of f'       to differences

in life—cycle time, an (Age)(E) interaction term was added to Eq. (9).

The coefficient on this variable was insignificant so the assumption that,
                                                                                   12
for these ages, f' is invariant with respect to age, is borne out.
                                     —17—


          Given that some of these individuals are currently enrolled in school,

 it is interesting to perform the analysis on non—students. Eq. (5) was

 therefore rerun, deleting the S and ST terms on the non—student subsample.

 This reduced the number of observations to 1021 and standard errors increased

 as expected. However, the primary findings remained the same: (l966) 'Dl = $4.46

 while F(1966) 'D       $1.94, yielding a true differential of $2.52. The observed

 wage rates were f(1966)IDl — $2.65 and f(1966)ID...0 = $1.74 so that the

 observed differential was 9l per hour.

B. The NLS High School Class of 1972:

    1. Estimation

      In this section, longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal

Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLSHS) will be used to estimate

the unobserved on—the—job training component of earnings during this

later period. This sample, although similar to the NLS for 1966—1969,

has some important differences. The major difference is that all indivi-

duals in this sample were enrolled in twelfth grade in 1972 so no early

high school drop—outs are contained. This also implies that the age

distribution of respondents is much more tightly centered around the

mean age in 1972 than was the 1966—1969 sample (although the difference

in mean ages is not that substantial). Furthermore, there is virtually

no variation in initial schooling levels during October, 1972, the date

of the initial wage rate. These differences imply slight differences in

the forms of the wage growth equation (obvious ones are deletion of

initial   schooling and age variables), but the basic form is the same.
      The NLSHS is a national probability sample of about 22,000 high
school seniors. A survey was taken during the Spring of 1972 and two
follow—ups were conducted in October of 1973 and 1974. For the purposes
of this analysis, a sub—sample of males who had wage rates reported and

who    supplied    complete information on the other relevant variables was

s2lected. (2393 individuals fit this category.) The basic estimating

equation for this period was:

Making    the   same assumptions as were made in eq. (12), we can estimate the

true total compensation for whites           and non—whites, respectively. For whites
in 1972,


(24)            F(1972)I1 = f(1972)ID1          + 60.3.         dt


                            = 257 + 597

                               854/hour

         For non—whites itt. 1972,


(25)            P:(1972)I0 =   f(1972)IDO + 34.1 fe dt
                               255+337
                               592C/hour

What is important to note is that although there was virtually no wage differential

observed (whites earned on average $2.57/hour while non—whites earned $2.55 in 1972),

the on—the—job training differential was substantial: It equalled $5.97 — $3.37

or $2.60 per hour. In real terms, the true differential in 1966 ($1.39 per hour)

inflated for six years at a rate of 6% is equal to $1.99 per hour. Thus, there
                                      —20—


  is, if anything, an increase in the true differential for 1972. The major

  distinction is that the pecuniary differential narrowed substantially while

  the unobserved on—the—job training differential expended by a greater amount.

  This may be a response to government pressure to reduce pecuniary wage differen-

  tials.

           It should be noted that in this equation the coefficient on D(E) is

  positive and relatively large (although its standard error is also quite

  large). This was not the case during the first period analyzed. There it

  appeared that, initial conditions the same, experience—induced wage growth

 was not larger for whites than for non—whites. The difference there arose

  from differences in mean initial conditions. Here, even holding all else

  constant (including initial wage), the experience induced wage growth is

  larger for whites than for non—whites. The difference of the coefficients

  on D(tE) between 1966 and 1972 is equal to .0950 with a standard error of

  .0694. Thus, although there is a somewhat large standard error, there

  appears to be some evidence for a change in the coefficient on D(E) over

  time, as well as evidence for changes in the difference             —
                                                                D=1
                                                                          AE D0



2. Some useful comparisons

      Before reaching the firm conclusion that whatever narrowing of the pecuniary

ditferential has occurred has been offset by increases in the OJT differential,

some points should be made.

      First, it is important to note that 1966—1969 was a period of rapid

economic activity while 1972—1974 was a recession. (The unemployment rate for

white males 16 years of age and older averaged 2.6% between 1966—1969 and

4.2% between 1972 and 1974.) This has major implications for the estimates

obtained.
                                         —21—


           Note, for example, that the coefficient on initial experience (E66 and

     E ) bounces   from negative to positive. The negative coefficient on E        is

     explained elsewhere (see Lazear 1976) as reflecting the fact that OJT   is
     acquired during the first years at work. The positive coefficient on
                                                                             E72
     is likely to capture the fact that given initial wage rates, more senior

     workers are less affected by recessions than are their more junior counterparts.

     If this is the explanation, the effect is sufficient to offset the tendency to

     invest more during early years. Similarly, DII had a positive sign in the

     1966—69 regression, but a negative, one later. The reversal may be due to

     simultaneity bias brought on by recessionary changes. If the recession lovers

     the wages of some workers, in the short run they may increase their hours worked.

     This finding has shown up in past work.13 Thus, the negative coefficient or 1ii

     might reflect the fact that those individuals who experience relative

     declines in wages also iicrease their hours worked during recessions.

(.         Another difference across periods which may result from differences

     in business activity relates to the levels of the on—the—job training com-

     ponent. The absolute magnitude of this compensation is much larger

     between 1972 and 1974 than it was in the earlier period. There are at

     least two possible explanations. First, along the lines of Butler and

     Heckman (1976), the differential attractiveness of welfare payments to

     low v. high income individuals will tend to cause only the most able workers

     to remain. This is especially the case during recessions (since more drop

     below the point at which this alternative source of income is acceptable)

     so that the 1972—1974 sample of individuals who are working is of higher

     average ability than the sample of workers during 1966—1969. (They are

     also more able in that they all have attended school through grade twelve.)

     If, as is likely to be the case, the more able invest more in on—the—job
                                       —22—



taining, this would show up as a higher OJT componrtt for the mean working

individual between 1972 and 1974. Second, I have argued elsewhere, (Lazear

(1974) ),   that   it is rational to acquire OJT to a greater extent during

recessions than during expansions. If so, the difference between the

two periods would be a manifestation of this phenomenon.

      The point raised by Butler and Heckman (1976) has other implications

for this analysis. For example, it helps explain the total disappearance

of a pecuniary wage differential y 1972. Since non—whites are more likely

to be pulled out of the labor force by alternative welfare payments, those

who remain will be of higher average quality than the working whites. This

would result in a narrowing of the differential. It cannot, however, account

for the finding of this paper that the non—whites' gains in pecuniary wages

were offset by losses in OJT compensation. In fact, the effect works in

the opposite direction. Since during recessions, non—white males exit

the employment force to a larger extent than do whites, the 1972—1974

period has relatively high quality non—'hites. Since they are the indi-

viduals most likely to invest in OJT, the white—non—white OJT differential

would narrow between 1966 and 1972 on this score. It does not. Selectivity

effects are not sufficiently large to disguise the substitution from

pecuniary differentials to OJT differentials.

      The fact that pecuniary wage differentials have narrowed to a greater

extent for the highly educated can be explained by these findings. Since

education and OJT were found to be complementary, highly educated non—whites

had a larger OJT component in 1966 than did the less educated. If, say,

the same proportion of OJT was reduced for all non—whites, pecuniary wages

would rise by more in absolute terms for the highly educated. This would

imply a greater narrowing of the differential for this group. Note that

the narrowing of wage differentials to a larger extent for educated groups
                                    —23—


is inconsistent with Butler and Heckman (1976). This explanation reconciles

thair story with the observed result since true differentials do not seem

to have narrowed at all.

     A final point is that the R2 on the 1972—1974 regression is considerably

lower than the     for 1966—1969. The later data set deals with a much more

homogeneous group than the former. (There is no variation in initial schooling

and very little in age and previous experience.) Thus, regressions on the

NLSHS are asked to perform a much more difficult task than are those on the

original NLS.

 3. More details

       In this section, some of the points considered for the 1966—1969 analysis

 are examined for the 1972—1974 period.

       First, the 1972—1974 regression was performed for the non—student sub-

 sample. Again tS, ST, and (LS)(E) were deleted. Standard errors increased,

 but the coefficient on D(E) was still positive and substantial at .09002
              —                       —                           (.07988)
 Furthermore, F(1972)IDl = $10.06 and F(1972)     = $6.46 yielding a true

 differential of $3.60 per hour. The observed differential was only $2.64 —

 $2.56 or 7 per hour. It should also be noted that the $2.52 differential
 obtained for the non—student group in 1966, when inflated at six per cent

 per year, becomes $3.61 in 1972 dollars. This compares quite favorably

 to the estimated $3.60 differential for 1972.

       Again, the test for an (Age)(E) interaction was performed. Neither

 age, age(E), nor the two taken jointly entered significantly. Nor did

 stratification of the sample into two separate groups on the basis of age

 yield significantly different results.

 Summary and Conclusion:

      This paper suggests that calculations of white — non—white wage differentials

which are based on observed monetary wage rates understate true differentials

by a substantial amount. This is the result of differences in the steepness

of the age—earnings profiles across groups, the value of which should be

capitalized and added to current earnings. For young men, for whom the

effect is likely to be strongest, the normally measured wage differential was

found to be 58 per hour in 1966. The "true" differential, which includes

the capitalized value of wage growth, was two and one half times as large. For

1972, the observed differential was 2 per hour. The true differential was

$2.62 per hour. Even in terms of relative wage differentials the point

remains valid. The observed relative wage rate was 1.37 in 1966 and l.Ol

in 1972. The true relative wage rates were 1.48 in 1966 and 1.44 in 1972.

This implies a much smaller narrowing than appears from examination of

pecuniary wages.

      The most important conclusion is that although white — non—white pecuniary

wage differentials were eliminated between 1966 and 1972, the true differential,

which includes the value of on—the—job training, remained approximately the same.

This may reflect a national response on the part of employers to government

pressure to narrow pecuniary wage differentials, especially for young workers.

       It was found that about 95 percent of the unobserved differential in

 1966 could be eliminated by bringing the average level of non—whites' school-

 ing, currently at 10.088 years, to that for whites, at 11.464 years. This

 results primarily from the fact that on—the—job training seems to be comple-

mentary with level of schooling attainment so that, other things equal,

 highly schooled individuals have steeper age—earnings profiles.

      Finally, this paper has considered only one aspect of unobserved earnings,

namely payment In the form of human   capital.   For young men, this is substantial,

amounting to as much as one—half of total earnings. Other unaccounted for remuner—
                                   —25—

                                                               benefits, taxes, ana
                                Differences in non—pecuniary
ation ay also have effects.
                                                            analysis would bring
                         likely to enter. A more complete
job security, also are

these differences in as well.

11. Regressions estimated separately for whites and non—whites did not yield

     significantly different sum      of   squared residuals from the combined

12. Theory tells us that, at least over some range, C'(t) must be negative.

     (This is because C(T) =    0.)   That we cannot reject the hypothesis that

     C'(t)    0 does not imply, of course, that its value is non—negative.

     However, C'(1966)IDl is likely to be more negative than C'(1966)!D....Q

     because initial levels of investment for whites are higher and both

     C(T)ID1 and C(T) 'D 0 equal. zero. Thus, C'(1966)ID1 — C' (1966)

     is likely to be very small indeed. Therefore, the amount by which

     also likely to be small. The same argument applies for 1972 as well.
