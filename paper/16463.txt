The Impact of College Education on Geographic Mobility: Identifying Education Using Multiple
Components of Vietnam Draft Risk

                                             ABSTRACT

We examine whether higher education is a causal determinant of geographic mobility using variation
in college attainment induced by draft-avoidance behavior during the Vietnam War. We use national
and state-level induction risk to identify both educational attainment and veteran status among cohorts
of affected men observed in the 1980 Census. Our 2SLS estimates imply that the additional years of
higher education significantly increased the likelihood that affected men resided outside their birth
states later in life. Most estimates suggest a causal impact of higher education on migration that is
larger in magnitude but not significantly different from OLS. Our large reduced-form estimates for
the effect of induction risk on out-of-state migration also imply that the Vietnam War led to substantial
geographic churning in the national labor market. We conclude that the causal impact of college completion
on subsequent mobility is large and provide evidence on a range of mechanisms that may be responsible
for the relationship between college education and mobility.

         Data from the 1940-2000 U.S. Censuses show that the long-distance migration rates of

college graduates are roughly twice those of high school graduates.1 This gap is similar in magnitude

to the log wage gap between college and high school graduates toward the end of this period.

Strikingly, these migration rates by education group have been largely stable over these six decades,

despite large increases in post-secondary educational attainment. This is consistent with the

possibility that higher education has a causal impact on the geographic mobility of its recipients, but

without a credibly identified empirical analysis we cannot rule out other explanations for this pattern,

such as falling transportation and communication costs.2 However, in contrast to the extensive

evidence on the causal contribution of education to the wage gap (Card 1999 provides a survey),

little is known about the role of education as a causal determinant of geographic mobility.

Geographic mobility may afford an individual a larger choice set over jobs and locations and may

also reflect an ability to respond appropriately to spatial disequilibria across labor markets. As such,

it would constitute an important return to schooling that is distinct from increased wages. In this

paper, we use exogenous variation in college going to provide the first credible analysis of the causal

relationship between education and geographic mobility.

         We use variation in college attainment induced by draft-avoidance behavior among cohorts

of men affected by the Vietnam conflict to isolate the causal effect of education on geographic

mobility. This approach is inspired by Card and Lemieux (2000, 2001a) who document the excess

educational attainment among cohorts induced to enter college as a means of deferring conscription

into the Armed Services during the Vietnam conflict. While Card and Lemieux focus on differences

in induction risk across birth cohorts, we also exploit state level variation in induction risk within

1 This is true for both migration measures in the Census: out of birth state residence and migration across state/county
lines in the past five years. We discuss these measures in more detail later in the paper. For early evidence on
educational migration differentials, see Ladinsky (1967), and Greenwood (1975). Wozniak (forthcoming) and
Greenwood (1997) provide more recent evidence. Ferrie (2005) provides important evidence on migration rates and the
migration-occupation mobility link over the past 150 years, but educational attainment is only available in the Census
beginning in 1940.
2 Migration rates within an education group would fall as educational attainment increased if the propensity to migrate

were a normally distributed unobserved characteristic correlated with college going, as in a simple selection explanation
for the differential in migration rates.

cohorts. The existence of state level variation allows us to decompose national induction risk into

its constituent parts: induction risk faced by a young man’s own state cohort and risk faced by young

men of that cohort in the rest of the country. The decomposition yields two instruments, which we

use to identify the two endogenous variables—education and veteran status—in our empirical

application.

         This is the first use of a two instrument strategy to address the endogeneity of both

education and military status that is common in studies using changes in military policies as

instrumental variables (Angrist and Krueger, 1992; Bound and Turner 2002; Stanley 2003;

MacKinnis 2006).3 The use of two instruments allows us to generate estimates of the causal effect

of higher education on geographic mobility that are free of bias arising from the correlation between

veteran status and either educational attainment or the individual error term. Of equal importance,

our strategy exploits state-year level variation in induction risk to identify the college enrollment

decision. This is a significant advance over studies that use the Card and Lemieux measures to

identify college going using only year to year variation in induction risk (De Walque 2007, Grimard

and Parent 2007, and MacInnis 2006). Our robustness analysis reveals evidence that the

assumptions required to identify higher education from the time series variation in induction risk

alone are unlikely to be satisfied.

         Finally, our identification strategy is particularly appropriate for studying the impact of a

college education on internal migration. The increased incentives for college going in our setting

leave the relative price of attending any given college unchanged, and thus our instruments

encourage college going without affecting which college a student chooses. In other words, our

instruments increase college-going in a more general way than other instruments previously

employed in the literature, such as proximity to college and variation in state tuition policy (Card

1995; Dynarski 2008). These instruments have provided useful estimates of the return to college

3 Angrist and Krueger (1992) faced an identical problem in their study of the effects of educational attainment on

earnings using draft lottery numbers to identify educational attainment.

education, but because they increase access to college by lowering the price of some colleges relative

to others (usually on the basis of geography), they are less appropriate for studying education’s effect

on mobility because of exclusion restriction concerns. This is an important consideration—

particularly when the outcome is mobility—since attending a local college may have different effects

on the outcome than attending a distant college. On this basis, our strategy will appeal to those

interested in identifying the effect of higher education on migration in the absence of relative price

changes. However, we also examine how our results might differ if we used “policy-style”

instruments based on college availability and tuition inducements.

        Using micro-data from 5% samples of the 1980 U.S. Census of Population, we provide both

OLS and 2SLS estimates of the effect of college education on geographic mobility. In cross-

sectional OLS regressions, we observe that an additional year of higher education is associated with

an increase in an individual’s probability of residing outside his birth state at mid-career of three

percentage points, or approximately ten percent of the mean of this variable. When we instrument

for college with cohort-level induction risk, the causal effect of an additional year of college on

geographic mobility is generally larger, but estimates range from 1.9 percentage points to 6.7

percentage points. Moreover, large reduced-form estimates for the effect of induction risk on out-

of-state migration suggest that the Vietnam War led to substantial geographic churning in the

national labor market.

        After presenting our estimates of the causal impact of college going on mobility, we consider

the mechanisms through which college may have this effect. We show that our results are driven by

increased educational attainment at the post-secondary level alone, not through increases in

education generally. This suggests that the particulars of the college experience or skilled labor

market are likely drivers of the education-migration relationship, rather than increased cognitive

skills. We find evidence of a role for the migration experience of “going away” to college in




                                                    4
explaining later adult migration, but other mechanisms, including the geographic diversity of one’s

peers and the nature of the college labor market, appear to play important roles as well.

        The notion that education can provide valuable skills which make individuals more

productive in the workplace is well-established in the economics literature. However, the analysis of

the relationship between education and labor market outcomes has tended to focus on one of two

aspects of this relationship. The first is reduced form, quasi-experimental evidence that education is

causally linked to higher earnings (Card 2001). The second is that education improves measured

cognitive ability, which is one channel through which education is assumed to affect earnings

(Johnson and Neal 1996; Cascio and Lewis 2006). There is less, but growing, evidence that

education is causally linked to other important outcomes, such as health (Adams 2002; Currie and

Moretti 2003; Lleras-Muney 2005; Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney 2009). Similarly, there is growing

interest in and evidence that education confers skills other than cognitive ability that are rewarded in

the labor market (e.g. Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne 2001; Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua 2006;

Borghans et al. 2008).

        Our paper makes contributions to both these growing literatures. First, we test for a

reduced-form, causal relationship between education (specifically higher education) and geographic

mobility. This has important implications for individual welfare. Geographic mobility, like health,

expands the set of choices available to an individual and is therefore an important component of

individual utility. Similarly, mobility may have a direct impact on individual earnings, magnifying its

importance as a determinant of utility (Wozniak, forthcoming; Bound and Holzer, 2000). In addition

to its effect on an individual’s choice set of consumption bundles, Shultz (1961) and Bowles (1970)

both identified migration as a major form of human capital investment. Our paper can therefore

shed light on how one form of human capital investment may encourage another.

        This leads to our second contribution to the literature. By focusing on geographic mobility

as an outcome, we expand the notion of human capital acquired through schooling to include a


                                                   5
broader set of skills and attributes. A causal link between education and migration would imply that

geographic mobility is one of the “returns” to higher education. Because migration has long been

modeled by economists as the appropriate response to labor market disequilibria, finding a causal

link between education and mobility can potentially add much to our understanding of what

education confers. There was a period in which leading labor economists considered the question of

whether education confers the ability to respond to economic disequilibria, but this line of analysis

withered without resolution.4 Examining the nature of the relationship between education and

geographic mobility may provide new insight into this important question.

         Finally, concerns about immigration policy’s displacement effects on natives (Borjas 2006)

and about the need for and effects of geographic reallocation in the recent global downturn also

make it a timely outcome for study (Dougherty 2009).

         The paper proceeds as follows. Section II explains our identification strategy. Section III

describes the data and estimating equations, and IV presents our main results. Section V

investigates mechanisms for the causal effect of education on migration, and VI concludes.



II. Identification Strategy

         We extend an instrumental variables strategy inspired by Card and Lemieux (2000, 2001);

hereafter CL. They show that Vietnam era induction risk varied significantly across birth year

cohorts due to differences in military manpower requirements and cohort size. They find that

young men responded to an increased risk of induction by attending and completing college at

higher rates than pre-draft cohorts.5 College enrollment was a well known and virtually foolproof

way to defer conscription. The Military Service Act of 1967 stated that college students in good



4 Nelson and Phelps (1966) postulate a higher return to education in the presence of technological change and Welch

(1970) provides some related evidence. Schultz (1975) offers a survey of studies examining the ability to deal with
disequilibria.
5 Specifically, increased induction risk led to significant deviations in male college attainment gains from the inter-cohort

path traced out by females, whose attainment gains followed a similar trajectory to that of pre-draft males.

standing could defer induction until receipt of undergraduate degree or age 24, whichever occurred

first. Prior to 1967, deferment for the purposes of four-year college enrollment was guaranteed in

practice as local draft boards issued deferments for a variety of reasons including school attendance.6

Although new college deferments were eliminated in September of 1971 with the introduction of the

draft lottery, those currently enrolled were able to retain their deferments. Thus, the incentive to

enroll was great: among “fit” men, risk of induction was [eventually] very high.7 CL estimate that

male college attendance would have been 4 to 6 percentage points lower and graduation 2

percentage points lower had male college attainment in these cohorts followed the female path. Like

CL, we use variation in college attendance and completion generated by draft avoidance behavior to

isolate the portion of college education that was induced by policy changes on the part of the U.S.

government from that which would have been chosen by individuals independent of the policy

change.

          An artifact of our identification strategy for education—using draft avoidance behavior—is

that the likelihood an individual is a veteran also varies across cohorts in our sample. Veteran status

is a plausible determinant of geographic mobility (Pingle 2007), and may be correlated with the

individual error term in much the same way that education is. Our equation of interest therefore

contains two endogenous variables. To deal with this, we could exclude veteran status from our

included controls. This would generate a biased estimate of the causal impact of education on

mobility, but the size of the bias might be estimated using formulas for omitted variables bias and

assumptions about the magnitude of the causal effect of veteran status on mobility.8

          Instead, our approach is to deal with the problem of multiple endogenous variables directly.

We exploit state level variation within the cohort level variation identified by CL in order to obtain

6 Tatum and Tuchinsky, Guide to the Draft, Ch. 3. By contrast, enrollment in a two year college was not considered
grounds for automatic deferment. Students at two year programs were only eligible for occupational deferments under
the same rules as those already employed. See Rothenberg (1968).
7 CL provide a rough estimate of the risk of being drafted conditional on not enrolling in college.
8 This is the approach taken by Angrist and Kreuger (1992). If the coefficient vector is estimated using instrumental

variables, the estimate is not guaranteed unbiased if the model contains more endogenous variables than instruments.

separate instruments that can be used to identify both higher education attainment and veteran

status simultaneously. The existence of state-cohort level variation allows us to break national

induction risk into its constituent parts, yielding two instruments.

A. Constructing Multiple Instruments: State and National Level Induction Risk

            Institutional factors caused induction risk to vary across states within a cohort as well as

across birth year cohorts. Responsibility for devising and meeting the national target number of

conscriptions rested with the federal Department of Defense (DoD). To achieve this target, the

DoD issued monthly “draft calls” that divided the national number into quotas assigned to state

draft boards, which in turn did the active work of ordering men to be inducted. The monthly state

quotas sum to the national draft call each month.9

            CL use total inductions nationally as the numerator in the following annual measure of

induction risk for a birth cohort:

                                               I bt
(i)                  CL induction risk 
                                               Nbt

where I is the number of inductees from a birth year cohort, N is the number of men in that cohort,

b indexes birth years, and t indexes calendar years since a cohort was at risk to be drafted for several

years. Similarly, young men residing in state s faced state cohort risk that is analogous to the CL

measure, where s indexes state of residence:

                                                I sbt
(ii)                  state cohort risksbt 
                                                N sbt

            State cohort risk is our first instrument. (We postpone the details of its construction until

Section III.) We then use our state level data on I and N to construct a second instrument in the

following manner:

                                                        I  sbt
(iii)                 national cohort risksbt 
                                                        N  sbt

9   Information in this paragraph is based on Shapiro and Striker, Mastering the Draft, Chapter 20.

                                                                  8
            This measure defines national cohort risk for a man living in state s and born in birth year b

as the number of inductees from all other states –s and birth year b, divided by the total number of

such men. This is highly correlated with CL’s measure (i) but varies across state-birthyear cohorts.

The inclusion of the national and state cohort risk measures is similar to the inclusion of state and

national unemployment rates in the right hand side of a regression (as in Ziliak, Wilson and Stone,

1999). Our final measures of state and national cohort risk are actually averages of the measures in

(ii) and (iii) over the years a young man was ages 19 through 22. This follows CL, who argue that

this average induction risk best reflects the draft-based incentive to stay in college.

            State level variation in induction risk—such that the probability of induction was not equal

to (i) for all members of cohort b—arose for several reasons. First, the high degree of autonomy

enjoyed by local draft boards generated variation in draft risk across local boards. Davis and

Dolbeare identify three sources of variation in local board risk, “…[1] variation based on differences

in socioeconomic characteristics of jurisdictions; [2] variation among states based on differences in

policy interpretations provided to local boards and exaggerated by success in achieving

standardization around such particular practices; and [3] variation produced by idiosyncratic

discretionary decision-making by local boards.”10 They later write, “The conclusion seems

inescapable: local board autonomy implies both within state and between state variability, even

among socioeconomically similar board jurisdictions.”11

            A second source of state-year variation in induction risk were the severe communication

delays between the federal, state, and local officials in charge of the draft. These delays meant that

local draft boards knew the number of registrants available in their jurisdiction at a point in time

while the DoD assigned quotas using registrant numbers that were several months old. Thus draft

risk for an eligible man at a point in time was not only a function of the number of men in his state

currently eligible for the draft but also of the number available several months ago. The current

                                                                9
pool could be much larger than the past pool if, for example, a large number of local men graduated

high school thus becoming draft eligible or much smaller if a large number married or aged out of

the draft pool in the intervening months. In practice, boards were encouraged to have just enough

eligible registrants to match the number of inductees they would be asked to produce in response to

the next call. Under this pressure, the communication lags led to a cobweb-type feedback loop as

boards struggled to achieve the successful “standardization” identified in item [2] of the Davis and

Dolbeare list.12

            We examine our exploited state-year level variation in Figure 2, which graphs the variation in

state-level induction risk for a selection of states over our period of interest. Panel A shows raw

induction risk (i.e. quantity (ii)) while Panel B shows residual induction risk after controlling for a

time trend, state-of-birth fixed effects, and national risk as defined in (iii). It is apparent from Panel

A that some states have higher levels of induction risk associated with them on average. However,

because we include birth state fixed effects in our main specification, this is not part of our

identifying variation. The data in Figure B more closely approximates our identifying variation. (In

practice we will add other controls to our 2SLS specifications.)

            There are two things to notice in Figure B. First, there is indeed variation across states in

the induction risk that is not explained by fixed state characteristics alone. Second, relative

induction risk in a state appears to fluctuate smoothly over time. This is consistent with the known

sources of cross-state variation in draft risk. While Davis and Dolbeare identify purely idiosyncratic

variation in board decision-making (their item [3]), the other sources of state and local variation in

risk would tend to generate smooth fluctuations in state relative risk. For example, if the

demographics of a local board jurisdiction are changing smoothly such that more men are aging into

the draft pool but the local board is slow to adjust the number of deferments it grants because of

pressures to achieve standardization, then risk will slowly decline in this jurisdiction over time.

These smooth fluctuations do not pose a threat to our identification strategy as long as our

instruments meet the IV assumptions.          If this is the case, then the problems for statistical inference

posed by serial correlation in our instrumental variables (as opposed to purely idiosyncratic

fluctuations over time) can be handled through appropriate standard error adjustments along the

lines discussed in Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). (Also see footnote 24 on this.)

B. Do Our Instruments Meet the IV Assumptions?

        Our instruments need to meet the fundamental requirements of IV: joint significance in the

first stage, the exclusion restriction, and the monotonicity condition for the interpretation of our

estimates as local average treatment effects. We present our first stage results in a subsequent

section, but as our IV strategy is new to the literature, the other two requirements bear some

discussion.

        The exclusion restriction requires that the components of draft risk had no influence on

migration choices except through the channels of college attainment and veteran status. Our

instruments could fail to meet this restriction if young men attempted to exploit local level variation

in induction risk by moving between localities. Draft board policies prohibited this type of “local

board shopping.” Rothenberg (1968) notes that it is a myth that “you [can] change draft boards the

way you change your patronage of a supermarket or a bank.” A young man was required to register

with his local board at age 18, and this remained his local board for his entire period of draft

eligibility. In the event that he did move away, his original local board always maintained final

decision making authority over his draft eligibility although some particulars of draft processing may

have been handled by a board closer to his new residence.13




13 Rothenberg (1968) p. 48. We have also consulted several reference guides on the draft—books written for young men

at the time to inform them about their draft duties and obligations—to determine whether the practice of board
shopping may have been common even though it was prohibited by board policy. We find no evidence of this. See
Evers (1961), Tatum and Tuchinsky (1969) and Sanders (1966). Only later did advocates of reforming the Selective
Service System highlight this variation.

                                                        11
           A more likely scenario is that draft risk increased the likelihood that a young man attended

college at a significant distance from home since marginal college goers may have had to search

more widely to find a college that would accept them. If true, this scenario does not imply a

violation of the exclusion restriction. Rather, it implies that local treatment effects we identify are

particular to the setting from which we take our exogenous variation (something which is common

to all instrumental variables applications). Our effects may be larger than other causal estimates of

the same parameter if going away to college is an important mechanism through which college has a

causal effect on mobility.

           Finally, it is well known that some men enlisted voluntarily in order to secure safer military

assignments. (The Texas National Guard is an example.) Again, this possibility does not constitute

an exclusion restriction violation. This is simply another channel through which the draft

“encouraged” military enlistment. The other channel is the local draft board’s threat of

incarceration.

           Monotonicity requires that there be no “defiers” in the population—i.e. individuals who

would have gone to college or become a veteran in the absence of the draft but who did not do

these things because of the draft (Angrist and Imbens, 1994; Angrist et al. 1996). It is difficult to

test for such a subpopulation directly, and most IV applications assume there are no defiers. We

are, however, somewhat concerned that blacks may have been crowded out of college slots by large

numbers of whites attempting to avoid conscription, a violation of monotonicity. In light of this, we

examine the sensitivity of our results to this assumption by estimating our key models separately for

blacks and whites. We find no difference in the key parameters across these subgroups, suggesting

that any individual instances that violate the no-defiers assumption do not generalize to the black

population as a whole.14

III. Sample Construction and Estimating Equations

         Our data on men in the “Vietnam generation” come from the IPUMS microdata 5% sample

of the 1980 Census. (Ruggles et al., 2004). The main cohorts of interest to CL were men born

between 1935 and 1955. We focus on a similar set of cohorts because these men turned 19, the age

of peak draft risk, during the period when induction risk made its dramatic rise and fall with the

Vietnam War. However, due to data limitations on state-level induction rates and enrollment, we

must restrict our sample to men born between 1942 and 1953. Since these cohorts experienced the

largest rise and fall in induction risk, we do not lose much time series variation relative to CL by

excluding the earlier and later cohorts.

         The measure of migration we employ in this paper is a dummy variable indicating that an

individual resides outside his birth state when we observe him in the Census. This is equivalent to

an indicator for whether he is residing outside his birth state at a certain age—i.e. his late 20s or early

30s. This measure captures long distance migration that generally involves a change of local labor

markets.15 Because long distance moves involve changing labor markets, we feel they are a more

appropriate outcome measure than short distance moves given our interest in the relationship

between education and the ability to make changes in the face of disequilibria. We can also show

that educational differences in 1-year and 5-year migration rates are similar to those in the out of

birth state measure over longer distances.16 For example, college graduates are roughly twice as

likely as high school graduates to have moved across state lines in the last five years. This gap

narrows slightly for older individuals and when the one year measure is used, but the educational

differential remains substantial. By contrast, both the 1- and 5-year migration rates show that high

school graduates are considerably more likely than college graduates to have moved within their

county. This is particularly true at younger ages. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that our

15 See Saks and Wozniak 2009 for a discussion of the measurement error involved in assuming a move across state lines
involves a move between local labor markets.
16 We tabulated 1-year and 5-year migration rates for 20 to 45 year olds in our four education groups from the 1981

Current Population Survey and the 1980 Census, respectively.

                                                         13
measure is a good proxy for the likelihood of a long-distance move over shorter time horizons.

However, we prefer the lifetime rates since they more closely approximate a stock of migration

choices rather than a flow as do the five-year rates.17

         The main shortcoming of the dummy variable measure is that it is potentially confounded by

parental migration patterns. It is well known that an individual's education level is correlated with

that of his parents, and thus some of the observed migration differentials using this measure could

arise from more educated parents moving their children (who potentially go on to get more

education) across state lines. Fortunately, the migration advantage that more educated parents

confer to their children is small compared to migration differentials observed across education

groups later in life.18 Thus we interpret migration rate differences observed according to our

measure as reflecting migration undertaken by individuals themselves rather than their parents.

         We use birth state to proxy for residence state at the time of the draft. Evidence in Wozniak

(forthcoming) shows that although this assumption generates measurement error by misclassifying

individuals into incorrect states of residence at draft age, the misclassification error is not

substantially different across education groups.

         Our identification strategy requires that we choose a measure of education, since we cannot

separately identify the effect of one level of higher education from another. To inform our choice

of education measure, we explore the impact of our instrument on educational attainment. Figure 3

plots the coefficients and standard errors from separate regressions of educational attainment at

each grade level and higher (inclusive). The figure shows that increased induction risk increased

male educational attainment at all post-secondary levels. Our main estimates use years of schooling



17The one year rates are only available in the CPS.
18Using the NLSY 79, Wozniak (forthcoming) shows that the difference in rates of out of birth state residence at age 14
across individuals who go on to become high school graduates and college graduates is small, around four percentage
points. Most of the education group differential in migration rates among 30-year-olds in the NLSY using our Census
measure represents migration that occurred after age 14. Of course it is possible some migration is driven by the
decision about where to attend college. This mechanism could potentially explain education group differences in
migration and we consider it later in the paper.

as our education measure but we also present alternative specifications using discrete measures such

as graduating or attending college.

         It is possible that measurement error in education (in any of the measures) could bias our IV

estimates, along the lines explained by Black et al. (2000) and Kane, Rouse, and Staiger (1999) for

cases of non-classical measurement error in an endogenous variable.19 Unfortunately we are not able

to implement the bounding procedures developed by these authors, since we do not have the

second independent observation on an individual’s educational attainment these corrections require.

We simply note this is a concern in most IV estimates of the returns to schooling. However, we will

show that our conclusions are robust to alternative measures of educational attainment. This is

reassuring since these measures suffer from potential bias to different degrees. College completion

has been shown to be the most accurately measured higher education outcome and to contain little

measurement error overall (Black et al. 2003). Years of schooling, while suffering from non-classical

measurement error to some degree, is unlikely to be plagued by error that is purely negatively

correlated with the recorded value, as is the case with the dummy variable schooling measures.

Measurement error is likely of greatest concern in IV results using the college attendance dummy to

measure education.

         To construct the measures in Equations (ii) and (iii), we obtained data on the number of

inductees from each state for each six-month period spanning 1952 to 1972 from reports of the

Selective Service and converted these into electronic format. Like CL, we measure cohort size (at

both the national and state levels) using data on school enrollments of 17 year olds. We estimated

state cohort size using enrollment numbers spanning 1959 to 1970, the academic years in which our

cohorts of interest were in 11th grade.20 Thus state-cohort level risk (hereafter state risk) for a young



19 Kane et al. (1999) note that the direction of the bias is not clear in the general case of non-classical measurement error

in the endogenous variable, although Black et al. show that in some 2SLS specifications the IV estimates constitute an
upper bound on the true parameter.
20 We also check our estimates using enrollment in 10th grade. For 1959 and 1960, we only have information on

enrollment in all high school grades so we divide this figure by 4.

                                                             15
man born in Alabama in 1950 equals the number of inductees from Alabama in 1969 (the year he

turned 19) divided by the number of students enrolled in 11th grade in Alabama in 1967. National

level risk for the same young man roughly equals the number of men inducted nationally in 1969

divided by the size of his birth cohort; more precisely, we subtract own state inductions from the

numerator and own state cohort size from the denominator. Like CL, we construct an average draft

risk for the years a man was 19-22 since draft risk was non-trivial for men ages 20 to 22.

         Our basic second stage estimating equation is the following:

(1) moveisb   X isb   yrsisb   vet isb   trend isb   i   isb

move is our indicator for out of birth state residence, yrs is years of schooling completed, vet is a

dummy variable for veteran status, trend is a linear time trend entered as i’s birth-year cohort, X is

our set of demographic controls (which includes indicator variables for black and Hispanic), and Θ

is a complete set of state of birth dummies. As before, s indexes state of birth and b indexes birth

year. Since our sample is drawn from only a single cross-section of Census data, we omit time

subscripts. yrs and vet are predicted from first stage equations that includes the remaining right hand

side covariates in Equation (1) plus stateriskisb and nationalriskisb as defined in (ii) and (iii), respectively.

All estimation is done via standard linear 2SLS.21

         All covariates in (1) are included in all subsequent specifications; in our tables, we refer to

these as the “demographic controls”. The inclusion of age is equivalent to a year of birth trend in

our cross-sectional data. Age also accounts for national (linear) trends in male college completion.

We allow for state of birth fixed effects to account for different rates of geographic mobility across

states. This also removes variation arising from states that have persistently higher or lower than

average induction rates, which may be correlated with other state characteristics which are in turn

correlated with migration rates. Industrial composition, which may affect both migration choices


21See Wooldridge (2002) pp. 622-624 concerning 2SLS versus an approach with a probit first stage when the
endogenous variable is a dummy variable. In some cases, the latter is more efficient but may tend to produce larger
point estimates. Given our concerns about possible upward bias, we implement 2SLS estimation.

                                                          16
and induction rates if deferments are routinely granted for certain types of work, is one example of a

potential confounding factor that state dummies remove.

         We also show results for two additional specifications that include an expanded set of

controls. The first adds two variables to capture labor market conditions facing a cohort at the time

of the college enrollment decision: a measure of employment conditions and the log of cohort size.

Employment conditions are measured as the employment to population (epop) ratio in the

individual’s state of birth the year his cohort turned 19. Cohort size is measured as the log of the

number of respondents from a birth year cohort in the 1960 Census. The epop measure

approximates state labor demand conditions facing a birth year cohort at the time they decided to

enter college. Log cohort size approximates the labor supply available to meet those conditions.

Together, we believe these measures capture labor market conditions that may have occurred

alongside changes in state-level induction risk and that are thought to influence college enrollment

decisions.22 Both factors may also be independently related to inter-state mobility levels within a

cohort. Saks and Wozniak (2009) show that internal migration rates, including inter-state migration

rates, are procyclical. The literature on cohort size suggests that large cohorts have relatively poorer

educational and behavioral outcomes than large cohorts. Although we know of no work that links

cohort size to mobility, we include it since cohort differences in other outcomes may be related to

mobility potential. The second additional specification adds nine linear birth region trends to this

expanded set of controls. These trends further account for changes in college-going or migration

that may have been correlated with changes in state level induction risk.

         We restrict our analysis to men. As women were not subject to induction at the time of the

Vietnam War, we do not expect to find large treatment effects of male induction risk on female

college going. This implies that women might make a useful comparison group, and this is how CL

treat women in their analysis. They assume that the trend in female college attainment is the

22 The literature tends to find no consistent, significant relationship between local labor market conditions and college

attendance (Wozniak, forthcoming; Card and Lemieux 2001b).

                                                            17
appropriate counterfactual trend for male college attainment in the absence of the Vietnam War.

This allows them to calculate excess college going by men. However, there are reasons to believe

that female college attendance may have been affected by male college going during the Vietnam

years, with large inflows of men into college either crowding out women who would otherwise have

attended or encouraging more women to attend to take advantage of marriage market prospects.

Moreover, while women may or may not make an appropriate counterfactual for men in the context

of college going, marriage markets that link men and women in their geographic location decisions

mean that they certainly are not a useful counterfactual in the context of migration. For these

reasons, we prefer to control directly for counterfactual male trends in college going and its co-

occurring determinants—as outlined above—rather than indirectly as is suggested by the CL

approach. Finally, our use of state-year variation means identification is generated in part by

comparing men from different birth states to their peers in a given birth year cohort. This within-

cohort identifying variation reduces the need to find comparison groups outside our men in cohorts

of interest. We also estimate our main specifications on two placebo groups of men to show that

our results are unlikely to be explained by changes across birth states and over time in college going

other than those captured by our instrumental variables.

       Descriptive statistics from the Census samples of the cohorts we consider are given in Table

1 which summarizes the variables used in our analysis using the sample of men born between 1942

and 1953. Migration is a common outcome in our sample, with roughly one-third of men living

outside their birth states and the average man living over 300 miles from his place of birth. Our

main demographic controls include age, veteran status, and state of birth. Veteran status is a

dummy variable equal to 1 if an individual reported Vietnam era service.

       Figure 1 plots the means of selected variables separately for each birth year cohort. The

course of the draft expansion across cohorts is evident in Panel A, which also shows the high

correlation between our measure of national risk in (iii) and CL’s measure in (i). The increase in


                                                  18
male college going is also visible in Panel A, particularly for cohorts born between 1944 and 1950,

during the main rise and fall in induction risk. Panel B of Figure 1 plots our measures of education

and migration (adjusted for a basic set of controls) alongside our national risk measure. This is

essentially a graph of our reduced form results. It is clear that migration and educational attainment

increase along with national induction risk across cohorts.

         The inclusion of controls in our 2SLS regressions removes a large amount of variation from

our instruments. To assess the remaining variation, we regressed both risk measures, (ii) and (iii),

separately on the sets of controls just described. The R-squared from all six versions of this

exercise—two outcome variables times three sets of controls, used in Tables 3 through 6 below—

ranged between 0.25 and 0.42. This means that we are using approximately two thirds of the

variation in the risk measures to identify our endogenous variables.23



IV. Results from the Vietnam Generation

A. First stage and reduced form results

         Table 2 presents first stage results using the sample of men described in Table 1 based on

our basic Equation 1 specification as well as the two augmented specifications. We maintain the

convention of showing results for all three specifications for our main results. We also maintain the

convention of clustering our standard errors at the birth year level in specifications using only a

single instrument or national aggregates for cohort size and the employment rate. In specifications

using both instruments or state level measures of cohort size and employment rates, we cluster the

standard errors at the birth state-birth year level. 24 In Panel A, national and state cohort risk are

entered separately as the only variable identifying years of schooling. This is similar to the approach


23 Most of the variation is explained by the inclusion of the linear trend in age and another non-linear variable. In our

exercise, this was the national unemployment rate, but we did not perform an exhaustive set of regressions that
examined all possible subsets of our control variables.
24 We have also explored some specifications using multi-way clustering on both birth year and birth state, following

procedures suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2006). The standard errors on the coefficients increase
somewhat, but the qualitative results remain similar.

                                                            19
in other studies in which education is assumed to be the only endogenous variable. This is not our

preferred approach to identification, but we present the results for the purpose of comparison.

         The results in columns (1) through (3) of Panel A show that a 10 percentage point increase

in national cohort risk (roughly the entire range of this variable) increased the average years of

completed schooling in our sample by 0.35 to 0.45 years with the impact declining somewhat as we

add additional controls to the basic specification in column (1). These estimates show that cohorts

with higher national risk also attain more years of schooling. This is consistent with Figure 1 and

the results in CL (2000, 2001). Although our specification differs from that of CL, the magnitude of

our coefficients is similar and the F-statistics suggest that this first stage has substantial power.25

         We repeat the first stage estimates using only state cohort risk as the identifying variable in

columns (4) through (6) of Panel A. When national cohort risk is excluded, state cohort risk

positively predicts college graduation rates for men in our sample although the point estimates are

slightly smaller than those generated by national risk alone. We speculate that the similarity in the

estimates of the effects of the two risk measures is driven by the strong correlation (of 0.93) between

our state and national cohort risk measures.

         Panel B shows first stage equations from our preferred approach of identifying both years of

schooling and veteran status in Equation 1. For transparency, we estimate two separate first stage

equations—predicting college graduation and veteran status—although 2SLS estimates these

equations jointly. Consistent with the manner in which 2SLS identifies endogenous variables, both

equations include national and state cohort risk as identifying variables.

         Columns (1) through (3) in Panel B show that, as in Panel A, increased national induction

risk is strongly associated with increases in years of schooling. The point estimates here are

somewhat larger than when national risk is included alone, indicating increases of 0.5 to 0.6 years of


25Table 1 in Card and Lemieux (2001a) shows estimates corresponding to 4.6 percentage point increase for college
graduation. Using our specification with a dummy variable for college graduation as left hand side variable suggests an
increase of 3.5 to 4 percentage points in college completion for the same change in induction risk.

                                                           20
schooling over the range of in induction risk in our sample. On the other hand, years of schooling

are insignificantly or negatively related to state cohort risk when national induction risk is included.

This is in sharp contrast to the relationship between years of schooling and state risk in Panel A,

which suggests that increases in schooling attainment are largely driven by variation in national risk.26

         It is not clear a priori what relationship we should expect between state risk and years of

schooling in the Panel B specifications. If young men were unaware of their state level risk, we

would expect no relationship, as we see in column (1). On the other hand, if young men were aware

of their state risk, we might expect a positive relationship between state risk and years of schooling

as men “dodged in to college” more in riskier state-years. We find no evidence of this. Instead, in

the augmented specifications we find a negative relationship between state risk and years of

schooling. We can think of at least two reasons for this. First, it may be the case that state risk

increased a young man’s likelihood of becoming a veteran and that being a veteran in turn decreased

his likelihood of attending college. This is not unlikely, given that the well known hostility toward

the war that prevailed on many college campuses may have deterred some veterans from attending.

Alternatively, the negative relationship in columns (2) and (3) may be an artifact of the high

correlation (collinearity) between national and state level risk, which may be exacerbated by

including the non-linear controls for cohort size and employment rate. The coefficient pattern

across Panels A and B—in which state level risk positively predicts education when national risk is

excluded and the point estimates on national risk increase when state risk is included—is consistent

with collinearity (Verbeek 2000 and Wooldridge 2002). 27

         Neither interpretation of the results in columns (2) and (3) of Panel B invalidates our IV

strategy. Ex ante, increased state and national risk both increase the likelihood that a man becomes

26 National cohort risk was relatively easy to judge as national draft calls were widely reported while deviations of state

cohort risk from national were unknown ex ante. These facts suggest to us that state cohort risk had relatively more
influence on an individual’s veteran status while national cohort risk influenced his likelihood of college attainment.
This independence in the roles of the two instruments is not necessary for identification. All that is required in the 2SLS
method we apply is that the number of instruments equal or exceed the number of endogenous regressors.
27 Authors’ simulations show that the probability of collinearity alone generating coefficient estimates of opposing signs

on two variables that are significant at the 5% level is about 1 in 20.

                                                            21
a veteran and that he attends college; this is the required monotonicity condition. Conditional on

becoming either a veteran or a college attender, a young man may then be less likely to also become

the other. Indeed, this is why the draft drove young men into college. This simply highlights the

desirability of including controls for education and veteran status simultaneously in our setting.

Multicollinearity does not affect the predicted value of the left hand side variable, although it has

obvious effects on the coefficients estimated for the collinear variables.28 Thus collinearity does not

introduce systematic bias since the predicted values of the endogenous variables in the first stage are

correct in expectation, although it may contribute to imprecision in our second stage estimates.

         Columns (4) through (6) address the second endogenous variable in Equation 1. These

show that national and state cohort risk both covary positively with veteran status. This is

reassuring since higher rates of induction at both the state and national level should lead more young

men to go to war. We interpret the fact that the coefficient on national risk exceeds that of state risk

in the veteran equation to mean that the time series variation in draft risk generated by the massive

fluctuation in military manpower demands is responsible for more of the variation in veteran status

than are the differences in induction risk across states.

         Table 3 presents reduced form estimates of the impact of induction risk on our measure of

geographic mobility.29 These results are striking. The estimates show that increases in national

cohort risk are associated with a large positive increase the likelihood than an individual is residing

outside his birth state. Men from the highest risk cohort are 8 to 13 percentage points more likely to

reside outside their states of birth than men in the lowest risk cohort. This difference is the

equivalent of roughly one-fourth to one-third of the mean of this variable in Table 1. Once state

cohort risk is included, the impacts of national risk on mobility are even larger and state cohort risk

has generally weak negative impacts on migration. The remainder of the paper is devoted to

 Note that we drop specifications using only state cohort risk to identify education in our subsequent analysis. This

demonstrating that higher levels of college graduation are the mechanism driving these reduced

form estimates.

B. 2SLS estimates of the effect of higher education on migration

        Table 4 presents our main estimates of interest. We show results from the estimation of

Equation 1 via both OLS and 2SLS and with and without a control for veteran status. When we

follow the single instrument strategy (for comparison), as we do in Panel A, we exclude the veteran

status control since it is believed to be endogenous. We use our national risk measure as the single

instrument for years of schooling in this case. Our preferred estimates are in Panel B, where we

instrument for both years of schooling and veteran status using our two risk measures.

        In columns (1) through (3) of both panels, we report our OLS estimates. An additional year

of schooling is associated with a 3 percentage point increase in the likelihood that a man resides

outside of his birth state. This estimate is robust to the inclusion of additional controls across

specification columns and to the addition of the veteran status control in Panel B. Consistent with

our concern that veterans may be more geographically mobile than non-veterans, we find that

veteran status is associated with a 4 percentage point increase in our migration measure. If men who

are willing to serve in the military are also willing to move geographically, this relationship could bias

our estimated coefficient vector and it is the reason we need to instrument for veteran status as well

as education.

        Columns (4) through (6) of Panel A show results from 2SLS estimation of Equation 1 and

its augmented versions using national risk to instrument for years of schooling and omitting veteran

status from the equation. Years of schooling have an insignificant relationship to migration in

column (4), but the augmented specifications in (5) and (6) show a positive and significant – and

precisely estimated – relationship. As is often the case in the literature on instrumented returns to

schooling, the IV estimates exceed the OLS estimates, in our case by a little over 25%.




                                                   23
         Columns (4) through (6) of Panel B show our preferred estimates from 2SLS estimation of

Equation 1 using our two induction risk instruments to correct for endogeneity in both years of

schooling a veteran status. The estimates of the causal impact of years of schooling on migration are

larger than in the single IV estimates of Panel A, although they also cover a fairly large range. The

smallest estimate implies that an additional year of schooling raises the probability of an out of state

residence by 4.4 percentage points while the largest implies an increase of 6.7 percentage points.

The 2SLS estimates in Panel B have large standard errors, but this is not surprising given the added

imprecision our two instrument strategy entails and all are significant at conventional levels.30 The

estimates across all three 2SLS specifications in Panel B consistently imply a large causal role for

years of higher education schooling in determining geographic mobility. Interestingly, after

instrumenting veteran status has no significant impact on subsequent mobility. This indicates that

the significant relationship between veteran status and mobility in the OLS equations is in fact

driven by selection of more geographically mobile men into the military.

         The OLS coefficient on college graduation typically lies within the 95% confidence interval

around our 2SLS estimates because the latter are estimated with large standard errors. We can

compare the estimates from our OLS and 2SLS estimates more formally using a Durbin-Wu-

Hausman test for endogeneity. We can reject the null hypothesis that OLS and IV are the same at

the 5 percent level for estimates in column 4 of Panel B of Table 5. In the other five cases, OLS and

IV estimates are not statistically distinguishable.31

C. Discussion of 2SLS Magnitudes and Specification Checks

         We consistently find estimated treatment effects that equal or exceed OLS estimates. On the

one hand, this pattern is not uncommon in the literature on instrumented returns to education, and


30 Additionally, there is some cause for concern about the consistency of the standard errors in the single-instrument
estimates, since the number of clusters in that case is small. Our preferred estimates alleviate this concern since the
number of clusters is sufficiently large. See discussions in Bertrand et al. (2004) and Wooldridge (2003).
31 The F-statistic of this test for the 2SLS specifications in Panel A of Table 5 are 0.78, 0.99, and 1.00 respectively (p-

values of 0.3960, 0.3407, and 0.3395); the F-statistic of this test for the 2SLS specifications in Panel B of Table 5 are
6.11, 1.82, and 1.90 respectively (p-values 0.0310, 0.2048, 0.1958).

                                                              24
we generally cannot reject equality of the OLS and 2SLS impacts. 32 Two standard explanations

immediately come to mind. First, as is also the case in the returns to schooling context,

measurement error might bias OLS estimates downwards. This bias might be more likely in our

sample if older respondents are more likely to misreport educational attainment in retrospective

surveys. Eliminating bias due to measurement error can increase IV estimates above OLS estimates.

A second possibility is that heterogeneity in the response to treatment leads to local average

treatment effects on the marginal college graduate (identified in our 2SLS estimates) that differ from

the average effect (identified in OLS). We examined evidence for this in the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth by dividing an NLSY sample of men into groups whom we considered a priori to

have different propensities to complete college. We found that the OLS returns to college

completion were higher among groups who were more likely to be marginal college attenders in the

Vietnam era—specifically, men in the upper quartile of the AFQT distribution and with mothers

who had some college education. We interpret this evidence as suggestive of the possibility of

heterogeneous treatment effects.33

           It is also worth considering the possibility that the historical setting of our instrument leads

to larger treatment effects in the cohorts we examine than would be found in a more culturally

neutral experiment. The atmosphere surrounding the decision to avoid Vietnam by going to college

may have served to heighten an existing difference between marginal and inframarginal college

graduates in a manner that increases the estimated causal impact of college on mobility. For

example, if marginal college graduates are less similar to their family and high school friends than

inframarginal college graduates, they may find it easier to relocate over long distances leading to

heterogeneous treatment effects and the resulting 2SLS > OLS coefficient relationship.

Unfortunately we have no way of testing this claim. While we allow that the historical setting we use

may contribute to our large estimates, we do not believe that the causal impact of college on

32   Card (1999) addresses the differences between OLS and IV estimates of returns to schooling.

mobility is potentially zero. The array of evidence strongly suggests a large causal effect of college

graduation on mobility.

         We conducted a number of tests to examine the robustness of the results in Table 4. First,

we repeated the Table 4 analysis using alternative educational attainment measures: dummy variables

for college attendance (measured as 13 or more years of schooling) and for college graduation (16 or

more years of schooling). The results are reported in Appendix Table 1.34 College graduation is

associated with a higher probability of out of state residence among men in our sample than is

college attendance. Consistent with this, our IV estimates of the causal impact of college

completion are somewhat larger than our estimates of the causal impact of college attendance

(although these are not statistically distinguishable due to the large standard errors). In general, our

estimates tell the same story regardless of the measure of education we use.

         We also estimated the 2SLS equations on data collapsed to birthstate-birthyear cells. This is

the level of our variation, so it is natural to consider obtaining estimates using collapsed data. We

present the results of this exercise in Appendix Table 2. The point estimates are nearly identical to

those in Table 4, and although our standard errors increase somewhat, all the main results retain

statistical significance at conventional levels.35 Additionally, dropping national induction risk and

replacing the trend with birth year dummies in the Table 4 specifications—which forces our

identifying variation to come solely from cross-state differences in induction rates—does not

qualitatively alter our conclusions, nor does using overall national cohort risk as defined in (i) instead

of (iii) as our education instrument.

         Finally, in Table 5 we report the results of two placebo style analyses. These are intended to

verify that the causal relationship we identify is in fact driven by the response of young men in our



34 Since the inclusion of veteran status does not affect the OLS coefficient on education in these specifications either, we

only report one set of OLS results. 2SLS estimates with national risk only exclude veteran status from the equations.
2SLS estimates using both instruments include veteran status and treat it as endogenous.
35 We weight each cell by the number of observations used to compute it, in order to correct for differential precision of

our estimated averages. Results without weighting are essentially unchanged, but the standard errors increase further.

                                                            26
affected cohorts to the induction risk they faced. First, we re-estimate our reduced form

specifications for men in our same sample of cohorts using data from the 1960 Census. At this

point in their lives, these men had not yet been affected by the incentives for higher education

associated with the Vietnam draft. If the cohorts who would eventually face the greatest draft risk

were somehow also more likely to have migrated by our measure before the draft, this might mean

our causal estimates in Table 4 are spurious. It would suggest high-risk cohorts were somehow

different from low-risk cohorts in a way that might lead them to have both higher educational

attainment and migration rates.

        The results from this exercise are in Panel A of Table 5. In four of the six specifications we

find no relationship between the draft risk a man will face in the future and his out of state residence

in 1960. In two of the specifications, however, men who will face high national risk are also more

likely to have moved out of their birth states prior to 1960. We believe this suggests estimates using

national risk alone to identify years of schooling in our augmented specifications should be

interpreted with caution. However, our preferred specifications and the basic specification using the

single IV do not suffer from this concern.

        In Panel B, we estimate our 2SLS models on a set of placebo cohorts. Unfortunately, there

is no ideal placebo group on which to run such a test. We use men born between 1930 and 1941—

the twelve cohorts preceding those in our sample—who were too old to be affected by induction

orders during the Vietnam conflict although by virtue of their age these men were not subject to the

same non-draft related cohort factors experienced by the men in our main sample. Nevertheless,

the estimates in Panel B show no significant relationship between education and migration when we

use our Vietnam draft risk measures to identify years of schooling. This is consistent with our claim

that our instruments affect educational attainment only for our main sample of cohorts and that it is

the higher education of these cohorts that leads to increased migration.




                                                  27
V. Mechanisms behind the Causal Relationship

            Our results suggest a large causal role for higher education in geographic mobility. This

causal effect may operate through either direct or indirect channels. On the one hand, higher

education may directly confer skills or provide information which enhances the ability to undertake a

long distance move. Individuals may develop general cognitive skills that facilitate the accumulation

of information about alternative employment possibilities in other places. Moreover, individuals

may actually gain information about new opportunities for migration either through attending

college away from home or by interacting with peers who come from other places. In addition,

individuals may gain some moving-specific skills because attending college may itself necessitate a

move across state lines. A college education may also lower the psychic costs associated with

migration by fostering openness to new experiences and awareness of national or global issues may

lessen the difficulties of adjustment in a new place.

            On the other hand, higher education may indirectly affect the likelihood of undertaking a long

distance move. Research shows that increased schooling is causally related to higher wages (Card,

2001). If moving involves a fixed monetary cost, higher incomes may increase migration. Obtaining

a college degree also alters the set of possible occupations that are available for recent graduates.

Across the United States, the market for college graduates is often considered more geographically

integrated than the market for lower-educated workers. If the skills associated with a college

education are marketable in many regions, this may make it easier to consider moving out of state.36

Finally, education may alter other non-economic characteristics such as marriage which can affect

the likelihood of geographic mobility (Lefgren and McIntyre, 2006).

            We are able to provide credibly identified evidence on two of the mechanisms mentioned

above: exposure to a geographically diverse set of peers and a move out of state to attend college.

We obtain exogenous variation on both dimensions using data on public and private four-year


36   See Bound et al. (2004).

                                                      28
college enrollment from the 1980 HEGIS survey (conducted by the National Center for Education

Statistics). We created two separate rankings of states: the “out of state” ranking and the “diversity”

ranking. The first ranks states according to the shares of their college-attending natives getting their

degrees out of state, with quartile 1 having the lowest shares of its natives attending college out of

state and quartile 4 the highest. If the experience of moving to go to college is an important channel

behind the causal impacts we estimate, we might expect the college migration premium to be larger

for natives of the highest quartile states. The “diversity” ranking divide states into quartiles

according to the geographic diversity of their college populations measured using a Herfindahl

index.37 The idea in this case is that exposure to a geographically diverse set of fellow students

might increase one’s awareness of other labor markets or even improve one’s network in distant

locations, thereby increasing the migration premium to higher education in these states.

         We use our sample of Vietnam era men from the 1980 Census to estimate versions of our

main 2SLS specification in which years of schooling has been interacted with quartile indicators for

each of the two state rankings. Since this specification now contains five endogenous variables—the

four interactions with schooling plus veteran status—we instrument using interactions of the four

quartiles with national risk plus (non-interacted) state risk.38 The results, including OLS estimates,

are shown in Table 6.

         We find that for natives of states in the bottom quartile of out-of-state college going, the

OLS migration premium to an extra year of schooling in our sample, of 0.019, is significantly lower

than that for natives in the higher quartiles who get returns of above 0.03. As was the case with the

2SLS estimates of the migration premium in earlier tables, the estimates in Table 6 have large

standard errors. These prevent us from saying definitively whether the causal effect of higher



37 The states in each set of quartiles are listed in Table 6. While there is some overlap between a state’s quartile ranking

on one dimension and its ranking on the other, there seem to be enough differences for the measures to capture
different dimensions of the college experience.
38 We find qualitatively similar results when estimate these effects using interactions of the four quartiles with national

risk as well as interactions of the four quartiles with state-;level risk (an overidentified specification).

                                                             29
education on migration is larger for natives of one quartile than another. The point estimates

suggest, however, that the premium may be higher for natives of states in the middle of the out-of-

state college going distribution. In the case of the geographic diversity of one’s college peers, the

OLS estimates show no consistent difference in the schooling migration premium across natives

from states in the four quartiles of this distribution. Again, the 2SLS estimates are noisy, but they

suggest that the causal impact of higher education on subsequent migration may be higher for

natives of states in which the college system enrolls a more geographically diverse set of students.

         From the Table 6 results we conclude that while there is some evidence that going to college

out of state increased a man’s likelihood of residing out of state later, this is only part of the story.

The relationship between out-of-state college going propensity across states and subsequent

migration of that state’s college educated natives is far from linear. Moreover, our estimates using

variation in the geographic diversity of a state’s college population suggest that exposure to peers

from other places may also play a role in subsequent mobility. While these conclusions are limited,

we nevertheless believe they are a helpful step in understanding the nature of the relationship

between higher education and migration.39

         Lastly, we turn to alternative instrumental variables techniques to shed further light on the

mechanisms behind the causal relationship we identify. As explained in the introduction, we feel our

strategy is the most appropriate of several alternatives for identifying a “pure” effect of [higher]

education on geographic mobility. However, because alternative identification strategies use policies

that affected educational attainment in particular ways, we can compare the results from our main

specifications to those using alternative IV strategies in order to assess how different policies affect

the migration-education relationship. If the manner in which educational attainment was increased




39 These results are consistent with what is known about the causal effect of attending college out of state (Groen 2004)
or studying abroad (Parey and Waldinger 2009) on subsequent labor mobility choices. In our analysis, however, we
attempt to distinguish between the two distinct but correlated channels of “going away” for higher education and
exposure to a more geographically diverse set of peers.

                                                           30
matters for our results, this would suggest that the particular policy may have also affected one of

the channels through which education has its effect on migration.

         In Table 7 we present results from our main specification (or its nearest approximation,

given data constraints) estimated using three leading alternative instruments for educational

attainment: quarter of birth, new college openings, and state merit aid policies.40 Details of the

estimation are given in the table notes. Panel A shows the results of estimating our three main 2SLS

specification using quarter of birth to instrument for years of schooling. We find no evidence of a

causal impact of years of schooling on migration using this identification strategy. This has two

important implications for our main results. First, since quarter of birth increases educational

attainment at the high school margin and not the college margin, these results imply that it is years

of college only that causally impact adult migration, not simply education at any level. Second, since

education alone is not enough to increase mobility, these results downplay the importance of

cognitive ability as a mechanism in the education-migration relationship.41

         Panel B shows the 2SLS results for our main equations using the Currie and Moretti (2003)

college openings instrument to identify years of schooling. In this case, the instrument is number of

colleges in a man’s state of birth in the year he turned 17, divided by his state cohort size at age 17.

Higher educational attainment is identified using variation in the per capita number of colleges

available to 17 year olds across states and over time. The results show a large, negative impact of an

additional year of schooling on migration. This is in striking contrast to our main results and to the

OLS estimate. We believe the difference is due to the way in which the instrument affects

educational attainment. The college openings instrument operates by encouraging marginal college

attenders to go to a college nearer their home and specifically in their state of birth. If going away to

40 These were originally exploited for identification purposes in Angrist and Krueger (1991); Currie and Moretti (2003);

and Dynarski (2008).
41 The estimates in Panel A also serve as a valuable specification check for those concerned that some unknown

mechanical relationship leads to estimates of overly large causal impacts when we instrument for education in a
migration equation. On the other hand, there are important concerns about the consistency of 2SLS estimates obtained
using the quarter of birth instrument, particularly in a setting such as ours with very limited controls for family
background (Buckles and Hungerman, 2008).

                                                           31
college is an important channel through which higher education increases mobility (as the results in

Table 6 suggest), then an instrument that effectively shuts down that channel should be expected to

produce different estimates of the education premium on migration. Moreover, if college graduates

require labor markets with more high skilled jobs, and the presence of colleges creates such jobs,

then additional in-state colleges may further decrease a man’s propensity to leave his birth state after

completing a college education. (See Moretti 2004a and 2004b for related discussions.)

        Finally, Panel C shows results from estimating our main specifications using two state merit

aid policies to identify higher education in the 2000 Census. Following Dynarski (2008), we use a

dummy variable for college completion as our education measure and estimate the equations for a

younger sample of cohorts who were eligible to receive assistance through these policies. These

state policies increase college completion by lowering college costs through tuition scholarships to

any student who maintains a threshold grade point average in both high school and college. Large

percentages of high school seniors in both states with these programs qualify for this assistance. As

was the case with our main estimates, we find large, positive OLS and 2SLS premiums to college

completion on subsequent migration.

        The implications of these results are less straightforward than with the instruments in Panels

A and B because of the fact that the merit aid instrument operates on two margins. First, by

lowering the relative cost of in-state colleges, it likely increased in-state college attendance by

students who would otherwise have gone out of state to college. This would tend to reduce the

migration premium estimated via 2SLS in a manner similar to that of the college openings

instrument. On the other hand, lowering the relative costs of college (without increasing the per

capita number of colleges) encourages college attendance overall among a state’s natives although

the biggest effect is probably on in-state college attendance. We conclude that in the case of the

merit aid instrument, the positive effect of increased college attainment swamps the negative effect

of in-state college attendance on subsequent migration. This is consistent with the results of Table


                                                    32
6, which show that while out of state college going may be an important channel through which

higher education increases mobility, it is unlikely to be the only channel. This is also consistent with

the possibility that college openings in a state discourage later outmigration of college educated

natives by providing attractive local labor markets for high skill workers.



VI. Conclusion

        In this paper, we examined the causal role of college graduation in determining geographic

mobility, in particular, the likelihood of lasting, long-distance moves indicated by a man’s residence

outside his birthstate in early- to mid-adulthood. We show that selection is unlikely to explain the

large increases in migration rates associated with college completion.

        Using a 5% sample from the 1980 U.S. Census, we provide estimates of the causal impact of

college education on the probability of a long-distance move. We use state-cohort level variation in

college completion arising from draft avoidance behavior among men at risk for conscription into

the Armed Forces during the Vietnam conflict as a source of exogenous variation in the probability

that a man completed college. We show that this variation increased migration rates substantially

among affected cohorts. It also significantly increased the probability that a young man completed

some post-secondary education. We then use induction risk to identify the causal effect of higher

education on subsequent mobility. We find that college education increases the probability of a

long-distance move for the marginal college graduate significantly. Moreover, our instrumental

variables strategy enables us to purge our estimates of potential bias due to correlation of

unobservables with a relevant control variable other than education: veteran status. Our preferred

estimates use two instruments to account for the potential endogeneity of both college completion

and veteran status among our sample of Vietnam era young men.

        The use of two instruments to identify separate variables in our equations of interest results

in large standard errors. Our 2SLS estimates of the causal impact of college are significant at


                                                   33
conventional levels, but we cannot say with certainty that the causal effect is larger or smaller than

the OLS estimate. However, our estimates strongly suggest that the causal impact is economically

significant. The average man in our dataset moves out of his birthstate with probability 0.33, and

simple OLS estimates put the premium to an additional year of higher education on out-of-

birthstate migration at 0.3 while the highest estimate from our preferred 2SLS specification puts this

premium at 0.7.

Notes: Data are from the 5% sample of the 1980 U.S. Census, available from IPUMS. All specifications are restricted to men born
between 1942 and 1953. Cohort size is derived from the 1960 Census. Mobility is equal to 1 if respondent resides outside his state
of birth at the time of the Census, and 0 otherwise. The employment-population ratio is defined for the year in which individuals
are 19 years of age. Log cohort size is defined as the logarithm of the number of respondents to the 1960 Census in the
corresponding year of birth.

 Notes: Robust standard errors in brackets, clustered by birth-year in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and
 6. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively. Data are from the 5% sample of
 the 1980 U.S. Census, available from IPUMS. All specifications are restricted to men born between 1942 and 1953. Number of
 observations is 794,331 in each regression. Trend is a linear trend in age. Demographic controls include race (white, black, other)
 and birth state fixed effects. Cohort size is derived from the 1960 Census and defined at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and
 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and 6. Employment rate is the employment to population ratio, also defined at the birth-
 year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and 6.

 sample of the 1960 U.S Census; data in Panel B is from the 5% sample of the 1980 U.S. Census. Specifications in Panel A are
 restricted to men born between 1942 and 1953; specifications in Panel B are restricted to men born between 1930 and 1941.
 Number of observations is 167,475 in each regression of Panel A; 531,138 in each regression of Panel B. Trend is a linear trend
 in age. Demographic controls include race (white, black, other) and birth state fixed effects. Cohort size is derived from the 1960
 Census for both panels and defined at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and 6.
 Employment rate is the employment to population ratio, also defined at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-

 Notes: Robust standard errors in brackets, clustered by birth-year in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and
 6. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively. Data are from the 5% sample of
 the 1980 U.S. Census, available from IPUMS. All specifications are restricted to men born between 1942 and 1953. Number of
 observations is 794,331 in each regression. Trend is a linear trend in age. Demographic controls include race (white, black, other)
 and birth state fixed effects. Cohort size is derived from the 1960 Census and defined at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and
 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and 6. Employment rate is the employment to population ratio, also defined at the birth-
 year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-state in columns 4, 5, and 6. Column 2 uses national-level induction risk
 interacted with quartile and state-level induction risk to instrument for years of schooling interacted with quartiles and for veteran
 status.

Notes: Robust standard errors in brackets, clustered by birth-year in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-birth state in columns 4, 5,
and 6. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent level, respectively. Data are from the 5% sample
of the 1980 U.S. Census, available from IPUMS. All specifications are restricted to men born between 1942 and 1953, and
weighted by number of observations in each cell to account for the differential precision of our estimated averages. Number of
state-year observations is 600 in each regression. Trend is a linear trend in age. Demographic controls include the percentage of
whites, blacks, and others in each state-year and birth state fixed effects. Cohort size is derived from the 1960 Census and defined
at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-birth state in columns 4, 5, and 6. Employment rate is the employment
to population ratio, also defined at the birth-year level in columns 1, 2, and 3 and birth year-birth state in columns 4, 5, and 6.
Columns 4, 5, and 6 of Panel A use national-level induction risk to instrument for years of schooling. Columns 4, 5, and 6 of
Panel B use national and state-level induction risk to instrument for schooling and veteran status.
