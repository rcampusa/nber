Precautionary Savings and the Importance of Business Owners

                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper, we show the pivotal role business owners play in estimating the importance of the
precautionary saving motive. Since business owners hold larger amounts of wealth than other
households for non-precautionary reasons and also face highly volatile income, they induce a
correlation between wealth and income risk regardless of whether or not a precautionary saving
motive exists. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the 1980s and the 1990s, we
show that among both business owners and non-business owners, the size of precautionary savings
with respect to labor income risk is modest and accounts for less than ten percent of total household
wealth. However, pooling together the two groups leads to an artificially high estimate of the
importance of precautionary savings. New data from the Survey of Consumer Finances further
confirms that precautionary savings account for less than ten percent of total wealth for both business
owners and non-business owners. Thus, while a precautionary saving motive exists and affects all
households, it does not give rise to high amounts of wealth in the economy, particularly among those
households who face the most volatile stream of income.

1.       Introduction

         Precautionary saving is considered one of the most important motives to save,

particularly among the young population. While a variety of empirical estimates exist,

several studies show that precautionary savings may contribute to as much as fifty

percent of aggregate wealth for individuals under the age of fifty.1 The general approach

taken in these empirical studies is to relate measures of labor income risk faced by

households to the amount of wealth households accumulate. As a result of these large

empirical estimates, most models in macroeconomics now incorporate a precautionary

saving motive. Moreover, the importance of precautionary savings has implications for

public policy; the effects of welfare and taxation policies very much rely on the strength

of this motive.

         One of the critical problems of the existing empirical work on precautionary

savings is that researchers pool together two distinct sub-groups within the population:

business owners and all other households.2 Such mixing has the potential to confound

the analysis of precautionary savings. As we show, business owners face, on average,

higher expected income risk and accumulate larger amounts of wealth than other

households for reasons unrelated to precautionary savings. For example, pension

coverage rates are much lower for business owners than for non-business owners. Those

who own their business, as a result, must accumulate more private wealth to sustain

consumption during retirement. Business owners also display a stronger bequest motive

than other households. The fact that business owners hold higher-than-average wealth

Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998) and Kazarosian (1997).

  As in Quadrini (1999) and Hurst and Lusardi (2004), we define business owners as households who report owning
their own business and we use the terms entrepreneurs and business owners interchangeably. In our robustness
specifications, we also define business owners as households who report being self-employed.


                                                         2
while facing larger measured income risk than other households will lead to a correlation

between wealth and labor income risk regardless of whether or not a precautionary

motive is important. In this paper, we explicitly show that the large positive estimates of

precautionary savings documented in the literature are, in fact, an artifact of pooling

together business owners and non-business owners.

       To test this hypothesis, we separately analyze precautionary saving motives

within a group of non-business owners and within a group of business owners using data

from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Within each group, we find that

precautionary savings explain only up to ten percent of total household wealth.       Yet,

when we pool these samples together, we find results consistent with other empirical

estimates on the importance of precautionary savings. Specifically, in the pooled sample,

we find that as much as fifty percent of total wealth is explained by precautionary

savings.

       The novelty of our work is not only to show the pivotal role business owners play

in estimating the importance of precautionary savings, but also to show that the high

amount of wealth held by business owners is not the result of their precautionary motive

to save against income risk. In fact, the relationship between wealth and risk may simply

reflect the risk-return tradeoff of the projects undertaken by business owners rather than

their desire to shield themselves against shocks to income.

       In the final part of the paper, we use a more direct approach to estimating the

importance of precautionary savings. Starting in 1995, the Survey of Consumer Finances

(SCF) asked respondents about the amount of their desired savings earmarked for

unplanned emergencies. This question was designed by one of the authors of this paper




                                            3
to explicitly measure precautionary savings.3 After showing that responses to this

question vary with measures of income risk faced by the household, we show that in the

aggregate, reported precautionary savings comprise less than eight percent of total

wealth. The sample of business owners reports having less than four percent of their total

wealth as precautionary savings while non-business owners report having around ten

percent of their wealth as precautionary savings. In summary, our two methods for

estimating the importance of precautionary savings yield strikingly similar results.

Whether using regression analysis or examining direct reports of precautionary savings

from survey questions, we find that precautionary savings explain less than ten percent of

total wealth holdings.

           The work in this paper is the first to bridge the gap between the work of Carroll

and Samwick (1997, 1998) and Kazarosian (1997), which show sizeable effects of

precautionary savings, and the literature that finds small effects (Guiso, Jappelli, and

Terlizzese (1992), Skinner (1988), Hrung (2000), Engen and Gruber (2001) and Lusardi

(1998)). In the final portion of the paper, we discuss how these studies which find small

estimates of precautionary savings have implicitly controlled for differences between

non-business owners and business owners either by excluding business owners from their

samples or by excluding business wealth from their measure of household savings.

Overall, we conclude that, when analyzing the importance of precautionary savings using

micro data sets, researchers have to properly account for differences in saving motives

between business owners and non-business owners.             When differences cannot be

accounted for, researchers should exclude business owners from their sample.

         The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the standard approach

to estimating the economic importance of precautionary savings. In section 3 we use data

from the PSID to demonstrate the apparent importance of precautionary savings on a

pooled sample of business owners and non-business owners. In section 4 we show that

the results in section 3 are an artifact of pooling together different groups of households.

Within both groups taken separately, we find at best small evidence of precautionary

savings. Moreover, once we properly account for differences between business owners

and non-business owners, we no longer find precautionary savings to be a sizeable

component of aggregate wealth accumulation in the pooled sample. In section 5, we

introduce the SCF data and review the evidence provided by the survey question

designed to directly measure precautionary savings. In the final section we summarize

our findings and discuss how accounting for differences between business owners and

non-business owners is important for many empirical studies of household consumption

and saving behavior beyond the analysis of precautionary savings.


2.       Estimating the Importance of Precautionary Savings

         Intertemporal models of consumption/saving behavior under uncertainty predict

that agents accumulate wealth to insure themselves against risk (Deaton (1991), Carroll

(1992, 1997)).         For the most part, the precautionary saving literature has focused its

attention on the relationship between labor income risk and wealth accumulation.4                              All

else equal, households who face more labor income risk should accumulate more wealth

to insure themselves against unexpected low income realizations.
4
  Labor income risk is only one of the many different risks faced by households. Other risks include, for example,
health and longevity. As with the bulk of empirical work on precautionary savings, the focus in this paper is on
examining the relationship between non-capital income risk and household wealth accumulation. Given that our
attention will be on heads of households aged 25-50, labor accounts for most of non-capital income, and labor income
risk is likely to be the most important risk these households face.


                                                         5
         Using calibrated theoretical models, several authors have calculated that

precautionary savings can explain as much as fifty percent of total wealth in the US

economy (Skinner (1988), Caballero (1990, 1991), Carroll (1992), and Gourinchas and

Parker (2002)).        Existing empirical estimates using micro data have yielded mixed

results, but studies such as Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998) and Kazarosian (1997)

have confirmed that precautionary saving is the leading motive to accumulate wealth and

can explain roughly half of the total wealth of US households.

         The empirical strategy of estimating the importance of precautionary savings

using micro data is based on the following specification:5


         ln(Wit ) = α 0 + α1σ itpermy + α 2σ ittransy + α 3 ln( yit ) + Z it β + uit                     (1)


where ln(Wit) is the log of a measure of household i's wealth in period t, ln(yit) is the log

of a measure of household i's permanent income in period t, σ itpermy and σ ittransy are,

respectively, measures of the variance of permanent shocks to household i's income and

the variance of transitory shocks to household i's income. The Z vector includes

demographic characteristics of household i in period t including age, age squared, gender,

race and marital status. The controls are included to capture potential differences in

preferences across households and the hump-shaped profile of wealth over the life-cycle.

         According to the precautionary savings model, wealth is a function not only of

permanent income, but also of uninsurable risk faced by the household.                             Almost all

empirical studies designed to estimate the importance of precautionary savings using

micro data proxy uninsurable risk with either the variance of income (Carroll and

5
  This specification is the one used by Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998) and is similar to specifications used by
Kazarosian (1997), Lusardi (1998) and Carroll, Dynan, and Krane (2003).


                                                        6
Samwick (1997, 1998)), the variance of consumption (Dynan (1993)), or they exploit

actual job loss or expectations of future job loss (Lusardi (1998) and Carroll, Dynan and

Krane (2003)).         In this paper, we follow Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998) by using

panel data to distinguish between the variance of permanent and transitory shocks to

income. Since both permanent income and the variance of income are measured with

considerable amount of error in micro data, we instrument these variables using controls

such as, but not limited to, occupation and industry dummies. The testable implication

then becomes whether households in those occupations and industries facing more

volatile income streams accumulate more wealth to shield themselves against uninsurable

shocks to income.6

         The empirical work using this specification faces several challenges. First, it is

not clear which measure of wealth to use in the regressions since wealth components

differ in term of their liquidity and substitutability. For example, wealth accumulated for

retirement or bequest motives can also serve to buffer shocks to income. Second, there

are many differences in preferences and individual characteristics that should be

accounted for when measuring either household wealth or income risk. Third and most

importantly, researchers need to find some observable and exogenous sources of income

risk that vary enough among the population to be able to estimate the effect of risk on

wealth (Browning and Lusardi (1996)).

         In the following section, we make use of the specification described in (1) to

show that, while the empirical estimates for precautionary savings seem very high, these



6
  We realize that there has been a growing literature that suggests occupation may not be a valid instrument given that
risk-averse households may accumulate more wealth and also choose occupations with safe income streams (see Fuchs-
Schündeln and Schündeln (2005)). We address this issue in section 3.2.

estimates, in fact, tell us little about the strength of the precautionary saving motive

among US households.


3.       Data and Empirical Work

3.1      Baseline Analysis

         We perform the empirical work using data from the PSID. As in Carroll and

Samwick (1997, 1998), we use wealth data from the 1984 PSID wave. Also, like Carroll

and Samwick, we use income data from the 1981 through 1987 waves to construct

measures of the permanent and transitory variance of income.7 To broaden our analysis,

we also use data from the 1994 PSID wealth supplement. In doing so, we construct the

corresponding permanent income and variances of income using income data from 1991-

97. The use of more than one cross-section of wealth data allows us to control for

macroeconomic conditions in different time periods as well as to check the robustness of

results over time.

         To partially overcome the problem that wealth accumulated for other reasons (i.e.,

retirement or bequests) can serve to insure against shocks to income, we restrict our

sample to households whose head is between the ages of 26 and 50 in the year the wealth

is measured.8 According to the precautionary saving model of Carroll (1992, 1997),

Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998) and Gourichas and Parker (2002), the precautionary

saving motive (with respect to labor income risk) is the dominant motive to save up to

until age 45-50. After the age of 50, the predominant reason households save is to fund

consumption during retirement. A detailed description of other restrictions in
7
  We construct the measures of the permanent and transitory income variances using the approach outlined by Carroll
and Samwick (1997). Details of the calculations are available from the authors upon request.
8
  As a robustness test, we redid our whole analysis including non-retired households aged 25-57. This change did not
change the main results. We use the more restrictive age range for our analysis in order to: 1) give precautionary
savings the best shot to explain household wealth accumulation and 2) be consistent with the existing literature.


                                                         8
constructing our final sample is reported in the Data Appendix. Appendix Table A1

includes descriptive statistics of the main variables we use in our empirical work. Our

final sample includes 2,144 households.

         The controls we use in our empirical work include the following demographics:

age, age squared, race, gender, marital status, and education attainment.9 In addition, we

exploit the panel dimension of the PSID to control for past income and wealth shocks

experienced by households. Specifically, we include a year dummy and dummies for

whether the head of the household was unemployed during the year when the wealth data

were collected and any time during the prior four years (1980-1983 or 1990-1993).

Households who are more likely to face high income risk are also more likely to have

been hit by past negative income shocks, and this may weaken the estimated relationship

between wealth and risk. We also include dummies for past positive shocks, such as

having received inheritances or other lump sum payments.

         We construct permanent income by taking the average of non-capital income over

the relevant sample period (1981 through 1987 or 1991 through 1997). Non-capital

income is defined as the sum of the head’s labor income, the spouse’s labor income (if a

spouse is present), the labor income of all other household members, and all transfers

received by the household (excluding any capital income components).                                   All dollar

amounts are in 1997 dollars.

         For comparability, we follow the procedure of Carroll and Samwick (1997) to

compute the variances of permanent and transitory shocks to income. Since both


9
   As a robustness check, we also included controls for the growth of household income during the seven-year period
(1981 – 1987 or 1991 – 1997). In some specifications, we also instrumented for income growth. Regardless of the
specification, the growth in income was always a strong predictor of household wealth. Those with steeper income
profiles held lower wealth, conditional on their level of permanent income. However, in no instance did the inclusion
of our income growth measures affect our estimates of the importance of precautionary savings.


                                                         9
permanent income and the variances of permanent and transitory income are measured

with error, we instrument for these variables using a large set of variables. As suggested

by Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998), we use occupation dummies and these dummies

interacted with age and age squared, as well as industry dummies. In addition, we use the

unemployment rate in the county of residence during the prior year, the variance in the

county unemployment rate over the sample period, and a dummy for whether the head

belongs to a union. Other studies have used the variation in unemployment across

regions to instrument for the variance of income (Lusardi (1997) and Engen and Gruber

(2001)). Furthermore, Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) show that the increased earnings

instability after the 1980s is correlated with changes in unionization.

       Table A2 in the Appendix shows our estimates of the variances of permanent and

transitory income by one digit occupational categories. There are sizeable differences in

income variances across occupations. For example, self-employed managers are more

likely to experience a shock to both their permanent and transitory components of income

than managers employed in firms. The estimates reported in Table A2 match closely the

estimates reported by Carroll and Samwick (1997).

       The measure of wealth we use initially is total net worth, which is defined as the

sum of checking and saving accounts, bonds, stocks and mutual funds (including IRAs),

home equity, other real estates, business equity, cars and other vehicles, and other assets,

minus the value of all debts. Since we use logs, we exclude households who have

negative or zero net worth in our sample, which amount to a little more than five percent

of our sample. In the following subsections, we avoid this sample restriction by using

wealth-to-income ratios as our dependent variable. In this case we do not exclude any




                                             10
additional households from our analysis. As we will show below, our key results are

unaffected by this restriction.

           Empirical estimates of equation (1) are reported in Table 1. For brevity, only the

coefficient estimates of the variances are reported. Both estimates of the income

variances are statistically significant and show that, as predicted by the theory, higher

income risk leads to higher wealth holdings. According to these estimates, the

precautionary saving motive is very important. We perform two experiments to provide

context to the magnitude of the coefficient estimates. First, we assume that households

move from an occupation with low income risk (professionals, with an estimated

variance of permanent income shocks of 0.013 and an estimated variance of transitory

shocks of 0.040) to an occupation with high income risk (operatives and laborers, with an

estimated variance of permanent shocks of 0.019 and an estimated variance of transitory

shocks of 0.059).10       The movement across those occupational categories increases

household wealth by thirty-four percent (all else equal). If we move a manager who is

employed by a firm (estimated permanent and transitory variances equaling 0.017 and

0.030, respectively) to being a self-employed manager (estimated permanent and

transitory variances equaling 0.027 and 0.087), we predict that household’s wealth would

increase by fifty-three percent.

           As a second way to gauge the magnitudes of the coefficients in Table 1, we

compute the total amount of aggregate wealth explained by precautionary savings by

eliminating all income risk, i.e., setting both variances to zero. After doing so, we can

calculate how much wealth households would accumulate when facing no income risk



10
     See Table A2.


                                               11
and compare that amount to the estimates when income risk exists.11 As reported in

Table 1, we find that almost half of total net worth is accounted for by precautionary

savings. Ninety-five percent confidence bands around our estimate suggest that the share

of total wealth explained by precautionary savings ranges from about forty-one to sixty

percent.12 This approach is very similar to the procedure used by Carroll and Samwick

(1997, 1998), who found that about half of wealth is explained by precautionary motives.

Thus, our estimates are consistent with the existing literature which estimates the

importance of precautionary savings by pooling together households regardless of

whether or not they own a business.

         However, zero income risk represents a rather extreme case. Therefore, we also

redo the experiment setting the variances to the minimum mean across occupations as

found in Table A2 (i.e., setting the permanent variance to 0.0079 and the transitory

variance to 0.0305).           Under this experiment, the amount of total wealth accounted for

precautionary saving is twenty-five percent.                      Ninety-five percent confidence bands

around this estimate suggest that the share of total wealth explained by precautionary

savings ranges from about seventeen to thirty-four percent.


3.2      Sensitivity Analysis

         Before showing that the above results disappear when we control for differences

between business owners and non-business owners, we show that these results are

generally robust to a variety of alternative specifications. In essence, we want to show


11
    To do this, we use the estimates from (1) to predict log wealth for each household. We then predict log wealth for
each household setting the variances of permanent and transitory incomes to zero. To get the estimated percent of
wealth explained by precautionary savings, we take the difference between the predicted log wealth with and without
the variances set to zero for each household and then average over all households. We also repeat this procedure setting
the value of the variances to the minimum mean value across occupations as explained later in the text.
12
   95 percent confidence bands were bootstrapped using 1,000 repetitions.


                                                          12
that what is driving the result is the pooling of non-business owners and business owners

together rather than the choice of samples, measures of wealth and income variances, and

set of instruments.

       First, as already suggested by several researchers (Lusardi (1997) and Fuchs-

Schündeln and Schündeln (2005)), workers can self-select into jobs according to their

coefficient of risk aversion. If such selection exists, the use of occupation and industry

dummies as instruments for the variance is invalid. We have therefore tried a different

set of instruments. Specifically, our instrument set includes only the county

unemployment rate, the variance of the county unemployment rate, and dummies for

whether the head belongs to a union, whether the spouse works, whether there are other

earners in the household, and whether the worker is hourly paid.

       While these alternative instruments have some predictive power for the variance

of income, it has lower power than when occupation and industry dummies are included.

The results of this specification are shown in Table 2, column I.         Using this new

instrument set, the importance of precautionary savings in explaining aggregate wealth

holdings is diminished.      Instead of explaining almost one-half of total wealth

accumulation, the estimates with the modified instrument set suggest that approximately

one-quarter of total wealth accumulation is explained by precautionary motives when

setting the variances to zero and thirteen percent when setting the variances to the lowest

mean value. While the share of precautionary wealth is smaller in this case, it is still

sizeable.

       To further evaluate the robustness of results, we have investigated a different

measure of the variance of income. Rather than calculating the variance of permanent




                                            13
and transitory shocks to income-a procedure that involves making rather restrictive

assumptions-we have worked with a measure of the total income variance faced by

households. To compute this measure, we regress the log of non-capital income on some

exogenous characteristics such as age, age squared, race and gender. We calculate the

variance of the residual from that regression over the sample period (1981-87 or 1991-97)

for each household.             We then use this measure to replace both the permanent and

transitory income variances in our estimation of (1). We re-estimate (1) using both the

original instrument set and the second instrument set discussed above (excluding the

occupation and industry dummies). Results are shown in Table 2, Columns II and III,

respectively.13         As in Table 1, those facing higher income risk accumulate higher

amounts of wealth, sometimes as much as fifty percent of total wealth. Thus, our main

results hold true in this specification as well and are not sensitive to the assumptions we

have made when calculating the permanent and transitory variances of income.

           The use of the log of wealth poses another potential problem. While the

distribution of wealth is very skewed and we need to worry about the influence of very

rich households, using the log transformation leads us to exclude a sizable number of

households with negative or zero wealth from the sample. This exclusion is hardly

exogenous.          In fact, high risk households may get hit by shocks that deplete their

resources and push them into negative wealth. In this case, the selection of the sample

can bias our estimates. There is another consideration when working with positive net

worth only; it could be that the precautionary saving motive prevents households from

going heavily into debt, but they still would not hold positive wealth. In other words, the

precautionary saving motive may simply limit the amount of borrowing that households
13
     As above, both instrument sets have strong power in predicting this new variance measure.


                                                           14
would otherwise undertake. Since we eliminate households in debt, we may end up

incorrectly calculating the amount of precautionary savings undertaken in the economy.14

         To potentially overcome this problem, we have used the ratio of wealth over

permanent income as our dependent variable and retain the observations with zero or

negative net worth in the sample. To limit the effects of outliers, we have trimmed the

distribution and excluded the observations at the top and bottom two percent of the

distribution of the wealth to permanent income ratio. As reported in column IV of Table

2, this specification implies that fifty-seven percent of aggregate wealth is explained by

the precautionary savings motive when setting the variances to zero and to twenty-five

percent when setting the variances to the lowest mean values.

         In summary, the estimation of (1) is robust to many potential criticisms.

Specifically, changing the instrument set to exclude occupation and industry dummies,

using different measures of the variance of income, and using the wealth-to-income ratio

as opposed to the log of wealth as our dependent variable all yield results that show that

precautionary savings explain at least one-quarter and as much as sixty percent of total

wealth accumulation.



4.       The Importance of Business Owners

         One of the problems in estimating the types of regressions described above is that

they pool together distinct sub-groups within the population. Mixing together households

that own a business (or are self-employed) with other households can be problematic to

the extent that business owners as a group face higher risks and accumulate larger

14
   Many theoretical models of precautionary savings impose liquidity constraints and prevent households from going
into debt (see Deaton (1991, 1992). The inability to borrow makes the precautionary saving motive stronger; if
households cannot borrow when hit by shocks, there is stronger need to accumulate a stock of precautionary wealth.


                                                       15
amounts of wealth for reasons unrelated to precautionary saving. The large positive

estimates of precautionary savings documented in the previous section may simply be an

artifact of pooling together business owners and non-business owners.

         Business owners have nearly three times as much wealth (Table A1) and

experience nearly twice as much labor income risk (Table A3) as non-business owners.

We first examine whether business owners hold more wealth than other households after

conditioning on permanent income. To show the relationship between wealth and

permanent income between business owners and non-business owners, we regress the log

of household wealth on a cubic in the log of household permanent income and a business

ownership dummy for households in our PSID sample.15 The coefficient on the business

ownership dummy is 1.24 (p-value < 0.01). This implies that, conditional on measured

permanent income, business owners on average accumulate 124 percent more wealth than

their non-business owning counterparts.

         There are many reasons why business owners hold more wealth than non business

owners aside from the fact that they face higher income risk. For example, business

owners are much less likely to have private pensions (Gustman and Steinmeier, 1999).

Data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) show that approximately fifty-four

percent of non-business owners are covered by a private pension. The comparable

number for business owners is only thirty percent. Upon retirement, the ratio of pension

wealth (excluding social security) to non-pension wealth is about twenty-five percent for

the average household (Gustman, Mitchell, Samwick and Steinmeier (1999)). As a

result, business owners have to accumulate much more non-pension wealth to sustain


15
   As discussed above, our measure of wealth does not include public or private pensions. Up through 2001, the PSID
did not collect significant information on private pensions.


                                                       16
consumption through their retirement years. Most micro data sources like the PSID

exclude pension wealth from their measures of private wealth; this fact alone could

explain a large fraction of the difference in wealth levels conditional on permanent

income.

       Additionally, business owners are more likely to report that they would like to

leave a bequest to future heirs (Hurst and Lusardi (2004)). This is not surprising given

that business owners often want to pass their business directly to their heirs. Business

owners may also need to maintain large amounts of working capital both to deal with the

necessities of their business and to maintain effective control over the business. Most

importantly, if households are compensated for taking greater risks with higher returns, it

is again not surprising that business owners have higher wealth than non-business owners

for given levels of permanent income. If researchers do not properly control for all of

these differences between business owners and non-business owners, one would expect to

find a strong positive association between income risk and wealth even in an environment

with no precautionary motives.

       Lastly, as mentioned above, conditional on measured permanent income, business

owners have higher wealth than non-business owners. However, it is possible that given

the way permanent income is usually measured, it is an appropriate measure of lifetime

resources for non-business owners, but it is an inappropriate measure of lifetime

resources for business owners. If average non-capital income is an underestimate of

actual permanent income for business owners, business owners will be observed as

having higher wealth conditional on measured permanent income even if they do not

have higher wealth conditional on actual permanent income.          Given tax avoidance




                                            17
incentives, tax evasion incentives, and the difficulty in differentiating between labor and

capital returns for business owners, there is reason to believe that measured permanent

income is understated for business owners. We explore this hypothesis in depth in sub-

section 4.2.



4.1    Estimating Precautionary Savings among Non-Business owners

       Our hypothesis is that the empirical estimates of precautionary savings from

Section 3 (and from much of the existing literature on precautionary savings) are large

because they pool together business owners and non-business owners.           To test this

hypothesis, we begin by estimating (1) on a sample which only includes households who

do not own a business in year t (sample size = 1,729). Otherwise, the sample is exactly

the same as the one used for the estimates presented in Table 1. Our dependent variable

remains the log of total net worth. The permanent and transitory variances are computed

as above and the vector Z of controls is unchanged. Lastly, we instrument the variance of

permanent income shocks, the variance of transitory income shocks, and the level of

permanent income with the main instrument set described in section 3.

       Table 3 shows that, compared to the results in Table 1, the coefficients on both

income variance measures fall dramatically in magnitude and are no longer statistically

different from zero. To gauge the overall importance of precautionary savings under

these estimates, we repeat the experiments in Section 3. First, we suppose that households

move from an occupation with low income risk (professionals) to an occupation with

high income risk (operatives and laborers). Under this experiment, household wealth

would barely change at all. Recall that the comparable thought experiment using the




                                            18
coefficients estimated in the pooled sample (from Table 1) was an increase of thirty-four

percent.

       Second, we examine how much of total wealth held by non-business owners is

explained by precautionary savings. Assuming that households face zero or very low risk

(as in the procedure described in Section 3), the estimation implies that precautionary

savings explain -4.1 percent of total wealth holdings when setting the variances to zero

and -1.4 percent when setting the variances to the lowest mean value. Note that these

estimates are not statistically different from zero. The bootstrapped 95 percent confidence

bands for the first estimate (zero variances) are minus forty percent to twelve percent and

for the second estimate (lowest mean value) are minus nine to seven percent.       In other

words, the confidence bands from these estimates imply that at most twelve percent of

total wealth held by households under the age of fifty is explained by precautionary

savings.

       The result of this specification is striking.    It says that among non-business

owners (between eighty percent and ninety percent of the population), there is, at best,

only a small systematic relationship between labor income risk and household wealth

holdings. Moreover, compared to values reported in the empirical and theoretical papers

mentioned above, our estimates are much smaller; at most twelve percent of total wealth

held by households under the age of fifty is explained by precautionary savings.

       Another set of variations serves to emphasize just how critically the importance of

the precautionary saving motive hinges on the inclusion of business owners in the sample

used for the estimation. One might argue that because business owners are, on average,

wealthier than other households, the estimates may simply capture different behavior




                                            19
among the wealthy. To assess whether we are simply measuring wealthy or successful

households when considering business owners, we cut the data in two additional ways.

First, we remove from our sample those households in the top twenty percent of the

income distribution (leaving us with 1,716 observations). Second, we exclude from the

sample households who own stocks (for a sample of 1,238 observations). In both cases,

we find that precautionary savings continue to explain a large (and statistically

significant) portion of total household wealth. Specifically, for the sample of households

in the bottom eighty percent of the income distribution, forty percent of wealth appears to

be explained by precautionary reasons. In the sample of non-stock owners, thirty-five

percent of wealth appears to be explained by precautionary reasons.16 Thus, in both cases

substantial fractions of wealth can be explained by the precautionary motive, arguably

because each sample includes a substantial fraction of business owners; eighteen percent

of the lower income households and seventeen percent of non-stock owners report

owning a business.

            In conclusion, there is no evidence of precautionary savings driving large amounts

of wealth accumulation in the sample of non-business owners. Moreover, the estimates

are likely much closer to zero than they are to fifty percent.


4.2         The Importance of Precautionary Savings among Business Owners

            In the above subsection, we documented that the estimated importance of

precautionary savings is severely mitigated if we exclude the business owners from our

sample. However, this does not imply that precautionary savings are not important. It

may be that business owners respond strongly to labor income risk. Their response to

16
     For simplicity and because the sample sizes change, we only consider setting the values of the variances to zero.


                                                             20
such risk, in turn, may give rise to large amounts of wealth in the economy, a point

previously noted in the work by Carroll and Samwick (1997, 1998).17

          To probe the precautionary motives of business owners further, we re-estimate (1)

for this group alone. The results of this estimation are shown in column I of Table 4.

Indeed, the coefficients on both variance measures are positive and statistically different

from zero. Using the same procedure as above and setting the variances to zero, we find

that thirty-three percent of wealth among business owners can be explained by

precautionary motives. When setting the variances to the lowest mean value, we find that

precautionary savings account for twenty-three percent of wealth. These effects are also

statistically different from the non-business owners sample.

          On the surface, this number appears large. But, as with pooling different types of

households in the full sample, the numbers reported in column I of Table 4 could result

from other reasons than the desire to insure against risk. Specifically, those business

owners who take more risks should, on average, be compensated with higher returns. The

relationship between wealth and income risk could simply capture the risk-return trade-

off rather than the strength of the precautionary saving motive among business owners.18

          To address this issue, we first assess how robust the findings in column I are to

alternate specifications. One simple change to the estimation is to exclude business


17
    As noted above, Carroll and Samwick (1998) find that over fifty percent of wealth for households under the age of
50 can be accounted for by precautionary motives. However, they do note that, when they exclude farmers and the
self-employed from their sample, their estimates suggest that precautionary motives explain essentially zero percent of
aggregate wealth holdings. They state that: “(Their) preferred interpretation of these findings is of course that the
farmers and the self-employed provide exactly the same kind of variation in the independent variable that is very
valuable to identify the coefficient on uncertainty, and hence, these groups should remain in the sample” (page 415). In
fact our paper shows that business owners have high wealth (compared to non business owners) for other reasons aside
from precautionary motives. A contribution of this paper is to show that, even within the sample of business owners,
the relationship between risk and wealth proxies for something other than precautionary motives.
18
   Note that since we consider those households who are business owners in the years when the wealth data was
collected (1984 or 1994), we are implicitly considering only those business owners who either started in that year or
that started earlier and survived. The survival bias further strengthens the relationship between wealth and labor income
risk in the sub-sample of business owners.


                                                          21
wealth from our measure of total net worth. If equity in private businesses is illiquid, the

returns to business ownership may show up in higher business wealth.19 Moreover, it

seems implausible that business owners would hold their precautionary wealth in their

businesses: Income streams from the business and the value of the business are positively

correlated. For savings to provide insurance, we expect business owners to hold at least a

portion of their precautionary reserves outside of their business.

         In column II of Table 4, we report the estimates of (1) for the business owners

sample where the dependent variable is now the log of non-business wealth. Under this

specification, the estimated impact of the precautionary saving motive falls by more than

half (from thirty-three percent to fifteen percent when setting the variances to zero and

from twenty-three to ten percent when setting the variances to the lowest mean value).

The degree to which non-business wealth responds to risk is now fairly small among

business owners.

         Another important point concerns the estimation of permanent income. As

mentioned before, permanent income is measured by averaging non-capital income for a

given household over the sample period. While non-capital income is likely to be a

sufficient measure of compensation for non-business owners, the situation is not so

straightforward for business owners. There are three important factors in this difference.

First, tax evasion may drive some business owners to under-report their labor income (by

far, the most important component of non-capital income). Second, legal tax avoidance

drives some business owners to retain part of their compensation within the business.20


19
   We are aware that business owners could effectively liquidate the returns to their business by holding lower non-
business wealth. The exclusion of business wealth from our measure of net worth is meant to explore the robustness of
our estimates to plausible alternative specifications.
20
   See Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and Rosen (1994), who also emphasize there are many tax incentives in business
ownership.


                                                        22
Lastly, tax evasion and tax avoidance aside, it is hard to specify and measure the actual

labor return from business ownership; the part of business income attributed to capital

and to labor is inevitably arbitrary in many cases.21 This mis-measurement is problematic

for this sort of analysis given that the return to the investment of business owners (i.e.,

their total compensation) is likely correlated with the underlying risk of the project.

         According to standard consumption theory, household consumption is a valid

measure of a household's permanent income. While labor income may be underreported

for business owners, there is no reason to believe that consumption for business owners

will be seriously mis-measured relative to the consumption of non-business owners. As a

potentially better proxy for the lifetime resources of households, we use consumption in

lieu of non-capital income in the estimation of (1).22

         The PSID provides information on food consumption at home (including food

stamps) and food outside the home. Although the sum of these two measures is only a

limited proxy for total nondurable consumption, many studies have used food

consumption to test the predictions of the theory and have found that food consumption

often displays characteristics similar to non-durable consumption (Lusardi (1996), Hurst

(2004)). We take the average of the sum of food at home, food away from home, and

food stamps over the sample period as a proxy for permanent income and use it as a

proxy for y it in (1) to test the sensitivity of the model to our original definition of

permanent income. We instrument for the variances of income and average food

consumption using the same set of variables as before.



21
   Note that a large portion of labor earnings for business owners are simply imputed within large micro surveys such as
the PSID or the Current Population Survey.
22
   See, among others, Meyer and Sullivan (2003) who also use consumption as a proxy for permanent income.


                                                          23
       The results of this regression are reported in Table 4 (column III).           The

coefficients of the variance measures are no longer statistically different from zero and

are much smaller in magnitude, compared to those found in Table 1. Using the same

procedure as outlined in Section 3, we find that precautionary motives explain a little

more than eight percent of total wealth within the sample of business owners (the

equivalent number for setting the variances to the lowest mean value is a little over six

percent). The ninety-five percent confidence bands on these estimates range from roughly

negative three percent to twelve percent. Of course, these values are only crude measures

of the importance of precautionary savings. These experiments aim to show that the

correlation between wealth and risk among business owners may capture something else

than simply precautionary savings. Note, however, that our results are robust to a variety

of changes. Whether we use different instrument sets, different measures of the variance

of income, or the self-employed rather than business owners (discussed below), our key

results do not change.

       When we return to the pooled sample and re-estimate (1) using the log of non-

business wealth as the dependent variable and using food consumption as the measure of

permanent income (and keeping everything else the same), we find results that are

dramatically different from those reported in Table 1 (see Table 5). Notably, the implied

share of precautionary wealth explained by precautionary motives decreases from forty-

seven percent to less than ten percent. These results are striking. When pooling together

non-business owners and business owners and using total wealth which includes business

equity, we find that precautionary savings explains nearly half of total wealth

accumulation. However, this is simply an artifact of pooling together different groups of




                                           24
households without accounting for their differences. When we control for the presence

and importance of business owners, we find estimates of the impact of precautionary

savings in explaining aggregate wealth holdings to be lower than in much of the existing

literature.      As noted above, for non-business owners, which comprise over eighty-five

percent of the sample, we find that the precautionary motive explains at best twelve

percent of total wealth holdings (as measured by the upper bound of the 95 percent

confidence interval).

          One may argue that splitting the sample by business owners is not the best way to

cut the data. Instead, we could split the sample by whether or not the household head is

self-employed. As noted by Carroll and Samwick (1997), results are sensitive to the

inclusion of the self-employed. Only sixty-three percent of business owners report that

they are self-employed when asked about their primary job.23                               Moreover, only about

two-thirds of those who report being self-employed report owning a business.

          In Table 6, we report the results of estimating (1) on a sample of households who

are not self-employed and a sample of households who report being self-employed. The

results are even stronger than those presented in Tables 3 and 4.                                  Specifically, for

households who are not self-employed, precautionary motives only explain less than two

percent of wealth holdings. For those who report being self-employed, precautionary

motives explain only slightly over eight percent of total wealth.24                                The regressions

reported in Table 6 have the log of total net worth as the dependent variable and use

average non-capital income as the measure of permanent income. In other words, the


23
    Some business owners earn their primary labor income from a source other than the business. For these households,
the business provides either a supplement to their primary labor income or a return on capital only.
24
   If, rather than setting the variances to zero, we set the variances to the lowest mean value, we find that the share of
precautionary savings among those who are not self-employed is basically zero and among the self-employed is 6%.


                                                           25
regressions are analogous to the regression reported in Table 1. This shows that the

results are clearly driven by pooling. Considering the self-employed and the non-self

employed together leads to large estimates of the percent of wealth explained by

precautionary savings. However, when the sample is split by self-employment status,

there is little evidence of a sizeable precautionary motive within each sub-sample.

       Does our estimation imply that one cannot run regressions on pooled samples that

include both non-business owners and business owners (or self-employed households)?

According to our work, if researchers do run pooled regressions (as done in the majority

of the empirical work on precautionary savings), they need to account for differences

between these two groups.        At a minimum, researchers should account for more

appropriate measures of permanent income and should examine the robustness of their

results by excluding business wealth from their measure of potential precautionary

savings. They should further model the other reasons why business owners accumulate

wealth because that may lead to an artificial correlation between wealth and income risk.

In surveys where such data is not provided, we suggest dropping the business owners (or

the self-employed) from the sample.

       In summary, we show that the standard estimates of the importance of

precautionary savings in explaining total wealth accumulation are fragile. Within both

the sample of business owners and non-business owners, our estimates of the magnitude

of precautionary savings are less than ten percent. While this amount is still sizable, it is

much smaller than the estimates reported by other authors using the same estimation

procedure. In the next section, we explore a potentially more robust method to measure

the amount of precautionary savings within the population.




                                             26
5.       An Alternative Approach to Estimating Precautionary Savings

         As the previous sections show, it is hard to disentangle the amount of

precautionary savings using the estimation techniques described above. We propose an

alternative approach to evaluate the importance of precautionary savings, which relies on

a direct question about desired precautionary wealth from the Survey of Consumer

Finances (SCF). Starting from 1995, the following question has been asked to all SCF

respondents:

         “About how much do you think you and your family need to have in savings for

unanticipated emergencies and other unexpected things that may come up?”

         This question was specifically designed to get respondents to elicit the amount of

desired precautionary savings.25 In other words, the question was intended to measure

what is the equilibrium level of desired precautionary savings due to the fact that future

income streams and consumption needs are uncertain. Prior to being added to the SCF,

the question was thoroughly pre-tested.

         The question has been extensively analyzed by Kennickell and Lusardi (2004).

They show that responses to this question tend to mimic the customary pattern of wealth

holdings over the life-cycle and across demographic groups.                           For example, young

households, who have low wealth, tend to report low amounts of precautionary savings

and, for this group, precautionary savings is almost always less than total reported gross

wealth. More importantly, Kennickell and Lusardi (2004) show that responses to this

question are correlated with various measures of risk, including income, longevity and


25
  The wording reflects the responses households give when asked open-ended questions about motives to save. Other
data sets, such as the Dutch CentERdata and the German Save, have questions about precautionary savings that have
the same wording. See Borsch-Supan and Essing (2003). A similar question has now been added to the 2003 Italian
Survey of Household Income and Wealth and the 2005 Dutch CentERdata Panel.


                                                      27
health risk. Since the question is asked to all respondents with no age restrictions and

does not specify an explicit source of risk, responses refer to all types of risk, not just

labor income risk.

       Another important feature of this variable is its behavior during the stock market

boom. While total net worth increased sharply from 1995 to 1998 due to the increase in

the price of stocks, the distribution of desired precautionary savings remained roughly the

same in 1995 and 1998, as we would expect from the fact that neither labor income risk

nor permanent income increased dramatically during that short time period.

       To further assess the accuracy of the SCF self-reported measure of precautionary

wealth, we restrict our SCF sample using the same criteria we use when constructing our

PSID sample. Our goal is to see how our new measures of precautionary savings respond

to permanent and transitory income variances, as predicted by the precautionary saving

model. To do this, we estimate an equation similar to equation (1) described above,

replacing the log of net worth with the log of desired precautionary savings.         This

specification allows us to examine directly whether households with higher income

variances are also those that report higher amounts of precautionary wealth.

       The one draw-back to this procedure is that the SCF is not a panel data set. This

makes it impossible to measure income variance of a given household directly from SCF

data. To overcome this problem, we combine data from two samples. We estimate the

income variances using panel income data from the PSID (from 1991 to 1997). We then

use the estimated coefficients from the PSID to construct an estimated measure of the

variance of both permanent and transitory income shocks for households in the SCF.

This procedure is possible because one can define the demographic variables and the




                                            28
occupation and industry dummies used as instruments comparably in the PSID and the

SCF.      For this method, we use demographics (age, age squared, marital status, race,

gender and number of children) industry dummies, education and occupation dummies

(and their interactions with age and age squared) to construct the transitory and

permanent income variances. We measure permanent income in the SCF by using the

measure of “normal” household income provided by SCF respondents (Kennickell and

Lusardi (2004)).26

         Estimates from this two-sample procedure are reported in Table 7. Column I

reports the results from the full sample, while columns II and III, respectively, report the

results when the sample is restricted to non-business owners only and then business

owners only.27 As expected, desired precautionary savings are correlated with the

variance of permanent and transitory income shocks in the total sample. Thus, higher

income risk leads households to desire to hold higher amounts of precautionary wealth.

         Considering the estimates using total net worth rather than desired precautionary

savings in the first column of Table 8, we find that total wealth is also correlated with

income risk in the total sample. However, when we exclude business owners from the

sample, the estimates using total net worth indicates there is no longer evidence of

precautionary savings in the non-business owners sample. Only business owners display

a precautionary saving motive (Table 8, column II and III). Results are similar to the

estimates in the first part of the paper using PSID data, confirming that pooling business

owners and non-business owners together leads to misleading estimates of the

27
   Standard errors have been corrected using a bootstrapping procedure with 1,000 repetitions. Standard errors for the
SCF estimates need to be corrected both for fact that the variance measures are estimated using PSID data and the fact
that missing data in the SCF are multiply imputed (see Data Appendix).

precautionary saving motive. Estimates using desired precautionary savings (Table 7

Columns II and III) are instead indicative of a mild precautionary saving motive both

among business owners and non-business owners and this is what we now turn to assess

the quantitative importance of precautionary savings.

       The advantage of the SCF data on desired precautionary savings is that we can

simply look at the amounts reported by households. These values represent an upper

bound to the value of precautionary savings against income risk since the question refers

to all types of risk that household finds relevant. However, since we concentrate on

young families only, income risk is likely to be the most considerable source of risk.

       In our most preferred analysis, we simply examine the amount of reported

precautionary wealth as a fraction of total net worth for SCF households.     If the SCF

question is measuring desired precautionary savings, as we have shown above, we can

assess the overall importance of precautionary savings by directly examining the relative

magnitudes reported by SCF households. Panel A of Table 9 reports mean and median

values of desired precautionary savings in the total sample, the sub-sample of non-

business owners and the sub-sample of business owners only. These values highlight

again the importance of business owners when assessing the importance of precautionary

savings. Business owners desire a higher amount of precautionary savings than non-

business owners and these values are often quite high. Panel B of Table 9 reports the

more relevant statistic, the ratio of desired precautionary savings to total net worth.

Precautionary savings account for approximately seven percent of wealth in the full

sample of households under the age of 50 in the SCF.          Among business owners,




                                           30
precautionary savings account for approximately four percent, while among non business

owners, precautionary savings account for ten percent of total net worth.

       This analysis is consistent with our regression analysis outlined in the first part of

the paper. These values show that a precautionary saving motive does exist among

young families in the U.S.        Thus, models of consumption/saving behavior should

incorporate income risk into their theoretical framework. However, this motive does not

give rise to large amounts of wealth. The precautionary saving motive can at best explain

less than ten percent of total net worth.

       Disentangling the importance of precautionary savings by using a measure of total

net worth is very difficult both conceptually and empirically. The stock of wealth at a

point in time is the result of precautionary accumulation, but it also includes (among

other things) the return from taking risk, past and current portfolio choice, the shocks that

have hit households. Estimates of precautionary savings from simple regressions of total

wealth on proxies for risk are likely to be confounded by such factors.


5.     Conclusion

       Some of the papers in the literature on precautionary savings suggest that

precautionary motives explain about half of total wealth, while other papers suggest a

much smaller fraction. The results of this paper indicate that the high estimates of the

importance of precautionary savings are driven by mixing two very different groups of

households: business owners and non-business owners. Relative to the latter group, the

former holds large amounts of wealth and also faces high income risk. Although pooling

these two groups leads to very large estimates of the share of precautionary wealth out of




                                             31
total net worth, we show that, within these two groups separately, the estimated amount

of precautionary savings is low.

       Specifically, using a variety of different techniques and exploring two types of

methodologies (estimating the effects of income risk using regression analyses and

exploiting the answers to new survey questions), we find that precautionary motives

explain less than ten percent of total wealth held by households under the age of 50. For

non-business owners, the 95th percentile of our confidence band suggests that

precautionary motives with respect to labor income risk explain no more than twelve

percent of total wealth accumulation. This is not inconsistent with the theoretical work

and simulation results of Carroll (1992) and, more recently, Irvine and Wang (2001).

       Our results can explain and reconcile the widely different estimates of

precautionary savings that are found using different micro data sets and across different

countries. For example, Engen and Gruber (2001), Hrung (2000), Lusardi (1998), and

Skinner (1988) all found rather modest estimates of the importance of precautionary

savings. Upon examination, these findings are consistent with our results. Specifically,

Engen and Gruber (2001) use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation

and consider a measure of gross financial assets that does not include business equity in

their estimation of precautionary savings. Similarly, Hrung (2000) uses a measure of

liquid financial wealth from the Continuous Work History Sample Panel of the U.S.

Treasury that excludes business equity. Lusardi (1998) uses total net worth in her

estimation, but her sample excludes the self-employed. Skinner (1988) uses the flow of

saving rather than the stock of savings in his estimation of precautionary saving. Since

he calculates saving by taking the difference between income and consumption, his




                                           32
estimates are less affected by the problem of pooling business owners and non-business

owners together. All of the previous papers which found low estimates of the importance

of precautionary savings in explaining wealth holdings within the U.S. economy have

either explicitly or implicitly controlled for differences between business owners and

non-business owners.

       Our paper can also explain why the importance of precautionary saving varies a

lot across countries. In fact, our results show one should be wary in making international

comparisons. Since business owners in other countries may accumulate rather different

amounts of wealth than in the US, estimates from foreign countries should be used with

caution. For example, our results may explain why the estimates of precautionary savings

in Italy and France (Guiso, Jappelli and Terlizzese (1992) and Arrondel (2002),

respectively) are much lower than what is found in US data.

       If precautionary motives are not overly important in explaining the wealth

accumulation of younger households, why do these households save?                 While this

question is not the specific aim of this paper, there is a large literature that documents the

importance of liquidity constraints in affecting the financial behavior of younger

households.    For example, young households save to make a down payment to buy a

home or for their children education. Additionally, once households purchase a home,

they accumulate wealth each month by simply making their mortgage payments. In fact,

over forty percent of wealth of young households is held in home equity. Lastly, many

young households start accumulating wealth for retirement. Given the existence of

liquidity constraints, the costs associated with extracting home equity, and life cycle




                                             33
saving motives, it is not surprising that precautionary motives with respect to labor

income risk only explain a small portion of total wealth holdings of younger households.

       Because the conceptual and measurement issues related to business owners have

such a powerful effect on estimates of precautionary savings, we recommend that

researchers control carefully for differences between business owners and other

households. When this is not possible, business owners should be excluded from the

sample.

       Lastly, we want to stress that the results presented in this paper have implications

for research well beyond precautionary savings. We show that, when examining

household consumption or savings behavior, it is important to understand the difference

between business owners and non-business owners. This is likely to be equally important

in studies assessing the importance of bequest motives since business owners are more

likely to leave bequests to their children. Similarly, business owners may play a critical

role in assessing the offset of pension and private wealth; business owners are far less

likely to have pensions than other households but may hold large amounts of wealth for

reasons unrelated to pensions.

PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS (PSID)

A.1    Sample selection

       We use data from the PSID in 1981-87 and 1991-97. To construct our final

sample, we drop all households from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO), which

over-samples the poor, and from the added Latino sample. We also drop households with

heads who were younger than 26 or older than 50 in 1981 (for the 1981-1987 panel) or

1991 (for the 1991-1997 panel). We drop households with invalid education, occupation

or industry responses (including the unemployed and those who are not participating in

the labor market) in those same years, as well as households where the head’s marital

status changes at any time during the period considered. We also drop households from

the sample if the head or the wife changes during the period considered. Finally, to avoid

the estimation of the permanent and transitory variances to be driven by a few households

with extremely volatile incomes, we drop those households whose income in any year

falls below 20% of the average household income during the time period. We also

exclude observations with missing county unemployment rate. When using log wealth

over permanent income, we also exclude those observations with zero or negative wealth.

A.2.   Definitions

       Net worth

       Net worth is defined as the sum of all assets owned by the household at the time

of the interview. It includes money in checking or savings accounts and in IRAs; money

market bonds; Treasury bills; bond funds; cash value in life insurance policies; valuable

collections for investment purposes; rights in trusts or estates; shares of stock in publicly




                                             38
held corporations; mutual funds; investment trusts; stocks in IRAs; value of all vehicles,

and value of all (partially or fully) owned farms and businesses. The value of all those

assets is net of anything owed on them, such as the value of mortgages and due payments

of car loans. Other debts that have been subtracted include: mortgages on other owned

real estate, credit card charges, student loans, medical or legal bills and loans from

relatives.

        Non-capital current income

        We calculate non-capital income as labor income plus transfers of the head,

spouse, and all other members of the household. Labor income includes wages and

salaries, overtime compensation, bonuses, commissions and tips, and income from the

practice of a profession or trade, as well as the labor share of income from farm income

and business income. Total transfers include: (a) ADC/AFDC, Supplemental Security

Income and other welfare transfers; (b) Social Security transfers; (c) other retirement

income, pensions and annuities; (d) unemployment compensation; (e) workmen’s

compensation; (f) child support transfers; (g) transfers from relatives and friends; and (i)

food stamps, which are not included in any of the transfers above. All dollar values were

deflated to 1997 dollars, using the CPI.

        Permanent income

        We consider two alternative definitions of permanent income. The first one is

simply the time average of current income. For example, for a given household in the

1981-1987 panel, permanent income is average income over that period. We have also

considered the time average of expenditures on food (the sum of food at home, food away




                                            39
from home and annual value of food stamps) over the same period as an alternative proxy

for permanent income.

       Business owner

       A household is classified as business owner if answering ‘yes’ to the following

question in the wealth supplement of the PSID: ‘Do you (or anyone in your family living

there) own part or all of a farm or business?’ Our alternative definition of business

owners is household head is self-employed. The exact wording of that question is ‘Do

you (head) work for someone else, yourself, or what?’ The possible answers to this

question are: (1) someone else; (2) both someone else and self; and (3) self only. A

household is considered self-employed if the answer is either (2) or (3).



SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES (SCF)

B.1    Sample selection

       We use data from the 1995 SCF. To construct our final sample, we use as much as

possible the same restrictions used to construct the PSID sample. To summarize the main

restrictions, we drop households whose head is younger than 26 or older than 50. We also

drop households where the head of the household is not working and where the marital

status of the head changed at any time during the last 5 years. When using log wealth, we

exclude those observations with zero or negative wealth and zero desired precautionary

savings.

B.2.   Definitions

       Net worth




                                            40
       Net worth is defined as the sum of net savings and checking deposits, savings

bonds, stocks net of margin loans, bonds, mutual funds, IRAs, net value of other

retirement accounts, equity interests in annuities and trusts, housing equity, other real

estate equity, business equity, net value of vehicles, net cash value of life insurance and

the net values of miscellaneous assets minus all remaining debts.

       Permanent income

       Permanent income is taken to be a measure of “normal” income reported by SCF

respondents. This question follows a sequence of questions on actual income. Each

respondent was asked whether the total of all components of their income for the

preceding year was unusually high or low compared to normal. In this case, the

respondent was asked for the figure that would be more usual.

       Business owner

       A household is classified as being a business owner when reporting owning one

or more businesses in which the household has either an active management role or a

more passive investment role.

B.3.   Imputation of missing data

       Like most other surveys, the SCF deals with missing data through imputation, but

it differs from most in imputing multiple values for each missing variable. Multiple

imputations allow both statistically more efficient estimation of models with missing

information and an estimate of the variance costs of the missing data. In the SCF, the

nonmissing data and the imputations are provided as five replicates (or “implicates”) for

each observation (see Kennickell (1998) and Kennickell and Woodburn (1999)). For

each of the five sets of replicates, we use a bootstrap procedure to estimate the standard




                                             41
errors attributable to the fact that the variances measures are estimated using the PSID

data. We then combine the estimates of the coefficient estimates and standard errors for

each replica (see Tables 7 and 8). Programs are available from the authors upon requests.

households from the 1984 PSID and between 1991 and 1997 for households from the 1994 PSID. Non-capital income
includes all income from wage and transfers received by the household. Average food expenditure is the monthly food
on food at home and food away from home purchased by the household multiplied by 12.

Notes: This table reports IV estimation of a regression of the log of net worth on the variance of permanent income
shocks, transitory income shocks, and permanent income. The regression also includes controls for household
demographics and past shocks to wealth. See text for full detail of additional variables included. Estimation was
performed using PSID wealth data from 1984 and 1994. Sample was restricted to household between the age of 25 and
50. Permanent income is measured as average household non-capital income. The two variance measures as well as
permanent income were instrumented using occupation dummies, industry dummies, interactions between occupation
dummies with age and age squared, union status of household head, the county unemployment rate, and the variance of
county unemployment rate. Sample pools together business owners and non-business owners. We compute the percent
of net worth explained by precautionary savings by predicting net worth using the regression equation for each
household. We then predict net worth using the regression equation for each household and setting permanent and
transitory variances to zero. We compute the percent of net worth explained by precautionary saving by comparing
these two predicted values. See text for full details.

Notes: Estimations in column I of this table is exactly the same as the estimation reported in Table 1 except that the
sample is split by self-employment status. See notes to Table 1 for a full description of the specification and how we
compute the percent of total net worth explained by precautionary savings. Both regressions in this table use the log of
total net worth as the dependent variable and use average non-capital income as the measure of permanent income.

Note: This table reports the regressions of log of desired precautionary savings in the 1995 SCF on the variance of
permanent income shocks, the variance of transitory income shocks, and additional controls such as permanent income,
age, age squared, marital status, race, gender, and number of children. Column I uses the full sample of SCF
households. Column II restricts the sample to no-business owners only. Column III restricts the sample to only
business owners. The sample is restricted to all heads between the age of 25 and 50 and using the other restrictions in
constructing the PSID sample described in the text. The variance measures were predicted using PSID data and fitting
estimates back to the SCF using demographics (age, age squared, marital status, gender, race, sex and number of
children), industry dummies, education and occupation dummies and these dummies interacted with age and age
squared. Standard errors have been corrected to account for the fact that the variance measures are generated regressors
from the PSID.

Notes: Panel A reports the response to a survey question designed to measure how much savings a household desires to
have due to uncertainty surrounding future income and consumption needs. See the text for the exact wording of the
question. Panel B shows the ratio of desired precautionary savings to total net worth for the same sample of
households. Data are from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances. The sample is restricted to households with heads
aged between 25 and 50 and other restricted listed in the text. Sample size equals 1,497.
