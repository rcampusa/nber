Growth

                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the role of the ICT revolution in driving productivity growth behavior for the United
States and an aggregate of ten Western European nations (the EU-10) from 1977 to 2015. We find
that the standard growth accounting approach is deficient when it separates sources of growth
between ICT capital deepening and TFP growth, because much of the effect of the ICT revolution
was channeled through spillovers to TFP growth rather than being limited to the capital
deepening pathway. Using industry-level data from EU KLEMS, we find that most of the
1995-2005 U.S. productivity growth revival was driven by ICT-intensive industries producing
market services and computer hardware. In contrast the EU-10 experienced a 1995-2005 growth
slowdown due to a paucity of ICT investment, a failure to capture the efficiency benefits of ICT,
and performance shortfalls in specific industries including ICT production, finance-insurance,
retail-wholesale, and agriculture. After 2005 both the U.S. and the EU-10 suffered a growth
slowdown, indicating that the benefits of the ICT revolution were temporary rather than providing
a new permanent era of faster productivity growth. This joint transatlantic post-2005 slowdown
is consistent with the broader view that ongoing innovation has been less potent in boosting
productivity growth compared to earlier decades of the postwar era.

1. Introduction

        After a long slump between the 1970s and mid-1990s, when the annual rate of
productivity growth in the United States languished, a distinct productivity growth revival
occurred during the subsequent decade of 1995-2005. But that episode of renewed growth did
not last, as in the subsequent decade of 2005-15 U.S. productivity growth slumped back to a rate
even slower than that which had occurred prior to 1995. The trajectory of growth in Western
Europe was quite different, starting off with a pre-1995 productivity growth rate faster than in
the U.S. but then slumping in two stages, after 1995 and again after 2005, to a pace even slower
than the mediocre post-2005 rate achieved by the U.S.

        During the half decade between 1995 and 2000, the U.S. experienced a pronounced surge
of investment in information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and software.
The year 1995 marked the initial appearance of widely used web browsers, and the late 1990s
witnessed an investment boom in hardware and software as business firms rushed to modify
their business methods to take advantage of the newly invented internet and new business
services such as Google, founded in 1998. Several articles published soon after this ICT
investment boom credited it for most or all of the post-1995 revival in U.S. productivity growth
(Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000), Oliner and Sichel (2000), and Stiroh (2002)).

       However, the evolution of the U.S. data since the year 2000 raises a set of questions
about the causal role of ICT. Since productivity growth continued to be strong from 2000 to 2005
yet ICT investment slumped after 2000, does ICT investment still play a causal role in
explaining the productivity growth revival when the growth interval is extended? Furthermore,
since U.S productivity growth slumped after 2005 to a rate lower than that before 1995, to what
extent does lower ICT investment explain that post-2005 stalling of the growth process?

        The failure of Europe to enjoy a productivity growth revival similar to the U.S. after 1995
and its lamentably slow performance after 2005 raises further questions about the role of ICT
investment. Did the absence of a post-1995 growth revival occur because Europe invested
substantially less in ICT equipment than did the U.S.? Or was it that the extent of ICT
investment in Europe was similar to the U.S. but that same level of investment had a smaller
payoff than in the U.S.? Given that the U.S. and Europe had similarly slow productivity growth
rates after 2005, why was that growth performance so poor? To what extent did the same ICT-
intensive industries that led the post-1995 revival also contribute to the post-2005 decline in
growth?

       The most common way of answering these questions is to conduct an exercise in growth
accounting, crediting ICT and non-ICT capital growth as two distinct sources of growth by
multiplying their growth rates by their income shares. A complementary approach is to use
industry data to reveal the extent to which individual industries that produce ICT equipment or

                                                1
are relatively intensive users of ICT equipment account for periods of rapid or slow aggregate
productivity growth. This article uses both approaches to investigate the role of ICT investment
in the 1995-2005 and post-2005 behavior of growth in labor productivity and in total factor
productivity (TFP) in the U.S. and in Western Europe.

        Using KLEMS data on individual industries as in our previous transatlantic study
(Gordon and Sayed (2019)), we have developed time series for an aggregate of 10 Western
European nations, which we call the "EU-10."1 We are able to examine output and input data
for both the EU-10 and the U.S. for 16 industrial sectors as well as 11 subindustries within
manufacturing. The creation of data for the EU-10 as a single European aggregate contrasts with
previous studies that tend to examine a dizzying array of data for numerous individual
European nations. The EU-10 aggregation greatly facilitates the task of isolating sources of
differences in growth behavior between the U.S. and Europe. In our previous study (Gordon
and Sayed, 2019) we divided up the sources of labor productivity growth for the 27 industries
among capital deepening, changes in labor composition, and growth of TFP. There we
highlighted individual industries that had performed particularly well or badly and examined
the different time paths of capital deepening and TFP on each side of the Atlantic.

        This study goes further by examining the role of ICT capital as a source of differences in
labor productivity and TFP growth between the U.S. and EU-10 over three time periods
extending from 1977 to 2015 and divided at 1995 and 2005. 2 We start by studying the evolution
of labor productivity growth over the three time periods for the total economy and for two
dimensions of disaggregation ­ industries producing commodities versus services, and
industries that are relatively intensive or non-intensive users or producers of ICT equipment
and software. We emphasize the distinction between industries producing commodities vs.
services, since the usual explanation of the role of ICT-intensiveness in the productivity growth
process emphasizes the role of ICT in revolutionizing office spaces as workers transitioned to
desks with web-enabled personal computers, firms shifted their businesses to online platforms,
and communication and collaboration occurred through the internet. This process should have
boosted productivity growth in industries producing services more than in those producing
commodities.



        We then conduct a regression analysis to quantify the role of ICT intensiveness as a
source of changes in productivity growth after 1995 and after 2005. We disentangle the relative
roles of the amount of ICT intensiveness versus the payoff from a given extent of ICT

  "Western Europe" consists of the fifteen members of the European Union prior to its 2004 enlargement. Ten of
these nations are included in our EU-10 data ­ Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The five nations that are excluded ­ Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg,
and Portugal ­ are all small and together account for only 7 percent of 2017 EU-15 GDP (Source: Conference Board
Total Economy Database).

  This study starts in 1977 because that is the initial year of our ICT data. The previous paper extended back to 1972
for the EU-10 and to 1950 for the U.S.

                                                          2
intensiveness as sources of Europe's failure to experience a post-1995 productivity growth
revival and as sources of the post-2005 slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic. We then ask
whether ICT intensity contributed to productivity growth purely through its effect on capital
deepening or, whether in addition ICT intensiveness spilled over to boost the growth of TFP.

         We find that additional productivity growth in ICT intensive industries drove almost all
of the post-1995 revival in U.S. productivity growth. However, this change in growth occurred
almost entirely in services-producing industries rather than commodities-producing industries
except for the electric machinery industry that produces computer hardware. This makes sense
because the most intensive users of ICT were industries in the services sector. The EU-10 story is
quite different. Productivity growth in producing computer hardware in the EU-10 actually
slowed after 1995 in contrast to its explosive growth in the U.S. Further in the EU-10 there was
little difference between the productivity growth slowdown after 1995 and after 2005 in
industries that were intensive in ICT use versus the non-ICT industries. Europe not only
invested less in ICT hardware but failed to reap its benefits even in industries that were heavy
ICT users.

Plan of the Paper

        The paper has seven main sections. Following this introduction, part 2 provides an
overview of the literature on the relationship between ICT and productivity growth in the U.S.
and Europe. Part 3 starts with a contrast of productivity growth rates over the three periods for
the U.S. and EU-10. We present a decomposition of sources of growth that emphasizes the
distinction between TFP growth and ICT capital deepening. In part 4 we introduce and display
indicators of ICT intensity and examine the behavior of productivity growth in the ICT-
intensive and ICT non-intensive industries. Part 5 provides the analytical framework for the
regression analysis in which the observations are the evolution of labor productivity and TFP
growth over the three periods for 27 industries. Part 6 carries out the regression analysis,
emphasizes the similarity of results explaining growth in labor productivity versus TFP,
distinguishes between the role of differing ICT intensity versus the payoff from ICT, and singles
out individual industries as primarily responsible for the results. Part 7 summarizes the results
and concludes.

2. Overview of the Related Literature

       TFP takes a central role in the analysis of Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000). They attribute the
acceleration between 1990-95 and 1995-98 in labor productivity growth roughly equally
between TFP and capital deepening, with about two thirds of the increase in TFP due to non-
ICT producing industries. They explicitly suggest inter-industry spillover effects, with the
higher TFP growth of ICT-producing industries paving the way for other industries like
wholesale and retail trade to invest in computers and electronic equipment.




                                                3
       Stiroh (2002) employs industry-level BEA data for 1977-2000 to examine the industry
composition of growth prior to and after 1995. Stiroh flags a subset of his industries as ICT-
intensive and examines the differential effect of ICT intensity on the post-1995 productivity
growth acceleration. He estimates that ICT-intensive industries experienced a productivity
growth revival of roughly 2 percentage points while non-ICT intensive industries experienced
no revival, suggesting that the post-1995 productivity growth revival was entirely driven by
industries that invested heavily in ICT. His emphasis on the stimulative role of these ICT-using
industries shows that the productivity acceleration was not driven just by those industries
producing computer hardware and software.

         Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2005) emphasize spillover effects. These authors find that
TFP accelerations of the late 1990s and early 2000s required investments in ICT capital. Thus
ICT capital deepening augments TFP growth. A subsequent article by the same authors (2008)
distinguishes between productivity growth from 1995-2000 that was driven by ICT-producing
industries, as contrasted to the 2000-2005 interval that was driven by industries intensive in ICT
use. They also point to the positive effects of structural market changes, such as reallocation
effects, increases in competition, and the emergence of flexible labor markets. Bartelsman et al.
(2007) suggest that while a productivity acceleration was led by the technology and
wholesale/retail sectors in the late 1990s, additional growth in the finance and business services
sectors during the early 2000s sustained an aggregate acceleration in growth until 2004, with
TFP playing the primary role.

       While there is a broad consensus that ICT-intensive industries drove the acceleration of
U.S productivity growth in the late 1990s, the subsequent turnaround to much slower
productivity growth after 2005 raises new questions. Did the ICT revolution of the late 1990s
have a sustained positive impact on productivity growth, or was it only a one-time shock? In
Fernald's (2015) interpretation, the ICT revolution had a temporary "level effect" that resulted
in a marked but short-lived period of additional productivity growth that ran its course after
about a decade. Extending Stiroh's (2002) result, Fernald suggests that both the rise and fall of
labor productivity growth resulted from a temporary boost to productivity growth in both ICT-
producing and ICT-using industries. Cette et al. (2016) likewise claim that the ICT revolution
had run its course by 2004. In their view, the ability of ICT investment to foster TFP growth
through channels like electronic inventory management or role-reorganization in services
industries was exhausted by 2004-2005.

       Byrne et al. (2016) maintain that while ICT-innovations continued into the late-2000s,
they were not potent enough to prevent a broad post-2004 slowdown in U.S. productivity
growth. They also suggest that the subsequent post-2005 wave of communications innovation
associated with smartphones and social networks has enhanced consumer surplus without
appreciably raising business-sector productivity. On the other hand, Byrne and Corrado (2017)
suggest that ICT price-indices have been mis-measured and that the ICT services sector could
have been contributing about 1.4 points to total economy productivity growth after 2014. About



                                                4
a quarter of this 1.4 points is concentrated in investment in cloud-based computing and online
services, the use of which has been steadily rising in the economy through the late 2010s.

        The dominant role of ICT investment in the U.S. productivity growth acceleration of the
late 1990s is not universally accepted. Acemoglu et al. (2014) in a study of U.S. manufacturing
show little difference in the degree of growth resurgence between ICT-using and non-ICT-using
industries. While these authors do find a positive impact on labor productivity for
manufacturing industries that utilize high-tech equipment, they cast doubt on the proposition
that ICT intensity can explain the entire post-1995 revival. In our subsequent study of
productivity growth differences across industries, we are careful to distinguish between the
quite different behavior of industries producing commodities (including manufacturing) from
those producing services.

        In an early comparative study of ICT-related investment, Colecchia and Schreyer (2002)
show that nine OECD countries 3 ramped up investment in ICT in the 1990s. In the late 1990s,
ICT investment contributed between 0.3 and 0.9 points to economic growth, although the U.S.
benefited much more than any of the other countries in their data set. In contrasting the U.S.
mid-90s acceleration with the deceleration in Europe, O'Mahony et al. (2008) survey a variety of
causes, including lower total factor productivity (TFP) growth and the lower importance of ICT-
producing industries in Europe. They attribute the absence of a post-1995 productivity growth
revival in Europe to the slower emergence of a knowledge economy in Europe, particularly in
the services sector, and argue that particular labor market structures and regulatory laws may
have played a role in dampening productivity growth.

        Timmer and van Ark (2005) describe how Europe lagged behind the U.S. in ICT
investment after 1980, implying that the region was not as prepared as the U.S. to reap the
benefits of the post-1995 ICT revolution. TFP gains from ICT-producing sectors and additional
capital deepening from ICT-capital investment explain almost all the U.S.-Europe productivity
differential during 1995-2001. Their framework uses a European Union aggregate with a growth
decomposition of labor productivity into its components of capital deepening, labor quality,
and TFP.

        Some authors have argued that Europe simply needed to play catch up to the U.S again,
as it had done in the early postwar years. For example, Inklaar et al. (2007) argue that the main
differences between U.S. and EU growth were due to a shortfall in TFP growth in the European
services sector, and that over the next few years following their 2007 publication date we would
see increased ICT investment and a subsequent growth revival in the European economy. But
as we have seen that growth revival did not occur. In fact, Dabla-Norris et al. (2015) argue that
while the services sector drove the gap between U.S. and European productivity growth, the
time to tap into the full potential of ICT may have already passed for Europe. Cette et al. (2016)
argue that the U.S. established a technological frontier to which Southern European countries


3   Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S.

                                                             5
like Italy and Spain needed to catch up. But this explanation fails to explain the lack of an ICT-
driven growth revival in the EU countries outside of Southern Europe.

        Inklaar et al. (2011) suggest that the significant decline in European labor force
participation and hours worked per person between 1973 and 1995 may have meant that, when
the ICT revolution finally came, European industries may not have been ready to reap the
benefits of new technologies. Bloom et al. (2012) show that U.S.-owned multinational
companies that had operations in Europe were able to reap the benefits of the ICT revolution
while European firms were not, suggesting that differences in management structure between
the two regions may have helped drive this transatlantic productivity gap. Adding further
evidence of the reorganization role of ICT investment in the U.S. resurgence. Castellani et al.
(2016) find that European countries performed worse at both investing in research and
development and in transforming that R&D expenditure into a significant productivity growth
response. Moreover, these authors contend that while the U.S. shifted its economy to "high-
tech" sectors, much of the European economy remained in "medium-tech" and "low-tech"
sectors, where capital deepening is the main channel driving productivity growth.

3. Transatlantic Productivity Growth, 1977-2015

         We begin with a straightforward comparison between the U.S. and EU-10 in the growth
rate of labor productivity during three eras spanning 1977 to 2015. Data limitations require that
1977 is the starting date in this paper, as contrasted with 1972 for the EU-10 and 1948 for the
U.S. in our previous study (Gordon and Sayed, 2019). 4 After the initial labor productivity
growth comparison, we proceed to a Solow-type decomposition of the sources of growth,
including ICT and non-ICT capital deepening, changes in labor composition, and changes in
TFP growth.




Productivity Growth Across Time for the Major Sectors


4
 Our KLEMS data are missing observations on several inputs including ICT capital for the "Professional and
Administrative" industry prior to 1977.

                                                        6
        We look first at growth rates of labor productivity in Table 1, where the first two rows
cover the total economy and the market economy (which excludes public services, education,
health, and real estate). The bottom two lines divide up the market economy into industries
producing commodities (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, and utilities) and the
remaining industries producing market services.

         The top row of Table 1 for the total economy contrasts the 1995-2005 revival of U.S.
productivity growth from 1.11 to 2.17 per cent per year with the post-1995 slowdown of EU-10
growth from 2.21 to 1.26 per cent per year. Both entities share in common a post-2005 growth
slowdown, from 2.17 to 0.87 per cent per year for the U.S. and from 1.26 to 0.63 per cent per
year for the EU-10. The second line for the market economy shows a sharper 1.35 per cent post-
1995 increase in U.S. growth as compared to a smaller 1.06 per cent post-1995 increase for the
total economy. The U.S. market economy also exhibits a more pronounced post-2005 slowdown
of 2.03 percent per year as contrasted to the slowdown of 1.30 per cent per year for the total
economy. The greater post-1995 revival and post-2005 slowdown in the market economy than
the total economy reflects the relative stagnation of growth during all three periods in the four
industries within the non-market economy. There are smaller differences between the total and
market economies for the EU-10, where the overall slowdown from the first to the third period
is 1.58 per cent per year for the total economy and a similar 1.69 per cent for the market
economy.

        The bottom two rows of Table 1 divide up the market economy into commodities-
producing and services-producing industries and show that productivity growth has been
faster in all three periods on both sides of the Atlantic in the production of commodities than in
the production of services. In the U.S., the post-1995 growth revival and post-2005 growth
slowdown were of roughly the same order of magnitude in commodities as in services, as the
margin by which commodities growth exceeded services growth was relatively stable across the
three periods (0.71, 0.98, and 0.64 percentage points respectively). From the first to last period
the growth slowdown in commodities of 0.83 percentage points was almost the same as the 0.76
percentage-points slowdown in services.

        The story for commodities versus services in the EU-10 is different, as the margin by
which commodities growth exceeded services growth shrank from 1.51 percentage points in the
first period to a mere 0.22 percentage points in the last period. The extent of the early-to-late
productivity growth slowdown was 2.37 percentage points for commodities and a smaller 1.08
per cent for services. Thus in studying the behavior at the industry level we can anticipate
finding that the problem of diminished growth in the EU-10 is disproportionately an issue of
performance in the commodities sector, whereas in the U.S. responsibility for the post-1995
revival and post-2005 slowdown is shared roughly equally between commodities and services.

        Was productivity growth in the EU-10 held back because its industry mix reflected a
smaller role for hi-tech industries and a larger role for low-tech industries? This suggestion can
be tested by calculating an alternative aggregate EU-10 productivity growth rate when the U.S.

                                                 7
industry mix is applied to the EU growth rate of productivity in each industry. We multiply
each European industry's labor productivity growth rate by the U.S. value-added share of that
industry for each year from 1977 through 2015 and then sum up the industry terms to calculate
a hypothetical counterfactual aggregate for EU-10 labor productivity growth. We find that, were
the EU-10 to have shared the same industry composition as the U.S., its alternative aggregate
productivity growth would have been 1.69 per cent for 1977-95, 1.28 for 1995-05, and 0.76 for
2005-15.

        Compared with the actual growth rates of 2.21, 1.26, and 0.63 for the same time periods,
we see that the U.S. industry mix substantially lowers EU productivity growth in the first period,
makes no difference in the second period, and slightly raises growth in the third period. The big
change in the 1977-95 period occurs because the U.S. had a substantially lower share of total
output devoted to commodities production, and since EU commodity growth was almost
double growth in the services sector, imposing U.S. share weights reduces counterfactual EU
1977-95 growth. The counterfactual early-to-late slowdown for the EU is reduced from 1.58
percentage points in the actual data to 0.93 points in the counterfactual experiment which
imposes U.S. weights. This exercise is another way of drawing attention to the predominant role
of the commodities sector in driving the early-to-late slowdown in EU-10 productivity growth.

Sources of Growth Decomposition

        Now we take the productivity growth rates from Table 1 and apply a standard
decomposition of sources of growth in Table 2. The U.S. decomposition appears in the left half
of the table and the EU-10 version in the right half. The growth rate of labor productivity ("LP")
from Table 1 is listed in the left column and is decomposed in the remaining columns into the
contributions of TFP, changes in labor quality ("LQ"), ICT capital deepening ("ICT KD") and
non-ICT capital deepening ("NICT KD"). Here we ignore the LQ column, as the numbers are
small and vary little across time intervals. Since ICT capital deepening contributions are not
available in the U.S. KLEMS data prior to 1999, Table 2 backcasts the U.S. series using nominal
ICT KLEMS data (which is available through the 1970s) deflated using total economy BEA data.
The specifics of this backcasting process are described at the bottom of Table 2. 5




5We note that the BEA deflators we utilize refer to the total economy and involve using data from outside the
KLEMS database. Hence, while use of this backcasting method may be appropriate for the larger U.S. aggregates of
the total economy, market economy, commodities, and services, it may not be suitable method of backcasting for the
27 individual industries that make up these aggregates.

                                                        8
        The question addressed by this exercise is the extent to which the rise and fall of U.S.
productivity growth, as well as the two-phase decline in EU productivity growth, were
associated with changes in TFP as contrasted with ICT and non-ICT capital deepening. In the
top left row for the U.S. total economy, only a small portion of the post-1995 LP growth
acceleration of 1.06 percentage points is due to the contribution of TFP (0.24 points), and much
more to the two components of capital deepening (ICT 0.32 points and non-ICT 0.44 points).
The story is similar for the 1.30 point productivity slowdown after 2005, with a minor TFP
contribution of 0.20 points contrasted with ICT and non-ICT capital deepening contributions of
0.34 and 0.72 points, respectively. Stated another way, the contribution of ICT capital deepening
accounted for less than one-third of either the post-1995 or post-2005 changes in U.S. labor
productivity growth.

     Moving down to the next U.S. sector describing the market economy the up and down
movement of productivity growth is greater (1.35 and -2.03 points), and the contribution to

                                                9
these movements of TFP growth is considerably larger than for the total economy. The
contribution of non-ICT capital deepening is negligible for post-1995 and goes in the wrong
direction as an explanation for the post-2005 productivity growth slowdown. But we still retain
the finding that less than one-third of the overall change can be attributed to ICT capital
deepening (0.34 and -0.55 points respectively). Thus our initial look at the U.S. economy appears
to contradict the finding in much of the literature reviewed above that the post-1995
acceleration of U.S. productivity growth was primarily driven by ICT investment.

        The next sections for the U.S. provide the growth decomposition for commodities-
producing industries and for market services. In commodities, a 1.23 point post-1995
acceleration in TFP growth explains almost all of the 1.47 point post-1995 rise in labor
productivity growth. On the way down after 2005, the TFP contribution of 2.77 points more
than explains the 2.30 point slowdown in labor productivity growth. ICT capital deepening
plays virtually no role in explaining these movements for commodities. For market services the
story is quite different, as TFP growth (0.69 points) and ICT capital deepening (0.60 points)
divide the explanation of the 1.20 point post-1995 speedup in labor productivity growth.
Similarly, their respective contributions of 1.00 and 0.92 points neatly divide the recorded post-
2005 productivity growth slowdown of 1.96 points. We shall return in subsequent sections to
explore this apparent bifurcation of roles for ICT capital deepening as making an important
contribution in services while having little to no importance in the commodities sector.

        The right half of Table 2 provides the same decomposition for the EU-10. In the top
section on the total economy, we see that the initial post-1995 slowdown in labor productivity
growth of 0.95 points was explained by TFP growth (0.56 points) and non-ICT capital
deepening (0.53 points), with no role for ICT capital deepening. The subsequent post-2005
productivity growth slowdown of 0.63 had as its counterpart a 0.29 point deceleration in TFP
growth together with very small contributions of ICT and non-ICT capital deepening (0.17 and
0.07 points, respectively). The balance of contributions was essentially the same in the EU
market economy as in the total economy.

        Since we are interested in why the EU did not match the post-1995 speedup in
productivity growth enjoyed by the U.S., we can look from left to right across the market
industries section of Table 2 to note that ICT capital deepening in the U.S. during 1995-2005 of
0.80 points greatly exceeded the 0.37 point ICT contribution for the EU-10. But that is not the
whole story, as the contrast in TFP growth between the U.S. (1.46 points) and the EU-10 (only
0.48 points) was a bigger part of the explanation of U.S. success in this period. We will
investigate in a subsequent section whether U.S. industries that were ICT intensive
disproportionately enjoyed faster TFP growth during this interval.

        As noted above, EU-10 labor productivity growth slowed down between the early (1977-
95) period and the late (200515) interval much more in the commodities sector than in market
services. The early-to-late productivity growth slowdown for commodities of 2.37 points was
largely explained by a decline in TFP growth (1.78 points), with virtually no role of ICT capital

                                                10
deepening. Thus the EU experience of commodities was similar to that of the U.S. in that ICT
capital deepening played little to no role on either side of the Atlantic. In the EU market services
sector, the early-to-late labor productivity slowdown of 1.08 points is attributed most
importantly to non-ICT capital deepening (0.61 points) with smaller roles for TFP growth (0.27
points) and ICT capital deepening (0.22 points). It thus appears that the industries in the
market services sector are those in which the U.S. ICT advantage occurred.

4. Measures of ICT Intensity and Their Industry Distribution

        The relationship between labor productivity growth and ICT intensity is a central issue
in this paper. Did U.S. industries that were relatively heavy users of ICT experience a relatively
large post-1995 productivity growth acceleration and/or a relatively large post-2005 growth
slowdown? Did EU-10 ICT-intensive industries have relatively large or small productivity
growth slowdowns after 1995 and again after 2005? Can slower productivity growth during
1995-2005 in the EU-10 than in the U.S. be explained by lower values of ICT indicators in the
EU-10?

         Two alternative ICT-intensity variables are available in the KLEMS data for both the U.S.
and EU-10 and for all 27 of the available industries, including the 16 industrial sectors into
which the total economy is divided, as well as the 11 sub-industries within manufacturing. The
first of these is the ICT "share indicator," which is formulated as in Stiroh (2002). We compute
the average ICT share of investment, which is the annual nominal expenditure on computing
equipment, communications equipment and computer software and databases, all divided by
the annual nominal expenditure on total capital investment. Initially we examine the actual
values of this ratio for individual industries and subsequently in the regressions we convert the
share indicator into a share dummy variable equal to unity for industries which are ranked
above the median value in the 1991-95 period and zero otherwise.

        The other KLEMS ICT variable is the "contribution indicator," equal to the contribution
of ICT capital to real value-added growth. This is available at the industry level only beginning
in 1999. As with the share indicator, we initially display numerical values of the contribution
indicator but for the regression analysis convert it into a dummy variable equal to unity for
industries which are ranked above the median value in the 1999-2005 period and zero
otherwise. For the regression analysis we also distinguish ICT use from ICT production by
creating dummy variables for the "Electric machinery" industry that produces ICT hardware
and the "Information and Communications" industry that produces ICT software and data.




                                                11
        The values of the share indicator for 1991-95 are displayed in Figure 1, where the EU
value is plotted on the vertical axis and the U.S. value of the indicator for the same industry is
plotted on the horizontal axis. Only the 16 industrial sectors are shown, as there is insufficient
space to display clearly the 11 additional manufacturing sub-industries. The thin diagonal 45-
degree line indicates equal values for the EU and U.S.; six industries are above that line
indicating a higher EU-10 than U.S. value, while 10 are below that line, indicating a lower EU-10
than U.S. value.

        The thick diagonal regression line in Figure 1 has a coefficient of 0.91, indicating that the
average value of the share indicator for a given industry in the EU-10 is 91 per cent of its value
in the U.S. Notice that all of the industries with the highest values of the share indicator are in
the market services sector ­ finance/insurance, information/communications,
professional/administrative, and trade. The fact that the regression line lies so close to unity
suggests that on average a low EU value of the ICT share indicator is not an important
explanation of why the EU-10 registered slower productivity growth than the U.S. during 1995-
2005.

        Panel A in Figure 2 displays the EU-10 and U.S. values of the alternative contribution
ICT indicator for 1999-2005 in the same format as Figure 1. Note that, in contrast to the share
indicator, the contribution indicator is less "spread out," with only five of the U.S. industries
and only three of the EU-10 industries having a contribution indicator above 0.5. Because of the
cluster of dots near the origin in Panel A, we supplement it with Panel B which shows a
"zoomed in" version of the same information in the region of 0 to 0.5 on the two axes.

                                                 12
13
         For the contribution indicator the values for the EU-10 are considerably lower on
average than in the U.S., as summarized by the regression coefficient of 0.49. This indicates that
on average the value of the contribution indicator for a given industry in the EU-10 is roughly
half of its value for the counterpart industry in the U.S. Since the contribution indicator equals
capital's income share times the growth rate of ICT capital 6, a factor holding back EU-10 labor
productivity growth during 1995-2005 was slower growth of ICT capital. Notice that the four
service-sector industries that are highest ranked in the U.S. by the criterion of the contribution
indicator are the same as those when ranked by the share indicator.

         Appendix Table A1 lists the actual and dummy values for all U.S. and EU-10 industries
of both the share indicator (1991-95) and contribution indicator (1999-2005). Table A1 includes
not just the 16 industrial sectors shown in the Figures 1 and 2 but also the 11 sub-industries
within manufacturing. Also shown for ease of reference in Table A1 are the growth rates of
labor productivity and of TFP in the three sub-intervals between 1977 and 2015 as well as the
average 1977-2015 value-added share of each industry and sub-industry to provide a measure
of its relative importance.

        We have now examined productivity growth rates in Tables 1 and 2 and ICT intensity
indicators in the two figures. The effect of ICT intensity on productivity growth is illustrated in
Table 3, where we define industries that are intensive in ICT use as those ranked above the
median in a ranking of the share indicator. This ranking is carried out separately for the U.S.
and EU-10. By dividing up the industries into these two groups we are able to ask whether
industries that are intensive in ICT use had higher growth rates in the U.S. 1995-2005 rapid
growth period and whether the decline in productivity growth after 2005 in the U.S. and after
1995 in the EU-10 was concentrated in ICT-use-intensive industries. In addition to separating
industries by their intensity of ICT use, we also single out two ICT-producing industries,
electric machinery in the commodities sector and information/communications in the market
services sector.

        Because we obtain roughly the same decomposition using either the share or
contribution version of the intensity of ICT use measure, we simplify Table 3 by exhibiting
results only for the share version. The top section of the table for the total economy singles out
the ICT-producing industries as having much faster productivity growth than the other
industry groups in both the U.S. and EU for all three time periods. This breakdown also
highlights the ICT-producing industries as the only group having a post-1995 growth
acceleration in the EU, in contrast to the other two groups that experienced a post-1995 growth
slowdown. All three industry groups in the EU as well as the U.S. registered slower
productivity growth after 2005.



6For example, if the growth rate of ICT capital over a given year is 0.5 and its income share is 0.4, the contribution of
ICT capital to productivity growth is 0.2.


                                                           14
        How do the industries intensive in ICT use compare to the non-ICT industries? For the
U.S. the ICT-use group has faster growth than the non-ICT group by a margin of 2.23 to 1.20 per
cent in the middle period but, surprisingly, somewhat slower growth in the first and third time
intervals. This means that the ICT-use industries had a much greater 1995-2005 productivity
acceleration than the non-ICT industries (1.45 vs. 0.29 points) as well as a much larger post-2005
slowdown (1.77 vs. 0.39 points). For the EU the ICT-use group registers faster growth than the
non-ICT industries in all three periods by a modest margin of 0.78, 0.52, and 0.58 percentage
points respectively. This means that the EU early-to-late productivity slowdown was similar in
both groups (slowdowns of 1.70 and 1.50 points, respectively).




        The bottom two sections of Table 3 divide up the market economy into commodities and
market services. Again we see for the U.S. and EU-10 that the ICT-producing industries in the
commodities sector (electric machinery) and in the services sector
(information/communications) experienced growth accelerations in 1995-2005 and slowdowns
in 2005-2015. For the other industries in the U.S. the commodities and services sectors exhibit
very different impacts of ICT use. In the commodities sector the post-1995 acceleration was
concentrated in the non-ICT industries with relatively slow productivity growth in the ICT-use
group. The opposite was true for market services where the post-1995 acceleration and post-
2005 slowdown were much more evident in the ICT-use-intensive industries than in the non-
ICT group.

       We can gain an understanding of these patterns for the U.S. by referring back to Figure
1, which displays the value of the ICT share indicator that is used to divide up industries into
the ICT-use and non-ICT components for the decomposition of Table 3. Within the commodities


                                               15
sector the construction industry has a relatively high value of the ICT-use indicator but exhibits
productivity growth of about -1.0 per cent per year in all three time intervals. This is sufficient
to hold down overall U.S. productivity growth in the ICT-use segment of the commodities
sector. In contrast in the market services sector all the post-1995 acceleration and post-2005
slowdown in productivity growth occurs in the ICT-use industries, four of which are the
highest ranked in terms of the ICT-use indicator. These are the industries where we would
expect the digital revolution to have its major impact on business efficiency ­ not only
information/communications (which is shown separately on the services "ICT Prod" line in
Table 3), but also finance/insurance, professional/administrative, and wholesale/retail trade.

        For the EU there is much less difference between commodities and services and between
ICT-use-intensive and non-ICT industries. In all these EU-10 industry groups productivity
growth slowed down after 1995 and again after 2005. Surprisingly the ICT-producing electric
machinery industry in the EU-10 actually experienced slower productivity growth after 1995
despite all the innovation that was driving faster productivity in that industry for the U.S. The
extent of the EU-10 early-to-late slowdown was greatest in the non-ICT industries (2.82
percentage points in commodities and 2.27 percentage points in services) where productivity
growth was zero after 2005. The early-to-late slowdown was somewhat less in the ICT-use-
intensive industries (1.64 percentage points in commodities and 0.98 percentage points in
services). To this extent intensity of ICT use helped the EU by avoiding the post-2005
productivity paralysis experienced by the EU's non-ICT-intensive industries.

       Comparing the EU with the U.S. for the middle 1995-2005 period, the main sources of
EU-10 weakness were in commodities ICT production (i.e., electrical machinery) with 12.79
percentage points slower labor productivity growth relative to the U.S. (4.78 per cent versus
17.87 per cent), non-ICT commodities 1.36 percentage points slower growth (2.88 per cent
versus 1.52 per cent), and ICT-use market services 2.09 percentage points slower growth (2.86
per cent versus 0.77 per cent). We return in Table 7 to look more closely at the 1995-2005
performance of particular industries in both the U.S. and EU-10 that were intensive in ICT use.

5. Cross-Industry Regression Framework

       We have now examined in Table 3 average rates of productivity growth for groups of
industries that have a relatively high or low value of our share-based ICT-use-intensity
indicator. Now we turn to regressions in which productivity growth in our 27 industry sectors
and manufacturing sub-industries constitute the observations to be explained. Our regression
framework is adapted from Stiroh (2002), whose specification reflected two time periods, pre-
and post-1995 ending in 2000. Here, in contrast, we have three time intervals in which our 1977-
2015 overall time period is split at 1995 and 2005. We begin with a simple equation that allows
productivity growth to differ across the three intervals:

                                  =  + 1  + 2  +  (1)



                                                16
where the "M" ("mid") variable is a dummy equal to unity after 1995, and the "L" ("late")
variable is a dummy equal to unity after 2005. The constant  represents average labor
productivity growth for all industries during 1977-1995. The coefficient 1 on "M" represents
the difference between average labor productivity growth in 1995-2005 minus 1977-1995 for all
industries, while the coefficient 2 on the "L" term is the average difference between 2005-15
minus 1995-2005 for all industries.

       We augment this model so that the  term becomes an industry specific constant  . This
allows us to estimate a fixed effects regression of the form:

                                  =  + 1  + 2  +  (2)

Now, the  term is the average productivity growth of industry  during 1977-95. This allows
greater flexibility in the sense that industries are allowed to start from different initial values of
productivity growth prior to 1995. The 1 term still captures the average productivity growth
change of all industries from 1977-95 to 1995-2005, and 2 measures the average productivity
growth change of all industries from 1995-2005 to 2005-2015.

        The purpose of our regressions is to capture the effect of ICT-intensity in driving
changes in productivity growth that occurred post-1995 and post-2005. The regressions differ
from the decomposition of Table 3 in two ways. The first difference is by measuring the change
in productivity growth across time intervals as contrasted with the level of productivity growth
as displayed in Table 3. The second difference is that the regressions control for differences
across industries in productivity growth during the 1977-95 base period, whereas these
differences are not subtracted out in Table 3. Accordingly the regression format can be written
as

                    =  + 1  + 2  + 1    + 2    + (3)

The ICT variable is a dummy equal to unity if industry  is ICT intensive, with ICT intensity
measured using either the "share" or "contribution" indicator as defined above. With this
design, 1 measures the average post-1995 acceleration of non-ICT-intensive industries, while
1 + 1 captures the average post-1995 change in productivity growth of ICT-intensive
industries. 1 then captures the additional productivity change (up or down) of ICT-intensive
industries post-1995 relative to non-ICT industries. Similarly, 2 represents the post-2005
acceleration or deceleration of non-ICT-intensive industries relative to 1995-2005 while 2 +
2 measures the change in productivity growth of ICT intensive industries, with 2 capturing
the difference between the two groups.

       As in Table 3 we are interested in distinguishing the effect of the two industries that
produce ICT from the other industries that are relatively intensive in the use of ICT. To measure
the ICT-production effect, we allow these two industries (electric machinery and
information/communication) to have separate coefficients that measure their contribution to the


                                                  17
post-1995 and post-2005 changes in productivity growth. This leads us to add in four more
regression terms to control for these ICT producing industries, as written in equation (4) below:

                           =  + 1  + 2  + 1   
                  + 2    +1    + 2    +1    + 2    +  (4)

Now the interpretation of the 1 term is the additional growth change of the electrical
machinery industry relative to ICT-intensive industries; 1 has a similar interpretation but for
the information/communications industry. The 2 and 2 coefficients provide equivalent
interpretations for the post-2005 slowdown in productivity growth.

        One issue with estimating equations (1) through (4) via ordinary least squares is that
each regressor's coefficient will only capture (geometric) average changes in productivity
growth. We may be worried about the influence of erratic behavior in relatively "small"
industries on our estimates of each of the coefficients. For example, the U.S. agricultural
industry experienced a post-1995 acceleration of 3.55 percentage points despite accounting for
only 2 per cent of value added in the total economy. To address this issue, we estimate equation
(4) using weighted least squares (WLS), with the weight of an industry equal to its value-added
(VA) share in 1976. This weighting procedure follows that of Stiroh (2002), which in turn draws
on Kahn and Lim (1998), and is based on the reasoning that (1) industries with smaller VA
shares should be given less importance in analyzing determinants of aggregate growth and (2)
industries with smaller VA shares have noisier productivity growth data. Our choice of the year
1976 preserves exogeneity of the weights, since the first data point in all of our regressions is
1977-78 productivity growth.

6. Industry Regression Results

Labor Productivity Growth

        Table 4 presents results based on equation (4) above, where the observations are annual
labor productivity growth rates between 1977 and 2015 for the 27 industries. The left half of the
table refers to the U.S. and the right half refers to the EU-10 aggregate. 7 To conserve space the
individual fixed-effect constants for the 27 industries are not listed separately. All columns are
estimated with Weighted Least Squares. For the EU-10, data for only 26 industries are utilized,
as the "wholesale and retail" industries are consolidated into a single sector in the European
KLEMS data.

        The grid of "Yes" boxes designates the differences between results listed in the
individual columns of the table. Columns (A) and (D) refer to the total economy, while (B)
selects the annual observations of the 15 commodities industries (including the sub-industries
within manufacturing) and (C) selects the annual observations for the 12 services industries

7
  There are 27 industries for the U.S. but only 26 for the EU-10, because data limitations require us to combine the
retail and wholesale industries for the EU-10 whereas separate retail and wholesale data are available for the U.S.

                                                          18
(including both market and non-market services). For the U.S., columns (A) through (C) use the
share indicator as the ICT-intensity variable while (D) uses the contribution indicator. 8 Thus a
comparison of columns (A) and (D) shows the difference made when the contribution indicator
in (D) is substituted for the share indicator in (A).




        We first examine the results for the U.S. as displayed in columns (A) through (D). The
low magnitudes and lack of significance on all U.S. coefficients in line (1) for the post-1995
dummy reflect the fact that non-ICT-intensive industries had little additional productivity
growth after 1995 compared to their 1977-95 growth rate. The U.S. ICT-use post-1995 interaction
coefficients in line (3) are positive and generally significant (except for commodities industries
in column (B)); this suggests that, unlike the non-ICT-intensive industries, the U.S. industries
intensive in ICT use had a significant acceleration of productivity growth after 1995. In the total

8
 An identical version of this Table with results for only the contribution variable can be found in Appendix Table
A2.

                                                         19
U.S. economy this extra post-1995 growth was 1.64 points for the share indicator and 1.35 points
for the contribution indicator, and in the services sector was a considerably higher 2.41 points.

        Recall that the post-1995 dummy variable refers to 1995-2015, not 1995-2005, and so the
coefficient on the post-2005 dummy variable measures the change in productivity after 2005 as
compared to 1995-2005, not as compared to 1977-95. This change in productivity growth after
2005 is shown in lines (2) and (4). There is a modest decline in line (2) for the U.S. non-ICT-
intensive industries, but this decline is significant only in the commodities industries. There is a
decline for the total U.S. economy in the ICT-use-intensive industries, a significant 1.55 for the
share indicator and an insignificant -0.96 for the contribution indicator. The decline was a
highly significant 2.66 in the services industries.

        When we compare lines (1) and (2) for the U.S. non-ICT-intensive industries, the
negative post-2005 coefficients are larger in absolute value than the positive post-1995
coefficients, reflecting the fact that productivity growth was slower after 2005 than before 1995.
For the ICT-use-intensive industries the negative post-2005 coefficients are roughly the same
size in absolute value as the positive post-1995 coefficients, indicating that for these industries
U.S. productivity growth was roughly the same after 2005 as it was before 1995.
The coefficients for the "EM" (electric machinery) industry are shown on lines (5) and (6), where
for the U.S. there was an enormous and highly significant post-1995 productivity growth
acceleration and post-2005 slowdown. This is the industry that produces computer hardware
that reached its peak of innovation in the 1995-2005 decade (Oliner-Sichel, 2000). The fact that
the negative coefficient for the 2005-15 dummy variable is larger than the positive coefficient for
the 1995-2015 dummy variable reflects the fact that productivity growth in this industry was
lower after 2005 than before 1995. In contrast the U.S. coefficients for the "I&C"
(information/communications) industry on lines (7) and (8) are all insignificant.

        Turning now to the right half of Table 4 for the EU-10 in columns (E) through (H), we
can highlight those aspects of the results that differ from those for the U.S. The first contrast
appears on lines (1) and (2) where (except for the services industries in column (G)) the non-
ICT-intensive industries in the EU-10 had a highly significant growth slowdown after 1995 and
yet another significant slowdown after 2005. The post-1995 and post-2005 EU-10 slowdowns
were of roughly the same magnitude. Again, in contrast to the U.S., there was no additional
change up or down in the EU-10 ICT-use-intensive industries as shown in lines (3) and (4). Nor
was there any significant growth change in the electric machinery industry in lines (5) and (6),
which as we observed in Table 3 above actually experienced slower growth in 1995-2005 than
before 1995. The only notable industry effect for the EU-10 was a highly significant post-1995
change in the information/communications industry that was only partly offset by an
insignificant post-2005 decrease.

       Our overall conclusion from Table 4 is that the U.S. behaved very differently from the
EU-10. The U.S. experienced little post-1995 or post-2005 change in the rate of productivity
growth for the non-ICT-intensive industries but a significant and temporary acceleration

                                                 20
especially in the ICT production industries but also in the ICT-use-intensive industries.
However, this zig-zag pattern is concentrated in the ICT-use services industries, as well as in
the electric machinery industry, but is not evident in the other commodities ICT-use industries.
The relative symmetry of these accelerations and decelerations support the broader
interpretation that ICT investment in the U.S. can be viewed as a "temporary shock" that
elevated aggregate productivity growth for a decade before dissipating as the fruits of the ICT
revolution were reaped. Stated another way, the ICT revolution created a one-time increase in
the level of U.S. labor productivity that took about a decade to work itself through the economy.

        The conclusions for the EU-10 are quite different. There were two successive
productivity growth slowdowns, one after 1995 and the second after 2005, and these were
concentrated across the 15 industries producing commodities with no additional impact coming
from the subset of those services industries that were ICT intensive. Further there were no
significant slowdowns in the EU-10 service sector industries whether ICT-intensive or not, with
the notable exception of the information/communications industry that experienced a marked
increase in productivity growth after 1995 that only partly disappeared after 2005.

Total Factor Productivity Growth

        In Table 2 we examined a standard decomposition of sources of growth that divides up
contributions to labor productivity growth among labor composition, ICT and non-ICT capital
deepening, and a residual TFP growth component. Here we are interested in the channels by
which ICT intensity alters productivity growth. We have seen in Table 4 that, for the U.S., ICT-
intensive industries experienced a temporary acceleration of labor productivity growth during
1995-2005 that was not shared by non-ICT-intensive industries. Is this ICT contribution to
growth channeled exclusively through capital deepening? Or, as suggested by Oliner and Sichel
(2000), does ICT innovation "spill over" and raise the growth rate of TFP beyond the direct
effect of ICT through capital deepening? Oliner and Sichel were particularly interested in the
spillover from innovation in the intermediate goods industry making integrated circuit chips to
the final goods industry making computer hardware. Here we are interested more generally in
spillovers from all types of ICT investment into TFP growth in the industries that are ICT
intensive.

        Table 5 is arranged just like Table 4, with results for the U.S. on the left and for the EU-10
on the right. We repeat the results for labor productivity growth in the total economy from
Table 4 for ease of comparison with our new results explaining TFP growth. Thus, in Table 5,
columns (A) and (B) repeat the U.S. results shown in Table 4 for the total economy, columns (A)
and (D). Likewise columns (E) and (F) repeat the EU-10 results shown in Table 5, columns (E)
and (H); these differ only in the choice of the ICT indicator.




                                                 21
         The new results for TFP growth are shown in columns (C) and (D) for the U.S. and in
columns (G) and (H) for the EU-10. The pattern of significance values and the size of coefficients
for each TFP equation are so similar to the corresponding labor productivity equation that the
differences are negligible and can be described briefly. For the U.S. the first six rows of the TFP
coefficients in columns (C) and (D) have the same pattern of significance indicators and slightly
smaller numerical values as the labor productivity results in columns (A) and (B), except that
the post-1995 ICT-intensive acceleration in line (3) column (D) is slightly larger for the TFP
equation than the corresponding productivity growth equation in column (B). TFP coefficients
are consistently larger in lines (7) and (8) for the I&C industry effect although those coefficients
are all insignificantly different from zero and from each other.

        The same pattern emerges when the EU-10 TFP growth equations in columns (G) and
(H) are compared with the corresponding EU-10 productivity growth equations in columns (E)
and (F). Coefficient values and significance levels are almost identical for the post-1995 and

                                                22
post-2005 non-ICT effects shown on lines (1) and (2). Coefficients for the extra ICT-use-intensive
and EM effects are all insignificant in the TFP equations just as they are in the labor productivity
equations. However, the "I&C" effect for the information and communications industry shows
a post-1995 acceleration that is even larger and more significant in the TFP equations in columns
(G) and (H) than in the corresponding labor productivity growth equations in columns (E) and
(F).

        If the effect of ICT investment was simply to boost labor productivity growth through
capital deepening, with no further impact on TFP growth, we would expect no correlation
between ICT intensity and TFP growth. If, however, the effect of ICT investment was to cause a
reorganization of business practices that went beyond the mere installation of new equipment,
we might expect to see that the industry-by-industry differences in labor productivity growth
were mirrored in similar differences in TFP growth. Indeed, this appears to be the conclusion
implied by the results of Table 5. In the U.S. those industries that were ICT-intensive
experienced a similar acceleration in both labor productivity growth and TFP growth in 1995-
2005 that was reversed after 2005. And in the EU-10 all industries (whether ICT-intensive or
not) experienced a similar deceleration in both labor productivity growth and TFP growth after
1995 and again after 2005.

Cross Effects

       Are the differences in productivity and TFP growth between the U.S. and EU-10
industries due to differing values of ICT indicators or to a differing responsiveness to those
indicators? That question can be answered by looking at "cross effects," the results of
recalculating predicted values from the regression equations with values of the ICT indicators
and regression coefficients from opposite sides of the Atlantic.

        The top section of Table 6 reports the results for the U.S. and the bottom section shows
those for the EU-10. Calculations for labor productivity growth are shown on the left and for
TFP growth are shown on the right. Since we are interested in the effect of the actual values of
the ICT indicators, not just whether they are set equal to 0 or 1 as in the regressions of Tables 4
and 5, we base the results of Table 6 on alternative versions of the productivity and TFP
equations in which the 0 or 1 values of the ICT indicator dummy variable are replaced by the
numerical values of the ICT indicator.

        We could base these calculations on the ICT share indicator or the ICT contribution
indicator. However, as shown above in Figure 1, the EU-10 values of the ICT share indicator are
quite similar to the U.S. values, with a regression coefficient of 0.91 of EU-10 indicator values for
each industry on U.S. indicator values. Thus it is not surprising that it makes little difference
when we recalculate predicted values of productivity growth by substituting the share indicator
values from across the Atlantic. All the difference in predicted values comes from differing
coefficients in the productivity equations and none from differing share indicator values.



                                                 23
The results using the ICT contribution indicators are more interesting, since as shown in Figure
2 above the EU-10 contribution indicator values are quite different than the U.S. values, having
a coefficient of 0.49 when regressed on U.S. indicator values. The estimated coefficients of the
alternative "continuous value" versions of the ICT contribution equations are shown in
Appendix Table A3.




         The top row and left column of Table 6 shows for the total U.S. economy that the actual
productivity growth rate for 1995-2005 was 2.17 per cent. Underneath this actual value, line (A1)
shows that the predicted value of labor productivity growth when using the continuous version
of the ICT contribution equation is a nearly identical 2.20 per cent. If EU-10 data for the ICT
contribution indicator are substituted for the U.S. values, the predicted value declines by 0.24
percentage points to 1.96, as shown in line A2. Then line A3 shows that if we switch back to U.S.
data for the contribution indicator and use the EU-10 regression coefficients, the predicted value
falls to 1.78, 0.42 percentage points below the predicted value of 2.20 when the same U.S.
indicator values are combined with U.S. regression coefficients. Finally with EU-10 values for
both the indicator data and the regression coefficients, the predicted value falls to 1.69 per cent,
or 0.27 points below the 1.96 predicted value when EU data are combined with U.S. coefficients.
Thus, U.S. productivity growth was faster than in the EU-10 for 1995-2005 both because the U.S.
values of the ICT contribution indicator were higher and also because U.S. ICT-intensive



                                                24
industries had a substantially greater positive post-1995 productivity growth response relative
to U.S. non-ICT-intensive industries than occurred in the EU-10.

        The bottom half of Table 6 in the first column shows that this same interpretation works
in reverse for the EU-10. With its own indicator data and regression coefficients, the predicted
EU-10 productivity growth in 1995-2005 is 1.69 per cent. Substituting U.S. indicator data raises
predicted productivity growth from 1.69 to 1.78 per cent using EU regression coefficients and
from 1.96 to 2.21 per cent using U.S. regression coefficients. Substituting U.S. regression
coefficients raises the predicted value from 1.69 to 1.96 per cent using EU indicator data and
from 1.78 to 2.21 per cent using U.S. indicator data. Thus 1995-2005 EU-10 productivity growth
was slower than in the U.S. both because EU-10 ICT contribution data were smaller and also
because EU-10 ICT-intensive industries had virtually no excess 1995-2005 productivity growth
response relative to EU non-ICT intensive industries as compared to a substantial excess
response in the U.S.

         Turning to the second column in Table 6, the top section for the U.S. shows the predicted
values of labor productivity growth for 2005-15, when the actual growth rate of 0.87 was much
slower than the 2.17 per cent actual rate recorded for 1995-2005. A comparison of lines A1 and
A2 indicates that the negative U.S. post-2005 ICT coefficients generate a predicted value of 0.60
per cent with the U.S. indicator data and a similar 0.64 per cent with the EU indicator data. A
switch from the negative U.S. post-2005 coefficients on line A1 to the positive EU post-2005
coefficients on line A3 causes a jump in the predicted value from 0.60 to 1.14 per cent. With EU
indicator data, the same switch from U.S. to EU coefficients causes a smaller jump in the
predicted value from 0.64 to 0.98 per cent when the EU indicator values are used, because the
size of those EU indicators is smaller (recall Figure 2).

        For the EU-10 in the bottom half of column (2) substituting the U.S. indicator values
makes a relatively small difference. A much larger difference occurs when the negative U.S.
coefficients are substituted for the positive EU coefficients. This switch of coefficients with EU
indicator values changes predicted productivity growth from 1.02 per cent on line B1 to 0.68 per
cent on line B3. The same switch in coefficients with U.S. indicator values changes predicted
productivity growth from 1.19 per cent on line B2 to 0.65 per cent on line B4 -- the drop in
predicted growth in this case is greater because U.S. indicator values are larger and are applied
to negative coefficients.

        The right half of Table 6 repeats the same exercise for the same equations when TFP
growth is used as the dependent variable instead of labor productivity growth. Again we reach
the conclusion that both indicator values and estimated coefficients matter in the interpretation
of differences in behavior between the U.S. and the EU. after 1995 and again after 2005. In the
1995-2005 interval the U.S. enjoyed a TFP growth acceleration not only because U.S. ICT-
intensive industries had higher values of the ICT contribution indicator, but also because TFP
growth responded by a greater positive amount than in the EU-10 to that ICT indicator. The EU-
10 not only had lower values of the ICT contribution indicator in several industries, as shown in

                                               25
Figure 2, but also had a much smaller (and insignificant) positive productivity response to the
ICT contribution indicator.

        After 2005, TFP growth slowed down on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S. this
slowdown was concentrated in ICT-intensive industries as suggested by the negative ICT post-
2005 coefficients. Predicted TFP growth is higher when the small but positive EU ICT
coefficients are substituted for the large negative U.S. ICT coefficients. In contrast the EU-10
experienced a balanced TFP growth slowdown after 2005, with only small (and insignificant)
positive coefficients in the ICT-intensive industries. So when the relatively large and negative
U.S. coefficients are substituted for the relatively small and positive EU post-2005 ICT
coefficients, predicted growth is substantially lower.

Which Industries Drive the Results?

        A central result that emerges from our regression analysis is that the 1995-2005
acceleration in U.S. labor productivity and TFP growth together with the subsequent post-2005
U.S. growth slowdown were both driven not just by ICT production in the electric machinery
industry but by ICT-use industries in the services sector. It appears that this post-1995 ICT
stimulus does not occur in ICT-intensive commodities-producing industries once the special
role of the electric machinery industry is taken into account. Which are the specific ICT-
intensive industries in the services sector that account for post-1995 U.S. productivity growth
behavior?

        Table 7 is designed to answer this question. The top section shows the top six industries
in the market sector when ranked by the value of the contribution indicator of ICT
intensiveness. Displayed for each industry are the U.S. and EU values of the contribution
indicator, the 1995-2005 growth rate of labor productivity in the U.S. and EU as well as the
difference between them, and the share of each industry in market-sector value added. The top
four industries (highlighted on the right side of Figure 2) are all in the services sector and the
next two are in manufacturing. Not surprisingly the list includes information/communications,
which produces data and software, as well as electric machinery, which produces ICT
hardware. Also included are the finance/insurance and professional/administrative industries
that are heavy users of ICT equipment and software, and the wholesale/retail sector. As shown
in the far right column, these six industries account for 53 percent of U.S. market-sector value
added.




                                                26
        Notably, all of the six industries have faster 1995-2005 labor productivity growth in the
U.S. than in the EU. While the margin is slimmer in information/communications and other
manufacturing, the difference is large in the four remaining industries and massive in electric
machinery. Part of this difference in labor productivity growth between the U.S. and EU is
explained by the first two columns that show a substantially higher value of the ICT indicator in
the U.S. than in the EU. But, as shown by the cross-effects analysis of Table 6, higher U.S.
productivity growth is explained not just by higher values of the ICT indicator but also by a
greater response of productivity growth to a given value of that indicator.

        But these six ICT-intensive industries were not the only reason that U.S. productivity
growth was temporarily high during 1995-2005. Shown in the bottom section of Table 7 are
seven additional industries ranked by their 1995-2005 U.S. labor productivity growth. All of the
seven are commodities-producing, and six are subindustries within manufacturing. What
distinguishes these U.S. industries is that they all achieved rapid productivity growth faster
than 3.0 per cent in 1995-2005 with relatively small values (all below 0.15) of the ICT
contribution indicator. In all of these industries but chemicals manufacturing, the U.S. rate of
productivity growth was faster than in the EU, very substantially so in the case of petroleum
and agriculture.




                                               27
       This list of seven commodities-producing industries that experienced rapid U.S.
productivity growth during 1995-2005 provides a cautionary note to generalizations that credit
ICT in general, or ICT only in the services sector, for all of the post-1995 U.S. productivity
growth acceleration. These seven industries all had relatively low values of the contribution-
based ICT indicator and so achieved their growth for reasons other than a large infusion of ICT
investment. 9 Notably, with the exception of petroleum, 1995-2005 productivity growth in the
EU-10 in this group of industries was relatively healthy with a relatively modest shortfall
compared to U.S. productivity growth.

7. Summary and Conclusions

        A retardation in the growth of labor productivity and of total factor productivity (TFP)
has characterized both the United States and western Europe, in the sense that on both sides of
the Atlantic growth has been slower since 2005 than it was before 1995. The notable difference
in performance occurred in the middle interval of 1995-2005, when a sharp acceleration of
growth in the U.S. contrasted to a growth slowdown in western Europe. As a result, the story
of U.S. productivity growth since the mid-1970s has been one of slow-fast-slow over the three
intervals divided at 1995 and 2005, in contrast to a two-step deceleration in Europe.

        A substantial literature about the 1995-2005 U.S. productivity growth revival credits
most or all of it to a surge of innovation and investment in information and communication
technology (ICT). Does this finding of a dominant role for ICT hold up to a new examination of
the data? If so, how is the post-2005 U.S. growth slowdown explained? If valid, a dominant
role for ICT during 1995-2005 raises questions about the European slowdown that occurred at
the same time. Did Europe invest less in ICT or was its problem a weaker exploitation of the
benefits of new ICT hardware and software? In which industries did Europe lag most
substantially behind the U.S. growth performance, and were these industries relatively heavy
users or producers of ICT investment?

        This paper explores these questions at the level of the total economy and of 27 separate
industries in the EUKLEMS dataset. This allows us to study sources of productivity growth
and to develop alternative indicators of "ICT-intensity" for individual industries on both sides
of the Atlantic. To avoid being swamped by industry-level data for numerous European
countries, we have combined time series for 10 western European countries into an aggregate
that we call the "EU-10" that can be compared directly to parallel data for the U.S.

        Our initial assessment is based on a decomposition of sources of growth in which labor
productivity growth is divided up among the contributions of ICT and non-ICT capital
deepening, changes in labor quality, and changes in TFP. Surprisingly, in view of the emphasis
in past literature on the role of ICT, we find that the direct contribution of ICT capital deepening


9
 These industries also had relatively low values of the alternative share ICT indicator, as shown in Appendix Table
A1.

                                                        28
accounts for one-third or less of the post-1995 U.S. productivity growth revival or post-2005
growth slowdown. For the EU-10, ICT capital deepening plays virtually no role in explaining
the two-step productivity growth slowdown. About one-third of the faster labor productivity
growth during 1995-2005 in the U.S. vs. the EU-10 is explained by the higher contribution of ICT
capital deepening in the U.S. Thus, the initial growth accounting exercise appears to cast doubt
on a dominant role of ICT in the post-1995 U.S. growth revival.

        To measure ICT intensity we develop two indicators, one based on the ICT share of total
investment and the other based on the KLEMS measure of the ICT contribution to value-added
growth. When industries are divided up into "ICT producing," "ICT-use-intensive" and "non-
ICT-intensive", we emerge with a different conclusion regarding the importance of ICT for U.S.
behavior. Most of the post-1995 U.S. productivity growth revival and post-2005 slowdown
occur in industries classified as either ICT-producing or ICT-use-intensive. This is particularly
true in the services sector where the industries with the highest values of our ICT use indicators
are located. For the EU-10, the story is simpler, as the two-step slowdown occurs in all three
categories of industries, with the exception only of the ICT software-producing
information/communications ("I&C") industry. Thus unlike the U.S. the ICT-use-intensive
industries in the EU-10 do not register productivity growth that differs from the non-ICT
industries either during 1995-2005 or after 2005.

        We run regressions for 27 industries on annual data for 1977-2015 to measure the
response across all three periods of labor productivity growth to ICT intensity. Separate
responses are included for the ICT-producing electric machinery ("EM") and I&C industries.
The results support the role of ICT-intensive industries in the services sector as the main locus
of the post-1995 U.S. growth revival and post-2005 growth slowdown, with a major extra
contribution coming from the ICT-producing EM industry. The EU-10 regressions differ,
indicating no additional role in causing the two-step productivity deceleration of the ICT-use-
intensive industries beyond the contribution of the non-ICT-intensive industries.

        Why does the initial growth accounting exercise suggest a minimal U.S. role for ICT, but
the ICT decomposition and ICT regressions support a major U.S. role? The answer is provided
when the dependent variable in the regressions is switched from growth in labor productivity
to growth in TFP. The coefficients are almost identical, indicating that the ICT stimulus to
productivity growth operates through spillovers to TFP growth, not just via the ICT capital
deepening effect as measured in the growth accounting exercise. There is no separate ICT
influence on TFP growth in the EU-10 with the exception of the I&C industry. While the post-
2005 slowdown in U.S. productivity growth is largely symmetric with the post-1995 growth
acceleration, there is a noticeable difference. Non-ICT-intensive industries in the commodities
sector contribute more to the post-2005 slowdown than to the post-1995 revival. Not only is this
true of all non-ICT U.S. commodities industries, but in addition the post-2005 slowdown in the
ICT-producing EM industry is particularly sharp, reinforcing the temporary character of the late
1990s ICT revolution.



                                                29
       A few differences stand out in the results for the EU-10. In most respects the two-step
slowdown after 1995 and again after 2005 were unrelenting, applying to all industries. There is
a modest tendency for ICT-intensive commodities industries in the EU-10 to have most of their
slowdown after 2005 rather than during 1995-2005, indicating that ICT investment may have
"buoyed" productivity growth enough largely to offset the other causes of the 1995-2005 EU
slowdown. After 2005, productivity growth dropped across all EU-10 industries. The role of
ICT-producing industries is quite different in the EU-10, with a much weaker performance in
hardware-producing EM but a strong performance almost up to the U.S. achievement in
software-producing I&C.

        Overall the results support a strong role for ICT-intensive industries, particularly in the
market services sector, in driving not just the U.S. 1995-2005 productivity growth acceleration
but also the post-2005 slowdown. We find that the standard growth accounting approach is
deficient when it separates sources of growth between growth in ICT capital deepening and
TFP growth, because much of the effect of the U.S. ICT revolution appears to have been
channeled through spillovers to TFP growth rather than being limited to the capital deepening
pathway. Three aspects of the U.S. 1995-2005 ICT revolution stand out besides its spilling over
to TFP growth. First, the growth-inducing aspects of the revolution were temporary, as growth
rates in almost every industry went into reverse after 2005. Second, the sharpest decline in
productivity growth occurred at the heart of the ICT revolution in the EM industry that
produces ICT hardware, with less of a relative slowdown in the software-producing I&C
industry. Third, there were sharp post-2005 declines in several commodities-producing
industries that were minimal users of ICT, including especially agriculture, petroleum, and
across the board in manufacturing sub-industries.

        Why did the EU-10 fail to benefit from the ICT revolution and instead why did it
experience a two-step slowdown in labor productivity and TFP growth? The diagnosis has four
components. First, despite all the U.S.-led innovation that drove its ICT-hardware EM industry
to register a 17 per cent annual rate of productivity growth in 1995-2005, that same industry in
the EU-10 actually experienced a productivity growth slowdown during the same decade.
Second, the EU-10 had substantially lower values of the contribution-based ICT-use-intensity
indicator variable, indicating less rapid growth of ICT investment. Third, the regressions reveal
virtually no difference in the extent of the EU growth slowdown experienced by ICT-intensive
versus non-intensive industries, indicating a failure of EU-10 industries to exploit the efficiency
opportunities provided by the limited ICT investment that did occur. And fourth, the EU-10
shortfall in productivity growth during 1995-2005 can be traced to particular industries in which
performance fell far short of the same industries in the U.S. These outlier industries include not
just ICT-producing electric machinery but also agriculture, petroleum refining, and the large
wholesale and retail sector where for many reasons EU nations lagged behind the U.S in
adopting the big-box retail format which exploited the opportunities provided by the ICT
revolution.




                                                30
        Stepping back and viewing the postwar growth experience more broadly, the EU-10
started out in 1950-72 with rapid productivity growth of 4.86 percent per year, which we have
previously interpreted as reflecting a process of catching up to the benefits of innovations that
had buoyed U.S. productivity growth during the interwar and wartime periods (Gordon-Sayed,
2019). Then the EU-10 transitioned to a slower productivity growth path of 2.31 percent in
1972-95, mimicking the 2.54 percent growth rate that the U.S. had previously achieved during
1950-72. Skipping over the very different experiences of 1995-2005, the EU-10 wound up in
2005-2015 with a productivity growth rate of a mere 0.63 percent, little different from the U.S.
rate for the same interval of 0.87 percent. The remarkable similarity of the U.S. slowdown to
2005-15 from 1950-72 with the EU-10 slowdown to the same late interval from 1972-95 is, we
think, more than a coincidence. The same process of the diminishing potency of ongoing
innovation was occurring on both sides of the Atlantic.

        In short the postwar transatlantic productivity experience can be boiled down to three
issues ­ the causes of the overall joint early-to-late slowdown, the sources of the temporary U.S.
1995-2005 acceleration, and the factors that held Europe back from enjoying a similar 1995-2005
revival. Our diagnosis of the first is the diminished impact of innovation over the postwar
period that operated on both sides of the Atlantic, of the second is the U.S. success during 1995-
2005 in achieving a one-time boost in the level of efficiency in the production and use of ICT,
and of the third is the multi-faceted failure of the EU-10 to mimic the U.S. achievement in
producing ICT hardware, in making a similar level of investment in ICT, and in capturing the
efficiency gains of the lower level of investment that actually occurred.
