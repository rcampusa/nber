                                              ABSTRACT

While financial knowledge has been linked to improved financial behavior, there is little consensus
on the value of financial education, in part because rigorous evaluation of various programs has yielded
mixed results. However, given the heterogeneity of financial education programs in the literature,
focusing on “generic” financial education can be inappropriate and even misleading. Lusardi (2009)
and others argue that pedagogy and delivery matter significantly. In this paper, we design and field
a low-cost, easily-replicable financial education program called “Five Steps,” covering five basic financial
planning concepts that relate to retirement. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact
of “Five Steps” on a probability sample of the American population. In different treatment arms, we
quantify the relative impact of delivering the program through video and narrative formats. Our results
show that short videos and narratives (each takes about three minutes) have sizable short-run effects
on objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informational content relatively
constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioral change: effects
on motivation and self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which ultimately influences
knowledge acquisition. Follow-up tests of respondents’ knowledge approximately eight months after
the interventions suggest that between one-quarter and one-third of the knowledge gains and about
one-fifth of the self-efficacy gains persist. Thus, this simple program has effects both in the short run
and medium run.

1. Introduction

In the United States, individuals are increasingly being asked to be in charge of their financial
security throughout their lifetime and after retirement. Despite this shift to individual
responsibility, many workers are not planning for their retirement (Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and
Beeler, 2007; and Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2009, 2011a,b). Multiple streams of research have
linked financial knowledge to better retirement planning and successful wealth accumulation
(Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007, 2009, 2011a; Hung et al., 2009; Stango and Zinman, 2009), and a
growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the causality runs from financial literacy to
behavior rather than the other way around (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). While financial
knowledge has been convincingly linked to improved financial behavior, basic understanding of
economics and finance remains low both among the general population and across age, income,
and education levels (Hung, Parker, and Yoong, 2009; Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2010;
Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014).

There is, however, little consensus on the value of financial education, in part because
comparative assessment of the gamut of existing programs has yielded mixed results. There is
considerable variation in methodology and program types across studies, and, as Lusardi (2008,
2009) and others have argued, pedagogy, intensity, and format may matter significantly in
explaining different findings. A key next step is therefore to move beyond a potentially
misleading discussion of whether “generic” financial education works, toward an understanding
of how to make financial education work through better design and appropriate delivery
methods. Bernheim and Garrett (2003) and Bayer, Bernheim, and Scholz (2009) show that
programs that only distribute printed material such as newsletters have little effect on
participation in retirement savings plans. Duflo and Saez (2003) find relatively small impact
from a one-time retirement benefits fair, while both Clark and D’Ambrosio (2008) and Bernheim
and Garrett (2003) find some effects on behavior when employers offer single or occasional
retirement seminars. However, when seminars are frequent, participation in retirement savings
plans does significantly increase (Bernheim and Garrett, 2003). Lusardi and Mitchell (2009) and
Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki (2001) find evidence that financial education courses that are a
mandated part of formal high school curricula lead to more savings and better retirement
planning outcomes in later life. While there is little doubt that financial education done properly
can work, the issue of cost-effectiveness remains: with these relatively traditional delivery
models, there is a clear tradeoff between efficacy and ease of implementation: Intensive
interactive programs are more costly in terms of money and time, may not scale easily, may not
be easily accessible by a wider audience and often by design appeal to only a small target
demographic.

In this paper, we contribute to resolving this important issue by designing and experimentally
evaluating a financial education program called Five Steps that draws on insights from
psychology to more effectively deliver information about five core concepts underlying financial
planning for retirement. A thriving literature in this field demonstrates the power of behavioral
economics to affect households’ financial decisions. Benartzi and Thaler (2004) and Ashraf,
Karlan, and Yin (2009) build on inertia and the desire for precommitment to design more
effective savings products, while Bertrand et al. (2010) use principles of persuasive advertising
to motivate a series of advertising content treatments promoting the take-up of consumer credit.
                                                                                               3


We apply the same approach to financial education: Five Steps was explicitly developed using
psychological principles to increase appeal and motivate behavioral change, while keeping to a
format suitable for easy, low-cost replication and mass dissemination.

We use a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact of Five Steps on a probability sample of
the American population. In different treatment arms, we quantify the relative impact of
delivering the program through video and narrative formats. The results of the paper demonstrate
the effectiveness of using simple precepts from psychology and marketing to enhance financial
education and the need to take seriously features of program design and delivery beyond simply
informative factual content.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the economic and psychological
theory behind the development of the Five Steps program and the intervention itself, and a
conceptual framework for evaluating the effects of the program. Section III details the
experimental approach used to evaluate the program. Section IV presents the results of
intervention. Section V considers how much of the effects remain in a follow-up test some eight
months after the intervention. Section VI discusses implications for future work and concludes.

II. Conceptual Framework and Program Development

The effectiveness of a financial education program is normally judged on two levels: whether a
program successfully conveys information to its target audience and whether it ultimately leads
to behavioral change. In this paper, we focus on the former, but we also consider changes in
hypothetical behavior.

Although the financial education literature often recognizes that financial education is a choice
made by individuals, the decision processes behind knowledge acquisition are not often studied
in great depth. Exposing an individual to a financial education program is by no means a
guarantee of take-up—either in terms of actual program participation or (in the case of programs
that are mandatory) actual learning conditional on participation. Meier and Sprenger (2013)
argue that knowledge is a form of investment, the value of which lies in a positive excess return
from financial investing, and that consumers make the decision to participate in financial
education based on their perception of this return. Similarly, Delavande, Rohwedder, and Willis
(2008) and Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell (2013) model the returns to financial knowledge as a
higher expected return on financial assets, with the cost of acquiring knowledge being a function
of explicit payment and other factors, including inherent cognitive ability and effort.

Consider the following very simple conceptual framework: suppose that an individual has to
exert effort e to gain financial knowledge k, such that the amount of knowledge gained k(e) and
cost of effort c(e) are both increasing in e. The expected return to knowledge is E[U (k)] where
U is also increasing in k. The net expected gain from expending effort is thus E[U(k(e))] – c(e).
Under standard assumptions about U, an individual will expend effort on financial education
until the expected marginal return from the investment in knowledge is equal to the marginal
cost of effort of acquiring that knowledge; i.e., E[U’(k) k’(e*)] = c’(e*).
                                                                                                 4


This simple formulation illustrates three possible ways to make a program more effective for
users, in the sense of ultimately increasing the optimal choice of knowledge k(e*).

      First, a program should be informative, by providing a high marginal return in terms of
       knowledge gains to a given amount of effort; k’(e) should be large.

      Secondly, it should be accessible to the users, i.e., have a low marginal cost to a given
       amount of effort; c’(e) should be small. We note that this is not only in terms of explicit
       payment, but also in terms of disutility—programs that are more inherently enjoyable to
       experience may ultimately lead to more knowledge gain.

      Finally, it should be motivational, i.e., by increasing the returns from acquiring a given
       amount of knowledge; U’(k) should be large. Choosing to deliver knowledge that is
       highly relevant to individuals (and hence has the potential to provide high returns) should
       itself be implicitly motivating. However, in practice, the degree of ex-ante awareness
       among potential participants may not be sufficient. Behavioral economics suggests that
       motivation can be manipulated in multiple ways. For instance the program can
       incentivize participants by making utility gains more salient or more easily achievable:
       educating participants about the true benefits of financial knowledge or even providing
       direct financial incentives. In their study of advertising campaigns, Bertrand et al. (2010)
       argue that such effects can also take place through manipulating reference points or cues
       that increase the marginal utility of consumption, or by biasing other key decision
       parameters through manipulation of intuitive and/or deliberative cognitive processes, for
       instance verbally framing a program or including specific visual images that evoke a
       particular emotional response.

We have designed specific features of a financial education intervention with these three
dimensions in mind, as described below.

II.A. Selecting Informative Content

To ensure that the program is highly informative and likely to result in large benefits to a broad
share of the population, we focused the content on five core concepts that underlie successful
retirement planning that have previously been identified in the literature as important, persistent
basic knowledge gaps (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). The literature also suggests that behavioral
factors contribute to these gaps. Taking behavioral factors into account, our program aims to
improve understanding of the following five core concepts.

      Compound interest:

       Understanding the difference between simple and compound interest, and how quickly
       interest accumulates can help individuals both appreciate the importance of starting to
       save early and the dangers of borrowing at very high interest rates. However, people
       seem to know little about interest compounding (Lusardi, 2012; Lusardi and Mitchell,
       2014; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009a, 2009b). Moreover, in what has been termed future
       value bias (Stango and Zinman, 2009), people tend to underestimate how quickly
                                                                                              5


    compound interest grows. This is a case of the more general exponential growth bias, in
    which people underestimate the growth of functions with exponential terms. This bias is
    strongly correlated with savings, portfolio choices, net worth, and other measures of
    personal finances.

   Inflation:

    Individuals need to understand the potential reduction in purchasing power over time due
    to inflation in order to assess saving and borrowing decisions in real rather than nominal
    terms. This is particularly important given the long horizons typical in planning for
    retirement. There seems to be little knowledge of the workings of inflation (Lusardi and
    Mitchell, 2014). Behavioral research also documents money illusion: people tend to think
    in terms of nominal rather than real monetary values, insufficiently taking into account
    the impact of inflation (Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky, 1997).

   Risk diversification:

    Individuals should not put all of their eggs in one basket, but rather choose well-
    diversified portfolios and avoid investing in only one asset, particularly if that asset is
    their employer’s company stock. There is very little knowledge about risk diversification
    (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Understanding of risk diversification seems also influenced
    by affect and heuristics. For example, people often rate company stock, the stock of their
    employer, as a safer investment than a diversified fund (Benartzi and Thaler, 2007). Even
    when spreading assets among several investments, 401(k) investors often choose naïve
    diversification, with equity exposure tracking the relative number of equity funds in the
    menu of available funds (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001).

   Tax treatment of retirement savings vehicles:

    Retirement assets invested in tax advantaged vehicles such as 401(k)s and IRAs benefit
    from tax exemptions on contributions, capital gains, or withdrawals, allowing for more
    rapid potential growth. In fact, people possess limited attention and often do not
    deliberatively consider and appropriately weight all features of complex decisions. The
    impact of taxes on decision making therefore does not depend solely on their economic
    consequences, but also on the salience of these taxes (Congdon, Kling, and Mullainathan
    2009).

   Employer matches of defined contribution savings plans:

    Many employers match (in different proportion, often one-to-one) the contributions
    employees make to retirement accounts, resulting in a much higher return on retirement
    savings. Failure to contribute up to the employer’s matching threshold is often the
    equivalent of leaving money on the table. However, a large portion of individuals do not
    take advantage of their employer’s full 401(k) matching contributions; evidence suggests
    this cannot be fully attributed to rational strategies. Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2005)
    investigated a special case in which it was difficult to provide a normative explanation for
                                                                                                  6


       failure to contribute up to the employer’s matching threshold. They examined a group of
       individuals who could withdraw assets from their 401(k)s at any time without tax
       penalties and found that, even among this group, half contributed below the match
       threshold. Notifying employees about the existence of this matching opportunity in the
       context of three brief written survey questions did not significantly impact the
       contribution rate.

II.B. Lowering Behavioral Barriers

To ensure that the program materials were delivered with low technical and time burden on the
user, we designed them to be accessible, engaging, and relatively brief. We also drew on several
well-established principles of psychology and marketing to increase motivation.

Guided by Bandura’s social cognitive theory (1989), we considered the role of self-efficacy in
uptake of our educational program. Self-efficacy refers to the subjective belief that one (rightly
or wrongly) has the ability to complete a particular task in a way that will lead to a successful
outcome. “Learning self-efficacy,” one’s belief that one has the capacity to successfully learn
from an educational program, increases motivation to utilize such a program. Since individuals
are often intimidated by financial information, we took care to make our program accessible in
order to increase self-efficacy and, in turn, motivation to utilize the program.

The five financial concepts were embedded in five simple short stories that describe the concepts
verbally and present the benefits of taking action. Each story explains elements of one of the
financial principles, consists of dialogue between two people, and is written to convey
information in a relatively light-hearted, positive manner. Each story focuses on a few simple
take-away points related to the concept and we minimize the use of complex jargon.

We adopted a narrative strategy. In commercial advertising, adult education, and public health,
narratives are an established means of creating cognitive involvement and emotional immersion
(Bruner, 1987; Green and Brock, 2000; Norris et al., 2005; McDaniel, Waddill, and Shakesby,
1996; Davidhizar and Lonser, 2003) and have been shown to outperform argument-based
advertisements in improved comprehension for poor readers (Michielutte et al., 1992).

Bandura’s account of self-efficacy also informed our use of a narrative strategy. While a main
focus of the program was on improving financial knowledge, we also aimed to provide that
knowledge in a way that could impact financial behavior. According to social cognitive theory,
bolstering self-efficacy beliefs (i.e., one’s belief that they can successfully perform a behavior)
fosters behavior change. One way self-efficacy beliefs can be strengthened is through observing
others successfully perform (or “model”) desired tasks and achieve desired outcomes (Bandura,
1989). We created narratives in which characters did just that: they accomplished desired tasks
and achieved desired goals, even in the face of challenges. We included triumph over obstacles
in the narratives because observing this type of persistence fosters a more resilient sense of self-
efficacy. It has been noted that observers are more strongly influenced by others when the
observed and observer are similar. Therefore, our stories incorporate a focus on relatable
situations and characters. As the content focus of Five Steps is on basic retirement planning
rather than catch-up strategies appropriate for those nearing retirement, we designed these
                                                                                                  7


features to be most relevant to young adults (going out, shopping, newlyweds, workplace
experiences) and our videos employed actors between the ages of 20 and 40. By having the
models appear relaxed and in an everyday setting and explicitly emphasizing lack of stress in
taking action in the scripted dialogue, we tried to make the intervention accessible and
unintimidating while at the same time imparting and reinforcing new information. It’s worth
noting that the use of behavioral modeling itself has been found to decrease anxiety in stressful
situations more than purely informational materials alone (Gagliano, 1988).

Our program design also applied other behavioral insights. The literature on present-bias and
time-inconsistency documents that people often lack the self-control to take action that will
results in future benefits (for review, see Frederick et al., 2002). This can manifest itself as a
tendency to procrastinate when it comes to retirement savings or taking up financial education
itself, which has largely long-term benefits (Benartzi and Thaler, 2007; Meier and Sprenger,
2009). To counter this, we designed the intervention to emphasize short-term benefits, whether
tangible or not (e.g., increased peace of mind), in order to make near-term benefits more salient.

Finally, wherever possible, as related to the individual stories, we employed insights from
various aspects of the existing literature. For instance, as research indicates that people perceive
free items as especially attractive (Shampanier, Mazar, and Ariely, 2007), when describing
401(k) contributions, employer matches was deliberately framed as “free money.”


II.C. Delivery Models: Videos versus Narratives

As part of this study, we developed and produced our narrative-based materials using two
alternative delivery methods: written narratives and videos.

While written materials are usually considered easy to disseminate, the online video increases the
potential for efficient and scalable interventions. Online videos are rising in popularity; a 2010
report by the Pew Research Center (Purcell, 2010) found that 69% of internet users watched or
downloaded videos online. The fixed cost of creating videos may be close to the cost of creating
written/printed materials. However, with the rise of free Internet video hosting services, the
marginal cost of dissemination is rapidly becoming negligible. While many interventions
currently rely on written pamphlets and materials, studies of health education have found higher
user satisfaction with educational videos as compared to written materials (Jeste et al., 2008;
Armstrong et al., 2011). Most importantly, while written narratives provide some degree of
behavioral modeling, the direct visual experience provided by videos may have greater potential
to provide the type of observational learning experience needed to have an impact on self-
efficacy (Gist, 1989). Additionally, education research indicates that videos have the potential
to create fertile opportunity for cognitive engagement (Kozma, 1991). As the popularity of
online videos is an important potential new development in adult education, we sought to explore
the relative impact of providing Five Steps through video versus written formats.

Videos and narratives were carefully matched on both informational content and stories, with the
way concepts were explained closely mirrored in the two formats. Each of the five videos was
approximately three minutes long. The narratives are reproduced in Appendix B, while the video
                                                                                                               8

are listed in Appendix C.

III. Field Experiment Approach

The primary goal of the study was to develop and evaluate an innovative, engaging, and low-cost
financial education program. Our empirical methodology employs qualitative and quantitative
methods to design and test the effectiveness of the financial education program.

III.A. Qualitative Study Design

In order to qualitatively test the intervention materials and get feedback, as well as to gain insight
on savings attitudes and behavior, we first conducted two focus groups in Washington, DC, with
young workers between the ages of 25 and 40. We were particularly interested in young adults’
response to our intervention, as starting to apply knowledge of the financial concepts earlier in
life could produce the greatest benefit, even though younger adults might consider retirement
saving less relevant. The first focus group consisted of ten “savers,” people who were already
saving for retirement. The second group consisted of eight “non-savers,” who were not currently
saving for retirement. This stratification allowed participants with similar experiences to feel
more comfortable and engage in a useful discussion. Focus group participants were presented
with each of the five stories explaining the financial concepts. They were shown two stories in
video format only, two stories in written narrative format only, and one story in both video and
written narrative formats. After each story, comments and feedback on the interventions were
solicited and the groups concluded with a general discussion of the different presentation formats
as well as how the information might motivate any behavioral changes.

While the focus group provided us with a deeper understanding of the types of responses we may
receive from a small group of savers and non-savers, it did not give us a great deal of
understanding of program effectiveness. Thus, we turn to the main empirical strategy in our
paper, a field experiment in which we rigorously test the causal effects of the program.

III.B. Field Experiment Design

To quantitatively test the Five Steps program, we designed a field experiment using the RAND
American Life Panel (ALP), fielded from May through November 2010. At the time of the
intervention, the ALP consisted of a sample of approximately 3,000 households who are
regularly interviewed over the Internet. An advantage relative to most other Internet panels is
that the ALP is a probability sample of the US population.1 Data routinely collected via the ALP

1
  ALP respondents participating in our experiments have been recruited in one of three ways. Most were recruited
from among individuals age 18+ who were respondents to the Monthly Survey (MS) of the University of
Michigan’s Survey Research Center (SRC). A subset of respondents (approximately 500) were recruited through a
snowball sample; here respondents were given the opportunity to suggest friends or acquaintances who might also
want to participate. Respondents without Internet (both in the Michigan sample and the snowball respondents) were
provided with so-called WebTVs (http://www.webtv.com/pc/), which allow them to access the Internet using their
television and a telephone line. The technology allows respondents who did not have previous Internet access to
participate in the panel and furthermore use the WebTVs for browsing the Internet or using email. A new group of
respondents (approximately 500) has been recruited after participating in the National Survey Project, created at
                                                                                                                 9


include a wide array of variables about household and individual demographics. In our sample,
about 30% of participants are below the age of 40, 55% are 41–64 years old, and 15% are 65+.
The education attainment is rather high—more than 40% have a college degree—and 59% are
female. About 28% have income below $35,000, 40% have income between $35,000 and
$75,000, and 32% have income above $75,000.

In May 2010, all members of the ALP (regardless of age) were administered a baseline survey
with a series of questions on topics related to our five concepts: (1) compound interest; (2)
inflation; (3) risk diversification; (4) tax treatment of retirement savings vehicles; and (5)
employer matches of defined contribution savings plans. The questions are reproduced in
Appendix A. While the survey questions are multiple choice, the correct answers to the quizzes
are all binary (the answer is correct or incorrect).

Starting in August 2010, with the exception of a control group, respondents were exposed to six
successive treatments, each presenting material for one topic in either video or written narrative
form. Treatments were delivered over three successive waves of the survey, which were spaced
two weeks apart. In order to maintain a reasonable length of each survey session, two treatments
were given in each wave.

The randomization was implemented as follows:

       The order of the five topics was randomized with equal probability for all respondents.

       Within each treatment, format was randomized so that respondents would experience
        either (only) video or (only) written narrative format with equal probability, with one
        exception.

       In one wave of the survey (randomly selected with equal probability), a respondent would
        experience two treatments for the same topic, one in video and one in written narrative
        format (in random order).

       After each treatment, the respondent was again asked the relevant questions from the
        baseline survey.

       In the same period, respondents allocated to the control group would also again answer
        questions from the baseline survey.

The effective result of this design was that every respondent was exposed to each of the five
topics in random order, and for every topic but one was exposed to either video (only) or

Stanford University with SRBI. This sample was recruited in person, and at the end of their one-year participation,
participants were asked whether they were interested in joining the RAND American Life Panel. Most of these
respondents were given a laptop and broadband Internet access. For more information about the ALP sample
recruiting methodology as well as access to the data collected in the ALP to date, the reader is referred to
http://mmic.rand.org.
                                                                                                                  10


narrative (only) format. For one randomly chosen topic, the respondent saw both the video and
the written narrative. Importantly, respondents could not opt to receive a certain intervention.

The benefits of the randomization design lie in the power of causal inference. When estimating
average effects of the program by topic and format, we are able to pool the data, regardless of
wave and treatment sequence. To estimate the program effect, we can use a simple comparison
of means that captures a differences-in-differences (DID) approach, in which changes in correct
answers of the respondents exposed to videos or narratives (the treatment group) are compared to
changes in answers in the control group.

In April 2011, the same quiz was administered again to all experiment participants, both
treatment and control groups. Below, we discuss the short-run results. In Section V, we discuss
the results of the 2011 follow-up test.

IV. Results

IV.A Qualitative Focus Group Responses

Both the savers and non-savers described the program’s level of content difficulty as appropriate
for themselves. The non-saver group found more of the information new, while savers found that
the intervention reinforced and supplemented knowledge of concepts with which they were
already somewhat familiar. Overall, group participants described themselves as not intimidated
by the program and also did not feel as though it talked down to them. The saver and non-saver
groups expressed fairly similar thoughts on format differences. Some expressed keener interest
in the videos as they did not require the work of reading, while others noted that they preferred
having access to both formats. No one argued for written narratives alone.2 Unprompted, focus
group participants also described specific actions they planned to take as a result of viewing the
videos, but no such plans were voiced as a result of interacting with the written narratives.3

IV.B Field Experiment Results

Table 1 shows the percentage of correct answers to each of the questions at baseline (May 2010).
Average baseline knowledge of these concepts varied significantly, with correct responses to
some of the questions falling below 50%. However, 92% of respondents were able to answer the
first question on compound interest correctly.

Table 1 further breaks down responses by gender, education, age, and income. More men
answered questions correctly than women on every question at baseline, confirming the results of
many other surveys on financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Similarly, respondents

2
  Some in the saver group suggested that the videos were more motivating and inspired them to take action. In
response to the videos, one focus group members said, “That made me want to run out and invest some money.”
Another said that the videos were “ready for television! Gonna be like, ‘Man, I need to start investing!’ People will
definitely react to that.”
3
  One described starting a new job several months before and said, “I haven’t gotten around to filling out the 401(k)
forms…I will be filling out those forms tomorrow.” Another said, “Last year I got a new nephew and a godson so I
think that I’ll open an account for each of them to begin the compound interest.”
                                                                                                                   11


age 18–40 performed worse than those age 41–64 and worse than those age 65 and older on all
but two questions, again consistent with related research (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto, 2010;
Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). On every question, those with incomes below $35,000 performed
more poorly than those with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000, who in turn performed more
poorly than respondents earning $75,000 and above. The same pattern was found for education;
respondents with high school diplomas or less performed more poorly on each question than
respondents who attended some college, who in turn performed more poorly than those with
college diplomas, as has been found to be the case in other work (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014).

Table 2 shows the numbers of each treatment that were administered during each wave, by topic
and medium (narrative or video). Wave 1 went to field in August 2010 and the surveys were
closed on November 3, 2010.4 Each written narrative / video was seen alone by between 1,427
and 1,497 respondents, while each topic was administered in the double format consisting of
both the narrative and the video to between 1,017 and 1,082 respondents.


IV. A Quantitative Findings

Tables 3A and 3B present a summary of performance in each of the five topic areas for the entire
sample of respondents, aggregated across individual survey questions.5 Table 3A shows the
results for objective knowledge questions (in terms of average percentage correct answers) and
Table 3B shows the results for the self-efficacy questions (in terms of average self-efficacy score
on a scale of 1–5, with 1 being the highest). The table shows a summary of the difference in
difference treatment effect estimates (comparison of the mean changes in the treatment group
and the mean changes in the control).

The column head “Any Treatment” shows means for all respondents presented with an
intervention, including those who saw the video, read the narrative, or did both. The column
headed “Video only” refers to respondents who have only seen a video on a particular topic;
similarly the heading “Narrative only” signifies that a respondent has only read a narrative about
the topic. “Both” indicates that a respondent has been exposed to both a video and a narrative
about the topic.

Table 3A shows a number of significant positive treatment effects on objective knowledge
questions, across all topics. In general, for questions on which baseline knowledge was high
(interest compounding/numeracy and both inflation questions) the program had least effect,
while for a topic on which baseline knowledge was modest (tax treatment of DC plans) we
observe consistently large treatment effects. Insignificant results are found for inflation and one

  In principle, respondents can answer questions whenever it is convenient for them. Typically most respondents
reply within the first two weeks of a field period. After two weeks a reminder is sent by email to those who have not
responded yet. This procedure is repeated four weeks after a survey goes to field. Generally, there is no reason to
“close” a survey, so that, for instance, even after six weeks responses still trickle in. In our experiment, two weeks
after a respondent has answered the first wave, he or she becomes eligible for the second wave; two weeks after
answering the second wave he or she becomes eligible for the third wave. Thus depending on when respondents
respond a wave, they get asked to do a next wave. We kept waves in the field until November 3, 2010.

  More extensive results are presented in Appendix tables 1A and 1B.
                                                                                                  12


employer match question, but in the first case results are somewhat inconsistent across format
types and questions; in the second case, no effects are significant.

Overall, Table 3A also shows that video-only treatments result in somewhat more positive
effects than narrative-only treatments, but interestingly, one does not seem to strictly dominate
the other for all questions. Also interestingly and perhaps contrary to the focus group input,
being exposed to both treatments does not seem to strictly dominate showing only videos or only
written narratives.

Table 3B shows that the overall effects on self-efficacy appear to be positive and significant
across all topics, with the largest gains related to tax-treatment of DC plans and employer
matches. However, format effects in this case are particularly interesting. In the area of self-
efficacy, we clearly see that video appears to be more effective and consistently positive. For the
written narratives, the effects are significantly weaker. Showing both videos and narratives has a
significantly stronger effect on self-efficacy than only showing the narrative. The comparison
between showing video only or both video and narrative does not exhibit a clear pattern.

In general, the findings of our analysis indicate that Five Steps can effectively deliver knowledge
and increase self-efficacy. The general results also support the hypothesis that video format can
have larger effects on self-efficacy.

To save space we concentrate from now on the proportion of correct answers by domain.
Furthermore, since in the next section we will present results for the second test, in April 2011, it
is convenient to indicate outcome variables as follows: Y0 if outcomes refer to baseline measures;
Y1 for outcomes obtained immediately after the intervention; Y2 for outcomes obtained in the
April 2012 follow up.

Table 4 presents treatment effects after controlling for background characteristics. Not
surprisingly, a respondent’s score on the quiz after the intervention is strongly related to his or
her baseline knowledge. Nevertheless the table confirms the findings shown in Table 3. With the
possible exception of inflation, the interventions yielded a highly significant improvement in
knowledge of basic financial concepts.

Table 5 reports the findings of regressing the change in the percentage of correct answers on the
various treatments and background characteristics. Apart from again showing highly significant
effects of the interventions (with the exception of inflation), it also allows us to examine the
hypothesis that behavioral modeling works best when subjects are similar to the models
presented. It should be recalled that the content and modeling was targeted specifically at the 18–
40 age group, a fact that would be made more salient in the videos where only actors in this age
group were shown. There is indeed some weak evidence consistent with this hypothesis.
Compared to the 18–40 group, the 65+ group shows a negative coefficient for four out of five
dimensions, with one of these strongly significant (employer match). The remaining
characteristics do not appear to have had much of an impact on the effectiveness of the
intervention, with the exception of gender. Women show significantly more improvement in
knowledge than men for all dimensions, except inflation. We have also tested for interactions
between age and the different treatments. Findings are not reported here due to space constraints
but can be summarized as follows: Significant interactions are only found for the risk
                                                                                                 13


diversification dimension, where generally the effects are stronger for younger respondents and
weaker for the 65+ category.

Tables 6 and 7 repeat the analysis of Tables 4 and 5 for self-efficacy. Self-efficacy improves in
all dimensions and for all treatments, although the videos appear to be most effective, as
observed before. The oldest group shows the smallest gain in self-efficacy, while females appear
to gain more than men, and higher incomes more than lower incomes. As with the knowledge
question, we have also tested for interactions between age and the different treatments. The
results (not reported) show no significant interactions.

V. The Follow Up Eight Months Later

As of April 8, 2011, the participants in the experiment (both in the treatment and the control
groups) were asked to once again take the same quiz. This allows us to investigate to what extent
the positive effects found right after the intervention remain after some passage of time. Tables 8
and 9 are similar to Tables 5 and 7. Now, however, the dependent variable in each regression is
the difference in percentage correct between baseline and April 2011 (Y2-Y0). It is immediately
clear that far fewer treatment effects are significantly different from zero than when measured
right after the intervention. Table 8 suggests that the video treatment has the greatest lasting
effect: four out of five dimensions show significant effects, while for the narrative treatment only
two out of five treatments are statistically significant. Interestingly the video with narrative
treatment is never significant. The various background characteristics are generally insignificant.

Table 9 exhibits a pattern that is qualitatively similar to Table 8. The video treatment is more
often significant (three out of five) than the narrative treatment (two out of five). Age
interactions are all insignificant (not reported).

Thus, the positive effects immediately after the intervention have worn off over time. Table 10
provides a direct comparison between the short-run effects (Y1-Y0) and the longer-run effects (Y2-
Y0). As a simple way to gauge how much of the initial effect remain, we also present (Y2-Y0)/ (Y1-
Y0). For knowledge questions, the percentage of the initial effect that remains after about eight
months is on the order of one-third to one-quarter. For inflation the percentages are larger, but in
view of the fact that the initial effect was small for this dimension, we should probably discount
this. For the self-efficacy question, only about 10–20% remains.

These finding suggests the need for regular updating of subjects’ knowledge with new material,
to avoid quick depreciation of newly gained knowledge.


VI. Discussion and Future Work

In this paper, we designed and evaluated a financial education program that demonstrably
increased participants’ objective knowledge and self-efficacy. Importantly, our field experiment
approach allowed us to conclude that the improvements we saw in the treatment groups were
caused by the Five Steps program or by the particular format tested. Our results show that given
the very minimal time respondents spent watching the videos or reading the narratives (each of
                                                                                                 14


the videos or narratives takes about three minutes), Five Steps has sizable short-run effects on
objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informative content relatively
constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioral change:
effects on motivation and self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which
ultimately influence knowledge acquisition.

It is important to reiterate that the experiment at this stage measures only outcomes related to
objective knowledge and self-efficacy. The focus group discussions suggest that in general, the
written narratives may promote knowledge retention but videos may more strongly motivate
action and behavior change; this remains a possibility to be tested in future work. Ultimately, the
goal of this study is to examine effects on behavior, with outcomes to be collected in a follow-up
survey. Empirical findings suggest that self-efficacy and behavior are related, although the causal
relationships are not well-established: measures of self-efficacy have been found to be correlated
with health behavior (e.g., Kreuter et al., 1999; Strecher et al., 1986; Gillis, 1993; Holden, 1991)
as well as in other domains (Stajkovic and Luthans, 1998), including finance (Gutter, Copur, and
Garrison, 2009). There is some evidence that suggests financial education programs can increase
financial self-efficacy, and ultimately behavioral change (e.g., Sanders et al., 2007; Shockey and
Seiling, 2004).

In general, the program presented is an example of how field experiments can contribute to better
understanding of the effectiveness of financial literacy interventions. As noted in the
introduction, part of the reason for the mixed results in related work is the lack of rigorous
evaluation. Field experiments are an ideal policy tool for gaining causal inference in this, as well
as in other domains. Future work should focus on using field experiments to investigate which
components of educational interventions are most effective.

Appendix B: The Narratives

A Wedding Gift and Compound Interest

Dave and Michelle met in college, five years ago. Theirs isn’t a romantic story of love at first
sight; instead they slowly built the foundation for a strong relationship. Dave asked Michelle out
for a coffee, then another, and another. Their relationship continued to grow stronger, and they
recently got married.

When they got $5000 in cash as wedding presents, Michelle and Dave had to decide what to do
with the money. The answer didn’t seem obvious. Looking over their finances didn’t take long
because they didn’t have much money, especially since Michelle’s job at the time paid more like
an internship. The two of them don’t generally consider themselves big planners and, at first, it
seemed pointless to even think about investing for the long term. Dave suggested not investing
right away, but instead waiting until they had better jobs and made more money.

But Michelle told Dave about the 7 and 10 rule. The rule describes how long it takes for an
investment to double. At a 7% rate of return, it takes about 10 years for an investment to grow
twice as large. At a 10% rate of return, it takes only about 7 years to double your money.

                                       7 and 10 Rule
At a 7% rate of return, it takes about 10 years to double your money.
At a 10% rate of return, it takes about 7 years to double your money.

At first, Dave wondered whether they could get such a high return: 10% is a lot! Michelle
pointed out that a 7% return might be more realistic. After all, they would be investing for the
long term. Dave realized that over the long term a diversified portfolio of stocks can yield returns
in that range, though both he and Michelle understand that it always varies.

The simple 7 and 10 rule helped Michelle figure out that even at a 7% rate of return, the original
$5000 would grow to a whopping $160,000 by the time she and Dave turn 75. When Michelle
first pointed this out to Dave, he thought something had to be wrong with Michelle’s calculation.
But, as Michelle explained to him, the money grows that much because the returns compound
over time. In other words, all of the money, including the earned interest, gets reinvested every
year so that over the long term, there’s some serious build-up!

If Dave and Michelle earn a 7% rate of return, their investment would approximately double
every 10 years.
If they invest $5000 when they are 25 years old, then:
by age 35, it would double to around…………………$10,000
which would double again by age 45 to around … $20,000
which would double again by age 55 to around …$40,000
                                                                                                CI2

which would double again by age 65 to around …$80,000
which would double again by age 75 to around...$160,000.
                                                                                               36



If Michelle and Dave waited until they were 55 years old to invest the $5,000 and earned the
same 7% rate of return, they would end up with $20,000 by the time they were 75. And while
$20,000 would be nice, the $160,000 they’d have if they invested right away would be even
nicer.

Michelle also showed Dave the other half of the 7 and 10 rule. If their investments perform really
well, their money could grow even faster. At a 10% rate of return, their investment would
double in only 7 years. By the time Dave and Michelle reached their mid-70s, their $5000 would
double a whole bunch of times and turn into $640,000!

Dave and Michelle decided to invest their $5,000 right away, giving it more time to grow. When
their friends and family gave them $5000, they never imagined it could turn into six figures. But
by applying the 7 and 10 rule, Dave and Michelle realized the money could turn into $160,000 or
maybe even $640,000, for their future. Investing the money was the best wedding gift they could
have given themselves!
                                                                                                    37


Taking Advantage of Employer Matches

Matt and Josh work at a company that holds a lot of tedious meetings but offers some great
perks, like delicious lunches during those meetings. They like free stuff, especially good free
stuff like the lunches on meeting days. They like free money even better than free food, so when
the coworkers found out that their company matches their 401(k) contributions, they had to take
advantage of it.

Their employer provides one-to-one matching of employee 401(k) contributions, up to $2000 a
year. For every dollar up to $2000 that Matt (or Josh) puts in his 401(k), his company puts in a
dollar too. It’s like an “invest a dollar, get one free” deal. Just like the buy-one-get-one free
deals at the deli across the street.

So, if Matt invests $2000 of his own money in a 401(k) account, then the company puts in the
same amount: $2000. That would be $4000 in his account, because the company matches every
dollar. It’s like Matt is getting a 100% return on his investment. Twice as much gets invested and
twice as much grows in his account.

At Josh’s old job, the company matched 50% of employee 401(k) contributions. His old
employer would add half of what Josh put into his 401(k). If he invested $1000, they’d add $500,
bringing his account up to $1500 before even earning money on investments. That’s not as
amazing as a one-to-one-match, but it’s still a lot of money!

Where Josh and Matt work now, there’s something called a vesting schedule. They’re “fully
vested” after 3 years. That means that after working at the company for 3 years, employees get to
keep the entire amount of the employer match in their 401(k) account, even if they leave the
company. But no matter what, money that Matt or Josh or any other employee invests in a
401(k), out of their salary, always belongs to the employee. Even if they get fired or decide to
leave the job before being fully vested, an employer can’t touch the money an employee
contributes.

Basically, employer matches are like free money. But if you don’t invest in your 401(k), you
don’t get the match. And if you don’t invest the full amount that’s eligible for the match, it’s like
leaving free money on the table. For their part, Matt and Josh aren’t trust fund babies. They can’t
afford to pass up free money! And the buy-one-get-one-free sandwich deal at the deli across the
street makes it their favorite spot to go for lunch!

Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket

As she packs up her grandmother’s china for storage, Kate holds up a bowl and reminds her
brother Sam that she was always afraid of breaking it when they were kids. Kate and Sam both
miss their grandmother, but they each need to decide what they’re going to do with the money
she left them. Kate tells Sam that she’s going to invest her inheritance. She knows their
grandmother wanted them to each have a little “nest egg” for the future.

Sam recalls how their grandmother always said, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” For
Kate, not putting all your eggs in one basket makes good financial sense and she tells Sam that
she’s going to spread her inheritance money around.

At first, Sam doesn’t understand why just putting your money somewhere safe isn’t enough.
But, as Kate tells him, when you’re investing for the long term, you have to take some risk.
Otherwise, there’s no way to make your money grow because the average amount of money an
investment earns over the long run is related to the riskiness of the investment. Riskier
investments tend to make more money, while less risky investments tend to make less money.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean that riskier investments are better. With riskier investments,
there’s a chance you'll lose money; there’s a trade-off between risk and return.

Kate explains to Sam that each asset in his portfolio, every investment he owns, will have some
degree of risk. But what he wants to avoid is having a total wipeout and losing everything he
owns all at once. For example, if he owns stock from only one company, then he is betting on the
performance of just that one company. If it were totally destroyed, say, by a hurricane, his
investment would be in trouble. An individual company can be struck by less dramatic
difficulties, too. That’s why it’s important to invest in a mix of assets and not put all your money
in one place.

Sam thinks about what Kate is saying, then tells Kate he’s thinking about investing in the
company where he works—the company is growing and Sam is confident they’re doing well.
Kate wonders if he’s been listening to her at all! She tells her brother that the whole point of
putting his money in a bunch of different assets is that if something unexpectedly bad happens to
one of them, he'll be cushioned to a certain degree. But if Sam invested in the company where
he works and that company tanked, both his job and his investments would be in trouble. That’s
where not putting all your eggs in one basket comes in: you shouldn’t have your investments and
your job tied to the same company, and you shouldn’t have all of your money invested in one
company. Instead, spread it around.

Kate has Sam consider the following scenario: What if you invested in a whole bunch of
companies, but they all manufactured umbrellas and all of a sudden, the value of umbrellas
plummeted? That might sound unlikely, but think about when the tech bubble burst or when the
real estate market crashed. It’s smart to invest in many different kinds of companies and
investments. Basically, you want the ups and downs of your investments to be as unrelated to
each other as possible so that if some do badly, others will offset those losses. That’s why it’s a
good idea to spread your investments across different countries, too.
                                                                                                  39


Sam looks at his sister with a warm smile. She really is as smart as their grandmother. As they

keeping his “nest egg” of investments in lots of different baskets.

Inflation and the Plaid Shirt

This is the story of how a very cute plaid shirt inspired Lisa to save more for the future. Lisa and
Beth were shopping together when Beth spotted the shirt and knew it would look great on Lisa.
But when Lisa saw it, she had a flashback to the 90’s, the last time plaid shirts were trendy. The
new shirt cost $50 and Lisa remembered paying $30 for similar shirts back then. So the word
“inflation” popped into Lisa’s head.

Inflation describes price increases over time. Lisa realized that not only do shirts that used to cost
$30 now cost $50, but lots of things that used to be $30 are now $50. When inflation rises, the
same number of dollars buys less. So the price of a shirt, and other things like haircuts and
groceries, can get higher.

Let’s say inflation increases at 4%. Something that costs $100 at the beginning of the year will
cost $104 at the end of the year. Which doesn’t seem like a big deal, until you consider that, on
average, everything is going to cost a bit more. If your income doesn’t increase, you can’t buy as
much as you used to because prices are higher. Even if you’re making more money than you
used to, it still might not be enough if your income didn’t increase as much as the cost of what
you normally buy.

When Lisa had her plaid shirt “aha” moment, she realized that prices are higher now than they
used to be and they’re probably going to be even higher in the future. Her friend Beth understood
that part, too. But Beth could not figure out how a shirt could go all the way from $30 in the 90’s
to $50 now when it doesn’t feel like the prices make such huge leaps from one year to the next.

Lisa explained that it’s because the price increases build upon one another.
Let’s say inflation increases at 3% every year for 20 years. A $100 bag of groceries will cost
$103 after one year. After 10 years, it will cost $134 dollars, and the 3% just keeps adding up to
more and more money so that after 20 years your $100 bag of groceries costs $181. In other
words, your $100 groceries cost almost double, closer to $200, 20 years later.

                                                              $156
                                               $134
                              $116
                     $103

Lisa knows that when she thinks about how much money she’ll need for the future, she needs to
consider how much more things will cost. Since her paycheck won’t buy as much as it used to,
                                                                                                   41


she needs to start planning. And if she forgets about inflation, then wearing her cute new shirt
will remind her!

Take Advantage of Tax-Free Assets

It’s payday and roommates Becca and Emily are making plans to go out for the evening. Emily
touches up her makeup as Becca opens her paycheck, only to discover that while she made $800
that week, the check is for only $640. She hates how much they take out for taxes!

Emily explains that the reason she signed up for a 401(k) retirement account when she started her
new job was to protect her money from getting eaten up by taxes. But Emily’s explanation
simply confuses Becca, who doesn’t understand what a retirement account has to do with taxes.

Emily sits down with her roommate to explain. Everyone pays income tax on their salary. For
example, if you’re in the 20% tax bracket, then 20% of your salary goes to the government and
you don’t get to use it. But if you start a traditional 401(k) retirement plan, you can contribute
pre-tax money to that account. You can contribute a portion of your salary straight to
investments, without paying taxes on it, so there’s more money for you. With a 401(k), your
contributions grow tax-free. You don’t pay taxes on the account until you retire, when you
probably won’t be earning as much and therefore will be taxed in a lower tax bracket.

While this sounds like a good idea, Becca asks what would happen if she wanted to take money
out before retirement. Emily explains that if she withdraws money before she is 59 and a half,
she will have to pay taxes and will get hit with a penalty fee, too—so it’s not usually a good idea.

But the problem for Becca is that she doesn’t think her employer offers a 401(k) plan. Emily
explains that there are other options. IRAs are another type of retirement account and you don’t
have to get them through your job; you can get them yourself. As with 401(k)s, there are
traditional and Roth varieties. Traditional IRAs protect your money from taxes when you put
money in. And Roth IRAs protect your money from some taxes at the end, when you withdraw
money during retirement.

Those aren’t the only types of retirement accounts available that protect money from taxes. Lots
of non-profit and government jobs offer similar types of retirement accounts that work in the
same general way as 401(k)s and IRAs. When you’re saving for retirement, it really pays to take
advantage of these types of accounts and not give any more away in taxes than you have to!
That’s why Emily contributes to a 401(k).

Becca and Emily head out the door to their usual happy hour spot, with Becca thinking about
how great it is to have friends who can give you financial advice and Emily thinking about
whether the cute new bartender will be at happy hour!
