                              The Allocation of Capital
                    Between Residential and Nonresidential Uses:
                   Taxes, Inflation and Capital Market Constraints



                                       ABSTRACT



      We have constructed a
                              simple two—sector model of the demand for
 and corporate capital. A increase in the inflation rate, with and housing
 out an increase in the risk                                         with-
                             premium
 a number of model variants. The     on equities, was then simulated with
                                   model and simulation experiments illustrate
 both the tax bias in favor of
                                housing (its initial average real user cost
 was 3 percentage points less than
 in which inflation                 that for corporate capital) and the manner
                    magnifies it (the difference rises to 5
 without an exogenous increase in real house prices and 4    percentage points
 with an exogenous increase).                              percentage points
                               The existence of a capita1market constraint
 offsets the increase in the bias
a sharp, inefficient reallocationagainst corporate capital, but it introduces
                                    of housing from less wealthy, constrained
households to wealthy households who do not have gains on
are not financially constrained.                            mortgages and
finance instruments would          Widespread  usage of innovative housing
                           overcome this reallocation but at the expense of
corporate capital. (ly a reduction in inflation or in the taxation of
income from business capital will solve the problem of
of capital.                                              inefficient allocation

      The simulation results are also able to provide an explanation
the failure of nominal interest                                      for
                                 rates to rise by a multiple of an increase
 in the inflation rate in a world with taxes. When the inflation
alone was increased, the ratio of the increases in the risk—free rate
flation rates was 1.32. A increase in the risk premium            and in-
conjunction with the increase in                          on equities, in
                                  inflation, lowered the simulated ratio
to 1.10, introduction of
                          a supply price elasticity of 4 and an exogenous
increase in the real house
of the credit—market        price reduced the ratio to 1.03, and incorporation
                      constraint reduced the ratio to 0,95.

       During the past decade, the United States has been plagued bya declining

rate   of productivity growth. Many have attributed this phenomenon to a

sharp slowdown in the growth   of   the capital/output ratio in the industrial

sector, and others have advanced a wide variety of policies, under the

broad umbrella of reindustrialization, to increase business investment

and reverse the downward trend in productivity. Some policies are intended

to promote savings and thus total capital formation. Others are designed

to shift the composition of capital formation from residential to nonresidential.

A primary rationale for the shift policies is the argument that the United

States has overinvested in residential capital in the 1970s. More specifically,

many have contended 'that the current tax system is biased in favor of

residential capital and that this bias has been reinforced by the acceleration

of inflation during the past decade and a half.1 The bias takes the form of

declining real user costs or investment hurdle rates for housing vis-a-vis

business investment and results in households occupying housing units of

too great quantity or quality.

       In spite of this apparent bias, the composition of investment in the

United states does not seem to have been altered significantly in favor

of residential uses. In fact, the reverse appears to have occurred (see

Grebier, 1979 and Feldstein, 1981). One explanation for this result is

that factors other than the tax bias may have been operating to raise

the share of nonresidential investment in total capital formation. Under

this interpretation, the tax-inflation bias has simply acted to offset such

factors. For example, if the income elasticity of the demand for housing is

less than unity, then we would expect the share of housing in GNP    to   decline


Diamond (1980) and Villani (1981) have documented the decline in the real
 user cost of owner-occupied housing; Hendershott and Hu (1980 and 1981b) have
 emphasized the decline relative to real user costs for nonresidential capital.

  over time as real income grows. An alternative
                                                     explanation is that the model
  underlying the derivation of the tax-inflation bias
                                                         is misspecified. Two
  potential problems   come to mind. First, the existence of fixed-rate

 mortgages and the capital gains earned on them during periods of rising

  interest rates might prevent optimizing households from changing (increasing)

 their effective housing demand even in the face of increasing tax
                                                                        advantages.
 Second, capital-market constraints (lender's restrictions on debt payment-

 income ratios) might significantly reduce the demand for housing by less

 wealthy households that move (in order to achieve real income gains)

 during periods of rising inflation and interest
                                                    rates. Of course, if the
 effective demand for housing has not
                                         increased, then capital cannot have
 been reallocated away from industrial
                                         uses. A major goal of the present
paper is to determine the extent to which the
                                                  existence of capital gains
on existing mortgages and capital-market
                                             constraints could have offset
the effect of the inflation-induced
                                      relative decline in the real user
cost of housing on the allocation of capital.

          this goal in mind, we have constructed a simple two-sector
       With

general-equi1jbj simulation model of the demand for housing and
corporate (nonhousing) capital.2 The model incorporates the existing
tax   structure, introduces portfolio balance relations for households,

specifies risk premiums required to hold risky assets, and includes

a federal budget constraint whereby
                                      government spending moves with federal


4or theoretical analyses of the allocation of capital

 and nonresidential uses, see Ballentine
 and Kau and Kennan (1981). For          (1981), EbrIll and Possen (1980),

tax revenues. To allow for the operation of credit market constraints,

households are partitioned into the wealthy who lend to the less wealthy.

(Both groups of households finance business.) The model simultaneously

determines the risk-free debt rate, risk premiums on mortgages, corporate

equities and housing, and the allocation of a fixed capital stock among

corporate capital, housing of the wealthy and housing of the less wealthy.

The model is parameterized so as to make it roughly comparable to the

American   economy in   the middle 1960s.

     Sections   111-V contain the results of a variety of simulation
experiments. The basic      experiment is an increase in the inflation rate
from one to 8   percent,   either alone or accompanied by an increase in the
risk premium    on corporate equities. The experiments are run with and

without allowance for behavior influenced by capital gains on existing

mortgages. Section IV introduces an endogenously-determined real housing

price and a mechanism for incorporating an exogenous increase in the real

housing price. The impact of a capital !narket constraint on housing demand

of the less wealthy is developed in Section V. A summary concludes

the paper.
                                       I. The Model




          Consider an economy in which there are two goods -
                                                                 housing and
  nonhousing. Housing services are produced by using only residential

  capital, and the nonhousing good is produced by nonresidential capital

  arid labor via a Cobb-Douglas production function




  (1)                 r =



 where Y is the level of nonhousji
                                   output; L Is the labor force; and K is
 the quantity of nonresidential capital employed which is determined
                                                                     by
 equating the value of its after-tax marginal
                                                      product to its user cost. That is,

                                   =

                 or

 (2)                  K (l_T)ykcy/ck


 where i    is   the corporate Income tax rate, and Ck is the user cost of

 nonresidential capital.

        Assume that each unit of housing
                                              capital produces one unit of housing
services.3 The quantity of housing services demanded by each
                                                             household i
is assumed to be. unitai'y     elastic with   respect to the income   of the
household    and      elastic with respect to the implicit rents per unit of

housing    and thereby the user cost of
                                          housing capital. Assuming that there
are    n households with identical tastes in     the economy, the individual
housing demand equation is



3We make the
             simplifying assumption that no labor is employed in the
 production of housing services. Similarly,
is                                          we assume that no capital
    employed in the production of government services.

(3)          H'   hD(h)

where H1 denotes the demand for housing services by the ith household;

       its disposable income; and c the real user cost per unit of housing

stock. As discussed below, c Is household specific because of differences

in income (and thus personal tax rates) and wealth (and thus portfolio

compositions and risk premiums).

        The total demand for housing is equal to             Assuming that there is

perfect mobility of capital between residential and nonresidential uses,

we can write



(1.)         W=K+H
where K is the total demand for nonresidential capital as determined in

equation (2), and       is the real stock of wealth of the economy and will

be treated as a constant in the basic model. The total value of wealth,

on the other hand, is equal to



(5)          W = K + PEH



where p is the real price of housing (the ratio of the price of housing

to the price of    nonhousing   goods, the   latter   being treated as the numeraire)

and    is initially unity so W =       While     all housing is assumed to be
owned directly by households, K is assumed to be held by corporations which
finance their investment by      issuing bonds   and equity (either directly or
by    retaining earnings).

     Portfolio   Balance     and Risk emjums

          Household       assets include   corporate       debt, corporate equity, and housing.
  Some wealthy households also hold
                                                 mortgages issued by less wealthy homeowners.
  The balance sheet for each household I can be expressed
                                                          by the following
  equation



  (6)



 where B1, E1, M1 and H'
                         are, respectively, the amouiitz of corporate debt,

 corporate equity, mortgage debt, and housing owned by the ith household,

 while WI and N1 are the net worth              arid the   mortgage debt incurred by it.
 For simplicity, the bonds are assumed to be risk-free (the
                                                            return is
 certain). it seems reasonable to assume that
                                                               mortgage   suppliers are
 never holders of mortgages or
                                        corporate bonds. Thus for those households
 with positive B1 and
                              M1, M   is equal to zero (their housing purchases

 are complete].y equity financed).              On the other hand, for those having
 positive loan to value ratios, B1 and N1 are equal to zero.

        With respect to the risky
                                        assets, the quantity- of each demanded
by household I relative to its total wealth is assumed to
                                                          equal the ratio
the difference between the rate of return on that asset
                                                        and the risk-free
rate to the product of the risk
                                           aversion parameter and the expected
variance of the return on that         asset:

The Real User Costs         of    Capital

      is the true depreciation rate of capital,                     is the depreciation

rate allowed by tax law and                   is the rate of property tax applied to

corporate capital.6 The nominal equity rate paid by corporations is rk

and differs from the after-tax equity rate received by shareholders,

rk8, by the taxes (at the personal level) on dividend income and on

increases in share values resulting from retention of corporate earnings

and inflation. Letting v be the portion of real earnings (including

real gains at the expense of debtors) paid out, 8 be the common personal

income tax rate and              the capital gains tax rate, the relationship

between rka and rk is given by

       Under current tax law, homeowners are not required to pay tax on

either the real imputed rents or

houses nor are they allowed to deduct any depreciation in computing

tax liabilities. Thus the real user cost of capital for wealthy households

with   no debt financing (v=O) is given by

where the symbols are as defined above except that they now apply to
housing. From equation (7'), rh is the after-tax debt rate plus a risk
premium equal to RaHpH"/W".
                                             II




       The user cost for less wealthy households is




(18)        c = pLvr ÷ (1_v)rh        -
                                             + oh   +




where rm is the after-tax (risky) mortgage rate. The relationship between

this rate and the risk-free financing rate is assumed to be giver., by


           r = (1-9)1    +


where



(19)        p = m1(v-v)       +

Below a critical level of the loan-to-value ratio v0 , the risk associated

wlth   housing   investment   is completely borne by the homeowners, and. thus

the mortgage rate they pay is equal to the risk-free rate. If the loan-

to-value ratio exceeds this value, a part of the risk is shared by lenders,

and consequently a risk premium has to be paid to them.7

       Substitution of the expressions for rh and r into equations (17)

and. (18), where rh for the noriwealthy depends on their housing as a

fraction of their wealth, yields



7Because the m0h term in the expression for rm is the risk premium
required by the lenders, the appropriate personal income tax rate is the
rate that applies to the average lender. This is in contrast to equation
(18) where 9 is the tax rate paid by the homeowner. In our model all
taxpayers pay the same tax rate so this distinction is irrelevant.

The first term in brackets is the sum of labor, dividend, and net

 there is no government debt. There is no need to differentiate between
 household interest paid and received because all households are assumed
 to be in the same tax bracket.

The sectoral wealth variables have been replaced by         and (lW)Wr

respectively, where w is exogenous because p is fixed. The last two

equations, where y is the portion of income accruing to the wealthy and

is exogenous, are applications of equation (3).      The basic model determines
                                                  W and H N), household and
income (Y), the three capital quantIties (K, H

business taxes (TXh and TX,), retained earnings (RE), disposable income (D),

the risk-free rate (1), the housing loan-to-value ratio (v), and the

mortgage-rate risk premium

      In view of our interest in explaining the allocation implications

of high inflation over the past decade, a natural starting point is to

set the initial values of the system roughly at their actual values in

the middle 1960s. In particular, let the initial inflation rate be one
percent and the initial risk-free financing rate be 3 percent. Moreover,
expected    inflation rates f or corporate and housing capital are assumed to

be equal.

      By the assumption that nonhousing production is subject to constant

returns to scale and the income elasticity of housing demand is unity,

the absolute values of K, H, and L do not matter. Only their relative

values are needed. Thus we arbitrarily set the initial real wealth equal

to 1,000. We also set initial p equal to unity, K and H equal to 500

and Y = 525.      All these can be interpreted as billions of 1965 dollars.

The ratio of K to H (i.e., 500/500 =       1) is roughly the ratio of residential
to nonresidential capital in the middle 1960s (see Hendershott and Hu,

 1980,   Table   -8), and the ratio of Y to K approximates the ratio of

GNP to nonresidential capital.
                                              16




      Elsewhere (1981b) we have discussed the implications of inflation

 for resource allocation when there are heterogeneous income groups in

 different tax brackets. To isolate the wealth effect from the income

 effect on housing demand, we assume here that all households earn the

 same income and pay the same         tax   rate. They differ from each other only

 by the initial wealth they possess. In most of the analysis, one-half

 of the households are taken to be wealthy and the other half less wealthy

 in the sense described below.

      The various tax, depreciation and financing parameters are as follows.

 Tax rates: 7     0.52,   e     0.3, u,       0.O!., 'r =   0.012, r = 0.016.
Economic and tax depreciation rates:
                                                8k   0.10, 8h =    0.025, t1 0.01
and t2 =   0.2.   Payout and financing rates: Y =           0.,   b =   1/3, and v 0.8.
With slightly over half of the housing debt-free, the average loan-to-value

ratio for all housing is just under Q.i, the actual ratio for the United

States. Discussions regarding the other parameters are contained in

Hendershott and Hu (1980)       and   Hendershott (1981).

     There are four risk parameters in the model:                 and m2, along with

v, determine a, and RaE and RaE, along with portfolio shares, determine
   and h We set           =   -0.08 and m2 = 1.0.      These values result in

a pattern of differences in mortgage rates with different loan-to-value

ratios that approximates the observed differences in mortgage commitment

0.6, 0.9 and 0.95. For E' we use 0.12. This is consistent with a

risk-aversion parameter of 3 and an after-tax expected variance of 0.04.

The housing variance, aH, is set at 0.005. Given the above parameter

values, the coefficients in the corporate user cost equation (13') are

   =              2 = 0.51921,            =   0.881 and   =   0.04376.     Furthermore,

ck =   0.0908, and the coefficients in the housing user cost equations are
   =             —   0.015 and E3 = 0.0376.
       The elasticity of the demand for housing with respect to the rental

price or real user cost is assumed to be -0.5. Polinsky and Eliwood (1979)

report an elasticity of -0.7, while Hanushek and Quigley (1980) estimate

it to be _0.14. Rosen's (1979) mean price elasticity was -0.97, but

the estimate was of a translog function where the elasticity declined

in absolute value as the real user cost fell.9 Moreover, his data were

for 1970, when the housing real user cost had not yet been fully reduced

by inflation.

       Capital's share of income, 0'k' is set equal to 0.2. From this and

the other specified parameters, TX,, RE, TXh, and D can be solved

recursively as TXk =         214.5, RE = 114.16, TXh = 137.98        and D =   296.71.

The quantity of labor and               are then determined by simultaneous solution

of equations (1) and (2). These values are L = 605.72 and                        =   0.90063.

Lastly, simultaneous solution of equations (14'), (11), (17'), (18'),

(3W) and (3N) then yields the remaining parameter values:                        = 0.141106,

w = 0.927114,c        = 0.05626, c = 0.06306,         HW = 257.13 and RN         214.2.87.



9To illustrate, assume the functional form Ln.H =              LnD   +           ÷
                                                                         lLnch
 The elasticity with respect to the user cost is then Ech =                          + 22    log ch.
 Assume that the elasticity is -1 at the initial user cost, 0.051414, and set
    = -5.72 (see Rosen, 1979, Table 2, p. 16). Then2 = -0.8106. The
 elasticity at a percentage point lower user cost, O.0144i., is -0.67, and
 at 0.031414 the elasticity is only -0.26.

Wealthy households have a well-balanced asset portfolio with between 18

and 33 percent (number In parentheses) in each of the four assets: bonds,

                   III. The Impact of Increased Inflation: Fixed Prices


              Table 2 presents some simulations of the model with the relative price

   of housing and the total capital stock held constant. The first column

   contains the initial values of the key variables.              Column 2 indicates how

   these variables are changed by a 7           percentage point increase in the expected
   inflation rate from one to 8         percent.      The risk-free rate rises by nearly
  9 percentage points and the loan-to-value ratio increases slightly.
  Owing       to   the heavier taxation of returns on corporate equities than on

  housing, the user cost for corporate capital rises relative to that for

  housing; the constraint that the capital stock is fixed dictates both

  the magnitude of the rise in the risk-free rate and the movement of the

  user costs in opposite directions. As a result, the capital stock is

  tilted toward housing. The increase in housing (and decrease in corporate

  capital) is a modest 3          percent   of the original stock.

         Column 3      in   Table 2 supplements the increase in inflation with a

  75 percent increase in the risk premium on
                                                         corporate equities (149 percent --
  from   14   to   6 percent   -- after allowing   for the endogenous corporate

  capital      response).      Malkiel (1979) is the strongest proponent of the view

 that the risk premium has risen)0 Because the increase may be due to

 the greater variability in prices associated with the higher inflation

 rate (Malkiel, p. 297), the joint simulation of both increases seems

 particularly       appropriate. Addition of the increase in the         risk premium

 roughly       triples the impact of the increase in inflation on        the   user cost

19Friend and Hasbrouck         (1980) also suggest a rise in the     risk premium.

 of corporate capital and on the allocation of capital. Now the increase

 in housing (and decline in corporate capital) is 12 percent of the

 existing stock.

         Of course, many less wealthy households did not move between the

 middle 1960s and late 1970s and thus did not have to refinance at the

 higher mortgage rate. In fact, capital gains on existing low rate

 mortgages are a strong incentive not to refinance.11 The last simulation

 reported in Table 2 takes this fact into account. In this simulation,

 n proportion of the less wealthy households are assumed to have maintained

 their existing financing and housing. The only model changes made are the

 substitution of



 (3N')       HN =                 N€     +    I N
                    (1_n)cr(i_y)D(c)

for   equation (3N) and the replacement of the last term in equation (ii),

\rpHN, with vp(HN -    nH)   +
                                 v0p0nHN.l2    We set n =   0.5.
      The results of this simulation are listed in column 14 of Table 2.

Because half of the less wealthy households do not alter their housing

and financing, the risk-free rate and loan-to-value ratio rise less. Because

all user costs are lower, the corporate capital stock and the housing of the

wealthy and the less wealthy who move are all greater than in the case

where all households refinance. The datum in the Table for the housing

of the less wealthy in column (14) declines relative to column (3) because

of the households that do not move but simply maintain their existing

11These gains decline in real terms over time as amortization occurs and
  inflation takes its toll. Thus this incentive eventually erodes.

   second order wealth effect, the decline in the market value of "old"
 mortgages, has not been accounted for in this simulation.

housing. The impact of the noninovers is as much on the allocation of

housing among households as on the allocation between residential and

nonresidential capital.

     The data at the bottom of Table 2 indicate that the increase in

inflation has a number of impacts on income flows. First, total income/output

declines owing to the fall in corporate capital; the drop in net income

is less, however, because of the fall in depreciation on corporate capital.

Second, household taxes (and thus government spending) rise owing to the

taxation of nominal interest and nominal increases in share prices at the

personal level. Whether corporate taxes rise or fall depends on the rise

in the risk-free rate. With the more plausible smaller increase in the

rate Lcoiumns (3) and (l)j, the increase in tax saving on interest is

more than offset by the reduction in the tax saving on depreciation so

taxes rise by 10 percent. Third, retained earnings fall sharply owing

to the rise in interest expense and the paying out of a portion of the

real gains at the expense of debtors. Fourth, disposable income tends

to decline by about the sum of the fall in net income and the rise in

taxes. To illustrate, consider column (3). Total income falls by $13

billion, but the decline in net income is only $7 billion because depreciation

drops by $6 billion. Taxes rise by $14 billion and disposable income is

reduced by $11 billion.

                            IV. Variable Housing Prices

         In the above simulations the real price of housing was held constant.

  Capital was assumed to be perfectly mobile between
                                                                   housing and. nonhousing

 uses, and relative real user costs allocated the capital. In fact, the

 real price of housing --        the ratio of the price of a constant quality
 house to the CpI net of shelter --             rose by 40 percent between 1965 and
 1979. In     the following simulations, a finite supply price elasticity
 is    incorporated into the model, and a shift parameter is introduced             into
 the    housing supply function. Housing capital is still assumed to be

 perfectly tradable between wealthy and nonwealthy households.

        Two major model changes are necessary. First, equation (Li') is

 replaced by



 (4")        W   =     + r(HW+HN)S          +
                                                1                (HW+HN)
                                                       HW÷HN1J

which implies that

is the mobility factor. This factor equals 1 if there is perfect mobility

of capital between residential and nonresidential uses and equals H0/(H'÷HN)
                                    25




if   capital is not mobile between the two uses. The former case holds

when s = 0, and equation (1.") reduces to (L) when      2 = 1.     The

latter case holds when s =    and implies that W = K   + H   for       =   X       1.
                                               r         o         1           2
As can be seen from equation (2), the coefficient s turns out to be the

inverse of the supply elasticity of housing.      and 2 are introduced

in (ii.") to allow for productivity change in the nonhousing and housing

sectors, respectively, and they are equal to unity in the absence of

technical progress. Technical progress in the nonhousing industries can

be considered as an exogenous increase in      in equation (1). However,

because of' the assumption of a Cobb4)ouglas production function, it can

be expressed in terms of the "capital aunenting!v rate and translated into

an increase in )] X2 is likewise introduced, As can be seen from (2k),

the ratio l'2 turns out to be the exogenous shift factor in the suppiy

function of housing. There is some empirical evidence that the efficiency

increase in nonhousing industries exceeded that in the construction

industry between 1965 and 1978 (Hendershott, 1980, Table 6). As a result,

there has been an exogenous increase in real construction costs (Grebler,

1979, Exhibit 17). In some experiments, we will raise        to 1.15 and

lower      to 0.88162, thereby abstracting from growth considerations;

thus the exogenous increase in p will be from 1.0 to 1.3, or 30 percent.13

      The second major change follows from the fact that the endogenization

of p requires the endogenization of the wealth variables: W, W and wN.

Three equations are added:


13The relative changes in l and are calibrated such that the average
  of the reciprocals of their levels is unity. Thus the changes leave
  W  unchanged at the initial values of corporate capital and housing.

Equations (11'), (5') and (12) determine the new wealth values based

upon the initial housing holdings, and equation (25) imposes the sectoral

balance sheet constraint based upon simulated values.

        The first column of Table 3 lists the impacts of the increase in the

inflation rate and equity risk premium on the key endogenous variables

for the case of a fixed real housing price or an infinite supply price

elasticity. The results are the same as those in column 3 of Table 2.

The second and third columns here report results for supply price elasticities

of 14 and 0.01 (values of s of 0.25 and 100, respectively)) With an

elasticity of 14, the real housing price rises by 2* percent (the increase

is 6 percent for an elasticity of 2). Because this tends to raise the

real user cost for housing, the increase in the risk-free rate necessary

to equilibrate the market for capital goods is not as great. The increase

in the real housing price provides both types of households with roughly

equal dollar real capital gains       because   their initial housing was   roughly

     recent estimates of this elasticity are 9 (Smith, 1976, p. 1401) and
 2 (Poterba, 1980, p. 11). We take 14. as the most likely value.
 Unfortunately the range of estimates is even wider than 2 to 9.

equal. However, as a percent of initial wealth, the gain is much greater

f or the highly-levered, less-wealthy households, 9 percent versus 0.7

percent for the wealthy. The absolute values of the changes in user

costs and quantities of capital are roughly 6 percent less than when the

real price of housing is fixed (column 1).

    As the supply price elasticity approaches zero, more and more of the

adjustment is achieved by a rise in the real price of housing and less by

increases in the risk-free rate. With an elasticity of 0.01, the risk-free

rate rises by only 7 percentage points and the increase in the user cost

on corporate capital is only 3 basis points. The rise in the real price

of housing is 45 percent, and less wealthy households maintain most of

this gain in housing equity, lowering the loan-to-value ratio by 18 percent-

age points. Because the real user cost for housing is higher for less

wealthy households, the increase in the real supply price of housing

raises their user cost relative to that of wealthy households, although

both decline, tending to raise the demand for housing. The small fall in

the quantity of housing demanded by the less wealthy is attributable to

the decline in disposable income. This, in turn, is due to an increase

in taxes, $2.8 billion of which is property taxes on the inflated house

values.

     Column (4) is the result of a simulation with both a supply price

elasticity of 4 and an exogenous 30 percent upward shift in the supply of
                                                15
housing schedule (x1 =   1.15, x2   0.88462).        The results are quite

similar to those of column 3 where the supply price elasticity was near

zero. Because the real price of housing rises by less, the risk-free rate

rises by more and the reallocation away from corporate capital is $20

billion or 4 percent.



   One-third or 10 percent of this shift is probably better interpreted
as a result of the supply elasticity of 4. Between 1965 and 1978 the stock
of residential housing increased by about 45 percent. This is not incor-
porated into our analysis which abstracts from growth considerations. From
equation (24) and the assumption that s   1/4, this increase would raise
p from 1.0 to 1.1 = (1.45)0.25.

                      V. The Capital Market Constraint



       Recent empirical studies suggest that nominal, as well as real,
                                                    16
mortgage rates affect housing demand.                     The most straight-forward

 cause of this result is the well-known housing cost/income limit that

 lenders impose on borrowers. Housing costs, excluding utilities, are the

sum of outlays for maintenance, property taxes, and mortgage payments. In

 terms of our earlier symbols, the ratio of nonutility housing costs (HC)

of the nonwealthy households that move to their after-tax labor income

(Y*) is:



               r                 r i+r
                                  /

                                                            -nH )

               [h
                                 (1+r)25-i

where Y*     (1y)(l_n)(l_Q)(1_rvk)Y and r is the after-tax mortgage rate on

a level-payment mortgage with a 25 year life. Using the initial values of

the variables, the ratio is 0.135. For the purposes of the paper, we

specify the limit allowed by lenders to be 0.17.

       When equation (26), after setting the left-side equal to 0.17, is

solved for v using the values of i, , HN and Y from the simulation of

increases in inflation and the risk premium, a value of 48 percent is

obtained. That is, mortgage payments and other costs rise so high rela-

tive to income that lenders (wealthy households) would be willing to ex-

tend only 72 percent (48/67) of the mortgage debt desired by less wealthy

households who move. The credit shortfall is$62 billion (0.67-0.48 times

$326 billion). In the absence of more innovative financing instruments,

such as graduated payment or shared appreciated mortgages, these house-

holds are simply unable to purchase the desired housing.

     To incorporate this constraint into the analysis, we replace the

equation for the desired housing demand of less wealthy households with

equation (26) after setting the left-hand side equal to 0.17. In effect,

this equation determines the loan-to-value ratio and the quantity of

housing held is derived from the balance sheet constraint of—these house-

holds. The results from a simulation of the revised model are listed in

column 2 of Table 4; column 1 repeats column 4 of Table 3 where the capital

market constraint is not binding. The loan-to-value ratio declines by

nearly 5 percentage points relative to column 1, and the increase in the

risk-free interest rate is three-quarters of a percentage point less.

Because "rationing" of less wealthy households occurs, a smaller increase

in interest rates and in the user cost for corporate capital is needed to

equilibrate the capital market. While the user cost for nonwealthy house-

holds falls sharply, it is irrelevant; the capital-market constraint leads

to a decline in their housing. The net result is an unchanged stock of

corporate capital, and a significant reallocation of housing from the less

wealthy to the wealthy. The housing of the latter now falls by 6 percent

instead of rising slightly.

     Of course, many less wealthy households will not move when faced with

high nominal mortgage rates and a binding capital market constraint.

households are assumed to maintain their existing housing. Because the

housing of nonmoving, less wealthy households does not decline (the credit

market constraint is less binding in the aggregate), the increase in the

risk-free rate is greater than in column 2 and the decline is the loan-to-

value ratio is less. The net result is a small, one percent, decline in

corporate capital and offsetting rise in housing capital. There is still

a significant shift in the housing stock from the less wealthy to the

wealthy; in fact, the housing of the less-wealthy movers now falls by a

full 17½ percent [21.l/(242.9x0.5)1.

     The imposition of the credit market constraint in the simulations is an

admittedly crude attempt to approximate the real world. Our method of im-

posing the constraint tends to overstate its impact on housing demand for

three reasons. First, all the impact of the constraint falls on housing; in

fact, constrained households would also be expected to hold less of other

assets, equities in our model. (Because equity holdings of the constrained

households are only 10 percent of their housing, this source of overstate-

ment is not large.) Second, if the income elasticity of housing is less

than unity and if households that move do so to earn higher real income,

then the credit market constraint is less binding than our treatment

implies. Third, the limit on the housing costs/income ratio assumed to

be imposed by lenders, 0.17, is probably too low. On the other hand, our

method tends to understate the impact in an important respect. The calcula-

tions assumed that all households owned houses in 1965 and reaped 30 percent

real capital gains since then. As a result the desired loan-to-value ratio

declined from 80 percent to 67 percent. In reality, many less wealthy

households are of a more recent vintage and have not participated in these
                                        34




     real capital gains. For these households the desired loan-to-value ratio

     is close to 80 percent and thus the credit market constraint is far more

     binding than that based on our analysis.       On balance, we view our
     results as roughly indicative of the aggregative impact of the capital

 market constraint.

         The simulation results reported in column 3 are also consistent with

 the changes observed between the middle l960s and late 1970s in many

 respects other than the maintenance of the
                                                corporate capital stock.
 Three seem worthy of note. First, the ratio of the increase in the risk—

 free rate to the increase in the inflation
                                                 rate, 0.95, is roughly that
 observed. Second, the 6 percent increase in real business taxes is close

 to the observed 10 percent increase in real profit taxes between 1965 and

 1979. Third, the sharp fall in real retained earnings (after adjustment

 for inventory valuation and capital
                                        consumption allowances), 83 percent,
is not far from the observed 70
                                    percent decline between the same years.


                                VI, Conclusion



        We have constructed a simple two-sector model of the demand for

housing and corporate capital. An increase in the inflation rate, with

and without an increase in the risk premium on equities, was then simu-

lated with a number of model variants.       The model and simulation experi-

ments illustrate both the tax bias in favor of housing (its initial


17
   This suggests that the distributional impact of inflation on households
is far more complex than that implied by our two household world. Ex-
tension of the model to allow for a
                                    greater diversity of households would
be useful.
                                  35




average real user cost was 3 percentage points less than that for corporate

capital) and the manner in which inflation magnifies it (the difference

rises to 5 percentage points without an exogenous increase in real house

prices and 4 percentage points with an exogenous increase). The existence

of a capital-market constraint offsets the increase in the bias against

corporate capital, but it introduces a sharp, inefficient reallocation

of housing from less wealthy, constrained households to wealthy house-

holds who do not have gains on mortgages and are not financially con-

strained. Widespread usage of innovative housing finance instruments

would overcome this reallocation but at the expense of corporate capital.

Only a reduction in inflation or in the taxation of income from business

capital will solve the problem of inefficient allocation of capital.

Current legislative proposals to increase business depreciation allow-

ances and to reduce the corporate tax rate and the taxation of capital

gains are steps in the latter direction.

     The simulation results are also able to provide an explanation for

the failure of nominal interest rates to rise by a multiple of an increase
                                               18
in the inflation rate in a world with taxes.        When the inflation rate
alone was increased, the ratio of the increases in the risk-free and in-

flation rates was 1.32. This is a weighted average of the increases necessary

to leave the real user costs of corporate (1.30) and housing (1.43) capital

constant, where the former is weighted twice as heavily as the latter be-

cause the elasticity of corporate capital with respect to the real user is

twice as large as the elasticity of housing. The necessary increases de-

pend on the taxation of corporate and housing income at both the personal

efforts at solving this puzzle.
                                     36




  and, for the former, corporate levels. To illustrate, the necessary

  ratio for housing is simply 11(1-9). An increase in the risk premium on

  equities, in conjunction with the increase in inflation, lowered the

 simulated ratio to 1.10, introduction of a supply price elasticity of 4

 and an exogenous increase in the real house price reduced the ratio to

 1.03, and incorporation of the credit-market constraint reduced the ratio

 to 0.95.

      The present model can usefully be extended in a variety of directions,

 one of which seems especially important.
                                              Currently, aggregate savings is
 implicitly assumed to be equal to replacement investment of real and housing

 capital. Thus the real stock of wealth of the economy remains constant

 over time. In the real world, however,
                                            aggregate savings tends to exceed
 the replacement investment of capital and the positive net investment en-

 sures that the real stock of wealth grows over time. Capital accumulation

and income growth would have no effect on its relative allocation between

the two uses if the income elasticity of
                                            housing demand were unitary and
the real user costs were constant. In fact, there appears to be a general

concensus that the income elasticity of housing is significantly less

than unity (Hanushek and Quigley,
                                    1980, Polinsky and Eliwood, 1979, and
Rosen, 1979) and the real user costs have not been constant. To accomodate

these factors and to deduce the impact of inflation on capital accumula-

tion generally, the model will be extended in a growth setting. This will

allow for changes in real after-tax interest rates and real wealth (in-

cluding the effect of increases in the real price of housing) to impact

on saving.
