       Using a panel of51 prices from 48 cities in the United Stateswe provide an upper bound

estimate of the rate of convergence to Purchasing Power Parity. We find convergence rates

substantially higher than typically found in cross-country data. We investigate some potentially

seriousbiases induced by i.i.d. measurementerrors in the data, and find our estimatesto be robust

to these potential biases. We also presentevidence thatconvergence occurs faster for largerprice

differences. Finally,we find thatratesof convergence are slower for cities fartherapart. However,

our estimates suggest thatdistance alone can only account for a small portion of the much slower

convergence rates across nationalborders.

       The aim of this paper is to provide an upper bound estimate of the rate of convergence

to purchasing power parity (PPP). The speed at which relative prices move toward parity is

important for theories of exchange rate determinationand for open-economy macro models,

almost all of which employ versions of PPP.       Professional wisdom regarding the rate of

convergence toward PPP has runthe M gamut - from fairlyhigh, to nearly zero, and now, back

to positive but slow. In markets for goods and services there is little expectation that price

disparitieswill instantly disappear as they do, for example, in tiancial markets, due to both

explicit and implicit baniers to the flows of goods and services. We examine convergence in a

context where many of these barriers are absent in order to quantitatively assess their

importancein marketsless integrated.

       Not long afier Jacob Frenkel’sseminalwork (1978) which provided evidence supportive

of convergence to PPP during a hyperinflation,many subsequent studies concluded a “collapse

of purchasingpower parities.”1 In particular,these studies failed to reject the hypothesis that

real exchange rates foflow a random walk, which implies that any deviation from PPP is

permanent. This haling undermined cofidence        in a wide range of open-economy macro

models that assumed some version of PPP, including monetary theories of the exchange rate,

and Dombush’s overshooting model,

       Recent research has focused on increasing statisticalpower by using longer time series

(Frankel 1986, Edison 1987), and on combining cross-sectional and time series features of the

data (Abuaf and Jorion 1990, Frankel and Rose 1995, Papell 1996, Wei and Parsley 1995).

These studieshave been considerably more successful at rejecting the unit root mdl hypothesis.
While these studies have found mean reversion in real exchange rates, the implied half lives of

between three and seven years have been diflicultto interpret.

       In this study we focus exclusively on prices withinthe United Statesin order to establish

a naturalbenchmark for comparison to internationalevidence.2 The use of this data set abstracts

from two potentially important influences on the rate of convergence:        trade barriers and

exchange rate volatility. Additionally, the higher degree of fictor market integration firther

limits departuresfrom price parityandthusfacilitatesconvergence. A second importantfeatureof

thisstudyis the use of commoditylevelprice data. Thuswe implicitlycontrol for termsof tradeand

otheraggregationeffectsthatcan impactconvergmce estimates.A Wer         benefi is thatwe are able

to makedirectcomparisonsof how ratesof convergmce depmd on the degree of tradabilhy.Frnally,

we explicitlyexaminethe effects of taxesandtransportationcosts on estimatedratesof convergence.

To our knowledge,thisis the fist studythatlooks atthe effect of tax rateson convergence.

       Section II describes the data and its collection in more detail. Section III be~s     by

provitig   some summary statistics on the price data and subsequently provides estimates of

rates of convergence. Mer comparing rates of convergence across (and within) tradable and

non-tradable groupings, we investigate other tiuences       on our findings.    A final section

summarizesour main conclusions.



                                         n.       Data

       The 51 finalgoods and setices prices m our panel are sampled(quarterly)from 48 citiesm

the United States over the period 1975.1 through 1992.4. The data set rncludesprices of both

tradableandnon-tradablegoods andservices. me price datawas assembledfrom publicationsof the

Americm Chamberof Commerce ResearchersAssociatio~ and rnckded m the publicatio~ Cost of

Living Index (heretier, Index).   Each quarterlyisme of the Index containscomparativeaverage

association. Inthisstudywe use onlythe rawprice data.

       me actualdatacollectionis done by the local Chamberof Commerce staff or vohteers for

the Chamber, and is vohmtary. Explicit instructionsand data forms are provided for each data

coflectorby the association.3 Some prices are obtainedby phone andusuallythe respondmts do not

for checking. Frndy, the datais sentto Houston whereit is tran~erredto computerand subjectedto

both computer and visual checks for outliers. Publicationoccurs approximatelytie and one half

monthstier the originaldataarecollected.

       Consequentlythe sampleof citiesrnckded m eachissueof the Index varies. At the beginning

of our sampleperiod therewere one hundredsixtysix citiesandforty four itemspriced. The number

of cities stea@ rncreasedto two hundredninetysevenm 1992.4; however each report containsa

distinctsanrpleof cities. In an attemptto constructa balancedpane~ we choose a sampleof forty

eightcitieswhich appearedm rou~     ninetypercentof the quarterlysurveys.

       The goods and services sanrpledhowever are much less variable,though there have been

additionsto and subtraction’sfrom the list. For this studywe selected~   one goods and services

(heretier, commodities) with three criteriam mind. First, for each commodity we wanted wide

coverage m terms of availab~    across cities and over time. Second, we wanted variationm the

degreeof tradabilityof the commoditiesrnckded m the data set. Frna&,we wantedhomogeneitym

the detiions   of the commodities over time. Some commodities did however, change duringthe

sample period; typically as a resuk of a change m manticturer packaging, This change was

accountedfor by assigninga missingvtie to the lastquarterpriorto the change.

                                      ILL    Convergence

A Basic Statistics

        Before discussingour regressionresults,it is useti to look at some summarystatisticson the

variabilityof price ~erentials and on mean absokte price Wermtials thatarepresentedin Table I.

In the table we compare the three groups on the basis of these two measuresof the rnterc~ price

Merentials over time. Our benchmarkcity is New Orleans. As a robustnesscheck we have also

consideredusingNew York as thebenchmarkcity; thischangehas littleeffect on the conchsions we

draw.

        Define the (pretax) price difference, Qti,~, as the percentage Mermce         m price of


                                                                    )
commodityk at timet between citiesi andj, ie., Qti,ti= ln(~,k, /Pj,k, . The naturalbenchmarkfor


Qti,viSzero. However, givenimpedimentsto arbitrageof goods and services,the price ~erence at

anyporntm time may ~er      from zero. In models presentedin Engel and Rogers (1994), and Wei

andParsley(1995), prices in two locationsmay ~er     at anyporntm time, but these Merences are


                                              5
bounded due to the cost of wbitragebetweenthe two cities. me width of thisband increaseswith

transportationcosts, which canbe approximatedby distance. ~      impliesthatboth the variabilityof


Qy,ti, and the mean absokte deviatio~ i.e., the mean over time of ln(~,,,,/~,k,,)   , are positively


relatedto transportationcosts betweencities.

       From Table I we see that, of the three groups, perishableshas on average, the highest

vatibility of the inter-cityprice ~erential while services has the highest mean average price

~erentiaL The highervariabilityof petiables price ~erences cotid be due to seasonalvariation

m eitherthe arrivalo~ or demandfor, some of the goods m thisgroup.

       It is use~ to linkthese indicatorsof the maguitudeandvariab@ of price ~erentials with

the costs of arbitrageactivities,which is what we turnto m Table II, The table presentsreds      by

group (i.e., perishables,non-perishables,and services) on the impact of distanceon rnter-c~ price

differentials. Following Engel and Rogers (1994), and Wei and Parsley (1995), we approximate

transportationcosts by distanceas measuredby the “greatercircledistance”betweenthe cities.5 The

resultsin Table ~ overwhelminglympport the implicationof these models thattransportationcosts

permitprice ~erences between cities,andthe&of       such~erences rncreasesW         arbitragecosts,

       From the table, the distance between two cities is positively related to the variabilityof

price Merences for all three categories, with the effect being the strongest among tradables.

The resultsfor mean absolute price differentialsis presented in Panel B. Again, the implication

of the models is strongly supported. We explore a possible non-linearityin this relationshipby

adding a squared di~ance term to these spectications:       the distance effect shows ~erent

convexities for tierent   product groups but the convexity features depend on whether we

examinethe variabilityof or mean absolute price ~erentials.

B. Testing for Stationariwand EstimatingRates of Convergence

        In this section we proceed in two stages. First, we test whether it is possible to reject

the unit root hypothesis, and we ask whether the answervaries systematicallyacross products.

Mer rejecting the unit root we turn to the issue of convergence speed. At this stage the

possibility of measurement error must be considered, which leads us to additional estimations

prior to reporting rates of convergence. For expositional convenience, we discuss each of the

three groups separately.

        In our test, the null hypothesis is a (Mless)   random walk, The alternativehypothesis is

a zero-mean AR(1) process common to all city-pairs. All regressions reported use New Orleans

as the benchmark city, i.e., we examine d~erences in prices in other cities relative to New

Orleans. More precisely, for each commodity (k) the basic regression specificationis:




where Qi,kz is the log-difference in the price of product k in city i relative to New Orleans at

time t, and, A is the fist d~erence operator. The lag structure, s(k), used to account for

possible serialcorrelation in the error te~   is determinedon a product-by-product basis as in a

univariateaugmentedDickey-Fullertest.

       Results of panel unit root tests for the first category (i.e., non-perishables) are

summarizedin Panel A of Table ~.       The table presentsthe tests on a commodity by commodity

basis. Levin and Lin (1992) have shown that panel data can dramaticallyincrease the power of

the unit root test, and that in contrast to univariatecase, the test statisticin a panel context is

asymptoticallynormal. In all cases, the point estimateof ~ is negative. According to Levin and

Lin, the criticalvhes   for t=50 and N=50 (approximatelyour panel size) at the 1Yo, 5% and 10%




                                                7
levelsare-2.38,-1.71, and -1.35. Usrngthese criticalvalues,we rejectthe unitroot for twentytwo

of thetwentysixproducts (or 850A)atthe 10% leve~of whichtwmty arerejectedatthe 5°/0level.

           In Panel B of Table ~,       we examine the (15) perishables, and (10) services.       For

perishables, we can reject the random walk nti at the ten percent level for an overwhelming

majority(80°/0, or twelve) of the commodities. In fact, we can reject it at the 10/0level for ten of

the ~een goods. Even for our fial group of mostly services, we can reject the nti at the 10%

level in half of the cases; it can be rejected at the l% level in four of the fie cases. ~s    implies

that price differences for many of the item that wodd               be called “non-tradable” in an

internationalcontext are disciplinedto not wander away from zero indefitely.

           Thus, the bti    of the evidence rejects the random walk nullhypothesis in favor of a zero-

mean stationaryprocess for all three categories. Does this imply that the distinction between

tradablesand non-tradablesis unimportantwithin a given country? Not necessarily, since so far

we have not addressed the issue of the speed of convergence. Under the assumptionthat the

Qi,kJ process    is a   zero-mean AR(l) process, the rate of convergence is positively related to the

absolute size of the estimated coefficient P.6          In Figure 1, we plot the empirical density

fictions     of the estimatedAR(1) coefficients for the three categories based on the estimatesin

Table III. As can be seen, the estimatedcoefficients for the service items tend to be smallerin

absolute magnitude than both the perishables and the non-perishables groups.              That is, on

average,the deviation from price paritytends to last longer for services.

           Figure 1 approximatelyhere]

       A tiher       way to examine dtierences among the three groups is to focus on the median

convergence rate for each group. That is, for each group, we calculate the implied half-life for

the product whose AR(1) coefficient is the median value in the group.7 The medians are com



                                                   8
flakes (-0.123), tied chicken (-0.157), and beauty salon visit (-0.044), for non-perishables,

perishables,and services, respectively. These coefficient estimatesimply half-lives for deviations

from panty of approximatelyfive quartersfor non-perishables,four quartersfor perishables,and

~een   quartersfor services.8 Thus in fact, the median convergence rate is substantiallylower

for the services category than for eitherof the tradable counterparts. In a broader context, both

tradable categories converge substantiallyfaster than rates estimatedin an internationalcontext

(typically with a half-life of three to tie years, see Frankel and Rose, 1995, for CPI-based real

exchange rates, and Wei and Parsley, 1995, for tradablesector price indices).




C. CiN g ecific effects

       So far, the only alternativeto a random walk null that we have entertainedis a mean-

zero AR(1) process. We may also want to consider non-zero city-~ ecific means. This is to

allow the sale prices of the products to reflect the cost of local non-traded components (e.g.,

extra store security guards in a more crime-prone city). Additionally, we may want to control

for possible seasonal effects. Specifically, we augment the basic specification in Table 111by

allowing city and quarterdummies,i.e.,

                          S(4
        A Q1,@= PQi,ti.l + ~Y. A Qi,ti-l+ Z Ciwand quarter dummies+ &i,@
                           m=l

       The results are reported in Table IV.      We also perform an F-test to see if the city

dummies are jointly significant. It turns out that for about sixty percent of the time, the city

dummies arejointly significantif we use a 10% critical value. As demonstrated by Levin and

Lin (1992), the criticalvalues to reject the unit root null increase dramaticallyin a tied effects

regression relative to a dorm      intercept case, and a comparison of their figures 4 and 9

indicatesthat the power to reject the null also declines. According to their Table V, the critical


                                              9
values at the 10/0,5°A and 10°/0levels for T=50 and N=25 (approximately our panel size afier

allowing for lagged dependent variables) are -8.25, -7.71 and -7.39, respectively. Based on

these criticalvalues, we can reject the unit root null far less frequently than for the case of a

zero-mean AR(1) process as the alternative: 53°/0for perishables, 3 10/0for non-perishables, and

only 10°Afor services. This result echoes that in Frankeland Rose (1995) who, using a panel of

real exchange rates from IMF member countries, also fid it hard to reject the unit root null

when fied effects are allowed.

       In an effort to increasethe power of the @atisticaltests we pooled the data and repeated

the estimation. Appendix Table A4 summarizes our results. In the table we report two

specifications, which dtier only in what dummies are included in the regression. In the first

regressionwe include only city-pair dummies,and in the second regression we include both city-

pair and product dummies. For these regressionsthe criticalvalues in Levin and Lin ( 1992) for

T=50 and N=300 (the largest cross-section dimensionsthey report) are -23.03, and -22,72, for

the 5Yo, and 10% levels respectively. Using these criticalvalues, we can reject the unit root in

regressions with individual spectic intercepts only for perishables. Thus the inclusion of

individualspectic fied effects greatly diminishesour abilityto reject the unit root hypothesis.

Note that for non-perishables and setices,        the point estimates obtained from the pooled

estimationare broadly similarto those reported in Table III, though for perishablesthe estimate

of convergence is somewhat faster.9

       In an internationalcontext various authorshave found results sensitiveto the choice of

benchmark currency (e.g., Frenkel 1981, and Fisher and Park 1991). We repeated the panel

augmentedDickey-Ftier tests using New York as an alternatebenchmark city. Appendix Table




                                             10
A5 summarizesthese re~ts.     Our abilityto reject the nullis virtuallyunaffected by the choice of

benchmarkcity. Thus in what follows we use the New Orleansbenchmarkexclusively.




D. Tax adjustment

       As noted in Caves, Frankel and Jones (1995), tafis                   and transportation costs create a

band within which the real exchange rate can fluctuate. Moreover, time variation in taxes or

transportationcosts suggests the band itself would W.                  There is little guidance in the literature

however, concerning whether PPP should hold on a pre-tax, or tax adjusted basis. One might

conjecture that consumers care about post-tax prices while producers respond to pre-tax prices.

That is, a Sufficientlylarge post-sales tax price tierential between two cities would induce

consumers to arbitragethe difference. Alternativelyif pre-sales tax prices between two cities

diverge too fm, producers would respond and arbitragethis Werence.

       Define ~.,~J be the tax adjusted price difference for product k at time t between city i


                                      8,k,f(1   + ‘i,k,r)
and New Orleans, i.e.,   &,k,,= log                         >   where t is the tax rate and j = New Orleans
                                      ‘j,k,t(l+ ‘j,k,t
                                                     )



Also, detie   Z,,k, to be either Qi,k,,, or ~.,k,t,depending on which one is smaller in absolute


value. Thus Zik, is the minimumprice difference at each point in time.

       In Tables V and VI, we repeat the tests for these (minimum) price d~erences.                       Since

sales taxes generallydo not apply to the services in our study, we restrictthe discussion to the

two tradable~oups. From the tables we see thatboth the estimates,and our abilityto reject the

null hypothesis, are virtuallyunaffected. What these tables suggest is that explicit sales taxes

have a minimalinfluence on the time series properties of deviations from price parity. Thus, in

the remaininganalysiswe focus on the non-tax adjustedprice ~erentials.

E. MeasurementErrors

        The convergence rates reported earlier assume no measurement error in the data. H,

however, the price data are collected tith measurementerror, the estimates could be affected.

To see this, suppose the true process is given by:

(2)     Q:=    M;-f   + s, ,


where Q;, the true price, is unobsewable. We actuallyobserve Q, = Q: + u,, where u, is a zero-

mean, serially uncorrelated measurement error.         This implies that Q, = ~,.l   + E,+ u, - flu,_,,

which is almost an ARMA( 1,1) process.

        We attempt to gauge the impact of the possible measurement errors using two

approaches:     (1) a restricted ARMA(l, 1) specification, and (2), an instrumental variable

approach. In both approaches, we reduce the dimensionalityof the problem by choosing the

three products which bracket the median from each of the three categorieslO. We also restrict

our sampleto the ten cities (in additionto New Orleans)with the fewest missing observations 1.

        me fist column of Table ~        reportsa simple~   1) estimation. In the second cob,      we

estimatean X          1,1), in which the moving averagecoefficientis restrictedto be the minusthe

autoregressivecoefficient (8 = –~). This restrictionapproximatesthatimphedby the assumptionof


an ii.d. measuremmt error. As one can see, the autoregressivecoefficients m the restricted

-1,1)         are tiost        always larger than those m the straightAR(l) regressions, Hence a

straightfonvard~       1) regressio~ ignofig     possille measurement enor, exaggerates rates of

convergence. Cok          3 of Table VII presentsthe resultsof unrestrictedARMA( 1,1) re~essions.

Comparing unrestrictedand restricted ARMA( 1,1) regressions, the coefficient restrictions are

rejectedm allcases.12




                                                 12
        Our second method of accounting for pos.si~lemeasurement errors is to employ an

instrumental
           variableapproach. Specifically,we use Q,_j as an instrumentfor Q,.l. According to

our assumption%Qt_J is clearlycorrelatedwith Ql_l, yet uncorrelatedwith the error terms m the

basic ml)     regressions. The IV-estimationreds      are reported as the last coti     of Table VII.

There are two noteworthy featuresfrom this COW.              First,the coefficient estimateson Q,_l are

higher tian the corresponding ~1)        estimates,imp~g         that the rates of convergence for all

products are somewhat slower tier accounting for possible measurementerrors. And second,

consistentwith our earlierresuks,tradablegoods gener@ converge to the law of one price tister

thansefices. Usingthe lV estimatesm Coti          4, the halflivesfor the medianproductsbecome 4.5

for non-perishables(corn flakes), 3.5 quartersfor perishables(fried chicken), and 10.5 for services

(Beautysalonvisit). These halflives correspondvery closelyto those reported earlier(5,4, and 15,

respectively),suggestingour estimatesderived from augmentedDickey-Fder spectications also

approtitely    addressthe measurementerrorsissue.




F. Non-linearitiesm the rateof convergace

       We ti     to how whetherconvergmce is non-linearm the initialprice ~ermce,          as foundby

e.g., Wei andParsley( 1995). Inparticti, convergencemay occur fister if the initialprice ~erence

is wider. For ease of expositio~ we pool the data,and reportreds         for each of our threegroups.

To examineformallywhetherthereis a non-linearpatternm the rate of convergmce, we add a term

of the initialdeviationsquaredto the regressio~ and add product dummies. To be precise, the

specticationfor each group is,

                                         16

(3)    AQu,kt = Po Qv,kt.l + Y Q;,k,t-1 + ~~m   AQv,kt-m +   dummies+ Sti,k, .
                                         m=l




                                                13
The quarterlydecay rate now becomes:         ~, + 2y Qti,h,,.l. The estimationresultsare reported in


Table~.       Inthetablewe reportfour specificationsdependingon the structureof lagged dependent

variablesand additionalfixed effects. As k clear from the table, the conclusion does not depend

cruciallyon the spectication. In particular,the squaredprice Wermce is statisticallysigni6cantfor

allthreeproduct/servicecategories,andfor virtuallyal specifications.Thus,thereis strongevidence

thatthe rateof convergmce dependson theinitialprice Werentm i.e., convergenceoccurs fasterfor

largerprice ~erences.

        Reds     m Table ~ imply that distanceis a fictor m explainingrnter-cityprice ~erential

variabilhy,i.e., price Werentials are more variablefor citiestier         apati. We now ask whetheran

effect efis   on ratesof convergence. In Table IX we augmentthe basic spetication (equation 1)

with two more terms. The fist is log distanceand the second is an interactionterm between log

distanceandthe initialprice difFerent~


(4)   A Qti,ti= Oh(distance)   + flo QV,M.,+ y QU,ti.,ln(distance) + ~fl.    A Qv,@-m+dummies + Eti,ti.

        Redts in thetableprovide evidencethatconvergenceratesareslower for citiesfirtherapart.

The impliedhalf Me now depmds on the distancebetween the citiesm question and on the initial

price ~erence.    An approximationcan be obtainedhowever by usingthe averagedistancebetween

citieswithinthe UnitedStates(856 milesusingNew Orleansasthebenchmarkcity) andthe estimates

obtained from Tables III. Using the reds        m Coh.unn4, the (approximate) half lives for non-

perishables,perishables,andsetices are6,3, and 14 quarters.13

        We are now in a position to ask how the convergence rates estimated in this paper

compare to existing estimates obtained from cross-country data. That is, our lower estimated

convergence rates may simply reflect the fact that cities within the United States are closer to

one another than “typical” internationalcity pairs. Indeed, the average distance between the


                                                14
OECD samplein Wei and Parsley(1995) is 3285 ties (using the United States as a benchmark)

as compared to 856 miles for this sample. According to the estimatesin Column 4 of Table IX,

if distance were the only factor ~erentiating cities within the United States and OECD cities,

the average half lives among OECD countries wotid be (approximately) four to seven quarters

for tradables, However, estimatesm Wei and Parsley(1995) for tradablesector price indices are

closer to four years!14 Simibirly,if distancewere tie only fictor, thenprice Wermces for services

thatwotid be clastied “non-tradable”rntemationally,
                                                  would have a half Me of about 18 quarters,

Thus we conckde that distanceexplainsonly a smrdlpart of the Mermce between domestic md

rntemationalestimatesof convergence.




                                       Iv.   Conclusion

       To summarize,there are a few noteworthy observations. First,tradablegoods (perishable

andnon-petiable categories)converge very fist to price parity. The hti life of the price gap for

tradablegoods is roughlyfour to tie quarters(fied chickenand com fikes), and~een quartersfor

services(beauty salonvisit). Convergencerates for both tradablecategories@tiables      and non-

perishables)aremuchfister thanthose found m crosscountry data; rndeed,the convergace ratefor

our leasttradablecategoryis on par with convergenceratesfound m studiesexaminingrntemational

tradablegoods. These conclusionsarenot tiected by the presenceof tax ~erentials or by possiile

measurementerrorsin the data. Addition@, we presentevidmce of non-linearitiesm the rate of

convergence. Inparticti,   convergmce occurs fasterfor largerinitialprice ~erences, andfir away

locations exhi%itslower convergence. However using these estimateswe find that transportcosts

accountfor only a smallportion of the muchslower convergenceratesfound m cros+count~ data.

      Earlier studies examiting disaggregated prices include Richardson (1978), who finds that Canadian and United
      States prices are only weakly relate~ and Rogers and Jenkins (1994), who are able to reject the unit root null in
      fewer than one-sixth of the 54 disaggregated products they study. While these findings are discouraging, there
      is reason to suspect the failures are due to the notoriously low power of common unit root tests. Recent work by
      Levin and Lin (1992) demonstrates that statistical power increases rapidly in a panel setting.
3.
      According to phone conversations with the person now in charge of final data checking for ACCRA, the
      reported prices were obtained as an average over a small number of sellers in the city (generally >3, and, since
      1982, >5 & <10 sellers), on the Thurs&y, Friday, or Saturday of the first week of each quarter.

6.
      The interpretation that follows is complicated by the possible presence of measurement errors. We return to
      this issue in more detail below. For now, we assume there is no measurement error in order to obtain a
      suggestive characterization of convergence rates across groups.
7.
      In the case of two medians, we pick the one with a smaller coefficient in absolute value
8
      The implied half-life = ln(O.5)/in@)
9.
      On the other hand, the assumption the AR(1) coefficient is the same across products within a group, which we
      impose here, can also be rejected.
10.
      That is, in the case of a single median, we choose the median, and one product above and below the median, in terms
      of their rate of convergence as in Table 3. When there are two medians, we choose the pr~ct with the next smallest
      mfficient estimate in ~lute due as the third product,
11.
      Missing values wre interpolated these the average of the values just prior and following the missing observations.
      Some experiments with other interpolation methods, e.g, by choosing the value just prior to the missing observation,
      did not ti~ our conclwions. S= Table VII for a list of the ten cities included in the estimations.
12.
      Let L. and L, be the log likelihood values for the unrestricted and restricted ARMA regressions, respectively.
      Then, 2(LU-L,]has a X2distribution with a degree of freedom of N- 1, where N is the number of observations,
      The five percent critical value is approximately 101.9 for dl products,
13.
      The half life was calculated as ln(O.5)/ (ln(l – P) + y ln(distance)) . Thisapproximation
                                                                                              alsoignoresa
      possible drift term in the time series representation of the price differential, The approximation yields an
      estimate of the rate of convergence that is slightly slower than the true one when the drift term is small,
14.
      The estimates in Wei and Parsley (95) are in line with other cross-country evidence. See, e.g., Frankel (86),
      Edison (87), who obtain estimates using extremely long time-series, or more recently, Frankel and Rose (95),
      The estimates in Pawll (95) imply even slower convergence,
