                                            ABSTRACT

We study the tendency to connect to the Internet, and the online and offline shopping behavior of
connected persons, to draw inferences about whether the Internet is a substitute or a complement for
cities. We document that larger markets have more locally-targeted online content and that
individuals are more likely to connect in markets with more local online content, suggesting the
Internet is a complement to cities. Yet, holding local online content constant, people are less likely
to connect in larger markets, indicating that the Internet is also a substitute for cities. We also find
that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: notwithstanding a large digital divide, blacks
are more likely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of local
population, making the Internet a substitute for agglomeration of preference minorities within cities.
Finally, using online and offline spending data, we find that connected persons spend more on books
and clothing online, relative to their offline spending, if they are farther from offline stores. This
indicates that the Internet functions as a substitute for proximity to retail outlets.

        Traditionally, markets for news and information as well as some retail goods have been

predominantly local. As a result, consumers’ welfare has been limited by the size of their local

market, and agglomeration of persons sharing similar preferences has improved their welfare by

facilitating the provision of products they want. 1 By agglomerating persons around the country –

indeed, around the world – into a single market, the Internet offers the potential to radically alter

consumption possibilities. In particular, the Internet may serve as a substitute for urban

agglomeration by leveling the consumption playing field between large, variety- laden and small,

variety-starved markets. But this is not necessary. Leveling the field requires that content on the

Internet be similarly attractive to persons in large and small markets. If the Interne t offers local, as

well as general, information, then its role as a substitute for agglomeration will be undermined.

Indeed, if local online content is sufficiently attractive – and if it is more prevalent in larger

markets – then the Internet may be a complement for urban agglomeration. 2

        In this paper we use information on how Internet connection tendencies, and connected

persons’ online and offline retail spending, are related to the attractiveness of their online and

offline options to draw inferences about whether the Internet serves as a substitute or a complement

for urban agglomeration. First, we examine the relationship between market size and available

locally-targeted online content. To this end we characterize the nature of available content using

Media Metrix data on 16.5 million web page visits by about 32,000 households in 326

Metropolitan Statistical Areas [MSAs] in August 2000. We document that substantially more

1
  We are aware of other arguments for agglomeration besides consumption. Henderson (1974) presents a model in
which city size balances production benefits against congestion costs. See, for example, Ciccone and Hall (1996) or
Rosenthal and Strange (forthcoming) for recent empirical evidence on the production benefits of agglomeration as well
as additional references. There is little research on consumption benefits of agglomeration. Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz
(2001) is an exception.
2
  We are not the only authors to pose this question. See Kolko (1999), as well as Gaspar and Glaeser (1998), who find
that telephones complement agglomeration because phone conversation complements face-to-face (two-way)
communication. Our focus in this paper is on one-way communication over the web rather than two-way
communication, but our question is similar. Finally, Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2003) examine a related
question, the effect of urban location on diffusion of Internet technologies.


                                                          1
online local content is available in larger markets, suggesting that Internet use may complement

urban agglomeration.

        We then examine how the tendency to connect to the Internet varies with metro area

population – a proxy for available product variety – and locally targeted online content.

Combining the Current Population Survey’s August 2000 Computer and Internet Use module with

our Media Metrix-derived data on local online content and Census data on local market size (as a

proxy for offline product variety), we document that local online content attracts people to connect.

When we separately account for both local online content and our measure of local offline variety

(population), we find statistically significant direct evidence of both complementarity and

substitutability. Individuals are more likely to connect in markets with more local online content,

and holding local online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. On balance

we find that these effects offset each other so that the Internet neither promotes nor discourages

agglomeration in larger markets.

        Second, we shed light on the Internet’s substitution for offline variety by examining the

relationship between the tendency to connect and individuals’ local isolation from persons sharing

their preferences. The problem of dissatisfaction with offline options can be particularly acute for

persons either isolated from products generally or with preferences unlike their neighbors’. It is

clear from existing research that blacks and whites have sharply different preference in media

products. As a result, the local availability of products that blacks value may have been limited not

simply by the absolute size of their local markets, but also by the size of the local community

sharing their preferences. 3     If isolated blacks are more likely than blacks living among large


3
 For example, larger markets have more and better local newspapers (George and Waldfogel, 2003), radio broadcasts
(Waldfogel, forthcoming), and television stations (Waldfogel, 2001). These studies document that black and white
consumers’ welfare, in their capacity as media consumers, increase in the size of their own respective group
populations.


                                                        2
concentrations of blacks to connect to the Internet, then we can infer not only that the Internet is a

substitute for cities but also that it is a substitute for “product ghettoes,” or groups of people within

a market sharing in common their locally atypical product preferences. Again using the CPS data,

we find that blacks are more likely to connect, relative to whites, as blacks have smaller local

population, suggesting that the Internet is a substitute for “product ghettoes.”

        Finally, we examine effects of isolation measured by distance to retail establishments

among a sample of Internet-connected respondents to the Wharton Virtual Test Market (WVTM)

survey. Using 1997 Economic Census data on the location and size of book, music, and clothing

stores, matched by zip code to data on WVTM respondents’ online, catalog, and offline spending in

each of those categories, we document that people buy more books and clothing online or via

catalogs, relative to their offline expenditure in local stores, as they live farther from their nearest

book and clothing store, respectively. This evidence shows that, at least in some categories,

consumers use the Internet as a substitute for proximity to retail stores.

        Friedman (1962) has argued that each person gets what she wants through market

allocation, so that markets avoid the tyranny of the majority endemic to collective choice.

Friedman’s argument holds literally only when production can take place at arbitrarily small scale,

so that available product variety does not depend on the size, or the preference composition of

potential customers in the market. When fixed costs are sizable, the number of available products,

and the resultant welfare of consumers in local markets can depend on the size and composition of

the local market. By agglomerating consumers into larger markets, the Internet allows locally

isolated persons to benefit from the product variety made available for consumers elsewhere. By

increasing the size of markets relative to fixed costs, the Internet may therefore bring market




                                                    3
allocation nearer to the ideal in which an individual’s welfare does not depend on either the number

of her neighbors or their product preferences.

         The paper proceeds in six sections. Section 1 reviews available evidence on product variety

and market size and characterizes the decision to use the Internet, as a function of one’s preference

type and the quality of local options. Section 2 describes the Current Population Survey (CPS),

Media Metrix (MM), WVTM, and Economic Census data used in this study. Section 3 employs

the MM data to quantify local content on the Internet and, in particular, to characterize how the

availability of local content varies with market size. Section 4 employs the CPS data to

characterize the demand for Internet connection. Section 5 examines how the balance of online and

offline retail spending varies with connected consumers’ distance to retail establishments. A brief

conclusion follows.



         I.       How Does the Internet Function as a Substitute or Complement for Cities?

         1. The Internet as a Substitute for Cities

         When production entails fixed costs and preferences differ across individuals, the number

of differentiated product options available locally will increase in the size of the market. 4 Larger

markets have more local product variety than small markets, and this greater variety draws a higher

fraction of persons to consumption of local offline products. In this way persons benefit each other

through what has elsewhere been termed a “preference externality” (Waldfogel, forthcoming).

         By aggregating people in disparate locations into a single market, the Internet has the

capacity to increase market size relative to fixed costs. 5 This can, in turn, raise the number of


4
  This is an example of what Spence (1976a,b) terms the “product selection problem.” See also Dixit and Stiglitz
(1977).
5
  Computer technology may also reduce the absolute size of at least the exogenous component of the fixed and sunk
costs of operating a busines s. Given the large advertising expenditures of web retailers such as Amazon.com, it is not


                                                           4
available products and reduce the dependence of consumption options on the number and mix of

consumers in one’s local market. That is, consumers in small offline markets can instead turn to

the Internet for products unavailable offline locally. What sorts of sites make the Internet a

substitute for cities? Retail sites provide one clear possibility: a person who has no store nearby

can instead buy online. We also have in mind sites that offer content that is not geographically

specific but which may have greater appeal in smaller markets with less offline product variety.

For example, Spinner.com offers 140 channels of streaming music programming, over twice the

number of radio stations available in any of the largest US markets. Spinner.com may appeal to

listeners in both large and small markets but is presumably provides more of a benefit to listeners

in small markets with few traditional radio stations. News sites, such as CNN.com or

MSNBC.com, present domestic and international news of interest to individuals in cities of all

sizes. But because small markets tend to have slender local newspapers, people who live in them

may place a higher value on the availability of news on the Internet.



        2. The Internet as a Substitute for Product Ghettoes

        The paucity of offline product variety is not determined solely by the total population in an

area. To the extent that preferences differ across types of individuals, the number of like-minded

persons in a local area will determine the size of the offline market and the amount of locally

available offline products that would appeal to those people. Since the distribution of types differs

across geographic markets, we expect persons to be more likely to connect to the Internet to satisfy

their locally unfulfilled tastes when they are “preference minorities,” that is, part of a group with

distinct preferences that makes up a small number of the local population. For example, it is well


clear whether web businesses have lower fixed costs than bricks and mortar businesses, when endogenous fixed costs
are taken into account. See Sutton (1991) for extensive discussion of endogenous fixed costs.


                                                         5
documented that blacks and whites have sharply different preferences in some categories of

products. In particular, the radio programming formats attracting two thirds of black listening

collectively attract less than 2 percent of nonblack listening. In major cities with both tabloid and

non-tabloid newspaper options, the tabloid attracts about three quarters of black readers, compared

with about a third of nonblack readers.



        3. The Internet as a Complement for Cities

        In addition to providing universal content that appeals to individuals in any size market, the

Internet may also be a local medium. The Internet can provide information that helps people to

navigate cities, and may deliver other goods and services that improve city life. For example, city

portals, such as boston.citysearch.com, provide information about events, restaurants, and movie

listings. Match- making sites, such as boston.matchmaker.com, help users in large cities meet each

other. And sites associated with local newspapers or television stations provide another

distribution channel for local news. If there are fixed costs associated with producing such content,

then the number and variety of local sites may increase in the size of the local market, making the

Internet more useful to people in larger markets and mitigating the Internet’s role as a substitute for

local offline product variety.

        Just as Internet access can complement cities generally, web retailers can complement

proximity to offline retailers. Many web retailers, such as gap.com, allow items purchased online

to be returned or exchanged at their offline stores. 6




6
  According to the Gap: “All online merchandise can be returned to any U.S. Gap store or by mail. Make sure to choose
the "gift receipt" option at checkout if you're sending the gift directly to the recipient.” (according to
http://www.gap.com/asp/home_gap.html?wdid=0, accessed September 17, 2003).


                                                         6
        These considerations motivate the four questions that this study addresses. How much web

content is local? Is there more local online content in larger markets? How does the tendency to

connect – and uses of the Internet – vary with one’s local offline and online options?



        II. Data

        Data for this study are drawn from four sources, the August 2000 Current Population

Survey Computer and Internet Use Supplement, an August 2000 Media Metrix data extract, the

Wharton Virtual Test Market (WVTM), and the 1997 Economic Census. The CPS supplement has

information on Internet connection, as well as demographic and geographic information, for

roughly 50,000 households in August 2000. We reduce our sample to 29,027 by restricting our

attention to those households that live in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that can be matched

to MSAs in our Media Metrix data set.

        The first column of Table 1 reports sample characteristics. Because we are interested in

factors that may affect the likelihood of a household using the Internet, we first define a household

as Internet connected if the household reports Internet access from home. Almost 44 percent of the

households in our sample have such connections. Just over half the sample has one or more

computers at home. Of the household heads in the sample, more than 13 percent are black, and 30

percent are at least college-educated.

        The household heads in the portion of the sample that is Internet-connected is

disproportionately white and is more highly educated than the population as a whole. 7 Only about

7 percent of the connected sample is black-headed, and approximately 45 percent of the households




7
 These results are consistent with evidence elsewhere on the digital divide. See
http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fttn99/contents.html .


                                                           7
are headed by a college-educated person. Naturally, nearly all of the connected sample of

households has a home computer.

         Our second data source follows the Internet usage behavior of a panel of households.

Media Metrix collects data on all web page visits by a representative sample of households in 326

MSAs by placing recording software on panelists’ computers. In our extract, which covers August

2000, each visit to a web page, or page “hit,” by a household is a separate record – with 16.5

million page visits in total during the month. 8 Media Metrix appends basic information about their

Internet-connected panelists, such as MSA, income category, educational attainment, and race, to

their data on web surfing. The third column of table 1 reports the education distribution for the

Media Metrix sample, and it is similar to the CPS sample of households with Internet connections

at home (in column 2). The Media Metrix sample is a little more highly educated than the CPS

sample, but that result is generated in part by our applying the highest level of educational

attainment of any member in the household to the whole ho usehold.

         In addition, for each site visit, we observe the URL, or “address” of the web page, which

Media Metrix classifies into one of 27 categories. 9 The first column of table 2 reports the

distribution across these categories of page hits and numbers of visited sites. 10 The category with

the most hits is portals, with 21.9 percent of the total hits, followed by services (15.9),

entertainment (12.5), adult content (8.0), retail (5.4) and auctions (4.3). Business-to-business sites

have the fewest hits by our sample of residential households with only 0.1 percent of the total.

Turning to the number of unique sites visited in each category, reported in column 3, “adult

8
  A “site,” in our extract, is typically a three-level name, such as www.aol.com. The data contain other sites at America
On-line (AOL), such as members.aol.com, as separate “sites,” even though they are in the same “domain.”
9
  The Media Metrix categories are: Auctions, Automotive, Business/Finance, Careers, Community, Corporate
Presence, Directories/Resources, Education, Entertainment, Government, Health, Hobbies, Lifestyle,
News/Information, Portals, Real Estate, Regional/Local, Retail, Search/Navigation, Sports, Technology, Travel,
Services, Adult Content, Business to Business, All Other, and Religion.
10
   In order to be included in the total hits or sites calculations, a site must be estimated to have received at least 5,000
hits during the month.


                                                             8
content” has the largest share of sites with 23.0 percent of the 22,432 total sites the Media Metrix

panelists visited. However, the portals category, which received a large portion of the total number

of page hits, comprises a very small fraction of the sites in the sample, just 1.0 percent. This pattern

indicates that there is more concentration in the portals, with a few sites each receiving a large

amount of traffic. We return to the latter part of table 2, on local sites, later in the paper.

        The third data source is the WVTM, which is an internet-based survey of more than 20,000

Internet users. For this project, we used data from the third and fourth waves, which were collected

during 1999 and 2000, respectively. The WVTM is designed to be representative, but is not

random. Survey participants were recruited by banner advertisements. The ad placements were

targeted to recruit a demographically representative population. This survey is well suited for our

purposes since it breaks down how much money the respondent spent over the last two months via

Internet sites, catalogs, and physical stores on books, music, and clothing. The WVTM also

records the respondent’s zip code, which enables us to match the spending data to geographical

characteristics. In addition, the survey records a host of demographic information, including

gender, race, income, and education. The fourth column of table 1 shows demographic

characteristics of the individuals in the WVTM sample. The education and race distributions are at

least broadly similar across connected samples.

        The fourth and final data source in the study is the 1997 Economic Census, one wave of a

census of business establishments that is collected every five years by the Bureau of Census. For

1997, the Census department surveyed more than 5 million establishments with employees and

collected administrative data on 15.5 million additional small establishments. For each

establishment, which is a physical location providing a service or making or distributing goods,

Census recorded its location, industry, dollar volume of sales, number of employees, and payroll.




                                                     9
For each line of business (NAICS code) and zipcode, the Census reports the number of stores in

each of the following size classes, by thousands of dollars of annual retail sales: 0-100, 100-200,

200-500, 500-1000, and over 1 million. In this study we are interested in books (NAICS code

451211), music (NAICS code 45122), and clothing stores (NAICS code 4481). 11 Matching the

zipcodes of the WVTM respondents to the zipcode distribution of stores, we can calculate the

numbers of book, music, and clothing stores within any distance for each individual in the

sample. 12 Table 3 describes some of these data. For example, the first entry in the first column

indicates that persons in the sample have an average of 1.37 bookstores within a one- mile radius.

If we restrict attention to large bookstores (with over $1 million in annual sales), the number is 0.47

bookstores. Music stores are slightly less proximate than bookstores – an average person has 1

within a mile, while clothing stores are much mo re dense: the average is nearly 10 within a mile.




         III.     How Much Content is Local?

         To determine whether the Internet is a complement to cities, we need to measure the

amount of local content targeted at each metropolitan area. As our metric, we count the number of

sites that produce content that appeals primarily to one particular market. Unfortunately, there

exists no comprehensive list of sites by locale from which one could characterize local content. 13

Indeed, one cannot determine the localness of a site’s targeting from the registration location of a

site, or where the parent company’s headquarters are located, since the site’s visitors could be from

anywhere.

11
   We experimented with alternate definitions: including department stores, superstores, and electronics stores in music,
and including department and superstores with clothing. In all cases, results were very similar to those reported.
12
   Distance is measured between the centroids of the two zip codes.
13
   Kolko (1999) uses the list of registered domain names and shows higher “domain density” in larger markets, which
is at least suggestive that web content is complementary with cities. Domain registration indicates the geographic
location of the registrant, not the site users, however.


                                                           10
         Fortunately, we can use the Media Metrix data to measure the geographic focus of a site.

By recognizing that a locally targeted site must have a primarily local audience, we can use the

geographic origin of a site’s visitors as reported in the Media Metrix data to estimate the extent of

its local focus and which market it primarily serves. In essence, after calculating every site’s share

of each market’s total page hits, we presume that a site that has a sufficiently high proportion of its

total market shares across all markets coming from just one market must be providing content of

local interest to that market.

         To make this more concrete, we compute each site’s index of “site localness” as

          p ij HH j 
1    ∑j  ( p HH ) , where pij is page visits to site i from MSA j and HHj is the number of
          ∑ j ij   j
                      

households in MSA j. This formula is essentially an inverse HHI scaled to reflect the fact that

population varies across MSAs. If we did not normalize by each MSA’s total households, sites

would appear to be targeted towards larger MSAs even if they truly were equally appealing to any

individual in any part of the country. When all visitors are from a single MSA, the index is 1. If a

site has equal average hits per household in two MSAs, the index is 2. The larger the index, the

less local a site. A perfectly geographically neutral site’s index equals the number of MSAs in the

sample. We define a site as local if it has a “localness index” of two or less, and we attribute the

site to the locale that contributes the site’s largest market share. 14

         Because our measure of localness depends on the composition of a site’s audience, our

accuracy in classifying sites as local diminishes for sites with very few visits from the Media

Metrix panel during the month. To counteract that problem, we require that sites exhibit a


14
   The most obvious type of local site that we misclassify as not local are sites which contain local information for a
number of locales. Since we require that a site be targeted to one locale to be defined as local, these sites do not
qualify. However, we suspect the narrowly targeted sites are a reasonable proxy for the localness patterns we would
find if we used a more broad definition.


                                                           11
minimum level of interest, as measured by page hits, in the MSA that they target in order to be

considered local to that market. Since Media Metrix does not sample proportionally to market

population, we estimate the actual number of hits by multiplying the number of hits per household

in Media Metrix by the number of connected households in the MSA, as calculated from the CPS.

A cutoff of 5,000 hits is applied to the resulting estimate. This way, even if one city has fewer

households than another in the Media Metrix panel, our threshold maintains the same economic

importance across locations. We also exclude MSAs with fewer than 20 Media Metrix households

from these calculations in order to reduce the error in measuring hits per household. That leaves us

with 113 MSAs that we are able to match to the CPS data.

           When we look at the sites with the largest and smallest adjusted localness indices across

Media Metrix categories, the index produces reasonable results. The least local sites have localness

indices over 20 and include such familiar sites as CBS.com (entertainment), microsoft.com

(corporate presence), ebay.com (auctions), autobytel.com (automotive), theglobe.com

(communities), SSA.gov (government), MSNBC.com (news/information), netscape.com (portals),

buy.com (retail), jobsonline.com (careers), google.com (search/navigation), and

SmarterLiving.com (travel). 15

           The most local sites have localness indices close to one and tend to refer to locales in their

URL. For example, siliconalleyjobs.com (careers), state.de.us (government), ncweb.com

(communities), baltimoresun.com (news/information), sanantonio360.com (portal), corealty.com

(real estate), searchchicago.com (regional/local), and uscfootball (sports) all have localness indices

equal to one meaning that all their hits came from one MSA. Many other local sites are associated

with local newspapers or television stations.

     We have suppressed the “www” site name prefix for clarity.

         Columns (5)-(10) of table 2 show the distributions of hits to local sites, and local sites

themselves, across Media Metrix categories. On average, 5.3 percent of all hits are to the 7,273

sites that we deem local. In column 7, more than a third of the hits to sites in the education and

regional/local categories are deemed local. Nearly half of the news/information sites are local, as

reported in the last column, though they account for just 15 percent of the category’s hits. Auctions

has the lowest share of its hits considered to be local, followed by portals. Travel and automotive

have the lowest rate of its sites being local.

         The average number of local sites per MSA, reported in table 4, follows the same general

pattern. There is an average of 64 local sites in each MSA, with a maximum of 841 local sites in

the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA CMSA. The largest individual

categories are Adult Content and Entertainment.

         We finish our description of the local site data by asking how the amount of local content

varies with the size of the local market. If there are fixed costs of providing a local online site, then

the quantity of local online content will increase in the size of the local connected market. And, in

turn, the heightened content availability in larger markets will reinforce the Internet as a

complement for cities. In traditional media, as we have mentioned above, larger markets have

more local content (more radio stations, more and better local newspapers, more television

stations). Are there similarly more local online sites in larger markets? 16

         Table 5 reports regressions of MSA local online content, overall and by the larger

categories, on total MSA population. An additional million residents in an MSA adds 48 total local

sites. The relationship between MSA population and the number of local sites is positive and

significant for all of the larger Media Metrix categories. That larger markets have more Internet

   The empirical question addressed in this section mirrors the question of the entry literature: how does the number of
firms (or products) vary with market size. See Bresnahan and Reiss (1991), for example.


                                                           13
content indicates that the Internet is not simply a leveler of utility across geography and, indeed,

may be a city complement. As in local media, the extent of online content increases in the size of

the market.



         IV.      The Demand for Internet Connection

         This section examines how the tendency to connect to the Internet varies with measures of

the extent of local online and offline options. 17 Our basic measures of the extent of offline options

are total local population, which is presumed to increase the variety of goods and services

available. In our second approach, a resident’s relevant product variety is determined by the size of

the market of people who share her preferences. In our estimation, we will measure that market

with the population – and population share – of one’s group, where the groups are blacks and

nonblacks.

         Our measure of local online product variety is the number of local sites. Although table 5

shows that the Internet provides more local content in bigger places, it does not say whether the

Internet actually enhances city life. For that to be true, people must want local content. There is

ample evidence in traditional local media that the greater variety brought forth in larger markets

attracts a higher fraction of the population to consumption. The radio listening, television viewing,

and newspaper reading shares are higher in larger markets. The greater quality and variety of

options in traditional media provide a reason why persons’ welfare, in their capacity as media

consumers, may be higher in larger markets. What about Internet use? Does the greater variety of




17
   One might in principle study demand for Internet connection as a function of price or availability of ISPs.
Greenstein (1999) indicates that by 1998 Internet access is widely available in all MSAs. The price of Internet access
also varies little across MSAs. A regression of the 1998 CPS measure of monthly ISP costs (hesiu9) on 1990 MSA
population gives a constant of $17.46 (s.e.=$0.21) and a population coefficient indicating that the price paid for access
increases by $0.043 ($0.018) per million of additional population.


                                                           14
online options targeted at big-city consumers attract a higher fraction of them to the Internet? If so,

then the Internet functions as a city complement.



           1. Internet Connection and the Extent of Local Offline and Online Options

           We examine how the tendency to connect is affected by local offline variety by using the

CPS data to estimate probits of an individual having a home Internet connection as a function of

MSA population or its log:

           Ci = α + β ⋅ POPm + δ ⋅ X i + ε im                                                             (1)

The left- hand-side variable, C, takes the value of one if household i has an Internet connection at

home. Our basic measure of local offline product availability, MSA population, is denoted by POP

and varies only at the MSA level, m. In some specifications, we add a large set of household level

demographic controls, Xi, including race of head, gender, household head education and age

dummies, and the number of children in the household. In those specifications, the estimated

coefficient on POP will measure the effect of offline variety in the local market on households’

decisions to connect to the Internet even after accounting for their own characteristics.

           The first and fifth columns of table 6, which include only population or its log as a measure

of market size, show that overall the probability of connecting to the Internet does not vary with

market size. The point estimate in the level specification (5) is slightly negative but

indistinguishable from zero, and the log estimate is positive and insignificant. 18 By itself the

absence of a relationship between market size and connection indicates that substitution and

complementarity effects of the Internet are either nonexistent or offsetting. Supplementing these




18
     The standard errors in all of these and subsequent regressions are adjusted for clustering by MSA.


                                                            15
specifications with individual- level controls for education, age, and presence of children in

columns (3) and (7) has little substantive effect. The market size coefficients remain insignificant.

       We distinguish the substitute and complement effects by adding a measure of the number of

local online options. Columns (2) and (6) add the total number of local sites (LOCALm ) (or its log)

in the MSA to the specifications in columns (1) and (5), resulting in the following equation:

        Ci = α + β ⋅ POPm + γ ⋅ LOCALm + δ ⋅ X i + ε im                                              (2)

In this regression, β measures the sensitivity of connection to offline options (as measured by

market size), and γ reflects the sensitivity of connection to local online content. In the log

specification without controls (column 2) the coefficient on local population is negative and

significant, and the coefficient on local sites is positive and significant. Results in levels are

similar, although less significant. Finally, columns (4) and (8) include controls and show the same

pattern (negative coefficient on market size, positive coefficient on local sites) but are not

statistically significant in conventional two-sided tests. While statistical significance levels are not

high, the results suggest that local content attracts households to connect to the Internet but that

households in larger markets are otherwise less likely to connect.

       The patterns of results in table 6 are noteworthy. First, the absence of a relationship

between connection tendency and market size stands in clear contrast to the city-complementing

relationships documented for traditional local media (radio, television, and daily newspapers).

Second, when both market size and local sites are included in the estimation, there is some

evidence that the lack of overall effect is due to distinct and offsetting substitute and complement

effects of the Internet on agglomeration. The results at least suggest that local content, which is

more plentiful in larger markets, attracts people to the Internet. Holding constant the amount of

local online content, people are less likely to connect as their local offline options, proxied by



                                                   16
population, are more appealing. The Internet functions as both as a substitute and a complement

for cities.



        2. Internet Connection and Racial Isolation

        While the Internet does not function, on balance, as a substitute for cities generally, it may

still allow locally isolated households to surmount the limitations of their local offline markets. To

put this another way, the Internet may be a substitute for “product ghettoes.” To investigate this we

ask whether racially isolated individuals are more likely to connect to the Internet. We implement

this in table 7 by asking whether blacks (nonblacks) are less (more) likely to connect as blacks face

less appealing local offline product options.

        Depending on the nature of local products, their appeal to blacks might reflect either the

proportion or absolute number of blacks in the local area. For products with large fixed costs

relative to market size, a local market supplies few options, and positioning relative to black

preferences depends on the fraction black in the local market. 19 For products with smaller fixed

costs relative to market size, a local market can supply multiple options, and the appeal of the local

offline product options depends on the absolute number of blacks. 20 Because the local alternatives

to content offered over the Internet may take either form, we perform tests of whether blacks use

the Internet to overcome racial isolation using both absolute levels of black population and

percentages.

        First, we perform the test in levels, running probits of the connection dummy on the MSA

populations of blacks and nonblacks. We also run the test in percentages, substituting the black

19
   George and Waldfogel (2003) document this as the mechanism for local daily newspapers. The appeal of the few
daily papers in a market depends on the fraction black in the market. Similarly, Waldfogel (2001) documents that the
absolute amount of black-targeted local televis ion programming varies with the fraction black in the market.
20
   Waldfogel (forthcoming) documents that the number of black-targeted radio stations, as well as the black tendency to
listen to the radio, vary with the size of the local black population.


                                                          17
share for the market populations. Columns (1) and (2), and (5) and (6), of table 7 report separate

black and nonblack regressions of the tendency to connect on either the absolute numbers of blacks

and nonblacks or the fraction black in the MSA. All of the specifications in table 7 include the full

set of individual- level controls. As columns (1) and (2) show, while the nonblack connection

tendency does not vary significantly with black or nonblack population, the black connection

tendency decreases in black population and increases in nonblack population. The relationships of

interest in column (2) are statistically significant or nearly so. Columns (5) and (6) perform the

tests in percentages. The nonblack tendency to connect is invariant with the percent black in the

MSA, while the black connection tendency is (almost significantly) smaller in MSAs with larger

black shares.

       It is possible, however, that local market-level unobserved factors, such as local offline

traffic congestion or the quality of local offline media products, affect the tendency for persons in

that market to connect to the Internet. We can accommodate this by including a local market fixed

effect. When we do this, we cannot identify effects of market- level factors, such as group

population, or the percent black in the market. We can, however, identify the difference between

the effect of the MSA’s populations of blacks and nonblacks (or the MSA black share) on black

and white tendencies to connect via a coefficient on a black dummy interacted with, say, the MSA

percent black.

       Columns (3) and (4) of table 6 report estimates of the MSA fixed effects specifications,

both probits and linear probability models, in absolute population levels; and the results are

significant in the anticipated direction. Markets with more blacks have a lower tendency for blacks

to connect to the Internet, relative to the nonblack tendency to connect; and markets with more

nonblacks have a higher tendency for blacks to connect. Columns (7) and (8) report analogous




                                                  18
MSA FE specifications in percentages. They show a negative, although not significant, coefficient

on the interaction of the black dummy with the black population share (the coefficients are over 1.5

times their standard errors). These results provide evidence that persons are more likely to connect,

the more they are isolated locally, or that the Internet is a substitute for product ghettoes.



        3. The Ironic Digital Divide?

        Evidence above indicates that blacks are more likely to connect as they are more isolated.

Blacks make up about 15 percent of the population in sample MSAs and so are in some sense

isolated in most places. If people connect to avoid isolation and blacks are isolated, blacks should

be more likely than whites to connect. Yet, the large and significant negative coefficients on the

black dummy in columns (3), (4), (7), and (8) confirm the existence of the digital divide. 21 We can

offer two explanations for this puzzle. First, ample evidence indicates that blacks have sha rply

different content preferences in other media. Even if there were no digital divide, the black

Internet audience would be much smaller than the white one. Consequently there would be less

absolute content of interest to blacks, giving rise to a smaller black connection tendency.

        Second, we have documented that local content attracts people to connect. Because our

MM sample contains too few blacks per locale, our data do not allow us to quantify local group-

targeted content. Still, it is safe to assume that there is little black-targeted local content on the

Internet that would attract connection.



        V.       Retail Spending and Isolation from Retail Stores




21
  See Fairlie (2002) for comprehensive documentation that blacks are less likely than whites to be connected to the
Internet, after accounting for a host of observable variables.


                                                         19
           We now turn to our final test for substitution, based on retail spending. The WVTM data

allow us to ask whether individuals overcome isolation, in this case from nearby retail

establishments, by making purchases on the Internet. For each individual in the WVTM sample,

we have data on purchases of three types of merchandise (books, music, and clothing) via two

channels, offline stores and online (which we define as Internet and catalog). Thus, for each

individual (i) we observe 6 spending variables. In addition, we know each individual’s zipcode

location, and from the Economic Census we know the size distribution of retail stores in each

merchandise category by zipcode. As a result we can calculate the number of stores in given radii

from each individual in the sample.

           Table 8 examines online 22 and offline spending on books, music, and clothing, by proximity

to offline stores in the category. For example, persons living within a mile of a bookstore spend an

average of $99 per year at bookstores, about 46 percent of it online. As distance from bookstores

increases, total spending on books declines, presumably reflecting lower tastes for books by people

who live in isolated places. Individuals over 20 miles from a bookstore spend an average of $68,

but the fraction spent online is nearly 53 percent. Finally, total spending on music also declines

with distance to stores. Except for those most distant from music stores, the fraction spent online

increases with distance from music stores.

           Clothing accounts for more spending, and a higher fraction – about two thirds – is offline.

The online fraction increases from 35 to 38 percent as distance from clothing stores increases,

although the increase is not monotonic. Individuals whose nearest store is 1-2 miles away spend

the highest fraction (nearly 41 percent) online.

           While table 8 provides suggestive evidence that people use the Internet to overcome

isolation from retail establishments, there are stronger tests available with these data, to which we
22
     “Online” here means online and catalog.


                                                    20
now turn. Table 9 documents this via regressions of category spending on a measure of distance to

the nearest category store, with and without controls (dummy variables for household income and

education level). 23 Each coefficient in the table is from a separate regression. The first two

columns, for example, show how online and offline book spending vary across persons by their

distance from an offline store. Both online and offline spending decline with distance, although

offline spending declines more sharply, particularly for books and clothing.

         In the specifications without controls, both online and offline spending are smaller for

individuals living farther from stores. When controls are included, offline spending does not

decline significantly with distance for books or clothing, although it does for music. Importantly,

though, the online decline with dis tance is sharper (for books and clothing). To the extent that total

spending varies with distance, we can infer that individuals’ ‘tastes for consumption’ vary with

distance. Thus the fact that offline spending declines in distance (in even-numbered columns of

table 9) does not provide clean evidence for the theory.

         We need a model that accommodates tastes for consumption that vary across individuals.

To this end we estimate a model with individual fixed effects:

         S io = α 0 + α 1 Di + α 2δ I + α 3δ I Di + µ i + ε io ,                  (1)

where

         Sio is individual’s spending on, say, books though outlet o (online or off),

         Di is the individual’s distance to a the nearest bookstore,

         δI is a dummy for online, and

         µ is an individual fixed effect (the taste for books, independent of channel).



23
  For these regressions we code distance as the top of the cell. For example, if one has a store in the 0-1 mile radius,
we code distance as 1 mile. We code distance somewhat arbitrarily as 30 miles for persons without stores within 20
miles. We experimented with other values (40, 50, 100 miles) and found similar results.


                                                            21
When this model is estimated with individual fixed effects, only α 2 and α 3 are estimable. The

parameter α 2 shows how much more people spend on books online than off. The parameter of

interest α 3 shows how spending-distance gradient varies online as opposed to offline. If α 3 is

positive, it indicates that, relative to offline spending, online spending rises with distance to the

nearest store. 24

           The three columns of table 10 run specification (1) on each of the merchandise categories,

and the estimates of α 3 are positive and significant for books and clothing (zero for music). These

estimates indicate that after accounting for individuals’ tendency to spend in a category, online

spending increases in distance relative to their offline spending (in books and clothing). More

succinctly, this indicates that for clothing and books at least, isolation from retail establishments

induces Internet-connected persons to make relatively more purchases over the Internet.



           VI.      Conclusion

           It is apparent from our results that, in spite of more and better local online options in larger

markets, the tendency to connect to the Internet is not affected by market size. This result stands in

sharp contrast to relationships in traditional media, which reinforce the welfare advantages of la rger

markets for consumption. In the case of the Internet, local content does encourage increased

connection in larger markets, as with traditional media. However, unlike traditional local media,

the Internet also provides access to a national level of variety for small places, mitigating the

advantage of larger markets over smaller ones. This kind of effect is especially clear in blacks’

tendency to use the Internet relative to whites to overcome preference isolation. In spite of black


24
     The individual-level controls are subsumed by the individual fixed effect.


                                                             22
isolation and the tendency toward Internet use to overcome isolation, blacks remain relatively

unlikely to use the Internet, possibly for lack of appealing Internet content.

       The Internet holds out the promise of erasing differences in consumption opportunities

arising from isolation, either from living in small markets or near small groups of preference

compatriots. There is some evidence that the Internet accomplishes both of these functions. All

else equal, the Internet is more attractive in small markets than in large ones. And online retail

spending on books and clothing is higher, relative to offline spending in those categories, as people

live farther from offline stores. Thus, there is evidence from a variety of results in the paper that

the Internet functions for consumers as a substitute for agglomeration. Yet, all else is not equal.

There is more local Internet content in larger markets, so the Internet is more attractive in larger

places than in smaller ones. The complementarity of local sites with local agglomeration offsets

the Internet’s substitute function.

       The Internet is a young technology whose diffusion is not complete. It is perhaps surprising

that we find any relationship between connection tendencies and various kinds of isolation. It is

probably too early to sensibly determine whether the Internet has fulfilled its promise, but it seems

fair to observe, at this point, that the Internet has not yet rendered geography irrelevant. To

paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the death of cities at the hands of the Internet may be greatly

exaggerated.
