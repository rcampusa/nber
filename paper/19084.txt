                                             ABSTRACT

This paper develops methods for assessing the sensitivity of capital flows to global financial conditions,
and applies the methods in assessing the impact of macroprudential policies introduced by Korea in
2010. Relative to a comparison group of countries, we find that the sensitivity of capital flows into
Korea to global conditions decreased in the period following the introduction of macroprudential policies.

1     Introduction
Beginning in June 2010, Korea introduced a series of macroprudential measures aimed at build-
ing resilience against external …nancial shocks, especially against its well-known vulnerability
to capital ‡ow reversals in the banking sector and the associated disruptions to domestic …nan-
cial conditions. Korea was one of the countries hardest hit in the 1997 Asian …nancial crisis,
and was again at the sharp end of the …nancial turmoil unleashed after the failure of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008. In recognition of the sources of Korea’s vulnerabilities (on which
more below), the macroprudential measures introduced from 2010 were aimed at moderating
the procyclicality of the banking sector by dampening the ‡uctuations in the growth of so-called
“non-core”bank liabilities, especially cross-border banking sector liabilities.
    The purpose of our paper is to give a preliminary empirical assessment of the impact of the
measures introduced by the Korean authorities, and to revisit the rationale behind their design
so as to re…ne the thinking behind capital ‡ows and …nancial stability. In this respect, the case
of Korea represents a natural experiment for investigating the impact of new macroprudential
policies. Our assessment is based on the framework developed in our earlier paper on global
liquidity (Bruno and Shin (2011)) where global …nancial conditions drive banking sector capital
‡ows through the funding and lending operations of international banks. Our empirical proxies
for global …nancial conditions draw on the institutional structure of cross-border banking and the
status of the US dollar as the currency that underpins the global banking system, as explained
below.
    Our assessment of the performance of Korea’s macroprudential tools is based on a panel study
where Korea is one of 48 countries in a sample that encompasses both advanced and emerging
economies. Our approach is to treat the countries other than Korea as a comparison group and
ask, …rst, how Korea’s susceptibility to the global factors in capital ‡ows compares to the other
countries during the entire sample period. Then, having obtained a benchmark for comparison
from this cross-country panel study, we ask whether the empirical relationship between Korea
and the comparison group changed in any noticeable way following the sequenced introduction


                                                2
of macroprudential measures in Korea from June 2010.         We exploit the panel structure by
reviewing the evidence both across time and in the cross-section, as well as examining the full
complement of interaction dummies to test for structural changes.
   To anticipate our main conclusion, we do indeed …nd evidence that capital ‡ows into Korea
became less sensitive to global factors after the introduction of its macroprudential measures.
Interestingly, this change in Korea’s sensitivity to global conditions is in contrast to the other
countries in the region. We …nd that Korea’s experience is the opposite of other comparable
countries in Asia, whose sensitivity to global liquidity conditions actually increased after June
2010. Speci…cally, when we examine the same set of regressions applied one by one to the “Big
Five” ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) as well as
to Australia, we …nd that their incremental sensitivity to global liquidity conditions was higher
after June 2010. Thus, Korea’s lower sensitivity to global liquidity conditions after June 2010
stands out in contrast.
   More broadly, we see the contribution of our paper as o¤ering a simple but useful methodol-
ogy for examining the impact of macroprudential policies by identifying variables that are known
proxies for global liquidity, and then investigating how the sensitivity of a particular aggregate
to global conditions varies over time, before and after the introduction of the new policies.
   Although our empirical methodology cannot fully control for other events in the capital-
recipient economy that occur at the same time as the introduction of the new policy regime,
the use of country …xed e¤ects and country-level control variables account for country-speci…c
shocks. Our method is a useful …rst step when searching for instances that deserve more careful
scrutiny through micro empirical investigations.
   The outline of the paper is as follows. We begin by describing the background to our study
by outlining the rationale for why the “non-core” liabilities of the banking sector are a good
proxy for the underlying …nancial conditions and the vulnerability to a reversal. We further
explain how, in the context of cross-border banking, capital ‡ows through the banking sector
are closely related to the ‡uctuations in non-core liabilities. We then describe the institutional
background for Korea and outline the timing and sequencing of the macroprudential measures

                                                3
introduced in Korea. The core empirical investigation of the paper then follows in two sections.
We conclude by drawing implications for the relationship between capital ‡ows and …nancial
stability.


2        Background
2.1        Global Banking System
Banking activity is a key driver of …nancial conditions both within and across borders. Rapid
growth of bank lending is mirrored on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by shifts in the
composition of bank funding. As banks are intermediaries who borrow in order to lend, they
must seek funding in order to lend to their borrowers. In an economy with domestic savers,
the primary source of funding available to the bank is the retail deposits of the household sector
- the “core” funding.          During a credit boom, however, the bank resorts to alternative, non-
core liabilities to …nance its lending when its access to core deposit funding does not keep pace
with the growth of its lending.1 Cross-border bank …nancing where banks draw on wholesale
funding supplied by the global banks is likely to be an important component of non-core funding
when the …nancial system has an open banking sector as in Korea. Given the close connection
between procyclicality and capital ‡ows, there are close parallels between currency crises and
credit crises in countries that operate with open banking sectors. Hahm, Shin and Shin (2011)
…nd in their panel probit study of …nancial crisis indicators that the ratio of non-core to core
funding (especially the non-core liabilities to foreign creditors) is the most consistently reliable
indicator of vulnerability of a country, both to a currency crisis and to a credit crisis.
    Elsewhere (Bruno and Shin (2011)), we have explored the role of global “supply push”factors
as key determinants of cross-border bank capital ‡ows. In particular, variables that determine
the risk-taking behavior of global banks through their leverage decision turn out to be useful
in explaining the “supply push” forces in cross-border capital ‡ows. Here, we build on these
earlier …ndings by examining how macroprudential policies may mitigate such global supply

push forces by moderating the procyclicality of the banking sector.
   As a background to our study, we reiterate brie‡y the institutional backdrop that motivates
our approach to cross-border banking as well as provide some additional institutional background
for Korea.2 Our empirical investigation rests on the interaction between local and global banks
depicted in Figure 1.     The direction of …nancial ‡ows goes from right to left, to stick to the
convention of having assets on the left hand side of the balance sheet and liabilities on the right
hand side. In stage 1 in Figure 1, global banks raise wholesale funding and supply wholesale
funding to local banks in other jurisdictions. The local banks draw on the cross-border funding
(stage 2) in order to lend to their local borrowers (stage 3). Stage 1 corresponds to the activity
of global banks borrowing in …nancial centers.
   A BIS (2010) study describes how the branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks in the United
States borrow from money market funds and then channel the funds to their headquarters.
Baba, McCauley and Ramaswamy (2009), McGuire and von Peter (2009), IMF (2011) and Shin
(2012b) note that in the run-up to the crisis, roughly 50% of the assets of U.S. prime money
market funds were obligations of European banks.               The funds channeled by the branch to
headquarters (intero¢ ce assets) constitute gross capital out‡ows from the United States.

their net intero¢ ce assets (right panel).        Net intero¢ ce assets measure the net claim of the

branch or subsidiary of the foreign bank on its parent. Normally, net intero¢ ce assets would
be negative, as foreign bank branches act as lending outposts. However, we see that the decade
between 2001 to 2011 was exceptional, when net intero¢ ce assets turned sharply positive, before
reversing into negative territory during the height of the European crisis in 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In e¤ect,
during the decade between 2001 and 2011, foreign bank o¢ ces became funding sources for the
parent, rather than lending outposts.                                                                                                                                                        As noted by the BIS (2010) report, many European
banks use a centralized funding model in which available funds are deployed globally through a
centralized portfolio allocation decision. Cetorelli and Goldberg (2009, 2010) provide extensive
evidence using bank level data that internal capital markets serve to reallocate funding within
global banking organizations.
                      The net intero¢ ce position of foreign banks in the US therefore re‡ects the extent to which
global banks were engaged in supplying US dollar funding to other parts of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In
our empirical investigation below, we will use the growth of the net intero¢ ce account position
of foreign banks in the US as a key empirical proxy for the availability of wholesale funding
provided to borrowers in the capital-recipient economy - a key “supply push”factor.

    The reason for our focus on US dollar-denominated bank ‡ows stems from the dominant
role played by the US dollar in the global banking system. Figure 3 plots the foreign currency
assets and liabilities of banks globally, as measured by the BIS locational banking statistics.
Locational data are organized according to the residence principle, and so the US dollar series
in Figure 3 show the US dollar-denominated assets and liabilities of banks outside the United
States.    The Euro series show the corresponding Euro-denominated assets and liabilities of
banks that are outside the Euro area, and so on.
    What is clear from Figure 3 is that the US dollar is the dominant currency for international
banking, and has been the currency behind the growth of gross capital ‡ows highlighted by
Borio and Disyatat (2011) and Obstfeld (2012). The US dollar asset series exceeded 10 trillion
dollars in 2008Q1, brie‡y exceeding the total assets of the US chartered commercial bank sector
(see Shin (2012b)). The role of the other currencies are much smaller in comparison. For this
reason, we may expect the net intero¢ ce assets of foreign banks in the United States to be a

key indicator of the availability of US dollar funding for cross-border transactions, and we pay
special attention to this variable in our empirical investigation.
    Stage 2 in Figure 1 corresponds to the cross-border capital ‡ows through the banking sector.
The empirical counterpart of Stage 2 in Figure 1 in our paper will be the cross-border claims
of the banks in countries that report loan amounts to the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS). Figure 4 plots the cross-border claims of BIS-reporting banks on counterparties listed
in the countries on the right.                                             The series have been normalized to equal 100 in March 2003.
Although the borrowers have wide geographical spread, we see a synchronized boom in cross-
border lending before the recent …nancial crisis.
    The observed capital ‡ows re‡ect the interaction of the supply and demand for wholesale
funding between global and local banks. When local and global banks interact in the market
for wholesale bank funding, the liabilities of local banks serve as the assets of the global banks,
and the lending by global banks is the supply of wholesale funding, while the borrowing by local
banks is its demand.       The distinction between the demand and supply of wholesale funding
harks back to Calvo, Leiderman and Reinhart (1996), who distinguished the “push”and “pull”

                                                                                                                                                 8
factors that drive capital ‡ows into emerging economies. Nevertheless, to the extent that global
“supply push”factors are important determinants of capital ‡ows that a¤ect all capital recipient
countries, macroprudential policies that mitigate the procyclical response of an economy to such
factors may have stabilization bene…ts.     The fact that global factors a¤ect all countries also
allows us to exploit the panel structure of the data and examine how the sensitivity of capital
‡ows into a particular country varies before and after the introduction of new policies by treating
the other countries in the sample as a comparison group.
   In our empirical investigation, we make use of two global factors. The …rst is the growth of
the net intero¢ ce assets of foreign banks in the United States (the series shown in the right hand
panel of Figure 5), re‡ecting the activities of international banks that engage in the supply of
wholesale bank funding. A rapid increase in the net intero¢ ce assets series re‡ects an expansion
of cross-border banking activities of global banks. We will see that the run-up in cross-border
lending in Figure 4 closely mirrors the increase in wholesale funding raised by the global banks
in Figure 5 In e¤ect, Figure 5 re‡ects the liabilities side of global banks’balance sheets (Stage

sheets (Stage 2 in Figure 1).
   The second set of global factors we employ in our empirical investigation are those associated
with the VIX index of implied volatility of equity index options in the United States. There is
well-documented evidence that banking sector leverage is closely associated with ‡uctuations in
the VIX index (see, for instance, Adrian and Shin (2010, 2012)). Leverage of the banking sector
- both global and local - are important determinants of cross-border claims. When leverage is
high, an additional unit of bank capital will translate into a higher level of cross-border claims.
In addition, any increase in bank leverage will mean that existing bank capital will support
higher amounts of lending. Therefore, since VIX is correlated with bank leverage, the theory
predicts that both the level of the VIX, as well as the change in the VIX will show up as being
determinants as capital ‡ows (see Bruno and Shin (2011)).

2.2     Case of Korea
The procyclicality of the banking sector and its use of cross-border funding is a useful lens
through which to view Korea’s experience. Korea was one of the countries hardest hit during
the 1997 Asian …nancial crisis, and its experience leading up to the 2008 …nancial crisis is
revealing in several respects. From 2005 to 2007, locally-owned Korean banks and the foreign
bank branches in Korea saw rapid increases in short-term foreign currency liabilities, which then
subsequently reversed abruptly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The severity of the 2008 crisis for Korea can be attributed largely to the rapid deleveraging
that took place by the banking sector (both domestic and foreign) with the onset of the 2008
…nancial crisis. Figure 5 plots the capital ‡ows to the Korean banking sector from the Bank of
Korea’s monthly balance of payments statistics.
   We see that the Korean banking sector saw rapid in‡ows in the form of short-term loan
liabilities which turned into substantial out‡ows once the crisis hit in September 2008, associated


                                                                                                                                                              10
with the kind of deleveraging of the banking sector that has become the hallmark of the global
…nancial crisis in 2008. Deleveraging sets o¤ amplifying e¤ects through price changes, where
the depreciation of the Korea won against the US dollar increases the size of external liabilities
relative to domestic currency assets. In addition, the creditor banks in global capital markets
are similarly shrinking their lending in response to heightened measures of risk. The feedback
loop generated by such reactions to price changes can lead to ampli…cation of shocks.3 In the
three months following the Lehman bankruptcy, the out‡ow of short-term liabilities from the
banking sector was in excess of 50 billion dollars and largely accounts for the net decrease in
Korea’s foreign exchange reserves from over 240 billion dollars before the Lehman crisis to 200
billion at the end of 2008. We also see in Figure 5 the operations of the Bank of Korea, which
entered into a 30 billion dollar swap agreement with the Federal Reserve in October, which was
subsequently unwound following the acute stage of the crisis.
    During the period of rapid capital in‡ows, the banking sector in Korea (including the foreign
bank branches) also held dollar assets, but the counterparties were local borrowers, such as
exporting companies who held long-term dollar assets arising from their export receivables.
Although the overall currency mismatch on the consolidated balance sheet consisting of the
corporate and banking sectors would then cancel out, a maturity mismatch between long-term
dollar claims and short-term dollar liabilities took its place. In e¤ect, the currency mismatch
was replaced by a maturity mismatch which left the Korean …nancial system vulnerable to the
global …nancial crisis in 2008 that followed in the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
Chung, Park and Shin (2012) give more detailed discussion of the role of hedging by exporting
companies as a contributory factor in the rapid growth of short-term foreign currency bank
liabilities.
    These lessons led to a concerted policy initiative on the part of Korean policy makers to
mitigate some of the known vulnerabilities. The IMF Background Paper on macroprudential

policies (IMF (2012)) provides information on the timing and rationale of the macroprudential
policies in Korea. Beginning in June 2010, the authorities in Korea introduced a sequence of
macroprudential measures aimed at building resilience against its well-known vulnerability to
capital ‡ow reversals in the banking sector and the associated disruptions to domestic …nancial
conditions. The policy initiative was widely reported in both the domestic and international
press at the time, and the press reports are useful in dating the sequence of events.4
   The …rst policy measure announced by the Korean authorities (in June 2010) was a leverage
cap on the notional value of foreign exchange derivatives contracts (encompassing currency swaps
and forwards) that banks could maintain (see IMF (2012, p. 50)). For foreign bank branches,
the leverage cap was set at 2.5 times their capital, while for domestic Korean banks, the cap
was set at 50% of their capital.       Foreign banks could in principle increase their positions by
allocating greater capital to their branches in Korea, but the leverage cap lowers the return to
capital for banks engaged in this segment of their business, thereby serving as a disincentive on
expansion of derivatives positions.
   The second component was the levy on the non-core liabilities of the banks (the “macro-
prudential levy”), applied to the foreign exchange-denominated liabilities of the banking sector.
The Korean non-core liabilities levy was relatively unfamiliar compared to the standard bank
capital-related tools or standard capital control tools such as the unremunerated reserve re-
quirements (URR). For this reason, the roll-out took more time.                Although the policy was
discussed from February of 2010 (Shin (2010)) and press coverage trailed the introduction of
the non-core levy from early in 2010,5 the measure was announced formally in December 2010,
after the conclusion of the G20 Seoul summit in November. The legislation was passed in April
of 2011, and the levy began its operation in August 2011 (see IMF (2012)).
   The levy consists of an annualized 20 basis point charge on the wholesale foreign exchange
denominated liabilities of the banks of maturity up to 12 months. Lower rates are applied in a

graduated manner to maturities of over one year.
   The levy was designed so that the proceeds of the levy are paid into a special segregated
account of the foreign exchange reserves, rather than going into the general revenue of the
government.      In this respect, the Korean levy was designed from the outset as a …nancial
stability tool, rather than as a …scal measure. The outwardly similar bank levies introduced
by France and the UK in 2010 had the proceeds being paid into general government revenue,
and were designed as …scal measures to supplement government revenue. By targeting non-core
liabilities only, the levy was also designed to address the procyclicality of the banking sector
while leaving una¤ected (as far as possible) the intermediation of core funding from savers to
borrowers.
   Figure 5 indicates the date of the introduction of the macroprudential policies by the dark
grey bar at June 2010. We see some evidence from the chart that short-term bank liabilities
continued to shrink, and was replaced with long-term liabilities, both in the form of long-term
securities and long-term loans. However, just examining the series for Korea in isolation does
not control for external conditions and other factors that a¤ect the banking landscape more
broadly.     For a proper assessment of the policies, we need to examine Korea’s experience in
comparison with other countries. This is our task in the rest of the paper.
   For the purpose of our empirical investigation, the exact dating of the impact of the non-
core liabilities levy is complicated by the long gestation period between initial discussions of its
adoption and its …nal implementation. Some anticipation of the new measure will have a¤ected
behavior before the formal introduction of the levy, but the quanti…cation of the anticipation
e¤ect is di¢ cult, and is not attempted here. The announcement of the cap of foreign exchange
derivatives in June 2010 serves as a useful threshold point, but we will conduct a number of
tests to enable us to identify the break point in the time series.
   The Korean measures should be seen in the context of the broader debate on macroprudential
policies.    Galati and Moessner (2012) survey the recent literature, and Claessens and Ghosh
(2012) discuss evidence on the e¤ectiveness of macroprudential policies for moderating credit
growth in emerging economies.      As a policy tool, the Korean non-core liabilities measure is

                                                13
distinctive in the way that it acts directly on cost of bank liabilities, unlike bank capital-related
tools or direct restraints on credit growth, such as loan-to-value (LTV) or debt service-to-
income (DTI) caps. Shin (2012a, section 4) discusses the advantages of such an approach and
the broader tradeo¤s involved in alternative macroprudential policies. We do not pursue the
policy design implications here, but our empirical results may be useful in more detailed and
comprehensive studies of the tradeo¤s involved in macroprudential policy design.


3     Empirical Findings
3.1    Data Description
In conducting our assessment of the impact of Korea’s macroprudential policies, our sample of
countries includes all the developed countries, the "Big Five" countries in ASEAN (so as to
provide the basis for a regional comparison for Korea) and a selection of emerging economies.
The selection of developing countries is based on the Claessens, van Horen, Gurcanlar and
Mercado (2008) database on foreign banks. We select countries where foreign banks play an
economically signi…cant role in the country’s …nancial system but we exclude o¤shore …nancial
centers.
    The full list of countries included in our sample are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia,
Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Ro-
mania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey,
Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay and Vietnam. Table 1 gives the main summary statistics
of our sample of 48 countries.

500 stock index option prices) are the two proxies re‡ecting the cross-border activities and the
leverage of global banks. In addition to the VIX in log level, we also include the quarterly log
di¤erence of the VIX (denoted by      VIX). The VIX level is a proxy for the leverage of the global
banks, and hence the rate at which each unit of new equity is translated into lending. On the
other hand,    VIX is the proxy for the change in leverage, and hence the rate at which lending
grows based on the existing level of equity (see Bruno and Shin (2011) for details).
   We also include several control variables - both global and local - as possible determinants of
capital ‡ows. We include the log real exchange rate (RER), where RER is computed as the log
of nominal exchange rate*(US CPI/local CPI). The nominal exchange rate is in units of national
currency per U.S. Dollar (from the IMF’s IFS database).             The quarterly growth in the global
money supply ( Money stock) is calculated as the quarterly log di¤erence of the sum of the M2
stock in the US, Eurozone and Japan and M4 in the UK (from the IFS). GDP growth is the
country percentage change in GDP from the previous year (from the WEO).                      Debt to GDP
is the change in government gross debt to GDP (from WEO). All quarter variables (with the
exception of   VIX) are lagged by one quarter to mitigate endogeneity issues. The sample period
spans from the …rst quarter of 1996 (the …rst date covered in Table 7A of the BIS locational
data) to the latest data at the time of writing, which is the …rst quarter of 2012.

3.2       Empirical Speci…cation
Our empirical investigation is based on various modi…cations of the following benchmark panel
regressions similar to Bruno and Shin (2011):

                               Lc;t =         +   1   Intero¢ cet   1   +   1 VIXt 1

                                          +   1   VIXt + controls + ec;t                                (1)

Here,     Lc;t is banking sector capital in‡ow into country c in period t, as given by the quarterly
log di¤erence in the external claims of BIS reporting country banks on country c between quarters
t and t    1; VIXt   1   is the log of end-quarter VIX index lagged by one quarter;       Intero¢ cet   1   is
the growth in intero¢ ce assets of foreign banks in the US from the quarter before given by the
percentage growth and lagged by one quarter. The control set includes all the variables listed
in Section 3.1. Regressions include country …xed e¤ects, year dummies and clustered standard
errors at the country level. Year dummies still leave scope for quarterly variations in our global
variables, and they turn out to be highly signi…cant, as seen below.
   Our empirical approach is to include in the benchmark panel speci…cation a dummy variable
equal to 1 (0 otherwise) for the period from June 2010 (“Post 2010”) and a dummy variable
equal to 1 (0 otherwise) for Korea (“Korea”). We then interact each dummy variable with each
global factors. Our focus is on the triple interaction terms given by

                                   Global factor       Korea   Post 2010                                (2)

which give the incremental sensitivity of capital ‡ows to Korea to the global factor from June
2010. In addition, we also examine the coe¢ cients of the pairwise interaction terms:

                          Global factor   Korea,         Global factor        Post 2010                 (3)

By comparing the coe¢ cients between the triple interaction term (2) and the two double inter-
action terms (3), we can ascertain whether the change in sensitivity to the global factor in Korea
after 2010 is due to a shift over time, or whether the change in sensitivity is Korea-speci…c. We
also construct similar interaction terms and regressions for all the other variables included in
the benchmark estimation.

usefully summarized in the following 2                  2 matrix for the case of the                   Intero¢ ce variable,
which gives the total e¤ects resulting from the impact of the                             Intero¢ ce variable for Korea and
non-Korean countries for the periods before and after June 2010.

      The coe¢ cient   1   in Table 2 measures the impact of                      Intero¢ ce before June 2010 on capital
‡ows for all countries, except Korea, while              2   measures the incremental impact of                 Intero¢ ce
after June 2010. The coe¢ cient             3   measures the incremental impact of                    Intero¢ ce on Korea
before June 2010 , while       3   +   4   is for the period after June 2010. There is an analogous set of
interactions terms associated with the other two global factors - VIX ( coe¢ cients) and                              VIX
( coe¢ cients). In Table 2, column (3) gives the                          i   estimates for the interaction terms with
the     Intero¢ ce variable, and column (5) gives the                     and         coe¢ cients for the interaction terms
involving the VIX and         VIX global factors.
      Column (1) reports results from the benchmark regression (1). The VIX index in levels and
log di¤erences as well as the          Intero¢ ce variables are highly signi…cant and of the predicted
sign as also shown in Bruno and Shin (2011).                      The signi…cance of              Intero¢ ce indicates that
the activities of global banks (mainly European banks, as shown in Shin (2012b)) are correlated
with the capital in‡ows into our sample of countries. In this context, ‡uctuations in the VIX
index (both in the level as well as its quarterly log di¤erence) are associated with shifts in the
leverage of the banking sector and hence the capital ‡ows through the banking sector.

that the impact of the global factor             Intero¢ ce is stronger after June 2010 than before. Also,
we have     3   > 0 indicating that Korea has traditionally been more sensitive to                Intero¢ ce than
other countries. However, we see that               4   < 0, meaning that Korea’s sensitivity to       Intero¢ ce
has fallen after June 2010, in spite of Korea’s sensitivity in the past and in spite of the greater
impact of           Intero¢ ce for other countries.
   Columns (4) and (5) show results of our augmented speci…cation with the dummy Korea
and the dummy Post 2010 and their interactions with VIX and                     VIX. Column (5) shows that
Korea has had greater sensitivity to the other global factors, VIX and                  VIX, as seen from the
fact that       3   < 0 and      3   < 0 (recall that VIX and leverage are inversely related, and so more
negative coe¢ cients indicate greater sensitivity). Nevertheless,              4   is not signi…cant and   4   <0
indicating that Korea hasn’t become more sensitive to the VIX and actually has become less
sensitive to VIX and             VIX after June 2010.
   We also conduct a full set of F -tests on the incremental sensitivity and total e¤ect over
time and across countries. From the 2                   2 table in (4), the columns indicate the cross-section
dimension of Korea versus the rest of the sample, while the rows correspond to the time series
dimension of pre- and post-2010. The key tests highlighting the di¤erence in the                       Intero¢ ce
e¤ect pre and post 2010 for Korea and the di¤erence pre and post 2010 between Korea and the
rest of the countries are the following:

       2   +        4   = 0 tests the null hypothesis that there has been no change in the sensitivity of
      Korea to             Intero¢ ce before and after 2010 (comparing across rows in (4)).

       3   +        4   = 0 tests the null hypothesis that there is no di¤erence between Korea and the
      rest of the sample to             Intero¢ ce after 2010 (comparing across columns in (4)).

   We perform a similar set of tests also for VIX (coe¢ cients ) and                 VIX (coe¢ cients ):Table

respective columns-speci…cations in 2. For instance, the tests of the null hypothesis that there
is no di¤erence for Korea’s sensitivity to the global banking activities after 2010 from the rest
of the sample are           3   +       4   = 0,   3   +   4   = 0, and     3   +   4   = 0.
   While non-Korean countries became more sensitive to changes in Intero¢ ce after June 2010,
Table 3 column (3) shows that Korea became less sensitive (                                     2   +    4   negative and signi…cant).
Moreover, before 2010 the impact of                            Intero¢ ce was higher for Korea than for the rest of the
world (    3   positive and signi…cant) and became lower after 2010 (                               3+ 4     negative and signi…cant).
The total resulting e¤ect for Korea after 2010 is that global banks activities did no longer have
a signi…cant impact on capital ‡ows for Korea (                             1   +   2   +   3   +   4   = 0).
   A similar trend occurs for the change in VIX. Korea became less sensitive to changes in the
VIX after 2010 (        2   +       4   positive and signi…cant ), whereas non-Korean countries became more
sensitive (     2   negative and signi…cant). The total e¤ect for Korea after 2010 is that changes
in VIX did no longer have a signi…cant impact on capital ‡ows for Korea (                                            1   +   2   +   3   +   4

= 0). However, after June 2010 Korea continued remaining more sensitive to the level of the
VIX than the rest of the world (                       3   +   4   negative and signi…cant). Taken together, the weight
of the evidence points to a structural shift in Korea’s sensitivity to global banking ‡ows, with
the e¤ect being stronger through the lens of the funding activities (intero¢ ce assets) of global
banks.

4.2       Sensitivity to Additional Factors
So far we have examined the impact of global banking activities and how they in‡uence capital
‡ows. We now turn to the additional explanatory variables listed in Table 2. In particular, we
see that       RER coe¢ cient is negative and highly signi…cant. Hence, when the local currency
appreciates against the dollar from quarter t                           1 to quarter t, there is an acceleration of capital
‡ows into that country from quarter t to quarter t + 1. This feature is a natural consequence of
a setting where borrowers from the local banks have a currency mismatch, as shown in Bruno
and Shin (2011). When the local currency appreciates, the borrowers’balance sheets become
stronger, thereby reducing the credit risk on the bank’s loan book, which in turn increases the

                                                                       21
capacity of local banks to lend. The increased lending is …nanced with capital in‡ows.
      Capital ‡ows are also increasing in the growth of the global M2 money stock worldwide,
which re‡ects the greater demand for funding by banks, as well as the increased capital ‡ows
through non-…nancial …rms, who hold the proceeds of any increased funding operation by holding
cash in the banks.
      In Table 4, we conduct an analysis of the structural change in the capital ‡ows with respect
to the RER, M2, GDP growth and change in DEBT/GDP similar to that in Table 2.                     We
follow the analogous method of de…ning triple interactions between each local factor with the
time dummy that takes the value 1 if the date is June 2010 or later, and with the country
dummy that takes the value of 1 for Korea and zero otherwise.             The F -tests for structural
change with respect to each of the four variables are presented in Table 5 , where (1), (2), (3),
(4) corresponds to the coe¢ cients listed in 4 for each of the four variables      RER,    M2, GDP
growth and       DEBT/GDP growth.
      In particular, testing the null hypothesis (3) + (4) = 0 corresponds to the testing the di¤erent
behavior of Korea with respect to the other countries after June 2010. This null is not rejected
for     RER, suggesting little evidence that the relationship between currency appreciation and
capital in‡ows is di¤erent for Korea relative to other countries after 2010.          However, since
capital ‡ow sensitivity has moderated in Korea after 2010 (from our earlier …ndings), a possible
explanation is that exchange rate volatility itself has been subdued since the introduction of
the macroprudential measures in 2010. In this sense, the failure to reject the null (3) + (4) =
0 may suggest additional bene…ts to the macroprudential policies that work through exchange
rate stabilization.
      In Korea, capital ‡ows increases became less dependent on increases in global money stock
or GDP growth and on decreases in government debt. In particular, Korea was more sensitive
to global money (Money stock) before June 2010 and becomes less sensitive after June 2010,
whereas the e¤ect for the rest of the world is unchanged. An increase in GDP was a signi…cant
local pull factor before June 2010 for all countries and even more for Korea, but it is actually
reversed after June 2010. Symmetrically, an increase in Debt to GDP was a signi…cant push

factor for Korea before June 2010 and it has a reversed e¤ect a¤ect after June 2010, with the
other countries una¤ected. Overall, these tests strongly show that Korea has indeed a di¤erent
sensitivity to global and local variables than the rest of the world after June 2010.

4.3           Alternative Test of the Sensitivity to Capital Flows
An alternative approach to testing for the moderation of sensitivity of capital ‡ows is to investi-
gate the reduced co-movement between capital ‡ows into Korea and the aggregate capital ‡ows
to all countries. We implement this test with the following two step procedure.6
     In the …rst step, we compute the variable Beta (i; t) by regressing the capital ‡ows into
country i on the aggregate capital ‡ows to all countries on a rolling eight quarter window
ft       7;     ;t    1; tg. The estimation window of Beta (i; t) starts in 1999 and it excludes the
period of the Asian crisis 1997 and 1998 to mitigate endogeneity problems.
     In the second step, we use Beta (i; t) as the dependent variable in an OLS regression. The
right hand side variables are the Korea dummy, the Post 2010 dummy and the interaction term
Korea*Post 2010. Other explanatory variables are VIX,                   VIX. We include the full set of year
     6
         We are grateful to a referee for suggesting this procedure.

and country dummies, and compute robust standard errors clustered at the country level.
    The results are presented in Table 6. The coe¢ cient              1   of the Korea dummy indicates the
additional sensitivity of capital ‡ows into Korea relative to the other countries in the sample
before June 2010.        We see from Table 6 that the coe¢ cient               1   is positive and signi…cant.
However, we see from the negative coe¢ cient               2   on the interaction dummy Korea*Post 2010
that the sensitivity of capital ‡ows into Korea dropped sharply after June 2010.
    Even more dramatically, we have          1+ 2   < 0, so that the sensitivity of Korea ‡ips from being
more sensitive relative to the whole sample to less sensitive. The null hypothesis                  1   +   2   =0
can be rejected with a p-value of 0.0011. This …nding casts the macroprudential policies into
an even more favorable light.

    Overall, the conjunction of the …ndings from the analysis of sensitivity to the global variables
and the local variables point to the moderation of capital ‡ows. We interpret our …ndings as
providing some preliminary evidence that the newly introduced macroprudential policies in
Korea have seen some initial success in moderating the sensitivity of capital ‡ows to external
factors.


5       Robustness Checks
5.1     Evidence from Other Countries in Asia.
Evidence of change in incremental sensitivity cannot be taken as conclusive proof of the e¤ect
of the macroprudential policy, since the experiment is simply to look before and after June
2010.      However, we complement our incremental sensitivity analysis for Korea by comparing
the results for Korea with those of other countries in the region, as well as examining evidence
for any structural breaks in the way that our variables of interest impact capital ‡ows, so that
we may place the results on Korea into context. Through this exercise, we may ascertain the
extent to which the results for Korea are shared by other Asian countries, and hence give clues
on any regional variations in our sample.
    We therefore run panel regressions analogous to those in Table 2 but for each of the following
countries: Australia (AUS), Indonesia (IDN), Malaysia (MYS), Philippines (PHL), Thailand
(THA) and Vietnam (VNM).
    The choice of Australia follows from the similarity of Australia’s banking sector in its open-
ness and its reliance on wholesale funding. Australia also has a similar sized economy to Korea,
a fellow member of the G20 grouping of countries and the Australian dollar has some of the same
attributes as the Korean won as a barometer of the risk-taking behavior in global capital mar-
kets. The other countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) are chosen
as they are collectively known as the “Big 5” ASEAN countries and share some similarities to
Korea in terms of openness to similar regional forces.
    We focus on the      Intero¢ ce variable as the main global factor capturing the funding ac-

tivities of global banks, and follow the empirical procedure reported in Table 2 using the
country dummy and Post 2010 dummy, as well as the interaction between the two. The re-
sults are reported in Table 7.        For economy of presentation, we report only the key interac-
tion coe¢ cients. For each country, we report the coe¢ cient on                Intero¢ ce*Country and on
  Intero¢ ce*Country*Post 2010. We assign the same numbering to the interaction dummies
coe¢ cients as we did for Table 2 and Table 3.
    The evidence on      Intero¢ ce is striking. In contrast to Korea, all countries in Table 7 except
Indonesia show positive coe¢ cients on the triple interaction term                   Intero¢ ce*Country*Post
2010, meaning that Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam became more sen-
sitive to ‡uctuations in global bank funding conditions after June 2010. Even in the case of
Indonesia, the coe¢ cient is insigni…cant, rather than being negatively signi…cant as in Korea.
    We conduct F -tests for structural change, and the results are reported in Table 8.                    The
numbering convention for the null hypotheses remains the same as before. The null hypothesis
(2) + (4) = 0 corresponds to the statement that the sensitivity of the country to                   Intero¢ ce
does not change after June 2010. We see that this hypothesis is resoundingly rejected for all


                                                      28
four local variables. However, unlike in the case of Korea, the null hypothesis (2) + (4) = 0
is rejected for the opposite reason from Korea.                In these other Asian countries, capital ‡ows
became more sensitive to global factors after 2010, rather than less sensitive.
   The null hypothesis (3) + (4) = 0 corresponds to the statement that there is no di¤erence
between the country and the other countries in the full sample after June 2010. We see that the
null hypothesis (3) + (4) = 0 is strongly rejected for Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines
and Vietnam. It is only for Indonesia that the null (3) + (4) = 0 cannot be rejected.
   Taken together, the evidence suggests that there has been a markedly lower sensitivity to
global funding on capital ‡ows in Korea, even when all other comparable countries in the region
saw the opposite e¤ect - toward an increased sensitivity to global factors in the determination
of capital ‡ows. Our results are suggestive that the introduction of macroprudential policies in
Korea served to mitigate the notorious sensitivity of Korea to external …nancial conditions.

5.2       Dating the Structural Change
So far, we have relied on the a priori knowledge of policy announcements and press reports to
choose the threshold date for the macroprudential policies to June 2010. We will now adopt a
more agnostic procedure in dating the structural break by examining at each date the evidence
for structural break at that date, and then compiling the evidence for the whole period after
the start of 2010.
   Speci…cally, we run the following panel speci…cation.7 Starting from the benchmark panel
regression, we introduce the interaction dummies:

                                  Intero¢ ce*Korea*Pre,             Intero¢ ce*Pre,                     (5)

where Pre is the dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the date is before the end of 2009,
and zero otherwise. We also introduce the interaction dummies

                                Intero¢ ce*Korea*Q(n),              Intero¢ ce*Q(n),                    (6)
   7
       We are grateful to a referee for suggesting this speci…cation.

for quarter n starting from the …rst quarter of 2010, and where Q (n) is the dummy that takes
the value 1 in quarter n and zero otherwise. We then run the benchmark panel regression with
the inclusion of the two triple interaction terms in (5) and (6), and report their coe¢ cients in
Table 9.
    By examining the coe¢ cients and the standard errors for these variables for each quarter
beginning in 2010, the rationale of this procedure is to obtain a more precise dating of the
structural break for Korea, and to examine how uniform the lower sensitivity to global factors


                                                      30
are over the post-2010 period.
     From the t-statistics reported in Table 9, we see that a0 > 0, and so the sensitivity of Korea
to    Intero¢ ce prior to 2010 was strongly positive. However, for the coe¢ cients a1 to a9 , we see
that all but one is negative and signi…cant. The only exception is March 2011. We observe the
reverse pattern for the    t   coe¢ cients, which are all positive and signi…cant with the excpetion
of   4:

     From this evidence, we can conclude that Korea became less sensitive compared to global
factors compared to the other countries in our sample of 48 countries. The evidence is consis-
tently present throughout the period after 2009. These results give some cause for reassurance
that our earlier results that rely on the partitioning of the sample period into “before and after”
subsamples does not rely on outlier observations to mask the overall e¤ect. The evidence points
to the impact of the macroprudential policies falling uniformly over the whole period from 2010.


6         Conclusions and Directions for Further Research
Given the accumulated evidence assembled in this paper, the following conclusions seem justi…ed
concerning the impact of Korea’s macroprudential policies.
     First, there is evidence from a variety of approaches that the sensitivity of capital ‡ows to
global factors reduced substantially in the case of Korea from 2010. We have seen this both
through the signs of the interaction dummies, through F -tests of structural breaks, as well as
the co-movement measurements using our Beta(i; t) variables.
     Remarkably, the dampening of sensitivity in Korea sits side-by-side with evidence that Ko-
rea’s experience is di¤erent from group of comparable Asian countries. For these Asian coun-
tries, they saw an increase in the sensitivity of their capital ‡ows to global factors after 2010.
Since the original …ndings for Korea were relative to the global comparison group, the increased
sensitivity of Australia, and other Asian comparison countries is representative of global trends
as a whole. Given such a backdrop, the conspicuous drop in the sensitivity of capital ‡ows into
Korea is all the more notable.


                                                   31
   Finally, we have seen that the lower sensitivity of Korea’s capital ‡ows to global factors after
2010 is an e¤ect that is uniformly present throughout the post-2010 period, rather than relying
on one or two outliers to get the overall sign.
   The results in our paper reiterate a number of broader lessons. The evidence in our paper
suggests that the driving force behind banking sector capital ‡ows is the leverage cycle of the
banking sector, through the interaction of the supply and demand of wholesale bank funding.
Our …ndings reinforce the argument in Borio and Disyatat (2011), Obstfeld (2012a, 2012b) and
Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) on the importance of gross capital ‡ows between countries in
determining …nancial conditions, especially the gross ‡ows intermediated by the banking sector.
   Bank capital ‡ows have also been pivotal in the European …nancial crisis. The credit boom
in countries such as Ireland and Spain were …nanced primarily by capital ‡ows through the
banking sector (see Allen, Beck, Carletti, Lane, Schoenmaker and Wagner (2011) and Lane and
Pels (2011)). Therefore, the mechanisms outlined here on the link between capital ‡ows and
leverage are relevant in understanding the European crisis, also.
   Our …ndings highlight the role of …nancial intermediaries in driving ‡uctuations in risk
premiums and …nancial conditions, especially in connection with the growing use of wholesale
bank funding.
   The procyclicality of banking sector capital ‡ows poses challenges in setting policy and
regulatory responses. The cross-border spillovers associated with banking sector ‡ows highlights
the importance of international coordination in banking regulation and in monetary policy, but
such coordination is not straightforward to design or implement, even when the interests of the
relevant countries are congruent. Moreover, even when coordination is globally optimal, it still
may generate tensions with national governance.
   In the absence of e¤ective international coordination, a second best approach (that takes
the spillovers as given) would be appropriate in designing a framework to mitigate the risks of
cross-border ‡ows at the national level. The recent report by the Committee on International
Economic Policy Reform (CIEPR (2012)) describes the considerations that are relevant in setting
policy on capital ‡ows in a second best world. The macroprudential policies introduced in Korea

                                                  32
in 2010 can be viewed in this context. The Korean measures should also be seen in the context
of the broader debate on the design of policies toward …nancial stability. Although the term
“macroprudential”is now commonly encountered in the policy world, empirical studies on their
e¤ectiveness have been comparatively less common. In this context, our empirical results may
be a useful input in more detailed studies of the tradeo¤s involved in macroprudential policy
design.
