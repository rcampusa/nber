Industrial Catching Up in the Poor Periphery 1870-1975

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper documents industrial output and labor productivity growth around the poor periphery 1870-1975
(Latin America, the European periphery, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia).
Intensive and extensive industrial growth accelerated there over this critical century. The precocious
poor periphery leaders underwent a surge and more poor countries joined their club. Furthermore,
by the interwar the majority were catching up on Germany, the US and the UK, a process that accelerated
even more up to 1950-1975. What explains the spread of the industrial revolution world-wide and
this catching up? Productivity growth certainly made their industries more competitive in home and
foreign markets, but other forces mattered as well. A falling terms of trade raised the relative price
of manufactures in domestic markets, as did real exchange rate depreciation. In addition, increasingly
cheap fuel and non-fuel intermediates from globally integrating markets seems to have taken resource
advantages away from the European and North American leaders, and integrating world financial markets
also reduced the cheap capital advantage of the leaders. However, ever-cheaper labor was not a serious
cause of industrial catch up, offering little support for the Krugman-Venables (1995) model. Furthermore,
tariffs did not foster industrial catch up either, but rather poor industry performance fostered high tariffs.
Markets and policies mattered, not just institutions.

                                              1. Motivation



         In some parts of the poor periphery1, modern industrialization started more than a

century ago. Latin America had two emerging industrial leaders in the late 19th and early

20th century – Brazil and Mexico, East Asia had two – Japan and Shanghai, and the

European periphery had at least three – Catalonia, the north Italian triangle and Russia.

This paper will show that some of these periphery industrializers were growing fast

enough to have started catching up on the established industrial leaders (Germany, the

United States and the United Kingdom). It will also show that the pace greatly

accelerated in the interwar decades: many more joined the catching up club – Argentina,

Colombia, Greece, India, Italy, Korea, Manchuria, Peru, the Philippines, Taiwan, and

Turkey; and the overall rates of industrial output growth accelerated even for the leading

periphery industrializers – most notably, Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia. Between

1950 and 1975, the catching up accelerated and came to include almost every member of

the poor periphery in Asia, Latin America, and backward eastern and southern Europe.

         Why did industrialization in the poor periphery start in the half century 1870-1913

(long before the Third World growth miracles of the mid-late 20th century) and why in

these places? Why did the spread of the industrial revolution to the poor periphery

accelerate so dramatically in the interwar years? Why was industrial catching up so

pronounced in the quarter century 1950-1975, and how much was independent of the pro-



1
 I use the term poor periphery to distinguish poor late comers in the periphery from the successful English-
speaking offshoots. The Third World is, of course, a subset, but the poor periphery also includes backward
eastern and southern Europe, as well as European-settled Latin America.


                                                     2
industrial policies pursued? In short, what were the main forces driving the diffusion of

modern industry from the rich industrial core to the poor periphery?

       No doubt the answers are as complex as any question dealing more generally with

the causes of modern economic growth, and no doubt any answer should include

fundamentals like culture, geography, institutions and good government. But there is, in

addition, a simpler explanation that would appeal to the growth theorist: As the Great

Divergence took place, labor became increasingly expensive in the industrial core relative

to the poor periphery. On these grounds alone, the poor periphery should have become

increasingly competitive in labor-intensive manufacturing. Here’s another simpler

explanation to add to the list: after a dramatic rise in the poor periphery’s terms of trade

up to its late 19th century peak (Williamson 2008, 2011), it then fell almost as

dramatically to the 1930s (Prebisch 1950; Singer 1950), thus producing a sharp rise in the

relative price of manufactures, favoring home industry. Here’s a third simple explanation

to add to the growing list: trade and exchange rate policy changed dramatically in favor

of import-competing manufactures. And here’s still a fourth simple explanation to add:

those poor countries scarce in manufacturing intermediates (cotton, minerals) and the

coal or petroleum to run their steam engines, found these disadvantages vis a vis well

endowed industrial powers evaporating as a world transport revolution made it possible

to deliver those intermediates at ever-cheaper prices to fuel-scarce economies in the poor

periphery. In all four cases, global forces had a chance to shine.

       But why do I care so much about industrialization when the rest of the recent

development/history literature has been content with GDP per capita and proxies for




                                              3
same?2 The answer is that I believe that industry and cities are carriers of growth, not just

proxies for the same. There are at least six decades of theory that strongly supports my

belief. Certainly the new endogenous growth theories (e.g. Krugman 1981, 1991a, 1991b;

Krugman and Venables 1995; Romer 1986, 1990; Lucas 2009: see also the summary in

Baldwin and Martin 2006) imply that urban-industrial activities contain far more cost-

reducing and productivity-enhancing forces than do traditional agriculture and traditional

services.3 This notion is so embedded in mainstream economic thinking that it gets

important exposure in modern surveys of growth theory (e.g. Helpman 2004: Chp. 5).

Indeed, how else can industrialization – that is, an increase in the share of economic

activity based in industry – take place without more rapid rates of total factor productivity

growth there? After all, it is relatively rapid productivity advance in industry that lowers

its relative costs and prices, displaces competing foreign goods, raises demand for its

output, pulls resources from other less dynamic sectors to augment its capacity to meet

that increased demand, and makes it expand in relative size. Thus, given that industry

achieves much higher growth rates during the industrial revolution than do other sectors,

GDP growth rates quicken as the dynamic sector pulls up the average. And as industry

grows in relative importance, its impact on overall GDP growth rates rises as well. The

explanations offered for this asymmetric effect favoring rapid productivity growth in

urban industry are many. Here are just five: urban clusters foster agglomeration

economies; denser urban product and factor markets imply more efficient markets; a

more skill-intensive industry and its modern support services fosters the demand for and

2
  I refer here to the spectacular contributions of the economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James
Robinson and their followers, as well as economic historians exploring the great divergence, like Robert
Allen and Kenneth Pomeranz, and all the many scholars who have used Angus Maddison’s famous data.
3
  Although modern endogenous growth rarely cites them, they were anticipated in the 1950s and 1960s by
two-sector or dualistic growth models.


                                                    4
accumulation of skills; a denser urban-industrial complex tends to generate a more

extensive productivity-enhancing knowledge transfer between firms; and industrial firms

are more able to draw on technological best practice used by world leaders.

        The historical evidence certainly confirms the theory. Figure 1 plots the

correlation, both in logs, between GDP per capita observed between 1820 and 1950

(Maddison 2001), and the level of industrialization per capita 50 or 70 years earlier

(Bairoch 1982). The correlation is steep and strongly significant implying that faster

future growth is correlated with current levels of industrialization.

        This paper measures industrial or manufacturing output growth in the poor

periphery over the century 1870-1975. It does it in four parts, roughly two decades each:

1870-1890, 1890-1913, 1920-1939, and 1950-1975. It also compares the poor periphery

growth performance with that of the industrial leaders -- Germany, the United States and

the United Kingdom -- to identify who was catching up, who was just keeping even, and

who was falling behind.4 It then reports industrial labor productivity growth to see who

was catching up or falling behind in that dimension as well. To the extent that

productivity advance was most directly affected by culture and institutions, we have a

chance to see whether it was productivity or per input costs and output prices driving

profitability in industry and thus the timing and location of early industrialization in the

poor periphery.5

  This, of course, is the language of my mentor Moses Abramovitz in his seminal writings. Note, however,
that Table 1 (Abramovitz 1986: p. 391) of his oft-cited EHA Presidential Address is based on 15 countries,
only one of which – Japan – is not western European or an English-speaking European offshoot. Thus, he
was not speaking to poor periphery catching up at all.

  Gregory Clark (1987) asked a similar question some time ago, but his focus was on between-country
differences in 1910, while my focus is on within-country changes 1870-1975.

        2. Industrial Catching Up in the Poor Periphery: When and Where?



The Data

        Secondary sources have allowed me to document constant price ‘industrial’

output for 29 members of the poor periphery for 1920-1939, the last of my three pre-

WW2 periods: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Chile, China,

Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Peru,

the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey,

Uruguay, the USSR, and Yugoslavia. The sample swells to 35 in 1950-1975, with the

addition of Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. Of

course, the same definition of ‘industry’ is not always used in all country studies: based

on their primary sources for the interwar period, some scholars restrict the industry

definition to manufacturing alone (15); some add construction to the total (2); some add

in addition mining (2); some add in addition some combination of transportation and

utilities (9); and one was forced to use non-agriculture (Turkey). Thus, heterogeneity

exists in the data, but where the alternative series are available for any given country, the

growth rates rarely if ever differ much across the industry definition. In addition,

although some sources report net value added, some report gross value added and some

report production or output indices, when a country source offers more than one such

time series, the resulting growth rates differ very little.6




6
 What matters far more is the importance of artisan non-factory manufactures production and its demise
over time. Factory manufactures production grows faster than total manufactures production, and factory
manufacturing labor productivity grows more slowly than total manufacturing productivity, as high
productivity factories displace low productivity cottage industry.


                                                    6
       Not surprisingly, the sample shrinks a bit as we move back in time: while there

are 29 countries in the 1920-1939 sample, ten disappear when moving back to 1890-

1913, leaving 19; and the sample shrinks still further in 1870-1890 to 13. While I am still

looking to expand the sample for the pre-1913 period, I doubt that many more will be

added to the list any time soon.

       Documenting industrial output growth in the poor periphery was hard enough, but

finding the employment data to convert output to labor productivity growth was even

harder. The somewhat smaller country samples for industrial labor productivity growth

are 34 for 1950-1975, 28 for 1920-1939, 16 for 1890-1913, and 10 for 1870-1890.

       Appendices 1-3 report the sources of the output and labor productivity growth rate

Estimates.

       I need to offer a final word before pressing on with this preliminary analysis.

Presumably, the spread of industrial activity behaves the same way that new products and

new technologies do, tracing out some diffusion S-curve (Basu and Weil 1998). Thus,

even successful industrialization should exhibit growth rates which start slow, accelerate

to a peak, retard, and then become negative as the rich economy de-industrializes while

shifting to sophisticated service activities. A future version of this paper with Michael

Clemens will adjust all the growth figures reported here using an estimated S-curve

diffusion metric. Until then, we shall have to be content with what follows.



Rising Industrial Catching Up before WW2

       Table 1 reports industrial output growth – always in constant prices – for the three

leaders (again, Germany, the US, and the UK) and the poor periphery. The first fact to




                                             7
emerge is that the rate of industrial output growth rose throughout the century 1870-1975;

it was not simply an ISI-induced boom that awaited post-WW2 policy. Between 1870 and

1890, the average industrial growth rate for the poor periphery was 3.85 per annum,

greater than that of the three leaders (3.49 percent per annum), and thus already achieving

some catching up. The fastest industrializing region by far was Latin America (6.24

percent per annum), led by Argentina, Chile and Mexico. The two other industrialization

hot spots were Russia (5.45 percent per annum) in the European periphery and Japan

(4.29 percent per annum) in Asia, but even these two did not reach the rates of industrial

output growth that Latin America achieved. Between 1890 and 1913, the poor periphery

fast industrializing club expanded: Serbia joined Russia in the European periphery; Brazil

and Peru joined the Latin American club (but Chile dropped out); and China and colonial

India joined Japan in Asian club. Between 1920 and 1939, the club got much bigger with

the addition of Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, colonial Korea, colonial

Manchuria, colonial Philippines, the new republics of Poland and Turkey, and colonial

Taiwan. Furthermore, the average rate of industrial growth in the poor periphery

increased to 4.72 percent per annum during the interwar decades, well above the three

leaders (3.17 percent per annum).

       Two morals follow. First, colonial status and lack of policy autonomy did not

necessarily suppress industrialization. True, it did suppress it 1870-1890, confirming the

conventional view: Table 2 shows that those with autonomy recorded much faster

industrial output growth (relative to the leaders) than did those without autonomy, 1.03

versus -1.06 percent per annum, a 2.09 percent point spread favoring those with

autonomy. However, this was not true over the half century thereafter: indeed, industrial




                                             8
output growth (relative to the leaders) favored those without autonomy 1890-1913, by

0.78 percentage points, and 1920-1939, by 0.12 percentage points.7 Second, the spread of

the industrial revolution to the poor periphery gained speed, depth and breadth as the

century unfolded, reaching an impressive crescendo in the post-WW2 quarter century

following 1950.

         What about catching up on the industrial leaders, Germany, the US and the UK?

Table 3 reports the answer. Between 1870 and 1890, only Latin American industry was

growing fast enough to start catching up to the industrial leaders (at a very hefty 2.75

percentage points per annum). Apart from precocious Latin America, only Russia in the

European periphery and Japan in Asia could report any catching up in the first period.

While Spain and Uruguay were holding their own, the rest were falling behind, especially

India and Indonesia. Between 1890 and 1913, Latin America was still catching up on the

leaders (now at 1.2 percentage points per annum), and Peru had joined the Latin

American club (replacing Chile, which now had fallen behind8). Between the pre-1913

and interwar period, the average rate of catching up in the poor periphery had increased

by four times, to 1.55 percent per annum. Furthermore, more than two thirds (an

impressive 22 out of 309) of our poor periphery sample were catching up on the leaders.

Six of the eight falling behind were in the European periphery -- Austria, Bulgaria,

Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Spain – joined by Chile and Egypt. Part of this impressive

  Thus, the evidence from this sample is not always consistent with the conventional wisdom: “The
imperialist powers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries generally tried to use their colonies as
markets for their manufactured goods and as stable sources of raw materials for their industrial production.
Combined with their colonies’ initial poverty, these imperial policies deterred the growth of manufacturing
in most colonies” (Kim and Park 2008: p. 26). See, for example, Fieldhouse (1983) and Austin (2003).
However, it must be said that our sample excludes Africa, much of western Asia, and most of Southeast
Asia.

underwent by far the biggest reversal in our time series.

surge in catching up in the interwar can be traced, of course, to the slowdown in output

growth among the three leaders due to the great depression (a 0.67 percentage point drop

in their average industrial growth rates from 3.84 in 1890-1913 to 3.17 in 1920-1939).

But in the Middle East and Asia, most of the catch up surge was due to an acceleration in

the poor periphery itself. And in the European periphery and Latin America, the

depression-induced fall in manufacturing growth rates was much less than with the three

leaders. In any case, between the periods before and after WW1, the biggest industrial

catch up surge took place in the following six (where the figures are changes in annual

growth rates between the two periods, and where the rates are relative to the three

leaders: from Table 3): Brazil 0.93, India 1.57, Mexico 2.51, Japan 2.99, USSR 4.71, and

Turkey 4.89. Although the 1890-1913 rates are unavailable for Colombia, China (only

Shanghai), Korea, Taiwan, and South Africa, their growth rates for the interwar are so

high that they are almost certain to have belonged in the big-catching-up-surge club.



The Spectacular Post-WW2 Catching Up

       The postwar poor periphery catch up after 1950 was truly spectacular, even by the

standards of the so-called west European miracle. The average rate of industrial output

growth was 7.88 percent per annum (Table 1), which meant a catching up rate of 3.29

percent per annum (Table 3). Thus, the poor periphery added more than 3 percentage

points to its already-impressive interwar industrial growth (4.72 percent per annum) and

catching up performance (1.55 percent per annum). Furthermore, industrialization in the

poor periphery was ubiquitous: only four countries, all in Latin America, recorded

industrial per annum growth rates below the poor periphery interwar average: Brazil 1.80,




                                            10
Chile 4.38, Colombia 1.57, and Uruguay 2.43. Everywhere else in the poor periphery

rates even greater than the “growth miracle” achieved in western Europe (Crafts and

Toniolo 1996) were common. In every region, the previous precocious emerging

industrial leaders were joined by many others: in the European periphery, Austria,

Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain

all joined the interwar industrial hot spots, Russia and Yugoslavia; in Latin America,

Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela

all joined the long-standing emerging leaders, Brazil and Mexico; in the Middle East,

Egypt joined Turkey; and in Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines joined India and the East

Asian interwar emerging leaders (some of whom came to be called the Gang of Four by

postwar observers).

       In short, the rate of industrial catching up surged in that postwar quarter century

after 1950 (intensive industrialization), and it also spread from the emerging leaders to

the regional followers (extensive industrialization), big time! But it is important to

remember that the catch up surge had its source in the interwar years and even before.



What about Persistence?

       Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and Shanghai province were emerging industrial

leaders pretty much from the start in the 1870s, but was historical persistence more

general than that illustrated by these famous five? Apparently not, since the evidence on

historical persistence is mixed at best. Figure 2 reports the simple correlation between

industrial catching up in some current period relative to the previous one. The correlation

is strongest between 1920-39 and 1890-1913, R2 = 0.21, but even here that correlation left




                                             11
much scope for newcomers arriving on the scene and old leaders disappearing from it.

The correlation is even weaker between 1890-1913 and 1870-1890, R2 = 0.15, and, most

surprising, it completely disappears between 1950-1975 and 1920-1939, R2 = 0.01!

       Persistence was not a strong feature of industrial catching up around the poor

periphery over the century 1870-1975. The implication is important since it suggests that

getting the fundamentals right – culture, geography and institutions – did very little to

guarantee successful (or unsuccessful) industrialization over the century. Other forces

must have been at work, whether world markets, domestic markets or policy.



                   3. How to Identify the Sources of Industrialization



       Manufacturing output growth (relative to the three leaders) was not correlated

with GDP per capita between 1870 and 1939 (R2 = 0.002). Whatever were the

fundamentals that determined GDP per capita – culture, geography or institutions, they

did not spill over in to rates of industrialization. So, what does explain where and when

manufacturing growth was fastest in the poor periphery?

       I think the best way to attack this question is first to lay out explicitly the

determinants of manufacturing profitability and competitiveness. To state the obvious,

profits per unit of output equal revenue less costs per unit of output, and a rise in

manufacturing output growth should be driven by an increase in those profits. Consider

the following statement, with subscripts t = time period (1870-1890, 1890-1913, 1920-

1939, 1950-1975) and j = country both suppressed in the notation:

       π = p – {wl + uk + pm m + pff}                                           (1)




                                              12
where p = domestic output price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)

       pm = domestic non-fuel intermediate price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)

       pf = domestic fuel price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)

       w = domestic wage cost per unit of labor

       u = domestic user cost per unit of capital = ipk

       i = domestic real interest rate

       pk = domestic capital goods price (world price + shipping costs + tariff)

and l, k, m, and f are the labor, capital, non-fuel intermediate and fuel inputs per unit of

output (all variable over time and place).

       To the extent that I am mainly interested in the timing of industry growth between

each of the four periods 1870-1890, 1890-1913, 1920-1939, and 1950-1975, it is the first

difference in prices and costs (c) driving changes in profits that mattered. Thus,

       dπ = dp – dc = dp - d{wl + uk + pm m + pff}                                    (2)

In rates of change (*),

       dπ/π = dp/p– dc/c = dp/p – {φlw* + φku* + φmpm* + φfpf*} –

                                         {φll* + φkk* + φmm* + φff*}.                 (3)

The last term of expression (3) measures total factor productivity growth, where falling

input coefficients (l, k, m, f) imply positive total factor productivity growth rates which

reduce costs, raise competitiveness, and improve profitability. Since very few countries in

the poor periphery 1870-1939 (or even 1950-1975) offer estimates of manufacturing or

industrial total factor productivity growth, I use industry labor productivity growth as a

proxy in what follows.

       How do I drape interpretive economic history on equation (3)? Here’s the list:




                                              13
dp/p: I assume all poor periphery countries in my sample were much too small to have

influenced world manufacturing prices, and thus that they were price takers for those

products.10 Three forces would have served to raise the relative domestic price of

manufactures: a fall in the terms of trade facing these primary product exporters and

manufactures importers; a depreciation in their real exchange rates; and a rise in their

tariff and non-tariff barrier to manufactured imports.

φlw*: Any fall in the home wage, compared with foreign competitors, would have

lowered relative costs and raised relative profitability. As the great divergence between

the industrial leaders and the poor periphery widened (Bourguinon and Morrisson 2002),

it was manifested by bigger wage and living standard gaps. Those countries whose GDP

per capita was falling behind fastest, at least had the increasing advantage of cheaper

labor. This was especially true, of course, in labor-intensive manufacturing where φl was

high. Whether they were able to exploit the cheap labor advantage depended, of course,

on other determinants of profitability and competitiveness.

φku*: Since the user cost of capital has a financial and a real component, ipk, both might

have mattered. As their financial capital markets integrated with world markets, and as

these ‘emerging markets’ underwent a fall in the premium they had to pay for external

finance (Obstfeld and Taylor 2004; Mauro et al. 2006), their interest rates should have

fallen compared to their foreign competitors. Furthermore, if tariff policy was used to

favor the import of capital goods relative to final manufactured products, the relative




10
  I am referring here to the price of their imported manufactures, not to their export price, since many in
my sample had a profound influence on their export prices, like Chile with its copper, Brazil with its coffee,
India with its jute, or Egypt with its cotton. To repeat, none of them were large enough to influence the
world price of manufactures.


                                                     14
price of capital goods should have fallen compared with the leaders (De Long and

Summers 1991; De Long 1992; Collins and Williamson 2001).

φmpm* and φfpf*: Textile manufacturing needs cotton, wool, flax and silk intermediates,

but many countries do not grow some or any of them. Metal manufacturing needs ores,

but many countries do not mine them. Since these are high bulk, low value products, they

were expensive to ship long distance in 1870, but transport revolutions had lowered those

costs dramatically by 1939. Manufacturing in natural resource scarce countries in the

poor periphery must have benefited by global market integration much more than did the

resource-abundant industrial leaders. In addition, modern steam-driven power in industry

needed cheap fuel. Those without coal to mine or oil to pump, suffered severe

competitive disadvantage in 1870, but that disadvantage must have almost evaporated for

any poor periphery country without coal or oil reserves in the more global world of 1939

when they could import the stuff cheaply. Certainly φm was big enough to matter, and

recent writings suggest the same must have been true of φf in steam-powered

manufacturing (Balderston 2010).

tfpg = {φll* + φkk* + φmm* + φff*}: Fast total factor productivity growth (tfpg),

compared with the industrial leaders, would have improved competitiveness and

profitability. Part of any relatively fast productivity advance would have been driven by

the demise of low-productivity, small-scale cottage industry, and the relative rise in high-

productivity large-scale factories. Part of it would have taken place by improvements on

the factory floor. Part of it would have been due to between-industry and between-factory

technology transfer associated with urban agglomeration, better and denser factor

markets, and easier knowledge transfer. It also seems likely that this would be one




                                             15
channel through which better institutions and better government would shine. The other

forces listed above deal instead with exogenous world forces and domestic policy, even

though the latter was surely endogenous to local political power.

       Before we press on to the empirical analysis, I need to make a qualifying

comment about equation (3). The theory there implies that I should correlate changes in

output growth between the four periods (driven by changes in profitability) with changes

in the explanatory variables. It might be argued, however, that changes in output growth

should be correlated with levels of the explanatory variables, and such correlations would

augment the sample. We will try both in what follows.



                     4. What Mattered Most? A Research Agenda



       This section is labeled a ‘research agenda’ since it consists of a simple bi-variate

approach rather than a more complex multivariate assessment, and it is based on an very

incomplete data set documenting competing explanatory variables. A more complete

version will have to await additional documentation of some of the explanatory variables,

and a completely new documentation of others. Still, we can report some interesting

initial findings as well as lay out an agenda.

                                   Three That Clearly Mattered



Productivity Growth

         Let me start with the reminder that labor productivity growth is being used as a

proxy for total factor productivity growth. Figure 3 reports the correlation between

manufacturing catching up, output growth less that of the three leaders (MOG-3), and

manufacturing labor productivity growth less that of the three leaders (LPG-3), both in

percent per annum averaged over each of the four periods. While the correlation in the

four decades up to 1913 is certainly positive and significant (R2 = 0.38), it still leaves two

thirds more to be explained, presumably by adding a role for world markets and transport

costs, domestic tariffs, and domestic exchange rate policy.11 This is even more true when

changing MOG-3 between any two periods is correlated with changing LPG-3 (not

shown, but R2 = 0.15). Productivity growth catch-up contributed powerfully to output

growth catch-up between 1870 and 1913, but other forces affecting output price and input

costs appear to have mattered even more. The results are much the same for the interwar

decades (R2 = 0.42), even though the elasticity of output growth to productivity declined

sharply (not shown in Figure 3: 1870-1913 ε = 3.389, 1920-1939 ε = 0.161). But the big

surprise is the impressive rise in the correlation in the ISI period between 1970 and 1975,

when R2 = 0.73. Given how the traditional literature has stressed the role of ISI policy – a

policy that fostered industrialization by raising industrial output prices and lowering input

costs, it appears the forces driving productivity were far more important over the quarter

century after 1950 than over the seven decades before WW2.

11
  Of course, industrial productivity growth itself was not exogenous, but at least in part endogenous with
respect to world markets, world transport costs and domestic policy, especially if cross-border
technological transfer rises with openness (Parente and Prescott 2002; Lucas 1993, 2009).


                                                    17
Terms of Trade and the Relative Price of Manufactures at Home

        The seminal papers by Raul Prebisch (1950), Hans Singer (1950) and W. Arthur

Lewis (1952) pointed out that the relative price of primary products had fallen

dramatically for almost a century before their date of writing. Figure 4 replicates the

Lewis-Prebisch-Singer finding, where the steepest decline was 1913-1939, followed by

1870-1890, with 1890-1913 bringing up the rear. The papers by Prebisch and Singer

offered support for more than two decades of anti-global policy, stressing how a short

and medium term decline in the terms of trade would damage GDP performance.

However, they did not mention what the terms of trade decline implied for local industry:

a fall in the relative price of primary products implies, of course, a rise in the relative

price of manufactures, and thus a stimulus to manufacturing in the poor periphery. Some

of the countries in our sample had steeper declines in their terms of trade than others, so

the stimulus must have varied. But in general there must have been a ubiquitous

industrialization stimulus, especially in the interwar years: if the poor periphery

underwent de-industrialization and Dutch disease during their spectacular terms of trade

boom from the 1800s to the 1870s (Williamson 2008; 2011: Chp. 12), symmetry argues

that they must have undergone ‘re-industrialization’ and ‘Dutch health’ during the terms

of trade bust from the 1870s to the 1930s. Figure 5 confirms the prediction: while the

correlation is hardly perfect (R2 = 0.03), the relationship is steep and the elasticity large.




                                              18
Real Exchange Rates

         Did real exchange rate depreciation give an added stimulus to industrialization in

the poor periphery over the seven decades before 1940? Depreciations do, of course,

make imported manufactures more expensive, thus stimulating local industry. But how

would nominal exchange rates be correlated with big terms of trade shocks? If exchange

rates are fixed, and change only with policy, a terms of trade collapse and a policy-

induced exchange rate depreciation will give a mutually reinforcing stimulus to local

manufacturing in the poor periphery. But even if the exchange rate is flexible, the effect

is reinforcing: a terms of trade slump should cause a real exchange rate depreciation.

Modern evidence from commodity exporters Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all

with flexible exchange rates in recent years, confirm these predictions (Chen and Rogoff

2003). What about 1870-1939?

         The standard view is that real exchange rates were stable during the gold standard

era up to World War I. But this standard view is based on Euro-centric evidence. In

contrast, there was real appreciation in the poor periphery12: in our sample, the real

exchange rate rose 11 percent 1870-1890 and by 10 percent 1890-1913, hardly a stimulus

for industrial catching up. But between 1920 and 1939, on average the real exchange rate

fell by 8 percent in the poor periphery, for a total turn around of 18 percent in favor of

domestic manufacturing.13 Of course, there was considerable variance in the behavior of

the real exchange rate (REER) across countries, not just over time, and Figure 6 reveals



12
   As Appendix 3 notes, the real exchange rate data available for the poor periphery is limited, especially
for the interwar decades. However, much has been documented recently by Solomou and Catão (2000),
Catão and Solomou (2005), and others.
13
   Some time ago, José Campa (1990) found this effect for Latin American industrial production in the
1930s by using the Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) approach.


                                                     19
that real exchange depreciation (appreciation) was indeed associated with fast (slow)

industrial catching up (R2 = 0.034).



             One Big Correlate, but Reverse Causality: Endogenous Tariffs



        Over the past two decades, the literature exploring the openness-growth

connection has boomed (typically using tariffs as the measure of non-openness), no doubt

because the results are very relevant to current policy formation in the Third World. The

vast majority of that literature, however, has simply looked at the correlation with GDP

per capita growth, and the result has been mixed, to say the least. The historical arm of

that literature started with Bairoch’s (1989) report of a positive correlation between tariff

heights and GDP per capita growth for pre-1914 Europe, confirmed with better data by

O’Rourke (2000), then challenged as spurious by Irwin (2002). However, Vamvakidis

(2002) showed that this was specific to the pre-1914 period since the protection-growth

correlation switched sign and became negative for the century thereafter, a result

confirmed by Clemens and Williamson (2004) on a world data base 1870-2000 and with

lots of controls. Most recently, Astorga (2010) again (like Bairoch) reports a positive

protection-growth correlation for Latin America 1900-2004, also with controls.

        What’s missing from this ambiguous literature is, of course, an explicit

assessment of the channel of impact leading to the macro GDP per capita growth effects

and an assessment of the alleged recipient of the protection in poor countries – industry.14



14
  There are some important recent exceptions, like Federico and Tena (1999) on Italy, Lains (2006) on
Portugal, Tena (2006) on Spain, Nunn and Trefler (2010) on the 20th century Third World, and Gómez
Galvarriato and Williamson (2009) on Latin America.


                                                   20
Why correlate industrial protection with GDP growth in the poor periphery if the policy

target was industrialization?

         High average tariffs in the poor periphery meant even higher tariffs on finished

manufactures, perhaps two or three times higher.15 And as Figure 7 shows they were very

high indeed in autonomous Latin America and the European Periphery (see also

Coatsworth and Williamson 2004; Williamson 2006). But if high tariffs were to foster

industrialization in Asia before 1939, it had to wait for the interwar. While tariffs in Latin

America and the European Periphery between 1870-1890 and 1890-1913 were very high

and even rose, they remained very low in Asia. Between 1890-1913 and 1920-1939,

average tariffs fell or remained the same everywhere in the poor periphery except Asia,

where they started rising in the 1920s and then shot up in the 1930s. Thus, protection may

have fostered industrialization in Latin America and the European Periphery up to WW1,

but it wasn’t until the interwar decades that it could have done the same for Asia.

         So much for the theory and the timing of tariff policy. What about the correlations

with industrial catching up? When we turn our attention from GDP per capita growth to

industrial catching up, do we then find the positive correlation between protection and

growth first found for Europe by Bairoch (1989), rather than the negative correlation

found by Vamvakidis (2002) and Clemens and Williamson (2004) for the world as a

whole, at least after 1914? Figures 8a and 8b reveal some surprises. For the full period

1870-1939, tariff policy did not contribute to industrial catching up (Figure 8a). Indeed,


15
  See, for example, Bairoch (1993) and Williamson (2011: Chp. 13). Antonio Teña (personal
correspondence) has estimated ad valorem tariffs on British manufacturing exports for four Latin American
republics in 1914 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico): while the tariff for all imports averaged 21.5
percent, the average tariff on British manufactures averaged 45 percent, more than twice as high. Similarly,
for the European periphery (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain): while the average tariff on all imports
in 1914 was 18.4 percent, the tariff on British manufactures was 46.2 percent, almost three times higher.



                                                    21
the correlation, though weak, is negative between protection and industrial growth. The

big surprise lies with Figure 8b, which covers only the interwar period: there the negative

correlation persists, and this time it is even highly significant! These are, of course, only

bi-variate correlations, but they certainly suggest that poor industrial growth fostered

protection, not vice versa. Of course, Eichengreen and Irwin (2009) have shown how

countries who depreciated their real exchange rates were much less likely to have raised

tariffs in the interwar, so the negative protection-growth correlation in Figure 8b could

possibly be overturned when future work explores the industrial catching up issue using

multi-variate analysis.

        In any case, after WW2 the results may be very different since the poor periphery

used many and even more effective tools to protect and stimulate domestic industry –

quotas, exchange controls, pro-industrial domestic policies, and, as in the 1930s,

exchange rate depreciation (Diaz-Alejandro 1984; Corbo 1992; Taylor 1998). Still, if

tariffs were correlated with non-tariff barriers and pro-industrial policies, we should see a

significant correlation between them and industrial catching up. But we do not see it in

the pre-1939 decades.



      One Which Mattered Even Less, and Two On Which the Jury Is Still Out



Cheap Labor in Labor-Intensive Manufacturing

        Cheap labor is central to one elegant and famous growth model offered by Paul

Krugman and Tony Venables (1995) fifteen years ago. In their economic geography model,

eventually transport costs drop to such an extent that the advantages of cheap southern wages

swamp any advantages of proximity to markets (since the advantages of being close to one’s


                                               22
suppliers or customers diminishes as transport becomes cheaper), and industries locate in the

South, which grows at the expense of the North. Can we find evidence of cheap labor effects in

our data base?

        Many forces were at work over the century 1870-1975, but we should see some

positive correlation between high industrial growth rates and low labor costs per unit of

output, both relative to the leaders. Alternatively, we should see a negative correlation

between relative industrial growth and relative GDP per capita, our proxy for cheap

labor. Figure 9a confirms the correlation, but it is very low (R2 = 0.03), suggesting that

cheap labor played only a marginal role in the catching up sweep stakes, and that the next

phase the analysis must control simultaneously for the remaining (major) forces. To the

extent that the focus is country-specific timing of industrialization rather than who leads,

then perhaps country fixed effects is the best way to identify how ever-cheaper labor

played a part in any explanation of the timing of industrialization in the poor periphery

before 1975. Yet, even that result is unlikely to be forthcoming since first differences --

changing labor costs, d(wage proxy), and changing rates of catching up, d(MOG-3) – are

not correlated at all in Figure 9b.

        So far, support for the Krugman-Venables model is weak at best.



Cost of Fuel and Manufacturing Intermediates

        There is, of course, an active debate among economic historians regarding the

importance of coal and ore deposits in giving the industrial leaders their initial advantage.

Still, the question needs to be posed in an open economy way since favorable

endowments of manufacturing intermediates and fuel may lose their importance if free

trade and transport revolutions make these inputs available cheaply to late-comers who


                                               23
don’t have the endowments. Some time ago, Gavin Wright (1990) showed us that while

its natural resource base was important in explaining the American leap to industrial

leadership from 1870 to 1890, that advantage disappeared in the more global economy of

1939. One can only expect to find a similar switch – but of opposite sign -- for those parts

of the poor periphery without a favorable natural resource endowment.

        I have almost no data yet documenting the relative price of fuel and

manufacturing intermediates (that is, relative to output price), so their role will have to

await the data. Much rides, of course, on φm and φf , the shares of intermediates and fuels

in total manufacturing costs. But big intermediate cost shares cannot be in doubt: for

example, in the 1870s raw cotton accounted for 70 percent of total costs of Lancashire

cotton textiles (Ellison 1886: p. 46), and one can only suppose the share was even higher

where the stuff was more expensive, like in the Mexican interior.16 Fuels, however, are a

little less obvious: again in cotton textiles, the percent of coal costs in total costs varied

between 2.2 for England, 5.5 for Alsace, 5-7 for India, and 9-16 for Catalonia (Balderston

2010: p. 571). While the cost shares were much smaller for fuels than for intermediates,

the price variance is likely to have been higher: in 1882 Lancashire, the price of one ton

delivered at the mill averaged $1.38; in 1882 Poland $4.48; in 1886 Russia $5.34; in 1882

Italy $6.35; and in 1882 Spain $7.13, more than five times the Lancashire price. And this

big range was just for Europe.

        We know coal prices converged between the 1870s and the 1930s, so this wide

price spread reported above for the early-mid 1880s must have diminished over time. For

example, a quarter of a century later, in 1907, the mean for a sample of 48 world seaports


16
 In the 1870s, Mexico had a tariff on raw cotton to protect local producers (Gómez Galvarriato and
Williamson 2009).


                                                   24
(almost half outside Europe) was 25.83 £/ton, but the average for the three leaders was 25

percent less, 19.43 £/ton (based on data underlying Clark 2007, Figure 15.1, p. 310). Coal

was very expensive in much of the poor periphery, including the following: Pernambuco

(Brazil), 49.50 £/ton, 155 percent above the three industrial leaders; Buenos Aires

(Argentina), 39 £/ton, 101 percent above; Manila (Philippines), 33.55 £/ton, 72.7 percent

above; or Colombo (Ceylon), 34.35 £/ton, 76.7 percent above. Thus, there is no doubt

that fuel costs still ranged widely across the globe as late as 1907, even when the

comparison is limited to seaports; if the comparison included inland cities, presumably

the range would be even greater (e.g. there are no observations yet for inland Russia,

India, the Balkans, Colombia, Peru, or Mexico). In addition, while we know the coal

price spread was greater in 1870 and less in 1939, but we do not yet have the data to

document the magnitudes. Even the cited data for our sole observation, 1907, is crude,

and thus we do not know whether the inverse correlation between 1907 coal costs and

industrial output growth in Figure 10 (MOG-3 rises with fuel costs) is signaling limited

evidence, that 1907 was a bad benchmark for assessing impact on industrial growth over

the half century1890-1939, that local fuel costs were driven up by successful growth, or

that they were simply correlated with something else.



The User Cost of Capital

       The premium attached to poor periphery interest rates fell as a global capital

market developed from the mid-19th century to 1929 (Obstfeld and Taylor 2004; Mauro

et al. 2006), and thus that their financial capital disadvantage diminished. We also know

that capital formation was greatly suppressed in countries where the relative price of




                                            25
capital goods was high (De Long and Summers 1991; Lee 1994; Taylor 1998; Collins

and Williamson 2001). Presumably, therefore, the user cost of capital must have

influenced accumulation and industrial growth in the poor periphery 1870-1975.17 How

much awaits the data documenting the cost of financial capital and capital goods, by poor

periphery country over time.



                                               The Agenda



         The agenda is clear. We have established where and when industrialization spread

to the poor periphery in the seven decades after 1870: We know whose industry was

catching up, whose was just holding its own, and whose was falling behind. Furthermore,

we know that the spread deepened and widened over time, and that the intensive and

extensive industrialization was positively correlated. The paper then offers a way to

decompose the sources of this performance, and lists the external (e.g. global) and

internal (e.g. local) factors which, in combination, will explain the timing and location of

industrialization in the poor periphery. The next step is to accumulate the missing

explanatory variables to complete the decomposition.




17
  There is, of course, no shortage of theoretical literature making the price of capital goods and
accumulation connection. See, for example, Jones (1994).

UAR (Egypt) (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965) estimate GDP growth 1928-1939 (1954

Revolution: An Economic Analysis (London: Oxford University Press, 1963, Table 7, p.
87) shows a decline in the manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment share
1927-1937 from 8.1 to 6.3%. Since there is no qualitative evidence of relatively fast (or
even significant) growth in manufacturing labor productivity 1927/8-1937/9,
manufacturing output is unlikely to have grown much faster than GDP. Thus, we assume
manufacturing output growth 1920-1940 to have been about 1.60% per annum.

Egypt: Bent Hansen and Girgis A. Marzouk, Development and Economic Policy in the
UAR (Egypt) (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965) estimate GDP growth 1928-1939 (1954
prices, Chart 1.1, p. 3) at 1.60% per annum. However, Charles P. Issawi, Egypt in
Revolution: An Economic Analysis (London: Oxford University Press, 1963, Table 7, p.
87) shows a decline in the manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment share
1927-1937 from 8.1 to 6.3%. Since there is no qualitative evidence of relatively fast
growth in manufacturing labor productivity 1927/8-1937/9, manufacturing output is
unlikely to have grown much faster than GDP. Thus, we assume manufacturing output
growth 1920-1940 to have been about 1.60% per annum. Issawi (1963, Table 7, p. 87)
reports that manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment fell slightly 1927-1937 at
-0.10% per annum. Thus, we assume manufacturing labor force growth 1920-1940 to
have been about 1.70% per annum.

                   Appendix 4: (Incomplete) Data Sources for
      Explanatory Variables 1870-1939 in the Poor Periphery Industrialization
                                1870-1940 Project
                             (Date: February 3, 2011)

The explanatory variables used thus far in the project are: average tariffs rates, the net
barter terms of trade, relative wage cost proxies, the real exchange rate, and policy
autonomy. The data base for some of these are incomplete, and they have not yet been
collected for others (e.g. the user cost of capital, fuel prices, and other intermediate
prices). The rest are taken from my earlier projects and the sources listed.

Average tariff rates (%): Calculated as import customs duties relative to total import
values. These data have been used in Coatsworth and Williamson (2004), Clemens and
Williamson (2004, 2010), and Williamson (2006). They are available from the author in
the Blattman-Clemens-Williamson 1870-1940 data base. The BCW data base is missing
many East European countries which are used in this new project and thus they are
augmented by Heinrich Liepmann, Tariff Levels and the Economic Unity of Europe
(London: Allen and Unwin, 1938), Table A1, pp. 392-99.

Net Barter Terms of Trade (1913=100): These data have been used in Blattman,
Hwang and Williamson (2007) and Williamson (2008). They are available from the
author in the Blattman-Clemens-Williamson 1870-1940 data base. The BCW data base is
missing many East European countries which are used in this new project. They will be
collected soon.

Policy Autonomy (dummy variable): See Table 2, although the source (Clemens and
Williamson 2010: Table 1, p. 28) offers far more detail.

Relative Wage Costs: As the text makes clear, we use a proxy, GDP per capita
relative to the three leaders (Germany, the UK and the USA). The GDP per
capita data are from Maddison http://www.ggdc.net/Maddison/content.shtml (last
accessed June 10, 2010). Three absent observations were filled as follows. 1900:
the Philippines uses its 1902 figure, and Turkey is estimated by multiplying the
Turkey/Asia 1913 ratio times the 1900 Asia estimate. 1929: Egypt is estimated
applying India’s 1929-60 growth rate to the Egyptian 1960 figure.

Real Exchange Rates: These are taken from many sources to be elaborated in
another draft (when the many absent period/country observations are collected),
and I have been greatly aided in the process by Pablo Astorga, Luis Bértola,
Michael Bordo, Luis Catão, Kalina Dimitrova, Sophia Lazaretou, Matthias
Morys, and Solomus Solomou.

Relative Capital Goods Prices (1913=100): Not collected thus far, but hope to
retrieve them from the France-Germany-UK-US export (by destination) data base
being collected in collaboration with Aurora Gómez Galvarriato. These will be



                                             45
used relative to local manufacturing prices.

Real Interest Rates: Not collected thus far.

Relative Manufacturing Intermediate Goods’ Prices (1913=100): Not
collected thus far. These will be used relative to local manufacturing prices.

Relative Fuel Prices (1913=100): Not collected thus far. These will be used
relative to local manufacturing prices.

Source: Policy status from Clemens and Williamson (2010; Table 1, p. 28). Within period changes were: China
1929, taken as autonomous 1920-1939; and Japan 1900, taken as autonomous 1890-1913. Those without
autonomy were either colonies or had signed 'unequal' treaties tying their policy hands, at least regards tariffs.
