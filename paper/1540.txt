                  Determinants of Slave and Crew
               Mortality in the Atlantic Slave Trade


                                ABSTRACT




     This paper measures and. analyzes death rates that prevailed in the
Atlantic slave trade during the late 1700s. Crew members died primarily
from fevers (probably malaria) and   slaves   died primarily from gastrointestinal
diseases. Annual death rates in this activity were 230 per thousand
among the crew and 83 per thousand among slaves. The lack of immunities
to the African disease environment contributed to the high death rates
among the crew. The spread of dysentery among slaves during the voyage
was probably exacerbated by congestion and. poor nutrition. Death rates
differed systematically by region of origin in Africa and. season of the
year. There was little interaction between the incidence of slave and.
crew deaths. The high death rates make the slave trade a demographic
laboratory for study of health and mortality ad an economic laboratory
for study of markets for free labor.

       One of the early political expressions of opposition to slavery occurred

in the late 1700s when Parliament considered proposals to ameliorate condi-

tions in the slave trade. The treatment and mortality of slaves emerged as

central questions in deliberations and the debate led to collection and study

of evidence on conditions in Africa, the middle passage, and the New World.

Legislation in 1788 took the form of limits on the slave—carrying capacity of

vessels; the requirement that slave vessels carry a surgeon who cared for

slaves and who monitored conditions through a journal that noted deaths and

causes of death: and a system of bonuses to ship captains and surgeons.

       Controversy over the health and mortality of persons involved in the

slave trade has persisted from the era of the campaign against slavery to the

present.    The debate continues in part because the rhetoric, the charges and
counter-charges, and the tactics of the supporters and foes of the institution
often obscured the underlying realities. More fundamental to modern research,
however, are the facts that substantially limited information on these ques-

tions survives to the present and the levels and determinants of health and

mortality are central to larger questions such as the economic costs of the

slave trade to Western Europe, the profitability of slavery and the slave

trade, and the impact   of legislation on the slave trade.
       Studies of mortality in the Atlantic slave trade have relied extensively

on data from company records, newspapers, and government sources such as port

records, papers required by legislation monitoring or regulating the trade,

and   the results of special inquiries.' The measure of mortality commonly con-
structed from these   sources is the ratio of slave deaths to the number of

slaves embarked, although some authors have used the ratio divided by voyage
                                      2

length multiplied by 1000.2 The central questions of research have included

mortality differences by region of departure from Africa, the effect of crowd-

ing on mortality, voyage length and the probability of death, the secular

trend in mortality rates, and the importance of vessels that had an unusually

high number of deaths.

       This paper extends work in the area by analyzing 92 surgeons' logs

required by Dolben's Act of 178R. The ships in the sample originated from the

major   supply regions in Africa and span the years 1792 to 1796. The excep-
tional value of the logs for measuring levels and studying determinants of
mortality   stems from the combination of information on dates of death, causes

of death, and records for slaves as well as crew. Because dates of death and

the number of persons at risk are available, true death rates can be calcu-

lated. The death rates    are relevant for comparisons with the mortality expe-
riences of other populations. The chronological record also permits study of
death rates by day during loading and during the voyage as opposed to study of
the journey as a whole that is common in previous work. Although the diagnos-
tic capabilities   of ship surgeons were primitive by modern standards, the

symptoms of several diseases or disease categories common in the slave trade

were sufficiently distinctive to be useful. This combined with the systematic

enumeration of causes enables a statistical examination of causes of mortality

that    is more detailed then previously undertaken. The mortality records of
the crew furnish a backdrop against which   slave mortality can be compared and

cont rasted.
        The analysis begins with death rates by cause of death, The results of
this inquiry suggest a plan of action for study of major causes of death
during loading and during the voyage. The next portion compares the findings
of this paper with previous work, and the last section considers the general-
ity of the results. The analysis generally accepts the data at face value;
                                       3

the hazards of doing this and features of the data are discussed in the appen-

dix.



                           DEATH RATES BY CAUSE OF DEATH

Construction

        The surgeon maintained a chronological journal of loadings and unload—

ings, usually in categories of men, women, boys, and girls, although sometimes

only males and females or men and women were enumerated. Slaves were fre-

quently held on board until departure for the West Indies. Slaves unloaded

include those sold to other vessels and pawns (captives held as security

before transactions were completed) and sick slaves returned to shore.3 Slave

sales or transfers to other ships were extensive on a few vessels. A computer

program written for these data tabulates the number at risk each day from

first    loading to the final destination in the West Indies.
       Muster rolls establish the crew size at the time of departure from
England for 45 out of 92 vessels in the sample. Crew size for the remaining
vessels was estimated from a regression of crew size on tons.4 The available

muster rolls show that relatively few crew members left the ship or were taken

on board before the ship reached the West Indies. As an approximation it was

assumed that crew size changed only through deaths. Thus the estimated number

of crew at risk may be inaccurate for particular vessels.

       Death rates were             from the chronological record of deaths and

data on the average number of person-years at risk during a particular time

period.5 The tables express results in annual rates per 1000 to facilitate

comparisons with other populations.


Medical Knowledge

        The information available on casues of death must be approached cau-

tiously given the rudimentary medical knowledge of the late 1700s.6 The
                                      4


difficulties stem from the lack of a germ theory of disease to guide inquiry

and from the poor state of medical instruments and procedures necessary for

precise diagnosis. In making a diagnosis that would guide treatment the sur-

geons drew upon visible symptoms of the patient. Unfortunately not all impor-

tant symptoms of a particular disease were visible, the symptoms may have

changed over time as the disease ran its course, and some diseases with dis-

tinctly different causes have symptoms in common. The problems of identifica-

tion were compounded if the patient had more than one disease.

      Medical diagnosis of cause or causes of death is important for investiga-

tion of socioeconomic and epidemiological factors in mortality. Knowledge of

the disease or diseases involved conveys information about the net influence

of the prevalence or pathogens, mechanisms of transmission, and the suscepti-

bility of individuals in the population. Unfortunately the surgeons recorded

few visible detals and their observations were often grouped under broad head-

ings such as "fevers," "dysentery," and "diarrhea." The fevers no doubt

included   malaria and probably yellow fever and the gastrointestinal diseases
no doubt included shigellosis (bacillary dysentery)and possibly amoebic
dysentery.7 However, fever sometimes acconpanies    gastrointestinal diseases

and   vomiting and diarrhea may acconpany malaria and yellow fever.8 Thus it is
not   safe to conclude that "fevers" were confined entirely to diseases spread
by mosquitoes or that gastrointestinal diseases such as "diarrhea" were con-
fined entirely to diseases spread by ingestion of contaminated matter.

Patterns
      Tables 1—4 show the death rates calculated for slaves and crew during
loading and the voyage. Comparisons involving the overall rates given in the
last row of the third column of each table demonstrate that loading and the
                                        5


voyage were extraordinarily hazardous to life. The rates are exceptional when

placed in the proper perspective of the probable age range of the slaves and

crew.    Death rates are   ordinarily highest during infancy, then decline during

childhood and reach a minimum just before or during adolescence, The rates
usually rise gradually for many years beyond the minimum and then accelerate
upwards in the 60s and beyond. Under ordinary circumstances most deaths were
confined to the very young and the old. Typical eighteenth—century Western
European populations in the age range 10—34, for example, probably had average
annual death rates not exceeding roughly 1 percent.9 Furthermore, the upper
limit   of recorded experience for this age group when not living under severe

circumstances such as war or famine is less than 2 percent.10 The slaves and

crew faced death rates several times higher than their contemporaries engaged

in ordinary activities. The slave trade therefore provides a laboratory for

study of health and mortality under extreme circumstances.

      The slave trade was relatively hazardous for the crew, particularly

during loading. Compared to slaves the death rates of the crew were more than

5   times higher during loading and nearly twice as high during the voyage. The
absolute   levels of crew death rates were on the low to middle range of magni-

tudes reported by others for European populations residing in western Africa

during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.1' The surgeons logs support

the view that western Africa was the "white man's grave." The extraordinary

death rates for the crew raise interesting questions about the operation of

markets for free labor that engaged in the slave trade, Comparisons of the

slave trade with other types of voyages would add a dimension of perspective

to the slave trade and may provide insights into causes of mortality.

      The chances of death changed considerably during the course   of loading
and the voyage. mong slaves the safest period occurred about 3 to 6 months
                                        6



before departure; the death rate at this time was 22.8 per thousand, or in the

neighborhood of twice the rate expected for settled populations not facing

severe circumstances. From this low the rate nearly tripled to 64.5 per thou-

sand during the four weeks before departure, continued to rise during the

early   part of the voyage, and reached a peak of 145.9 per thousand during days
29—42 of the voyage. Slave death rates followed an inverted—U shape during
the voyage and differed by a factor of roughly 2 to 1. Compared to slaves,
crew death rates were less volatile during loading and reached a plateau of
nearly 350 per    thousand in   weeks 5-12. Over three-quarters of   all crew deaths

during the voyage occurred within the first four weeks.

        During the operations of loading and the voyage over 60 percent of the

crew    deaths were from fevers and over 40 percent of the slave deaths were frOm

gastrointestinal diseases. The share of crew deaths from fevers was slightly

higher during loading (68%) compared to the voyage (54%). Among slaves thQ

shares of deaths from gastrointestinal diseases were approximately constant

during    loading (38%) and the voyage (41%). Gastrointestinal diseases claimed
16 percent of crew deaths and fevers amounted to 8 percent of slave losses.
        The minor causes of slave deaths included respiratory diseases (5%), sui-

cide (3%), scurvy (2%), insurrection (2%), and accidents. Among crew deaths 8

percent involved accidents (primarily drowning), 2 percent scurvy, 1 percent

respiratory, and 1 percent insurrection. The fotheru category includes well—

defined but relatively infrequent ailments such as yaws and dropsy, several

poorly—described    diseases (e.g. sudden death," "sulks," "fits," "delirium,"
and "relaxed"), and many illegible entries. Most of the slave deaths from

respiratory    diseases (89%) and scurvy (88%) occurred on the voyage, particu-
larly    near the middle and the end of the trip, which is consistent with claims
                                           7


and evidence that the voyage was debilitating. The low death rates from

scurvy      suggest that measures sometimes taken as early as the late eighteenth
century to include      vitamin C   in the diet through    foods such as lime juice may

have   been used.12 Information on exact dates of death available in the logs
indicates that slave suicides were concentrated           during or shortly after

slaves      were first loaded and at the time the ship left Africa.
       It    is important to note that smallpox and measles were virtually absent

as causes of death in these data. Inoculation against smallpox was practiced

in England as early as the mid 1700s, and the availability of the technology

suggests that it may have been used on slaves.13 It is also possible that

native      Africans practiced inoculation.14 Because the logs pertain to only to
a few years (1792-1796), it is also possible that epidemic conditions for this
disease were temporarily favorable.

Implications
       Because the underlying causes and methods of transmission of many

diseases are quite different, the investigation of determinants of mortality

will be undertaken by disease category. The data in Tables 1-4make it clear

that fevers and gastrointestinal diseases should be the focus of attention.

Other causes of death are relevant to the entire picture, but their frequency

of occurrence——even for the most important minor causes such as accidents

among the crew and respiratory diseases among slaves-—is so low that syste—

matic study is not feasible with these data.

       The   configurations of death rates by day of loading, day before depar-
ture, and day of voyage suggest that determinants of mortality substantially
involved a time—dependent process. The importance of time is            easily seen for

gastrointestinal diseases involving slaves; death rates more than doubled from
                                        8


the beginning to the end of loading and continued to climb, reaching a peak
during the third to the fifth week of the voyage. The pattern of death rates
resembles the beginning, height, and end of an epidemic.
      The concepts of agent, host, environment, and incubation period as

employed by epidemiologists are useful for understanding mortality from dysen-

tery.'5 The spread of an infectious disease depends upon the probability of

contact between an infectious agent and individuals, and the susceptibility of

individuals. The amount of infectious material in the environment is a func-

tion of the number of infected individuals or hosts of the agent, the duration

and extent to which infectious material is expelled by hosts3 the rate of sur-

vival of the agent in the environment, the route of entry into the host, and

the existence of alternative reservoirs or hosts of the agent. The availabil-

ity of hosts varies with the mobility and interpersonal contact within the

population group, and the immunityor other means of resistence to the agent

by individuals. The incubation period is the interval of time between contact

with an infectious agent and the onset of illness. Each disease has a charac-

teristic incubation period, which may vary among individuals. The discussion

so far has assumed a situation with case—to-case transmission of disease, but

the concepts can easily be extended to include the spread of infection from a

central source such as contaminated food or liquid.

      The epidemiology of malaria and yellow fever involve intermediate hosts.

The parasites responsible for these infections spend part of their life cycle

inhabiting mosquitoes and so the path of transmission is from man (or other

host) in his infectious stage, to mosquito, and subsequently from mosquito to

man. These diseases therefore involve populations of mosquitoes and humans

(or   other hosts), each with its own   set of susceptible and infective hosts.
                                       9


African natives were ordinarily infected with malaria as children, and those

who survived had a limited immunity to further symptoms, but could act as

hosts.'6 Thus malaria was hyperendemic in coastal areas of western Africa,

and the spread of the disease among European newcomers resembled a stochastic

version of contamination from a central source. Unlike malaria, yellow fever

kills the victim within 5 to 7 days or follows by rapid recàvery and life—long

immunity that prevents the individual from acting again as a host. The yellow

fever parasite occasionally died out in parts of .Africa, particularly in iso

lated areas, but the chances of an epidemic increased as the nonimmune popula-

tion grew and as contacts with the outside carried the disease.     Europeans may
have   contributed to periodic yellow fever epidemics as noninimune hosts.
       The spread of infectious disease is a complex process that can be     summa-

rized using   mathematical models.'7 In a simple deterministic model of an epi-

demic, for example, disease spreads by contact between infectives and suscept-

ibles, there is no removal from circulation by death, recovery, or isolation,

and    infections remain contagious throughout the epidemic. The epidemic curve
shows the rate at which   new cases accrue over time under the conditions or

parameters   specified by the model.   The time pattern of deaths is derivable

from   the epidemic curve by incorporating magnitudes for the share of   those

infected who fail to survive and the delay from the onset of symptoms to

death. More complex models can involve infection and removal, intermediate

hosts, geographical spread, stochastic phenomena, latent and infectious peri-

ods, and lost immunity. The a priori formulation of a model appropriate for

slaves or crew would be difficult in part because many conditions relevant to

the model are unknown.    Indeed, the relevant conditions are an important
object of investigation. Nevertheless, an epidemic model is a useful frame-
work for thought. Some of the parameters in such a model were given and
                                       10


others were under the control or influence of slave traders, ship captains,

and surgeons. The extent and nature of control are topics for the next sec-

tion of the paper.


                         ANALYSIS OF MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH

Approach

     Given the importance of time in an epidemic process it is fortunate that

surgeons recorded information on a daily basis. The unit of observation

selected for a regression analysis of determinants of mortality is daily

information for a particular ship. We chose a logit model in which the depen—

dent variable takes on the value of 1 if there were one or more deaths from a

particular cause.18 Separate regressions are required for slaves and crew on

the grounds that these groups arrived with substantially different immunities

and lived under considerably different conditions. Because there was contact

with shore and provisions were available from shore during loading but not

during the voyage, it is appropriate to analyze mortality during loading sepa.-

rate from mortality during the voyage.


Loading

     The variables available for study of mortality during loading include

region    of origin in Africa, slaves per ton on the ship, seas.on of the year,
and time. These variables are motivated below. Experiments with other varia-
bles are discussed at the end of this section.
     Region. Differences in death rates by location could have been caused by
variations in the rate of exposure to pathogens, the number and virulence of
pathogens, and the immunities and other means of resistence by individuals to
disease.     With regard to risks of exposure, the nature of   activities required
                                     11


by the crew while slaving may have differed by region. For example, the dis-

tance that the ship anchored from shore, whether the ship anchored along the

coast or in a river or delta, the amount of time spent by the crew on ship

versus the interior, and sources of food and water may have been important

determinants of mortality. kiong slaves the risks of exposure may have been

influenced by the duration of time from inland capture to loading, the loca-

tions of forts or prisons relative to sources of disease, the extent of crowd

ing while being held on shore, and sources of food and water.      It is virtually

impossible to acquire reliable information about the number and virulence of

pathogens that existed in the late eighteenth century. However, it should be

recognized that differences could have existed as a function of climate,

topography, migration, and the extent of adaptation of pathogens to hosts.

The immunities of individuals were influenced by the degree of adaptation to a

diseäseenviroriment.    Thus the extent to which slaves exported frc a particu-
lar port were acquired in regions remote or otherwise differing in disease
environment of the   port of exit may have influenced mortality. Excluding the

few   who had been to Africa or the West Indies previously,   the crew generally

had little or   no resistence to malaria or yellow fever. The general health
and diet of slaves and crew were important particularly for resistence to gas-

trointestinal diseases; nutrition apparently has little impact on the course

of malaria or yellow fever.19 Therefore the health of slaves at the time of

initial capture, exertions of the journey to the coast, and diet while being

held on the coast or on board ship may have influenced deaths from dysentery.

In conclusion, it should be recognized that the large number of possible

regional determinants of mortality and the lack of information about most of

them will make it difficult to identify specific sources of locational differ-

ences in mortality that may be found.     It should be noted that the influence
                                      12


of a particular region on mortality could have changed overtime, but that lack

of data restricts study of this issue.

      Slaves per Ton. Gastrointestinal diseases such as shigellosis are often

highly contagious.2° Transmission is common through the fecal-oral route,

usually by way of contaminated hands or food. Shigellosis does not confer

long—term immunity because reinfections are frequent, and the multiplicity of

strains precludes resistence to all varieties. Assuming that all instances of

gastrointestinal diseases were not acquired by contamination from a central

source such as food or water, the spread of these diseases would have varied

with density. Thus slaves per ton may have influenced slave death rates. To

the extent that the crew avoided slaves and slave living areas or had resist—

ence,   death rates of the crew would have been unrelated to slaves per ton.
        Season. The number of sites available for mosquito larvae, and therefore
the mosquito population, may have increased during the rainy season.21 In
addition, mosquitoes have may been more active and survived for   longer periods
in   humid as opposed to dry weather. Thus the chances of infection from mala-

ria may have increased during the rainy season. Some observers have noted an

increase    in the incidence of 'fevers" during the rainy season.22 Rain and
high humidity may also have prolonged the survival and increased the probabil-
ity of    transmission of bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal diseases.

        Time. The spread of infectious disease inevitably involves time. Fac-

tors that may influence the profile of mortality over time include patterns of

activity that affect the chances of exposure to pathogens, the mechanism of

transmission, the incubation period of the disease, and the interval from the

onset of illness to death. Diseases have characteristic incubation periods

 and intervals from the first symptoms to death. Given information about
                                            13


causes of death, the time profile of mortality may be informative about the

mechanism of transmission and the patterns of activity that led to disease.

        The results involving slaves and crew are given in Tables 5 and 6. Since

the chances of deaths should have been a function of the number of persons at

risk,   the regressions include the number of slaves (or crew) as independent
variables.      The values of -2   log A,   where A is the likelihood ratio, show that

each regression is highly significant. Significance tests for groups of coef-

ficients    are given in   the notes to the tables.

        Among   slaves the deaths from fevers and gastrointestinal diseases by
region of origin were systematically higher in the Bight of Biafra, Compared
to   other regions, the probability of deaths among slaves boarded in the Bight

of Biafra was 31 precent higher for gastrointestinal diseases and 58 percent

higher for fevers.23 The Bight of Biafra was also deadly for the crew,

especially for gastrointestinal diseases. However, the chances of crew deatris

from fevers were systematically highest on the Windward Coast and systemati-

cally lowest on the Gold Coast. The highest chances of crew deaths from gas-

trointestinal diseases occurred in Senegambia.

        Crowding, or slaves per ton, was included in the regressions involving

fevers on the grounds that some gastrointestinal diseases may have been mis-

diagnosed as fevers. Because the relationship between crowding and mortality

may have been nonlinear, the regressions include a polynomial in slaves per

ton. The tests reported in the notes to Table 6 show that crowding had no

systematic influence on crew deaths. The explanation for the lack of associa-

tion is unclear, but if the diet and health of the crew was relatively good,

it   would have imposed a gastric acid barrier to the spread of gastrointestinal
infections. It is also possible that the crew avoided contact and therefore
                                        14


contamination from slaves, or that the crew was largely immune (i.e. the crew

was   the source of slave gastrointestinal infections) to the diseases involved.
The tests reported in the notes to Table 5     establish that slave deaths were

systematically linked to crowding. Figure 1 shows that the chances of gastro-

intestinal infection implied by the regression increased roughly ten fold as

the ships approached carrying capacity. This pattern is consistent with

higher probabilities of transmitting infection through contact as density

increased.     If some gastrointestinal diseases were misdiagnosed as fevers, it

is not surprising that the chances of deaths from "fevers would have been

related   to slaves per ton. Figure     1 shows, however, that the chances of

deaths    from fevers eventually declined as slaves per ton rose. The reason for
this pattern is unknown, but it    is   possible that some of the fevers were
caused by mosquitoes and that for reasons of safety and control of the cargo,

the ships anchored further from shore at hiijh defisities.

       The chances of crew deaths from gastrointestinal diseases were not

systematically related to time as measured by a polynomial in day of loading.

The   day of loading coefficients involving fevers were significantly different
from 0 at .10; deaths were systematically lower early in the loading process,
possibly    because of the delay between infection and mortality for diseases
such as malaria

       Slave deaths from gastrointestinal diseases were systematically higher

during    the rainy season (June, July, and August north of the equator and
December, January, and February south of the equator).24 Rain apparently had
no influence on the chances of crew deaths from gastrointestinal causes or on
deaths from fevers. Infective mosquitoes may have been sufficiently prevalent
year-round that the chances of infection varied little by season of the year.
                                                 15


It is also possible t:hat infective mosquitoes were more prevalent during the

rainy season and that patterns of activity, such as expeditions to the

interior, were curtailed in ways that offset the greater risk of infection.

        Experiments with other variables include a proxy for the price of slaves,

a measure of association between slave and crew deaths, measures of duration

that slaves had been on board, theage and sex ratios of slaves, recent load-

ing of slaves, year of activity, and month of the year. Since bonuses and

other income received by the captain, the surgeon, and the crew varied with

the value of the cargo, there were incentives to improve care as a function of

slave   prices. Unfortunately, reliable annual data on slave prices are lacking
or have not yet been assembled for the late eighteenth century. Experiments
using the price of        sugar as a proxy for        the price of slaves failed        to uncover

any systematic relationship with slave mortality. The incentives at low

pricesmay      have been sufficient to elicit all the care that they were willing

to exert, or were able to exert given the primitive state of health care know-

ledge. The reasons in theory why the price of                   slaves and the price of sugar
may not have been highly correlated also suggest that sugar prices may have

been a poor proxy for slave prices; for example, fluctuations in weather could

have changed the supply and therefore the price of sugar in                      ways that had

little influence on slave prices.

      In an effort to investigate the possible transmission of gastrointestinal

diseases from slaves to the crew and vice versa, dummy variables representing

death of slaves (or crew) from gastrointestinal causes within the previous

week were included as explanatory variables in the regressions for gastroin-

testinal diseases. The results showed that there was no systematic interac-

tion between slave and crew mortality.
                                      16


       Because individual slaves were not tagged by date of entry or exit from

the ship, it is impossible to measure accurately the length of time that the

typical slave had been on board. Since life on the ship was probably debili-

tating, duration aboard may have influenced the incidence and course of

disease. Experiments with measures of average duration constructed on various

assumptions about flows (such as first on, first off and last on, first off)

were unsatisfactory; the procedures sometimes produced impossible results

(negative numbers of slaves at risk on some days, for example) and in those

cases in which the measures could not be rejected out of hand, there was no

systematic association with mortality.

       Differential patterns of exposure, immunity, and resistence to disease

may have affected death rates by age and sex. Children, for example, may have

acquired fewer immunities than adults Patterns in African societies of

demand for labor and ccess to food by age and sex and differential treatment

after enslavement could have led to differential mortality for males and

females. In the subset of observations providing the relevant information,

the shares of the cargo enumerated as females and children were included as

explanatory variables. Age and sex composition had no statistically signifi-

cant influence on fevers, but the chances of deaths from gastromtestinal

causes were systematically higher among females and children.

       The chances that someone harbored or transmitted a disease may have

increased with the number of slaves or crew aboard and with the recent addi-

tion   of slaves to the ship. Experiments with these variables failed to un-
cover any systematic influences. Quadratic terms in the number of slaves and
number of crew, and the number of slaves loaded within the previous week were

statistically insignificant when included in the regressions for fevers and

for gastrointestinal diseases.
                                        17


        Although the data employed in the paper pertain to only 5 years (1792—
1796), it is possible that captains and surgeons adjusted to the incentives of
Dolben's Act in ways that reduced mortality. A linear term in year of the

activity was included in the regressions, and the coefficient was negative and

statistically significant (t=—3.47) for gastrointestinal       diseases but statis-
tically insignificant for fevers. During the voyage the coefficient of the
year   was statistically insignificant in both regressions.      It is possible that

health was improved by methods that applied while loading but not during the

voyage.

       The regression models incorporate seasonal phenomena by including a dummy

variable for the     rainy season, but in reality seasonal phenomena influencing
health    and mortality were more complex than this simple dichotorr'. Patterns

of rainfall, food supply, insect vectors, and human activities varied through-.

out the year and by region in ways that make it    difficult   to predict the net

influence     of all relevant factors.25 Empirical investigation of these phenoni—
ena among slaves is restricted by the small    number of deaths that occurred

during loading. mong the crew there is sufficient information to include

dummies in month of loading as regressors in the equation for fevers on ships

that loaded north of the equator.      In these data crew deaths were systemati-

cally lower    during the dry season months of March (t=—2.33) and April
(t=-2. 58).    Captai.ns were probably aware of seasonal patterns because days

spent   loading peaked in March (10.7 percent of all days spent loading) and
were lowest during the summer months of the rainy season.

The Voyage

       Although the variables available for study of mortality during the voyage
are similar to those employed for loading, the interpretations may differ.
                                       18


Region of origin, for example, ecompasses only those aspects such as general
health or patterns of activity immediately before departure that continued to
have an influence during the voyage. Thus contrasts between regional effects

during    loading and the voyage may suggest interpretations of the regional
van ables.

       Table 7 shows that the chances of slave deaths from fevers were relative-

ly high among ships departing from Sierra Leone, the Bight of Benin, and

Congo-Angola. Senegambia, Sierra Leone, Congo-Angola, and especially the

Bight of Biafra were major sources of slave deaths from gastrointestinal

diseases. The small sample size limited regional comparisons involving the

crew to the Bight of Biafra versus other regions. Companions    of Tables 5-8
show that the Bight of Biafra was deadly for slaves and crew. The negative
coefficient for crew size in gastrointestinal diseases is unexpected. Errors
;n crewsize estimates may have contributed to this result, although it does
not register in this way in other regressions. Perhaps there was specializa-
tion   within the crew in the case of large ships in ways that concentrated

contamination from gastrointestinal diseases.26

       Crowding as measured by slaves per ton had no systematic influence on the

chances of deaths for slaves or crew during the voyage. The equations shown

in Tables 7 and 8 include only a linear term in slaves per ton on the grounds

that the range of the variable was small across ships during the voyage; how-

ever, a   third degree polynomial in slaves per ton is also statistically insig-
nificant. The lack of association contrasts with the systematic association

found for slaves during loading. Figure 1 shows that the chances of slave

deaths tended to level-off at high densities; thus if the lack of association

at high densities during loading applied to the voyage then the finding may be

an artifact of the limited range of observation during the voyage.
                                       19


       Table 8 shows that crew mortality rates from fevers and gastrointestinal

 diseases were negatively related to length of loading, but the coefficients

 are marginally significant.    If there was a systematic association involving

 length of loading and these causes of death, then the interpretation may be

that the level of exposure to disease increased during loading such that those

who survived were more immune to attacks and death during the voyage.

       Day of the voyage systematically influenced slave deaths from fevers and

gastrointestinial diseases and crew mortality from fevers.27 The relation-

ships estimated from the regressions are given in Figure 2.    In each case the

estimated probabilities of deaths follow an inverted-U pattern as a function

of time. 4mong slaves the peak occurred about 25 days into the voyage for

fevers and 31 days into the voyage for gastrointestinal diseases.    Crew deaths
from   fevers peaked about 12 days into the voyage. The prevalent and most
deadly forn ofrnalaria in Africa was P. falciparum.28 This form usua!ly has
an incubation period of 10 to 14 days, but may be longer, and may kill up to
25 percent of nonimmune adults within 2 weeks of a primary attack.29
                                                                     The days
immediately before a ship's departure usually involved considerable loading of
slaves and interaction with    shore. The interaction probably increased the
crew's exposure to infective mosquitoes; this combined with the range of.in—

cubation periods and the delay from first symptoms to death is consistent with

the time profile of crew mortality from fevers. Yellow fever runs its course

within 5 to 7 days, and so it is unlikely that infections received on shore

contributed to the peak observed during the voyage.    However, the putrid

fevers diagnosed by surgeons are consistent with yellow fever, and it is pos-

sible that infected mosquitoes taken aboard incubated the virus in ways that

led to deaths from the disease more than one week into the voyage.
                                         20


       Compared to the distribution for the crew, slave deaths from fevers

peaked about 2 weeks later and were more concentrated in the upper tail. The

distribution resembles that for gastrointestinal diseases. Most slaves had

probably been infected with malaria prior to capture, while traveling to the

coast, or while being held on the coast.       It is doubtful that slaves with

fever symptoms were loaded. Furthermore, relapses do not occur in P. falci—

parum.30 These considerations combined with the possibilities for misdiagno—

sis   and the sensitivity of deaths from Hfeversu to density during crowding
suggest that a large share of the slave deaths attributed to fevers during
the   voyage may have been of gastrointestinal origin.

       The time pattern of deaths from gastrointestinal diseases shown in Figure

2 is consistent with diffusion by personal contact and      with contamination from
a central source.        In the case of personal contact the time pattern of deaths

on    individual ships   would have resembled an inverted—U, and in the latter case

the   incidence of the first death across     ships would have followed the

inverted-U pattern, but deaths on a particular ship should have been bunched

together, differing only by individual differences in the incubation period.

While it is impossible to measure the relative importance of these processes

from the available data, information in Tables 9 and 10 suggests that spread

by    personal contact was a general tendency. Table 9 shows that the average
interval    from the beginnng of the voyage to the first death was 17.1 days,

which is significantly less than the interval of roughly 30 days predicted by
the central source hypothesis. The incubation period for shigellosis ranges

 from 1 to 6 days and averages 5 days.31 The fact that       the average intervals
 between deaths 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3 exceeded the average incubation

 period   casts further doubt on the central source explanation. In addition,
                                       21


the   size and decline of the intervals is consistent with a diffusion by con-

tact process. Table 10 shows that one—half of the ships with 2 or more deaths

from gastrointestinal diseases had average intervals between deaths that

exceeded the upper range of the incubation period of 6 days. Because 10 out

of   26 ships had average intervals under 5   days, however, one cannot rule out

instances   of contamination from a central source.    Indeed, instances of more
complex processes such as spread by contact combined with contamination from a

      Experiments conducted with other variables include the ratio of actual to
expected voyage length, dumniy variables representing interaction of slave and
crew deaths from gastrointestinal causes within the previous week, measures of
average duration that slaves had been on board, age and sex ratios, and qua-
dratic terms in crew size and number of slaves. The latter four experiments

were also conducted for loading and the results were similar with the excep-

tions that death of a slave from a gastrointestinal disease had a marginally

significant (t=1.85) positive influence on the chances of crew deaths and that

the shares of females and children had positive but not statistically signifi-

cant influences   on gastrointestinal diseases, Possible interpretations of the
interaction   between slaves and crew are that crew health, and therefore

resistence, deteriorated from loading to the voyage, and that the amount of

contamination from slaves was greater during the voyage because slaves ill

with dysentery could not be sent on shore. Females and children vulnerable to

disease while loading may have acquired immunities and possibly more food by

the time of the voyage. With regard to expectations, predicted length was

calculated from a regression of observed length on ship size in tons, region

of origin in Africa, and destination in the West Indies (Jamaica versus the
                                       22


outer   islands).32 The argument for including the ratio of actual to expleted

length is that provisions would have been depleted and death rates should have

risen on unusually long voyages. The ratio of actual to expected length,

interacted with day of the voyage or entered alone, had no systematic

influence on crew or slave deaths from fevers or gastrointestinal diseases.

This    result is not surprising in view of the findings, shown in Figure 2, that
deaths from the diseases in question were concentrated in the middle of the
voyage.


                         COMPARISONS WITH OTHER RESEARCH

        Important topics of earlier research on the Atlantic slave trade include

variations   in mortality by place of origin in Africa, crowding, voyage length,
age and sex ratios,    epidemics, and the relationship between slave and crew

mortality.    The following section compares the finding of this   research with

previous   work in each of these areas.

Location   in Africa

        At the outset it should be recognized that mortality comparisons across

regions are hazardous because factors other than region may have been in-

volved. This qualification aside, others have found high rates of mortality.

in routes from East—South Africa (Mozambique) and Biafra.33 Comparisons with

Mozambique are not possible because the data of this study do not include voy-

ages from that area. There are many possible explanations for high death

rates from Biafra, including adverse health at enslavement, poor conditions on

the journey to the coast and while being held for shipment, the exposure of

slaves from remote areas to a new disease environment, and a harsh disease

environment. While high death rates for slave and crew in Biafra (shown in
                                      23


Tables 5—8) could have been the result of the coincidence of different fac-
tors, the poor experience of slaves and crew is consistent with a harsh
disease environment.


Crowding

      Although contemporary critics of the slave trade widely regarded crowding

or "tight packing" of slaves as unhealthy, early regulations limited crowding,

and connections between density and mortality are inherently plausible within

a framework of the spread of infectious disease, recent quantitative studies

fail to establish a connection between slaves per ton and mortality.34 This

paper demonstrates that variations in crowding were crucial to variations in

death rates during   loading. The contrasting results are   reconcilable by

Figure 1, which shows that the chances of deaths changed little with increas-

ing density above 1.5 slaves per ton. Admittedly Figure 1 does not extend to

densities in the area of 2 to 3 slaves per ton that prevailed outside the era

of regulation, but findings by others that overall mortality varied little

across voyages within the higher ranges are consistent with the hypothesis

that the relationship changed little across high densities. It appears that

Dolben's Act may have had little effect on mortality because the limits on

crowding were not sufficiently restrictive.


Voyage Length

      It   has been widely, though not universally, noted that the share of the
cargo dying increased with time at sea.35 Whether there should have been a
positive relationship has not been   debated. Instead   controversy centers on

the   profile of mortality within the voyage, and specifically on the   relative

importance    of high mortality rates at the beginning as opposed to the end of
                                      24


the journey.    It has been argued that the former would have been associated

with poor conditions in Africa and the latter with poor conditions on the voy-

age, especially near the end of unusually long voyages. Neither of these pat-

terns is supported by this study, at least not for the major causes of death

studied in detail. This research suggests that high density possibly aggre—

vated by poor health before loading and poor nutrition during the voyage led

to high death rates from gastrointestinal diseases near the middle of the voy-

age.

       These results suggest directions for further research. Data on voyage

length and share of slaves who died may be inadequate for measuring the im-

portance of provisioning because the diseases involved are crucial to the ar-

gument; specifically, if there was screening before loading one would expect

deaths from epidemic diseases having relatively long incubation periods (such

as smallpox and measles, in which it is about two weeks) to accumulate near

the    end of the voyage. Furthermore, deaths resulting from reduced provisions
need not have been concentrated at the end of the voyage. Delays in voyages
crossing the equator occurred frequently in the doldrums off the coast of
Africa. Ship captains probably adjusted provisions as a function of where the
ship was in relation to where it was expected to be.36 Thus, rations could
have been cut early in the voyage and restored near the end of an unusually

long journey Even with "normal provisions the journey was probably debili-

tating, and thus the rise in death rates from respiratory diseases and scurvy

reported    in Table 3 is consistent with   the argument that conditions on the

ship    were important to health.37 Third, high death rates early in the voyage
may be consistent with poor conditions in Africa, but low death rates early in
the voyage do not necessarily irrply that conditions in Africa were goodu;
                                      25


captains and surgeons may have avoided areas with epidemics and may have been

successful in screening slaves in poor health. Finally, greater attention

shoud be given to the interaction of conditions in Africa with those on the

ship.    One of the contributions of the study of heights has been to alert
researchers to the nature   and extent of interaction among nutrition, disease,

and   growth.3A Thus, for example, the effects of famines in Africa on mortal-
ity during the voyage may have been a function of crowding, provisioning, and
voyage length.

Age and Sex

        Studies examining differential mortality by age have usually found that
rates   were higher for children.39 No systematic pattern has emerged involving

males versus females. Findings in this study that chances of deaths from gas-

trointestinal diseases during loading were higher for children and females are

generally consistent with previous work.


Epidemics

        Although the role of epidemics are difficult to appraise from aggregate

measures such as the share of slaves embarked who died, it is clear from qual-

itative evidence for the entire slave trade that the spread of infectious

diseases such as dysentery, smallpox, and measles were important in overall

mortality. As many as 20 to 30 percent or more of the ships in some trades,

especially those of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, had deaths

as a share of slaves embarked in excess of 15 percent.40 In these data the

average share of slaves who died was 2.4 percent, the share exceeded 4 percent

for only 10 out of 92 vessels (the distribution is given in Table 11 of the

appendix)    and the highest share in the sample was 13.8 percent. The favorable
                                      26


record stems in part from the lack of deaths from smallpox and measles.     It


also appears that the spread of dysentery may have been contained in these

data relative to vessels that had high mortality rates; only 60 percent of the

ships in the sample reported one or more and only 33 percent reported two or

more deaths from gastrointestinal diseases.


Slaves and Crew

     The issues of slave and crew mortality involve comparative levels and the

extent    of interrelation. The few data available on these questions indicate
that crew mortality exceed that for slaves and that the two were positively,
though, weakly, correlated.41 The fact that slaves and crew tended to die
from different causes would lead one to expect at most a weak positive corre

lation between overall slave and crew death rates. This study suggests that

passage   of gastrointestinal diseases from slaves to crews during the voyage
was a source of that correlation. Though minor in these data, respiratory
diseases and scurvy may have been important causes of death common to slaves
and crew in earlier eras of the trade.

     Although the literature on the slave trade seldom includes estimates of

crew mortality, West Africa acquired a reputation among Europeans as the

uwhite man's grave." Crew death rates probably remained high until progress

was made against malaria and yellow fever beginning in the mid—nineteenth

century. Thus the finding in this paper that the annual death rate during

loading   and the voyage combined was 229.5 per thousand for the crew is not
surprising   in light of other studies. The comparable figure among slaves of

82.8 per thousand is surprising for the extent to which it was below that for

the crew. The next section discusses the low death rate for slaves.

                                CONCLUDING REMARKS

     Using data giving date and cause of death this study has found that

fevers and gastrointestinal diseases were the major cause of death for slaves

and crew in the English slave trade to the West Indies during the late 1700s.

The crew died primarily from fevers (mostly malaria) contracted in Africa, and

gastrointestinal diseases such as dysentery that spread during the voyage were

the major cause of slave deaths. The chances of slave and crew deaths varied

systematically   by region of origin in Africa, season   of the year, and day of

the voyage; for slaves alone by density on board ship, age, and sex; and for

the crew alone by recent occurrence of slave deaths from gastrointestinal

diseases during the voyage.

     The incidence of mortality as measured by the number of deaths as a share

of slaves embarked was low in these data compared to the slave trade in other

times, which raises the question of the generality of these results.     In light

of this study, why might death rates have been higher elsewhere? There are

several possible explanations. First, diseases such as smallpox and measles

that were prevalent in other times were virtually absent from these data.

Inoculation may have been effective in reducing the incidence of smallpox on

the ships of the surgeons' logs. Second, knowledge and experience involving

health and mortality in the slave trade had accumulated by the late 1700s.

Practices at this time were not guided by a germ theory of disease, but pre-

sumably trial, error, and observation had eliminated some practices that con-

tributed to deaths. One would expect that the rise in slave prices that

occurred from the late 1600s provided an incentive for innovation in health

care.42 Third, Dolben's Act may have lowered mortality. To the extent that

limits on capacity allowed room for more provisions, health may have

improved.43 The fact that deaths from respiratiory diseases and scurvy were
                                     28


low in these data is consistent with this explanation. In addition, the

incentives of the act may have encouraged surgeons to screen carefully slaves

in poor health. Fourth, conditions on slave ships were unhealthy, and the

less time spent in this environment, the lower the share of slaves who died.

Loading times and voyage length declined from the seventeenth through the end

of the eighteenth century.44 Finally, nutritional and demographic conditions

in Africa could have changed in ways that led to slaves who were in better

health before loading. Additional studies of slave mortality that make use of

data on date and cause of death and conditions in Africa may shed light on

these issues.

      Studies of modern labor markets show that workers receive higher wages

for jobs that, other things being equal, are unpleasant or dangerous.45 The

acquisition of crew members for slave ships constitutes an economic laboratory

fr t"j of       employment under very hazardou conditions. Interest'ng ques

tions about this labor market include the size of compensating wage differen-

tials, whether higher wages were received for destinations to the higher mor-

tality regions of Africa, the extent to which prospective crew members were

informed about the risks, and the nature of compensation. With regard to the

last point one might expect that crew members who were knowledgeable about the

risks would have insisted on some compensation in the form of a signing bonus

that was spendable before the hazardous journey began.

      Comparative studies of mortality rates on ocean voyages would help to

place the slave trade in perspective and to elucidate causes of mortality on

slave and non—slave voyages.46 Data on non-slave voyages to the U.S. are

available, for example, from passenger lists and from forms required by the Pas-

senger Act of 1819. The agenda for research on these questions should include

the   relationship of health before departure to health and mortality during the
                                   29


voyage, the influence of provisioning on mortality, crowding and mortality,

seasonal patters of mortality, age and sex distributions and mortality, the

course of death rates during the voyage, and the time trend in mortality.

                      Appendix:   Discussion of the Data

Origins

      "An act to regulate, for a limited time, the shipping and carrying of

slaves in British vessels from the coast of Africa," also known as flolben's

Act, emerged from the parliamentary debates over the slave trade in 1788.

The act limited vessels to five slaves for every three tons of burden up to

201   tons, and one slave per ton for every ton above 201.48 Ship captains ex-
ceeding this limit were subject to a fine of £ 30 per slave above the limit.
Surgeons on board slave ships were required to maintain a journal encompassing
slave loading, slave and crew deaths, and causes of death. The law specified
that the collector at the port of destination was to administer on oath to the
surgeon attesting the truth of the journal. Captains received £ 100 and sur-
geons received £ 50 if deaths as a fraction of the largest number of slaves on
board did not exceed 2 percent. The awards were £ 50 and £ 25, respectively,
if the rate did not exceed 3 percent.

Characteristics
       An extensive search of the House of Lords Record Office and the Public

Record Office produced 92 surgeons logs that are substantially complete.49

The   typical journal begins with a brief description of the vessel (name, names
of master and surgeon, home port and tonnage) followed by sections on loading
and unloading by day in categories of men, women, boys, and girls: chronologi-

cal lists of slave and crew deaths; and the oath signed by the surgeon.

       The dates of departure from Africa of the ships in the sample span the

period from 1792 to 1796. Roughly one-third of the departures occurred in

1793 and only 9 voyages took place in 1794. The typical vessel loaded for 119

days, (s.d. = 92 days) but the range of experience encompassed 1 to 529 days.
                                         31


Approximately 28,770 slaves departed from Africa, of whom 63.7 percent were

males and 9.6 percent were children. The average ship carried 313 slaves and

had a capacity of 222 tons. All the major regions of supply along the west

coast of Africa are represented in the sample; 3 originated from Senegambia,

11 from Sierra Leone, 2 from the Windward Coast, 13 from the Gold Coast, 7

from the Bight of Benin, 8 from the Bight of Biafra, 18 from Congo—Angola, and

the area of origin for 30 vessels is unknown. The typical voyage took 56 days

(s.d. =       15.3 days) and the range was from 23 to 105 days. All the slaves were

destined      for the British West Indies and three—quarters of the ships went to
Jamai ca.


Bi ases

        The   logs of 16 vessels specify the day of arrival at the port   of destina-

tion. Arrival times for 71 vessel were inferred from the day the surgeon's

oath was signed. Arrival information is incomplete or lacking for 5 logs.

Presumably the surgeon ceased to record deaths when the vessel reached port.50

If the oath was administered after the day the vessel reached port, then death

rates calculated for the end of the voyage would be biased downwards because

the number of days at risk for recording deaths      would be overstated.

        Fortunately   12 vessels reported the actual day of arrival and have the

oath.     In this sample the average lag between the day of the oath and the

reported      day of arrival is 2.1 days, and the range is   from 0 to 5 days. The

distortion      to calculated death rates is relatively minor if the experience of
these vessels applied to those for which we lack information.
        Throughout the period of the slave trade entrepreneurs commonly rewarded
masters, surgeons, and certain members of the crew for efforts to maintain the
health    of the cargo. Bonuses took the form of shares of the sales receipts,
                                        32


head money, and privilege slaves.51 The extent to which Dolben's Act may

have   contributed to total incentives is not clear; entrepreneurs could have
allowed legislated incentives to substitute for their own.
       Table 11 shows the frequency distribution of recorded deaths as a share
of slaves exported from Africa. The clusters of observations at or below 2
percent and 3 percent combined with the cut-off point for bonuses under Dol—
ben's Act raise the suspicion that some deaths may      not have been recorded.

       The   observation that death rates in the Atlantic slave trade were rela-
tively low during the      1790s appears to support the underreporting thesis.52

In   defense of the data, however, it should be recognized that good reasons
exist for the low death rate (see the concluding section of the      paper). While

substantial     underreporting cannot be entirely ruled out, the favorable situa-
tion    with respect to epidemic diseases of smallpox and measles, for example,

makes the calculated aeath rates plausible.
        Even if there was substantial underreporting, the implications for our
 understanding of determinants of mortality heavily depends upon selectivity of

 underreporting.     If   deaths were not reported at random, for example, then many

 conclusions    about regional influences, seasonal patterns, and the course of
 events during the voyage remain largely intact.
        A selective form of underreporting perhaps worth   discussion involves the

 end   of the voyage. The decline in calculated death rates after the middle of
 the voyage combined with the chronological organization of the journals sug-
 gests that a simple strategy for collecting bonuses under Dolben's Act for
 ships that were near the margin for collection was to      neglect to report deaths

 near   the end of the voyage. Since all slaves loaded had to he accounted for,
                                    33


this required falsification of loading records. While this form of under-

reporting may have existed, it is relevant to note that the time profile of

deaths (available for gastrointestinal diseases only) on vessels that exceeded

the 3 percent minimum reached a peak on day 35 of the voyage and then declined

at a rate similar to that for the entire sample shown in Figure 2.

probabilities along the lines of those discussed in the text.

2. Miller, "Mortality in the Atlantic Slave Trade," and Eltis, "Mortality and

     Voyage Length" employ the second measure.

3. A total of 7 slaves in the sample were returned to shore as sick. These

     unloadings were arbitrarily counted as deaths.

4.   The estimated relationship is

          Crew = 11.64 + 0. 07956 Tons, N = 45, R2 =   .62
                 (5.43) (8.46)

     T—values are given in parenthesis. Simple non—linear functional forms fit

     little or no better than the simple linear form.

5.   The terms "death rate" and "mortality rate" are sometimes used loosely and

     interchangeably. According to usage by demographers death rates are based

     on the average number of person-years at risk during a time period and

     mortality rates are based on the number at risk at the beginning of a time

     period.   If there is little change in the number of persons at risk during

     the interval, the difference between the measures is small. Given the

     loading and unloading of slaves it is approiate to use death rates as op-

     posed to mortality rates in this paper. For a discussion of terminology

     see Henry S. Shryock and Jacob S. Siegel, The Methods and Materials of

     Demography (Washington, 1975), vol. 2, chap. 14.

7.   The potential for contaminated water suggests that typhoid may have

     contributed    to deaths from fevers. Typhus is an unlikely cause of fevers
     because it is usually associated with blankets and clothing characteristic
     of colder climates.
8.   Symptons of tropical diseases are discussed in G.      Thomas Strickland,

     Hunter's   Tropical Medicine (Philadelphia, 1984) and Oscar   Felsenfeld, The

     Epidemiology   of Tropical Diseases (Springfield, Ill., 1966). R. Hoeppli,
     Parasitic Diseases in Africa and the Western Hemisphere: Early
     Documentation and Transmission by the Slave Trade (Basél, 1969), p. 62
     notes that as late as   the early nineteenth century dysentery was thought

     to   be but oneof the symptoms of malaria.
9. Data in B.R. Mitchell, European Historical Statistics, 1750—1970 (New
     York, 1975), Table B6 show that crude death rates in European populations
     of   the late 1700s and early 1800s commonly fell in   the interval of 20 to
     30 per thousand. The model West level 7 life tables of Ansley J. Coale

     and Paul Demeny, Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations (Prin-

     ceton, 1966) has crude death rates in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 per

     thousand (given reasonable assumptions of the range of European birth

     rates), and is a conservative (high mortality) benchmark for these popu-

     lations. The average of the age-specific mortality rates for males in the

     level 7 table for age groups 10-15 to 30—34 is 10.4 per thousand.

            Soldiers not engaged in combat are a reference group against which

     the experiences of slaves and crew can be compared. The annual death rate

     among Dragoon guards serving in the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1836 was
                                          37


      14 per thousand from disease and 1.3 per thousand from suicide, murder,

      and accidents (see Parliamentary Papers, Statistical Report on the

      Sickness, Mortality, and Invaliding Among the Troops in the United Kingdom

      (London, 1839), p. 4).

10. The model West level 1 life table has crude death rates in the neighbor-

      hood of 47 to 51 per thousand (given reasonable assumptions about the

      range of European birth rates). In this table the average of the age—

      specific mortality rates for males in the age groups 10—14 to 30—34 is 18

      per thousand.

18. The share of deaths occurring on days in which there were two or more

      deaths was so low that it justifies the use of a logit model as an

      approximation for calcuating probabilities of death. Only 3.3 percent of

      crew deaths from fevers, for example, occurred on days in which there

      were two or more deaths. Pmong the eight data sets used, the largest

      share of deaths occuring on days in which there were two or more deaths

      (12.7 percent) involved slaves dying from gastrointestinal diseases

      during the voyage.

23. The probabilities were calculated from the regression coefficients and

      the logistic function by evaluating other independent variables at their

      sample mean. Similar calculations giving relative risks of deaths for

      other variables can be done using the sample means given in the appendix.

27.   The last 13 days of observations for voyages going to Jamaica are not

      included in the regressions on the grounds that provisions acquired from

      a landfall on one of the outer islands may have lessened the comparabil-

      ity with non—Jamaica—bound voyages. Thus all voyages "ended" when a

      landfall was made.

      ble for the inverted—U pattern. However, poorly-nourished slaves who
                                            40

      contracted the disease on shore could have died from it during the

      The omitted variables are Senegambia,         Sierra Leone, and       Windward Coast.

      This group of variables was omitted because there was no statiscally sig-

      nificant difference in voyage length from these areas. The data source

      is the Return to an Order of the Right Honorable the House of Lords dated

      the 10th of July 1799, directing that the clerk of the Parliments do

      cause to be extracted from the several log books and Journals of Ships

      employed in the Slave Trade in each year 1791 to 1797 ..., dated 28 July

      1800.     Only those observations from this source having all relevant

      information on tons, origin, destination, and dates were used.

36. Dow, Slave Ships, pp. 144—145 discusses problems of adjusting provisions

      L. Schwartz, Dynamic Optimization: The Calculus of Variations and

      Optimal Control in Economics and Management.

37. By way of perspective on the data in Table 3, relatively few voyages in

      these data were unusually long by standards of the entire slave trade

      (only 8 percent exceeded 75 days, for example), and limits on slave

      capacity under Dolben's Act may have enabled ships to carry additional

      provisions.

48.   If more thn 40 percent of the slaves were children (defined as no more

      than 4 feet 4 inches) then every five children over the 40 percent

      counted as four slaves.

49.   Judy Collingwood conducted the search. Logs that failed to give dates of
      slave deaths were ignored. Information sometimes missing from the papers
      available   to me includes dates of loading (2 logs), crew deaths (27

      logs), destination (1 log), causes of crew deaths (5 logs out of the 65

      containing crew deaths), and causes of slave deaths (9 logs).
