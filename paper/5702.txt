                                            ABSTRACT


        Social policies, particularly environmental and labour issues, are not new to trade policy fora

including   the GATT.    However, they are likely to have a more prominent role in trade policy

discussions in the years ahead for the new World Trade Organization.      Many developing countries

perceive the entwining of these social issues with trade policy as a threat to both their sovereignty

and their economies, while significant groups in advanced economies consider it unfair, ecologically

unsound, even immoral to trade with countries adopting much lower standards than theirs,

        This paper examines why these issues are becoming more prominent, whether the WTO is

an appropriate forum to discuss them, and how they affect developing and other economies.            It

concludes that (a) the direct effect on developing economies is likely to be small and for some may

even be positive through improved terms of trade and/or compensatory       transfer payments, but (b)

there is an important indirect negative effect on them and other economies, namely, the potential

erosion of the rules-based multilateral trading system that would result from an over-use of trade

measures to pursue environmental    or labour market objectives.

 SOCIAL POLICY DIMENSIONS                           OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION:

              ENVIRONMENTAL                   AND LABOUR STANDARDS

Despite the conclusion        of the Uruguay Round negotiations       in 1994 and the conversion

during 1995 of the GATT Secretariat into a more-influential            World Trade Organization

(the WTO),     trade tensions     between    nations   remain considerable.     Part of the tension

continues    because of social policy differences        across countries:    differences    in worker

rights and standards, in human rights more generally, in technical standards of production,

in natural resource and environmental        policies, in animal welfare issues, in education and

health policies, in support for national culture or exclusion of foreign cultural influences,

and so on. Some countries have sought to use trade policy as a stick or carrot to induce

other countries     to adopt something      closer to their social policy standards.        The United

States, for example, routinely does this in its dealings with China over human rights. It

has also used trade policy with Mexico in pursuit of animal welfare (the famous dolphin-

tuna case), and with Vietnam in pursuit of the interests of US families of missing-in-

action soldiers.




Apparently    social policy differences      are becoming more important        in disputes between

countries.   Why?     Under    what circumstances      (if any) is trade policy      an appropriate

instrument   for resolving such disputes? What are the implications           for the global trading
                                                        4


system, for regional trading arrangements,               and for their interaction?        What if anything

should East Asian countries             and perhaps         APEC do about this development?                These

questions    are addressed in this paper by focusing mainly on environmental                      issues and

trade, since their entwining         in policy circles is arguably the most controversial               and the

matter is already on the WTO’s work agenda. Some discussion                        of the trade and labour

standards     issue   also    is    included     in   the    paper,    partly   because     it parallels     the

trade/environment      debate to some extent, partly because the United States and France

would like to see it added to the WTO’s agenda, and partly because it is already included

in some major regional trade agreements. In fact both issues arose in a significant way in

the NAFTA       negotiations        of the early 1990s, to the point where it appeared                  the US

Congress     was not willing to ratify that agreement without accompanying                      supplemental

agreements on environmental            and labour standards, Since the 1950s these issues also have

been part of West European             integration    negotiations,    most recently with heated debate

among      European   Union        member      governments      at Maastricht     over a ‘social charter’

relating to Iabour standards.




The paper is structured as follows. The first section looks at why social policies in general

are becoming      subjected        to more international       scrutiny,   both regionally     and globally.

Section     two then asks why environmental                  issues   in particular      are becoming      more

entwined     with trade policy. Section three examines                the relationship    between economic

growth, trade, and the environment.            The following section discusses the nature and extent

of entwining     of GATT and the environment.                 This is followed by some speculation            on

what lies ahead for the WTO in its relationship with existing and prospective                     multilateral

environmental     agreements.        Section 6 is devoted to discussing          GATT/WTO         and labour
                                                       5


    standards, showing why their entwining has become an issue in the mid- 1990s and how in

    some (but by no means all) respects the issue of trade and Iabour standards is similar to

    the trade/environment      issue. Both issues have a distinct North-South     dimension, which is

    why developing countries are becoming more concerned about them. The final section of

    the paper focuses on what developing countries and APEC could do in response to these

    developments.




    1. Why social policies are coming under closer international             scrutiny




    Social policy differences across countries are to be expected. Partly they reflect per capita

    income     differences:   as communities      become richer, so does their demand         for social
I
    policies and higher standards. Policy differences exist also because of differences in tastes

    and preferences.      Indeed one of the key reasons for nationhood       is to bring together and

    distinguish   one grouping of people whose preferences are more similar to each other than

    to those      of neighboring       groups    (Alesina   and   Spolaore   1995).     In the case   of

    environmental     policies, they also reflect differences in per capita endowments        of natural

    resources and environmental        amenities. A diversity of social policies therefore contributes
[

    to differences    in countries’   comparative    advantages   in trade and therefore to the gains
I
    from trade.




    As economic       integration   proceeds,   though, pressure increases to reduce differences      in

    social policies      that have economic      consequences.    This has clearly happened      within

    countries in the course of their economic development:         numerous local, state or provincial

    policies/standards     have gradually been replaced by national standards and conformance
                                                          6


assessment       (National    Research     Council      1995). The motivation         is not just to reduce

administrative      and conformance         costs. It also results from concerns           in high-standards

regions that costs of production           for some firms and industries are higher in their region

than in regions       with lower standards,             causing    them to be less competitive.             These

differences      become ever-more important             as traditional    barriers to trade and investment

between regions fall (notably transport and communication                     costs). Harmonization       of those

standards could go in either direction, however, with winners and losers in each region

trying to influence the outcome. And there is no reason to presume that overall national

economic       and social      welfare    will improve          because   of those    social   policies     being

harmonized:       it all depends on how close the most influential                  groups’ standards       are to

those of the median voter.




Similar forces to those intra-national            ones are also at work in the international                arena.

There have been substantial reductions in recent decades in traditional barriers to foreign

import competition,          including    international       transport and communication       costs, tariffs,

and other governmental          border policies that inhibit flows of goods, services, and capital

across   national     borders.l     The     resulting     extra    exposure     of national    economies        to

competition      from abroad -- in part due to the very success of GA~                    in promoting       trade

liberalization    -- has caused attention to focus more sharply on domestic policies, including

cost-raising     social policies     and standards,           that continue     to reduce the international

competitiveness      of some firms and industries               in each country (Bhagwati       1996). These

harmed producers are especially likely to protest when significant new players with lower

standards become competitors,             This has happened          increasingly    during the past quarter
                                                       7


century first with the growth of Asia’s newly industrializing                     economies      and then the

opening up of China and numerous other transition and developing countries.




It has been suggested that one of the driving forces behind regional integration initiatives

has been the tardiness of the GA~             in taking up social policy issues among its large and

diverse group of contracting parties (Lawrence 1995). Achieving agreement to harmonize

social policies     and otherwise       coordinate   trade- and investment-related            domestic   policy

reforms is easier the more similar are the per capita incomes, tastes and preferences of the

countries concerned. Hence we observe the formation of trade blocs more among similar

than disparate economies.         We also observe the inclusion of social in addition to trade

policies     more    in   integration     agreements       involving   richer     than    poorer    countries,

presumably      because (a) the demand for social policies is income elastic, and (b) barriers

to trade and investment flows (both natural and governmental)                   between countries tend to

be lower among rich countries than between them and poorer countries or among poorer

countries.




When dissimilar countries have sought to join such blocs (e.g., Mediterranean                       to the EC,

Mexico to the NAFTA), advocates for higher standards have endeavored                             to tie market

access to the upward harmonization           of social policies. To a considerable            extent they have

succeeded in doing so in the European Union. And in the case of N~A                            they were also

after   President     Clinton   came      into office,     to the extent        that   side   agreements    on

environmental       and labour standards were added to the N~A                  in the closing hours of the

negotiations,
                                                     8


As for trade outside        these blocs, we tend to observe            advocates   for high standards

supporting     import restrictions    on like products       from lower-standard     countries.   Why?

Because such restrictions simultaneously          reduce opposition by local firms to the raising of

standards at home and increase the incentive for foreign firms and their governments                  to

adopt higher standards abroad (out of fear of losing market access), However, such uses

of trade policy are both discriminatory         and protectionist.   That brings advocates for higher

standards both into direct conflict with supporters of liberal world trade and into coalition

with traditional protectionist     interests. Fear of the latter gaining supefilcial respectability

in arguing     against   trade liberalization     has led to claims       that ‘social correctness’   is

becoming the New Protectionism         (Steil 1994).




2. Why environmental         issues are becoming more entwined with trade policy




The list of environmental        concerns with international         or global dimensions   has grown

rapidly in recent years. In addition to people being worried about air, water, soil and

visual pollution    at the local, national and regiona12 levels, some of that pollution               is

believed to be also damaging         the environment       on a global scale, for example through

ozone depletion     and climate change. Some in rich countries              are concerned    that these

problems     will be exacerbated      as economic        growth takes off in newly industrializing

countries    with laxer environmental      standards. More and more people worry also about

resource depletion, species extinction and animal welfare at the global level, regardless of

national boundaries.     Ongoing integration of the world economy also brings with it new

health and safety concerns by consumers of imported products. Needless to say, personal
                                                  9


values play an important role in debates on these issues, Hence there is considerable             scope

for friction between countries with different preferences, resource endowments,               incomes,

and knowledge      about how different activities and policies affect the environment,                 and

therefore different perceptions of optimal national and global environmental              and resource

policies.




Fluctuate    though they might with the business          cycle, these heightened         concerns     for

resource depletion    and the environment     are likely to keep growing. One reason is that,

even though uncertainties       remain, the scientific    basis for many of these concerns              is

perceived to be more solid now than was the case twenty years ago, Another is that both

the world’s population      and its real per capita income continue to increase at very high

rates by h-istorical standards. Unfortunately,    though, the supplies of most natural resources

and environmental     services are limited, and markets for many of them are incomplete                 or

absent.3 Markets     are under-developed    because of disputed,         ambiguous    or non-existent

property rights, or because of the high cost of enforcing those rights.




It is true that the more advanced economies           have established    institutional   structures    to

help handle     the tasks    of arriving   at a social     consensus      on what     are appropriate

environmental    or sustainable development      policies for that society, of allocating property

rights, and of enforcing policies. The same is true in some traditional societies before they

begin to ‘modernize’ and their resources          come under pressure         because     of declining

mortality rates. But it is less true in the newly ‘modernizing’ economies, where the world’s

population   and consumption     growth are expected to be concentrated           for the foreseeable
                                                    10


future. And, at the multilateral      level, co-operative     intergovernmental     mechanisms      in the

environmental     area have only recently begun to be formed and will take some time before

they become very effective, especially where free-rider problems are rife.




So, with sufficient fora yet to be fully developed for multilateral environmental                dialogue,

and with the problems increasingly being perceived as urgent as new scientific evidence

becomes available, there is a growing interest among environmental                  groups -- especially

in the more advanced economies -- in using one of the few policy instruments                    apparently

available     to their governments,       namely trade restrictions,     to influence     environmental

outcomes both at home and abroad.




Environmental       groups     perceive   trade policy     as a means      both    of raising     national

environmental      standards    at home and abroad and of inducing                countries    to become

signatories    to and abide by international      environmental     agreements.      On the first, these

groups are aware that, unless compensated,               firms will oppose the raising of domestic

standards if competitors       abroad are not subjected to similar cost increases. But since the

loss of competitiveness        can be offset by import restrictions        on products        from lower-

standard countries,     such restrictions     can at the same time remove opposition              by local

firms to higher standards at home and increase the incentive for foreign firms and their

governments      to adopt higher standards abroad. Not surprisingly, those features make trade

policy very attractive to environmentalists.




On the second, with respect to international        environmental      agreements, a major attraction

of trade measures is that they can be used effectively as sticks or carrots because they are
                                                    11


relatively easy to use and are immediate in their impact. Even the threat of trade sanctions

can have a rapid and persuasive effect in encouraging                a country to join an international

environmental      agreement and subsequently to abide by its rules.




Already we have seen the use of discriminatory               trade restrictions       affecting particular

targeted products (for example, in the Montreal Protocol on CFC substances that deplete

the ozone layer), There have also been proposals to use trade sanctions against unrelated

products.   These     aim chiefly    at persuading        developing      countries    to adopt    stricter

environmental      standards (for example, threats to provide less open access to textile and

other markets in industrial countries unless logging is curtailed or managed on a more

sustainable basis).




3. The relationships      between economic growth, trade, and the environment




The standard theory of changing comparative              advantages in a growing world economy,

which has been developed without consideration             of environmental       concerns, can readily

be modified      to incorporate   at least some of those concerns.           As espoused      by Krueger

(1977) and Learner (1987), this theory suggests that when a developing country opens up

to international   trade, its exports initially will be specialized in primary products. This is

because its stocks of produced capital relative to natural resources are comparatively                low.

Should those non-natural capital stocks per worker (including human skills) expand more

for this country than globally, the country’s comparative advantage will gradually shift to

more capital- and skill-intensive      activities    (particularly     manufactures     and services).   If

such countries     are relatively land-abundant,      some of that produced capital and new or
                                                      12


newly imported        capital-intensive     technology     may be employed         profitably     to extract

minerals or farm the land. But in most such countries the new capital will encourage the

expansion      of nonprimary       sectors and shift these countries’ comparative         advantage away

from primary products. Thus countries that are lacking in natural resources or that are

densely populated will tend to industrialize          at an earlier stage of economic development,

and their nonprimary exports will tend to be more intensive in the use of unskilled labor

initially.     In the case of manufactures,     the process of upgrading to more capital-intensive

production       over time leaves       room   in international     markets     for later-industrializing

countries also to begin with labour-intensive          export-oriented    manufacturing.




If national      boundaries     were    such   that   there    were no international       environmental

spillovers,     and there were no global commons,              this story need be complicated           only

slightly to incorporate       non-marketed     environmental      services and pollution        by-products.

The complication       required is simply to allow for the fact that as a country’s per capita

income       and industrial    output   grow, the value its citizens        place on the environment

increases     and with it their demands         for proper valuation        of resource    depletion     and

environmental       degradation,     for the assigning and better policing of property rights, and

for the implementation         of costly domestic pollution abatement policies that may induce

the production      and dissemination      of less-pollutive     technologies   -- at least after certain

threshold levels of income and/or pollution are reached.4                Beyond those threshold points

the severity of such abatement policies is likely to be positively correlated with per capita

income, with population density, and with the degree of urbanization.
                                                  13


If all economies     were growing equally rapidly, the progressive             introduction   of national

environmental      taxes and regulations    would tend to cause pollution-intensive           production

processes to gradually relocate from wealthier and/or more densely populated countries to

developing    and/or more sparsely populated countries.s They would also slow or reverse

the growth in the quantity demanded of products whose consumption                      is pollutive,   and

more so in wealthier       and/or more densely populated           countries     where taxes on such

products would tend to be highest. If more-advanced           economies         are net importers      (net

exporters)   of products    whose production       (consumption)      is pollutive,     these countries’

optimal environmental      policies would worsen their terms of trade to the benefit of poorer

economies,    and conversely       (Siebert et al. 1980; Anderson     1992a). Thus even countries

without (or with unchanged) environmental         policies will be affected through foreign trade

and investment     by the development      of environmental   policies that accompany growth in

other economies.b The extent of international relocation of productive activities due to the

raising and enforcement      of environmental    standards should not be exaggerated, however.

Recent studies suggest the effect of such policies on comparative                  costs may be quite

minor.’




The story becomes more complicated,          however, when account is taken of policy reactions

to international   environmental     problems such as the global commons, species depletion or

animal rights. The ban on ivory trade under the Convention                on International      Trade in

Endangered      Species   (CITES)     provides   an extreme   example:         the strong comparative

advantage    that southern African nations had in elephant products virtually disappeared

when the ban was introduced in 1989, Another is the recent ban, adopted under the Basel
                                                      14


Convention       relating to hazardous       waste, on exports of so-called hmardous                recyclable

from industrial       to developing      countries:   that ban threatens        the growth prospects           for

recycling industries         in developing   countries. A third example is the proposed limitation

on imports into some high-income             countries of tropical hardwoods, the aim of which is to

discourage deforestation.         An import ban of this kind would reduce export growth in logs

and perhaps sawn timber in those developing countries still well endowed with hardwood

forests, while improving          the terms of trade of other net importers of hardwood                 such as

Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In addition, the Montreal Protocol on phasing out the use of

ozone-depleting       CFCS incorporates discriminatory          trade provisions,       designed to limit the

relocation      from signatory     to non-signatory       countries     of industries   producing     or using

CFCS, as well as encouraging           non-signatories     to accede to the Protocol.s And there is the

infamous example of the United States ban on the importation of Mexican tuna which US

authorities deem to have been caught in dolphin-unfriendly                  nets: domestic US regulations

affecting    the use of dolphin-unfriendly               nets on US registered           fishing    vessels,     if

implemented       alone, would have boosted Mexican competitiveness                 in tuna fishing, but the

subsequent      ban on tuna imports instead reduced it. As is clear in the latter two examples,

the motive for trade policy action is often a mixture of national competitiveness                     concerns

and concerns -- especially in wealthier countries (typically not shared to the same extent

by developing countries) -- for the global commons and for animal welfare.




Two facts        therefore    need to be recognised.          The first is that there are important

international     environmental      spillovers   beyond the simple transborder            ones that can be

handled through negotiations           between governments            of affected neighboring        countries.
                                                   15


Those spillovers are of two sorts: in addition to the physical damage our activities can do

to the global environment         regardless of the location on the globe of those activities, there

are -- for want of a better term -- psychological          spillovers as well. For example, I may

grieve if another country’s activities threaten a particular animal or plant species in its

jurisdiction.    Or I may grieve if I believe your desires for higher environmental             standards

in your country are not being recognised            sufficiently   by your national government           (a

political market failure). Controversial        though such views are,9 many people perceive a

need for multilateral     action to reduce these spillover problems,        and that is where trade

policy   measures     enter the debate:      they are seen by environmentalists           as providing

powerful carrots and/or sticks for attracting signatories and/or penalizing non-signatories

to bilateral or multilateral       environmental   agreements,     as well as for encouraging       other

countries to adopt better national environmental         policies for the sake of their own citizens

and environment.




The other fact that needs to be recognised            is that one country’s environmental          policy

choice is not independent of the choices of other countries. Why? Because the imposition

of higher standards or pollution charges at home alters the international              competitiveness

of industries,    in particular    by harming the more pollution-intensive        industries.     If their

competitors      abroad were not subjected to similar cost-raising         policies,   such industries

would lobby against the imposition of higher standards at home. And while it is true that

the less-pollutive    industries at home would benefit from higher environmental             standards,

they are more diffuse and so are not likely to add much support to the environmentalists’

lobbying.
                                                      16


It was because of this latter fact that trade policy first entered the environmental                 picture,

back in the latter 1960s when the first wave of widespread concern for the environment

began in industrial countries. As already mentioned, environmental                 groups perceived that,

since the loss of competitiveness            of pollution-intensive      industries     could be offset by

restrictions    on imports from lower-standard         countries, such restrictions could at the same

time reduce opposition       by such industries to higher standards at home and increase the

incentive for foreign firms and their governments              to adopt higher standards          abroad to

avoid being subjected to anti ‘eco-dumping’ duties.




The demand for unilateral use of trade policy for this latter reason has grown over time

with the internationalization         of the global economy, in two ways. One is that, with the

decline in traditional trade barriers (tariffs, transport and communication                 costs, etc.), any

given environmental       charge is becoming relatively more important                  as a determinant    of

international     competitiveness,      ceteris paribus.   And the other is that, with the 1980s’

deregulation     of financial markets and direct foreign investment, the possibilities             for firms

to disinvest      in high-standard      countries   and relocate      their factories     in lower-standard

countries      (’pollution havens’) have increased markedly. Environmental                 groups fear this

will result in governments           delaying the introduction     or enforcement         of environmental

policies -- and possibly even a lowering of standards in a ‘race to the bottom’ -- in their

attempts to attract or retain investments and hence jobs.




Both types of environmental            uses of trade policy -- unilaterally,            and to increase    the

workability of multilateral environmental           agreements -- raise potential conflicts of interest

between rich and poorer countries;            and the fact that discriminatory           trade measures    are
                                                  17


increasingly being used to achieve the environmental             objectives of rich countries, without

regard to legitimate     economic   development        concerns of poorer countries,       increase the

likelihood    of environment-related       trade disputes.    There      is even dispute     over what

constitutes   the global commons:      some would argue that a country or region should not

have to bow to international     pressure to preserve endangered species in their territory (or

at least not without adequate compensation),        while others would argue that such countries

are merely the custodians of those resources for the benefit of humankind generally.




The increasing      use of discriminatory     trade measures       to address environmental       issues

should concern the world at large, and developing countries in particular, for at least four

reasons. First, trade policy measures typically will not be the first-best instruments                for

achieving environmental      objectives. This is because trade sanctions or the threat of trade

sanctions do not directly affect the root cause of the environmental             problem. Their use in

place of more-efficient     instruments   reduces unnecessarily       the level and growth of global

economic welfare as conventional] y measured, and may even add to rather than reduce

global environmental      degradation and resource depletion.10




The second reason for concern is that producer interest groups and some environmental

groups are nevertheless finding it mutually advantageous            to use environmental     arguments

in support of their claims for unilateral         import restrictions,     particularly   following   the

costly imposition     of stricter environmental      standards     on domestic    producers,ll   In this

sense, the environment       can provide     a convenient     additional    excuse for raising trade

barriers -- and one that is socially respectable.         Unfortunately,    such protectionist    action
                                                        18


reduces real incomes not just at home but elsewhere too, especially                        in developing           and

natural resource-abundant         countries.




Third, in so far as this can lead to an escalation in trade disputes -- as is almost inevitable,

especially given the North-South          dimension involved and the fact that environmental                       uses

of trade policy are inherently discriminatory                -- it could be followed by retaliatory                and

counter-retaliatory     action, the end result of which would be an undermining                        of the rules-

based open global trading           system on which the dynamism                of developing            economies

continues to depend.




And the fourth reason to be concerned is that there is another important sense in which

aspects of environmentalism           are putting at risk the global trading system. It is that, in

addition to proposing      the use of trade restrictions,           some environmentalists              also oppose

trade and investment      liberalization.      They oppose the GATT’s attempts to reduce barriers

on at lemt two grounds:           that freer trade means more output and income which they

presume     would       mean    more      resource      depletion    and     degradation         of     the   natural

environment;      and    that     freer   trade   and    investment        encourages      the        relocation     of

environmentally       degrading     industries    to countries with lower environmental                   protection

standards   and/or more fragile natural environments,                and leads to greater transportation

activity which contributes further environmental               damage.




Neither of these assertions is unambiguously                 supported by empirical evidence, however.

The first, that income increases mean greater damage to the natural environment,                              may be

true initially   for some poorer countries           (in which case any additional                environmental
                                                   19


damage has to be weighed against the marginal economic benefits of higher incomes for

poor people),     but once middle-income          status    is reached   people   tend to alter their

behaviour    in ways that reduce pressures on the environment.            A key change is in family

size: higher incomes lead in time to lower population growth rates (Baldwin 1995). This,

along with the increased employment          opportunities     resulting from trade liberalization,    is

likely to have a major effect in reducing the rate of environmental               degradation    due to

population     pressures   in developing     countries.     In rural areas it means fewer people

denuding hillsides to eke out a subsistence income, while in urban areas it means fewer

un- or under-employed      squatters in shanty towns with poor sanitation and water.




Another common behavioral             change as economies open up and incomes rise is that the

demand for education expands, and with more income and education comes more skillful

management      of all resources including the environment,          and more forceful demands on

governments     to improve the establishment       and policing of private property rights and of

more stringent environmental      policies (see footnote 4 above). As well, the political cost of

implementing      such policy reforms tends to fall because of increased            opportunities     for

businesses    to meet stricter standards      by acquiring      more and cheaper environmentally

benign production     processes and products from abroad. One might therefore expect that

as trade and investment liberalization      leads to upward convergence in incomes around the

world, there would be an upward harmonization                 of environmental     standards    (Casella

1996). That realization      points    to the inappropriateness       of the blanket    call by some

environmental     groups for trade liberalization          to follow the upward     harmonization      of

standards, since liberalization   may in fact induce harmonization.
                                                       20


And third, the increase in the value of poor people’s time in developing countries will alter

household     activities in another way which is especially important for the environment.                     It

is that the relative price of wood (in terms of time spent gathering                    it) as a source of

household     fuel rises. Since about three quarters of the timber harvested                   in developing

countries is used as househo!d fuel, this change could have a major beneficial impact in

reducing deforestation     and C02 levels.




The other major assertion by environmentalists,               that the global environment      is necessarily

harmed by the relocation of production following trade and investment liberalization,                        also

is questionable.     We know from the law of comparative                advantage that not all industries

will be relocated from rich to poor countries when the former’s trade barriers are lowered:

some industries in the North will expand at the expense of those industries in the South,

and conversely.       In any case, it should not simply be assumed                   that relocating    some

production     to the South      necessarily        worsens    the environment.       Recent     preliminary

examinations       of the likely environmental        effects of reducing government            assistance     to

two of the North’s most protected industries, coal and food,                reveal that “in both cases the

global     environment     may    well     be   improved       by trade    liberalization,     especially      if

complementary        environmental       policies   are in place (Anderson         1992b, Steenblik          and

Coroyannakis       1995). Nor need the risk of environmental             damage from transport activity

increase     with trade reform.      The lowering           of import   barriers   to processed      primary

products, for example, would allow more raw materials to be processed in resource-rich

countries,    so reducing the bulkiness         of shipments.     But evidently    many more empirical

studies    will be required      before the more extreme             environmental      groups    alter their
                                                     21


perception     of and publicity       against   multilateral   trade reform   as an environmentally

unfriendly activity.




4. The GATI’/WTO          and the environment




How ‘green’ are the rules of the GA~                and how have they been adapted over time?lz

From the outset the GA~            has been a conservationist       institution   in the sense that its

purpose has been to reduce trade barriers and thereby the inefficiency                  in the use of the

world’s resources.




The heart of the GA~,         agreed to by 23 original contracting parties in 1947 and since then

by another 100 or so countries, is the nondiscrimination           requirements   of Articles I and III.

These    obligate   parties   to treat imports       from any GA~         contracting     party no less

favorably      than other imports       (the ‘most-favoured-nation’       requirement)      and no less

favorably,     after border taxes are paid, than similar domestic             products     (the ‘national

treatment’ requirement).




Article XX provides exceptions to these general rules, however, including provisions                  for

some environmental       regulations.    Specifically, parts (b) and (g) of Article XX allow trade

restrictions   “necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health” and “relating to

the conservation     of exhaustible     natural resources if such measures are made effective in

conjunction    with restrictions      on domestic     production   or consumption”,       subject to the

requirement    that such restrictions     “are not applied in a manner which would constitute           a
                                                        22


means of arbitrary or unjustifiable              discrimination     between countries      where the same

conditions      prevail, or a disguised restriction on international            trade”. The latter has been

interpreted to mean that the measure must be primarily for a conservation                   purpose (rather

than for a mixture of motives)              and must be necessa~        in the sense of being the least

GA~-inconsistent            memure available. These provisos have ensured that the Article has

been rather narrowly interpreted,             which is partly why some environmental            groups have

felt further greening of the GATT is required (Chamovitz                     1991; Esty 1994). But there is

nothing       in the GATT       that prevents      a country      adopting    production   or consumption

measures       to offset environmental         externalities   associated     with either of those sets of

activities.    And since trade itself is almost never claimed to be the root cause of an

environmental       problem,     supporters     of the institution     see little need to consider      trade

measures as part of the solutions to those problems.




As already mentioned,          widespread public interest in trade and environmental             issues first

surfaced in rich countries         in the late 1960s/early        1970s, At that time concern focused

mainly on industrial pollution within and between neighboring                    advanced economies. The

foreign trade and investment issues raised at that time were centred on how the imposition

of stricter     pollution     standards     at home than abroad might damage               the international

competitiveness       of the home country’s          firms, and how to avoid such damage through

border protection measures.




Where the environmental             damage caused by production              is purely local, the calls by

disadvantaged       firms for trade restrictions         or subsidies       to offset the decline    in their

international    competitiveness,         because standards have been raised, has no economic logic:
                                                  23


such assistance would tend to offset the desired effect of limiting by-product pollution.13

Nor is it reasonable to conclude that other countries are engaging in ‘eco-dumping’ if the

imports they are able to supply are produced with laxer environmental             standards, if those

lower standards are consistent        with the preferences and natural resource endowments         of

those exporting      countries    (e.g., because those countries are poorer and/or less densely

populated and less urbanized). Even so, claims for protection against ‘eco-dumping’ have

political appeal and may result in higher import barriers or export subsidies than would

otherwise be the case in advanced economies. kading             up to the UN Conference       on the

Human Environment,         held in Stockholm    in June 1972, the GATT Secretariat produced a

background       paper on those issues (GA~       1971), and a Working Group on Environmental

Measures     and International      Trade wm established.    But no significant     changes to the

GATT occurred during the Tokyo Round as a result of these concerns being expressed,

and it was two decades before the Working Group met for the first time.




Trade policy actions are more likely to occur, and to be more difficult to dismiss                 as

inappropriate,     when environmentalists      in such countries view particular     damage to the

environment      as unacceptable    regardless of the nation in which the damage occurs. This

case is even more problematic          if the darnage is not just psychological     (as with animal

rights) but also physical, for then the relocation       of production   to a country with laxer

environmental      standards     may worsen animal welfare, or the environment          at home, in

addition to reducing the profitability      of the home firms. The US-Mexico        dispute over the

use of dolphin-unfriendly        nets by tuna fishermen again comes to mind. In that case the

GATT ruled against the US ban on imports of tuna from Mexico, partly because the ban
                                               24


did not discriminate    according to which type of net was used -- as it cannot, because an

aspect of the production     process rather than the final traded product itself is what is

considered objectionable.    The GATT panel ruled against the ban because to do otherwise

would have created a huge loophole in the GATI’ for any country unilaterally             to apply

trade restrictions   as a means of imposing its environmental      standards on other countries.

Such a loophole would work against the main objective of the multilateral trading system

which is to provide stable and predictable nondiscriminatory         market access opportunities

through agreed rules and disciplines and bound tariffs on imports.




Following   a lull in interest brought on by the economic disruptions         of the 1973-82 oil-

shock period, the current wave of public concern for the natural environment,         leading up

to and following the United Nations Conference on Environment             and Development    held

in Brazil in June 1992, is much more intense, more widespread, and likely to be sustained

and to affect a much broader range of countries than was the case prior to the latter 1980s.

The Uruguay Round agenda was set by 1986, before the current wave had built up, so the

trade/environment      issue was not a separate       item for negotiation.   Nor was there an

environmental    impact assessment of the Round as a whole. However, the Working Group

on Environmental       Measures   and International     Trade that was formed      in 1971 was

activated for the first time in 1991 and has met frequently since then. As well, several of

the Uruguay Round agreements         contain provisions     that relate to the environment   and

build on Articles in the General Agreement.
                                                     25


The most fundamental            provision    in the Round is in the Preamble        to the agreement     to

establish the World Trade Organization,            which refers to the WTO’s objective as enabling

all contracting parties the maximum opportunities               for:




            “expanding the production and trade in goods and services, while allowing

            for the optimal      use of the world’s resources          in accordance     with the

            objective of sustainable development,         seeking both to protect and preserve

            the environment       and enhance      the means       for doing   so in a manner

            consistent    with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of

            economic development”.




To give initial effect to that, a decision was taken on trade and environment                by ministers

meeting in Marrakesh in April 1994 to sign the Final Act of the Uruguay Round. They

agreed to establish a Committee             on Trade and Environment       to report to the first biennial

meeting of ministers          (probably in late 1996). The other main features of the Uruguay

Round agreements           with environmental      provisions     relate to technical   barriers to trade,

sanitary and phytosanitary         measures, and the agreements on subsidies and countervailing

duties and on trade-related        intellectual property rights. Overall, the trade liberalization      to

result from the Uruguay Round is likely to conserve resources and reduce environmental

degradation      rather than be unfriendly to the natural environment           (see Anderson    1995 for

details).




5. GATT/WTO              and mtitilateral    environmental       agreements
                                                         26


The other way in which trade policy is being called upon to help achieve environmental

objectives     has, as mentioned        above, more validity. It is as a carrot or stick to entice

countries      to sign and abide by multilateral              environmental    agreements.      In the case of

combatting global environmental            problems such as ozone depletion or climate change, the

free-rider problem arises. One of the more obvious and possibly more cost-effective                         ways

to reduce the free-rider problem is to write trade provisions                   into the agreement,      as was

done in the 1987 Montreal             Protocol on reducing the use of CFCS and halons to slow

ozone depletion. To date no GA~               contracting party has formally objected to that use of

trade policy. Nor have they to the bans on trade in ivory and rhino horn and tiger products

that are part of the Convention          on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), or

to the trade provisions        in the Basel Convention           on trade in hazardous wastes. Conflicts

may well arise in the future, however, if trade provisions are drafted into more contentious

multilateral    environmental        agreements (e.g., to impose a global carbon tax). That is why

this matter figures important y on the agenda of the new WTO Committee                           on Trade and

Environment.       Discussions       so far in the GATT/WTO              have centred around the idea of

providing       waivers   on     a     case-by-case      basis     or,   alternatively,    of   providing      an

“environmental      window” for multilateral             environmental      agreements     within the GATT

exceptions clause (Article xx).




To help assess        the appropriate       role for trade policy           in multilateral     environmental

agreements,      it is helpful        to recall   that    supporters     of trade     liberalization    and of

environmental      protection    share a common           goal: to improve social welfare. They also

share a common problem: the need to foster multilateral cooperation                       to fully achieve that

objective,     because    in each       sphere    (the economy,          and   the environment)        there    is
                                                         27


considerable      and increasing interdependence             among nations. But the two groups differ in

the important respect that supporters of liberal world trade have understood its virtues for

two centuries and have been active for more than 50 years in building institutions                     such as

the GA’IT and WTO to help achieve their goal, whereas widespread concerns about the

environment       are relatively new and supporters of environmental                protection entered only

recently as significant players in international policy arenas.




Understandably,      supporters of liberal trade and the GA~/WTO                   resent the encroachment

of these ‘new kids on the block’ onto what they perceive as their hard-won                            territory,

especially      when they genuinely           believe    that reducing     trade barriers     is likely to be

environmentally      friendly and consistent with sustainable development                   in the long run in

the sense that it allows           the world to use its resources             more efficiently .14 Equally,

advocates for greater environmental             protection are frustrated that international      agreements

as important       as those      resulting     from the GATT’s           recent   Uruguay     Round    can be

implemented         without      being       subject    to    environmental       impact     assessments      or

environmental      safeguards.




Clearly there is scope for greater understanding               and altered strategies on both sides. More

than that, there is the distinct possibility that, by working together, both groups’ objectives

will be further enhanced          -- a ‘win-win’ outcome.          Some observers      believe that it may

ultimately      require a world environment             organization   to set rules, incorporate      existing

international    environmental      agreements and negotiate new ones, monitor compliance,                  and

settle disputes over environmental            policies—in     the same way that the GA~          has presided

over trade rules and policies            for the past five decades (Esty 1994). And just as the
                                                   28


GA~/WTO          strengthens     the capacity of governments    to resist the demands of domestic

vested interest groups seeking higher import taxes, so a world environment               organization

may help governments           resist interest group demands to set low environmental        standards

(Deardorff     1995). The advantage of a World Environment           Organization    for traders, Esty

argues, is that it could redirect environmentalists’       attention away from trade policies and

towards ensuring the implementation           of more efficient policy instruments       for achieving

environmental     objectives,     allowing both sets of policies to contribute      more effectively

toward the common goals of sustainable development              and improvement      in the quality of

life. Even so, the issue of whether the WTO or the WEO would have precedence would

need still to be resolved. It is noteworthy that the side agreement to the NAFTA gives a

surprising     (to me, given        that it is a trade     agreement)     degree   of precedence     to

environmental      concerns relative to trade concerns. What needs to be recognised             is that

where the two are in conflict, achieving the optimal welfare-maximizing             outcome requires

both to compromise      somewhat.




Thus without doubt the trade policy community needs to be involved in the negotiating                of

multilateral    environmental      agreements that are likely to include trade provisions,      and to

develop criteria by which WTO members could assess in advance the extent to which

trade restrictions    within such agreements       are acceptable.   Some of the relevant criteria

were enunciated      at UNCED.        It is important,   first, to ensure that trade provisions     are

strictly necessary and effective in achieving the environmental             objectives   involved. For

the reasons outlined earlier, there will often be an alternative, more effective instrument

than trade restrictions.       Where trade instruments    are required in the absence of superior

policy measures,      they should be used only in proportion            to the size of the associated
                                                      29


environmental     problem and should be the least trade restrictive             measure available. The

measures ought to be transparent          and not be protectionist    in impact, and where possible

be consistent with both the GATT principles of non-discrimination                (most-favoured-nation

and national treatment) and the key environmental            principles such as the polluter pays and

the precautionary      principles.    If those conditions      are met, WTO          members     would be

unlikely to object to the use of trade measures in multilateral                environment      agreements

(witness the absence of objections by GATT contracting parties to the trade provisions                    in

the Montreal Protocol and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).

Hence even the possible            need to use trade provisions        in multilateral    environmental

agreements does not provide sufficient reason to amend GA~                 Article XX to allow in the

list of exceptions the use of trade measures for environmental           protection.




6. GATT/WTO           and labour standards




An even        more   questionable      entrant     onto   the WTO’S     potential     agenda     than   the

environment,     and one that has an even clearer North-South              dimension,    is the issue of

Iabour standards (Bhagwati and Dehejia 1994). Government                  and/or labour union actions

in setting minimum Iabour standards are often considered necessary to reduce the risk of

exploitation    of (particularly     low-skilled)    workers by capitalists.    As with environmental

standards, labour standards differ between countries and tend to be lower and/or enforced

less in developing     countries. The direct effect of such things as shorter working weeks,

higher overtime pay, longer annual leave, safer and healthier working conditions, etc. may

be to raise worker welfare, but they also raise the cost of employing labour -- otherwise

they would have been adopted voluntarily and so there would be no need for government
                                                   30


or union action. 15 They are therefore similar to other taxes on production                  that differ

across industries      in that their indirect effects need to be considered         as well (Ehrenberg

1994). Specifically,     they effectively make (particularly      low-skilled)     labour scarcer. That

tends to raise the cost of production in labour-intensive          industries most in high-standard

countries, thereby reducing the capacity of those industries to compete with producers in

low-standard     countries while enhancing the capacity of other industries to so compete,

along Rybczynski (1959) lines,




The owners of firms in harmed industries             can respond to demands          for higher labour

standards     by lobbying    against their imposition      and/or by demanding         protection   from

imports from lower-standard          countries   until the latter are raised. Thus one country’s

choice of standards       is not independent      of the choices of other countries,         nor is the

country’s trade policy independent        of that relationship.   As with environmental       standards,

the demand for unilateral use of trade policy for this reason has grown over time with the

internationalization     of the global economy: the decline in traditional           trade barriers has

ensured that any given cost-raising        standard is becoming relatively more important           as a

determinant     of international    competitiveness,     and the deregulation        of direct foreign

investment     abroad has increased the possibilities     for firms to relocate their factories from

high- to lower-standard      countries.




To what extent is there a parallel claim with the environment              issue for placing labour

standards     on the WTO’S agenda because of international           spillovers?     Many economists

would say there is none, because they perceive no physical spillovers                   of the global-

warming or ozone-depleting         kind. At least one minor one may be present in some times
                                                       31


and places though. It is the effect of high standards for low-skilled                  workers in attracting

unwanted migrants from less-developed               economies across borders that may be difficult to

police.lb     Furthermore,     there    is the possibility      also    of psychological        international

spillovers. People may grieve because of abuse of what they perceive as worker rights or

poor working conditions abroad just as they may for their low environmental                       standards or

abuse of human rights generally. But, again as with the environment,                         while that may

provide justification      for action of some sort at the international           level, there are only very

limited circumstances        in which multilateral trade measures are worthy of consideration                as

sticks or carrots for encouraging           other countries to raise their standards. One is in cases

where, as happened         in the N~A          negotiations,    there comes a point when significant

negotiating     parties refuse to enter further multilateral           trade negotiations     unless Iabour

standards are on the agenda. Should that happen, a judgement                  would have to be made by

the other negotiating        parties as to whether it would be worth continuing                under such a

condition.     Another    is when aggrieved high-standard             countries      can find no lower-cost

ways    to influence       the policies      of lower-standards         countries,     but even     there   the

psychological     benefits to the North maybe          insufficient    to warrant the costs to consumers

and exporters in the high-standard           countries (not to mention the net costs to the affected

low-standard     countries), And a third possible circumstance            is when there might otherwise

be a reluctance          to raise   one’s     own    national   standards     so as not to erode            the

competitiveness      of those domestic industries harmed by an increase in the gap between

labour standards at home and abroad.




The concern in high-standard           countries ostensibly is not so much the average wage level

difference    but rather such things as occupational             health and safety standards,          worker
                                                    32


rights to form unions and seek a minimum wage level and other improved conditions                        of

employment,        the use of child or prison or forced labour, and the derogation from national

labour laws in export processing zones. The United States and France, for example, were

at pains to make clear at Marrakesh that their push for the WTO to consider trade/labour

issues was very much focussed             on differences    in labour standards    other than wages.

Human rights activists and development NGOS often add support to union calls for higher

standards in developing countries, believing that it would improve the quality of life there

-- even though in fact the raising of labour standards in the formal sector is more likely

simply to drive employment            into the informal sector (where Iabour standards          are even

lower), and/or to lengthen          the queues of unemployed        people seeking high-paid,         high-

standard formal sector jobs.1’ In the case of young women displaced from their jobs by

higher    labour    standards,     they may to have to marry and bear children              earlier    than

otherwise, or even to enter prostitution,       in order to survive. 1*




As with environmental        standards, traditional protectionist    forces in high-income     countries

are prompt     to support        any such calls for import restraint by high-standard          countries

against   goods from lower-standard           countries.    They sometimes     bolster   their case by

quoting    simple     trade theory      (the Factor-Price    Equalization    and Stolper-Samuelson

Theorems) in support of their argument that liberal trade leads to factor price convergence

and in particular to a drop in low-skill wages in high-wage countries -- even though those

theorems have been shown to be not very robust when more than two countries,                          goods

and factors are involved          (Falvey 1995) and are not supported        by empirical    simulation

results of trade liberalizations        such as the Uruguay Round. 19 There is also a risk that
                                                     33


support for openness in low-standard           countries could come under challenge if those who

lose from the forced raising of those standards lobby domestically                  against their country’s

exposure to other societies through having a liberal trade regime.




The International      Labour Organisation        has been writing labour standards for 75 years.

Why has this issue suddenly become entangled with the GA~/WTO                                and trade policy

issues? In fact the entwining of trade and labour standards is not new,20 but it raises its

head mainly when the trading system is in the news and particularly if labour markets are

in trouble at the time. It became an issue when the International                 Trade Organization       was

being conceived in 1947,21 and again at the end of the Tokyo Round, and now once more

as the WTO establishes       itself and the Uruguay Round starts to be implemented                   at a time

of poor labour market performance             in industrial countries (with unemployment             above 10

per cent in Europe         and relative   earnings        of unskilled     labour       in the United    States

deteriorating).




Over time, though, the issue is coming under increasing discussion.                      This is partly for the

reason mentioned earlier of declining trade and investment barriers which mean that cost-

raising   standards    become    relatively     more important      as determinants           of international

competitiveness       and plant location. But a further implication             of falling communication

costs is that citizens of high-standard        countries are increasingly able to get information            on

labour (and environmental)        standards      in other countries,       That, together with the ever-

greater sense of integration      among the world’s people (the ‘global village’ idea), allows

and encourages        the concern for human rights to spread beyond national boundaries,                         a

tendency that might therefore be expected to continue                    indefinitely     as global economic
                                                 34


growth and integration proceed. Around that upward trend in concern will be fluctuations

that are opposite to the business cycle: the worse the labour market is performing in high-

wage countries (especially in the lower-skill categories), the more likely it is that imports

from low-wage countries will be blamed22           -- notwithstanding    clear evidence that such

imports are at most only a very minor contributor (Lawrence 1994; Burtless 1995; Tyers

and Yang 1995). And that likelihood           is exacerbated   by the computer   and information

revolutions    which, together      with other forces, are increasing    the demand    for skilled

relative to unskilled workers (Wood 1994).




Another reason why the labour issue has become more prominent in the multilateral trade

arena once again is because it has succeeded recently in penetrating          regional integration

agreements,    Specifically,    there is the inclusion of a Protocol on Social Policy annexed to

the Treaty of Maastricht         signed by EU member governments         in February   1992 (Sapir

1996). As well, it became the subject of a side agreement to the N~A             in 1993 -- a price

President Clinton paid to buy off opposition from labour groups to the NAFI’As             passage

through the US Congress,          Having been encouraged       by their success in those regional

economic      integration   settings,   and before that in some minor trade and investment

agreements     in the 1980s (see Lawrence (1994) for details), the advocates for that side

agreement are now, like the environmental         lobby groups, seeking to have an influence at

the multilateral   trade level. In both situations, the desire of the GATT’s contracting parties

to conclude, ratify and implement         the Uruguay Round agreements on trade liberalization

was to a considerable          extent simply being used opportunistically     by these groups    to

further their own causes, despite the tenuous connection of those causes with trade. Their
                                                  35


relative success to date is in large part because their causes have supetilcial                popular

appeal, while the downside in terms of the potential risk to the global trading system is far

from obvious to the layperson.




To conclude this section, it is instructive to examine the progress of labour policies in the

sub-global arena of the EU. A recent assessment by Sapir (1996) concludes that in Europe

there has always been the optimists           who believe economic      integration   breeds greater

economic growth and equality of social policies (led by the Ohlin Report to the ILO at the

time of the formation       of the EEC -- see International     Labour Organisation      (1956)), and

the pessimists     who believe upward harmonization         needs to be imposed on lower-standard

countries to improve citizens’ conditions there and avoid “social dumping” though trade.

In practice, relatively little has been imposed effectively on the poorer member countries

of the EU; the most that has been agreed to is the adoption of some minimum standards

and mutual recognition.       Yet standards have risen rapidly with the acceleration of income

growth in the poorer EU countries. Where standards have risen even faster than normal

they have been accompanied           by large “economic      and social cohesion”     payments    from

Brussels.      However,    since explicit   side payments     are not as readily available       at the

multilateral    level, and since the number and diversity of lower-standard           countries is far

greater globally than within the EU, the likelihood            of major action through the WTO

(much less the ILO or a WEO) seems slight.




7.    What       could    and should    developing     countries   and APEC         do about     these

developments?
                                                 36


The demands for greater harmonization         of domestic policies for competitiveness   reasons,

coupled with the greening of world politics and the growing interest in worker and other

human rights beyond national borders, are likely to put the WTO and trade policy under

pressure to perform tasks for which they were not designed and are not well suited -- and

at a time when the WTO needs first to consolidate          its role in the world and ensure the

implementation    of the Uruguay Round before moving into these more thorny issues that

are only peripherally connected with trade.23




The pressure on the WTO to become more entwined with issues of environmental                    and

labour standards is and should be of considerable         concern to developing   countries.    The

reason is not so much that the imposition of higher standards themselves would be costly

to them. In fact middle-income,      mid-standard     countries may well be net beneficiaries     if

low-income,    low-standard   countries were required to raise their standards more than them

to reach minimum       acceptable   levels. Even the negative     direct effect for low-income

economies     of having to raise their standards could be offset somewhat,        at least for the

most labour-abundant     poor countries, by a terms of trade improvement       if many countries

were to raise their labour standards multilaterally     and if that reduced the global supply of

low-skilled   labour time.    Nonetheless,    people in developing   countries are suspicious    of

the motives of OECD countries, and object to what they perceive as social imperialism

and a denial of their national sovereignty.




While they are not being targeted per se, the fact is that such standards tend to be applied

less in developing countries because they are poorer. That, together with the fact that their
                                                   37


comparative      advantages      often are in labour-, natural resource-   and pollution-intensive

industries,    means those countries       are vulnerable   either to being pressured      to enforce

stricter standards and/or to facing less market access for their exports to stricter-standard

countries.     Furthermore,     should the use of trade policy to try to harmonize          standards

upwards       lead to trade retaliation     and counter-retaliation,   the end result could be a

weakening of the multilateral        trading system on which developing countries are coming to

depend increasingly         as they liberalize their economies.   One possible consequence      is that

developing      countries     could seek refuge from anti- (eco or social) dumping         duties via

association     with or accession to the EU or NAFI’A, where they might expect to receive

greater compensation          for raising their social standards. In such cases, any net gain they

might enjoy could well be at the expense of excluded developing countries.




However, since the entwining of these social issues with trade policy is more likely to

tighten than to disentangle in the forseeable future, the question arises as to how

developing countries and forums such as APEC ought to respond. One response is to

point out that industrial countries had lower standards at earlier stages of their

development       and that, since developing countries have contributed a disproportionately

small amount per capita to global environmental          problems such as the greenhouse effect,

they should be compensated          for contributing to their solutions rather than have that

contribution     demanded of them under threats of trade sanctions. Compensation           would be

even more justified in cases where industrial countries are demanding responses by other

countries to reduce the psychological        international spillovers mentioned earlier.
                                                          38


Another      response     by developing       countries        is to disseminate      more widely the sound

arguments      for not using trade-restrictive        measures        to achieve environmental          or labour

objectives: that differences in standards are a legitimate source of comparative                       advantage

in so far as they reflect differences in resource endowments                  and societies’ preferences and

ability to afford the good things in life; that standards rise with per capita income and

liberal trade promotes        income growth; that theory and empirical evidence provide little

reason to expect that differences             in standards contribute         significantly   to differences    in

costs of production         and hence to trade and investment                 patterns,    nor that downward

harmonization      of standards (a “race to the bottom”) is occurring; 24that if freer trade were

to worsen welfare of, say, low-skilled             workers, adjustment             assistance programs such as

retraining    subsidies    provide much cheaper solutions               than trade restrictions,       as do non-

trade measures such as labelling (’dolphin-friendly                  tuna’, ‘made with unionized labour’ )

that allow consumers         to exercise their preferences through the market;                  that the GATT

rules-based      multilateral     trading system is threatened            by the risk of environmental          or

labour    groups    being       captured     by traditional        protectionist     groups   in high-standard

countries, and by the risk of resulting trade restrictions and pressure to involuntarily                     raise

standards being used by protectionist            groups in lower-standard            countries to argue against

their countries’ export-oriented           development strategy.




Helpful though such argumentation               could be, more dialogue and compromise                   between

high-income      and developing        countries     is likely to be needed. One suggestion                 is the

following.     E developing       countries    were to commit themselves                to enforcing    minimum

standards and to raising those standards over time according to a specified schedule, in
                                                  39


return for gradual improvements         in OECD market access, vocal interest groups in high-

income countries would be less able to deny that improvements               in social standards   are

positively related to income and trade growth. That would be using trade policy as a carrot

rather than a stick. Likewise, if developing countries were seen to be enforcing reasonable

standards especially effectively on their foreign investors, concerns about capital outflows

to “pollution    havens” or “cheap Iabour havens” and the consequent           loss of jobs in high-

standard    countries     would be less justifiable.   Alternatively   or additionally,   developing

countries    could transfer the onus back to high-standard         countries   to insist their firms

accede to the same high standards when they invest in developing countries as in more-

advanced     economies.      And anxiety over deforestation      could be reduced if developing

countries were able to demonstrate        they can police restrictions on felling and are prepared

to do so in return for adequate compensation            in the form of greater access to OECD

markets and/or aid (e.g., via the UNDP/UNEP/World              Bank Global Environment       Facility

administered     by the World Bank).




A more controversial        suggestion has been made by Rodrik (1994). He believes a case can

be made for high-standard        countries to take action against a trading partner if trade with

that country violates a widely held social standard (i.e., one that is accepted by export and

consumer      interests   in those countries   in addition   to the aggrieved     import-competing

producers and environmental/labour         groups). The case rests on the point that an erosion of

confidence      in the ‘fairness’ of the trading system may ultimately be more costly to the

world economy than the action against the offending trading partner. He suggests that the

Safeguards      Agreement     of the Uruguay Round could be broadened            to allow a ‘Social

Safeguards’     clause whereby in such cases a country could restrict the offending imports
                                                   40


and compensate       the trading partner. Rodrik recognises that this could do more harm than

good (not least because           it would formalize      a link between        trade policy and social

standards). Even so, he argues that its merits need to be weighed against the other options

available    to developing    countries    to minimize      the damage from the encroachment              of

social issues into the trade policy domain. The sobering history of abuse of the GATT’s

other safeguards clauses, though (see Finger 1995), leaves little room for enthusiasm                    for

this proposal to amend the Uruguay Round’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing

Measures.




Finally, what about the role of APEC? Since a complete decoupling of social issues from

trade policy seems unlikely          in the foreseeable     future, it is important         for developing

countries    to consider what principles      ought to govern the design of trade policies and

trade-related     environmental      and labour policies      to ensure     equitable     and sustainable

development.       Several   have been mentioned          above    in passing.     Even      if developing

countries were simply to discuss such a list with higher-standard                countries, the resulting

dialogue     may itself be productive        in diffusing    some of the concerns            expressed   by

environmental       and labour groups (Zarsky and Drake-Brockman                 1994). APEC, with its

diffuse but relatively small membership,         provides an obvious forum for such discussion

before the much larger WTO membership               debates the issues. In the same spirit, APEC

might also begin to monitor trade-related          environmental      measures as part of its overall

compilation      of trade impediments     in the Asia-Pacific. As well, it might actively seek, as a

priority    in its trade facilitation     and liberalization      initiatives    launched     at Bogor    in

November        1994, the removal of trade policies that incidentally           harm the environment      --
again, providing     a regional example for what might eventually      be achievable   globally

through the WTO.



1These reductions are reflected in the fact that the volume of merchandise      trade has been

growing nearly twice as fast as the volume of merchandise output globally (3.9 compared

with 2.1 per cent per year during 1980-92), and trade in commercial        services has grown

even faster (raising its share of global exports of goods and commercial      services from 17

to 21 per cent during 1980-92 -- see GATT 1994). Direct foreign investment,        meanwhile,

has grown nearly twice as fast as international      trade globally over the past decade or so,

following    the deregulation   of many countries’    financial markets and the revolution    in

communications      and data transmission.

2 Trans-border    pollution issues affecting adjoining countries of a region are not discussed

in what follows since they are usually resolved by intergovernmental        agreement without

having to resort to trade policy measures, the free-rider problem being absent because of

the small number of countries typically involved.

3 This does not apply equally to all natural resources         and environmental   services of

course.     The doomsayers      such as Meadows      et al. (1972)   have been shown     to be

spectacularly    wrong in predicting the exhaustion of minerals and energy raw materials, for

example, because they have failed to take into account economic feedback mechanisms.

Beckerman (1992) notes that the cumulative world consumption          of many minerals during

the past quarter century exceeded ‘known reserves’ at the beginning         of the period, yet

today’s revised ‘known reserves’ nevertheless exceed those of twenty five years ago! The

same cannot be said for tropical hardwoods and some fish species, however, although in

these cases there is scope to move further from the current ‘hunter/gatherer’ technology      to
                                                       42



using land or water more intensively in planting trees for timber or practicing aquiculture

in the same way as agriculture uses land to produce most other forms of food and fibre.

4 Recent papers reporting evidence in support of the claim that the demand for

implementing       and enforcing pollution abatement policies is income-elastic         include

Radetzki (1992), Grossman and Krueger ( 1993, 1995), Seldon and Song (1994), and

Grossman (1995). See also Deacon and Shapiro (1975) on the correlation between income

levels and voter attitudes toward environmental             priorities. Studies aimed at explaining

this transition (sometimes called an environmental             Kuznets curve) are now beginning to

emerge. Beltratti (1995) seeks to explain it in terms of transitional dynamics of

endogenous       growth models, while Jones and Manuelli (1995) provide a positive political

economy model.




5 The term ‘pollution-intensive          production     processes’ should be broadly interpreted       to

include activities      such as mining in pristine areas or leisure services that may attract

undesired       local or international     tourists.   The presumption      is that industries    are not

affected equally by the progressive          raising of environmental       standards and charges, for

otherwise there would be little change in the pattern of a country’s trade.

b Similarly, if as they grow economies            were to institutionally   shorten working hours per

week, raise wages for time worked outside those hours, or otherwise increase the cost of

labour time in attempting to raise labour standards, that would speed the transformation               of

those economies’       comparative     advantages away from labour-intensive         activities. If those

institutional     changes   affected     mainly    unskilled   labour,   the competitiveness      of less
                                                   43



developed economies in unskilled labour intensive products would strengthen even faster

. . see Section 6 below.

7 See, for example, Leonard (1988), Low (1992) and Jaffe et al. (1995). As well, Tobey

(1990) finds little evidence       of actual changes       in patterns     of trade specialization     in

response   to the imposition    of environmental        regulations     since the 1960s. However,      as

noted by Hoekman       and Leidy (1992), the absence of changes in trade patterns may be

because    import barriers    were raised to offset any decline            in the competitiveness      of

affected industries.

* For details of the Montreal Protocol see, for example,              Benedick (1991) and Enders and

Porges (1992). A list of the other major international environmental             agreements with trade

provisions is provided in GATT (1992, Appendix 1) and Esty ( 1994, Appendix D).

9 Some would argue that psychological            spillovers are less worthy of consideration         than

physical spillovers, not least because they are less measurable and hence less ‘objective’.

Hence the scope for traditional protectionists       ‘capturing’ environmentalistsconcerned          with

psychological    spillovers   is considerable.    Others would counter          that there is so much

uncertainty   about the extent and effects of physical spillovers that they too are subjective

and hence are qualitatively       no different     from psychological        spillovers.   Both exist in

people’s minds, and there is no reason a priori to presume that one is more important than

the other in some ‘willingness-to-pay’      or popularity sense.

10The ban on ivory trade again provides a case in point. By lowering the value of elephant

products, the ban reduces the incentive for rural Africans to tolerate elephants trampling

their crops and so ultimately could result in more rather than less culling of elephants in

some areas. In other areas, the ivory trade ban has reduced the value of the animal so
                                                        44



much that it is no longer profitable to cull the herd. An unfortunate               consequence       is that

bushland      in national parks is being decimated            by the increased number of elephants,

which is of course endangering other species (Barbier et al. 1990).

       Even the threat of trade restrictions          can be environmentally     counterproductive.     The

talk of European import bans on tropical hardwood logs (together with tariff escalation

on timber product imports) has encouraged Indonesia to ban log exports. But since felling

has been allowed to continue,           this policy has lowered the domestic          price of logs and

thereby      raised    effective   assistance     to Indonesia’s    furniture   and other      timber-using

industries to extremely high levels (GATT 1991, p. 127). At that lower log price and with

possibly lower-quality        saw-milling       techniques it is not surprising that less of each tree is

now used, leading possibly to nearly as many trees being felled as prior to the log export

ban.

well as the empirical evidence analysed by Van Grasstek (1992) of voting behaviour of

U.S. senators.

13 See, for example,          Baumol    (1971), Siebert (1974) and Walter (1975,               1976). Such

protection     from import competition           cannot be justified   on economic efficiency grounds

(nor for that matter on environmental                grounds),   because    the environmental      policy is

aiming to eliminate an unjustifiable             (implicit) subsidy arising through undervaluation         of

environmental         resources, rather than to add an unjustifiable       tax (Snape 1992).
                                                       45



14 See the literature         review      in, for example,     Ulph    (1994).   Liberal     traders   should

acknowledge,       however, that opening up to trade can lead to over-exploitation              of common-

property resources (e.g., via deforestation           of tropical forests) in the absense of adequate

property rights, environmental            char~s,   and/or policing, in which case there may be a

second-best       case for restricting     trade until those problems       are resolved      (Chichilnisky

1994). In such cases all other distortions/market            failures need to be corrected at the same

time   as trade is being           liberalized   in order to achieve       unequivocal      global     welfare

improvement.        Even then, theory tells us that some countries may be made worse off and

the environment       may still be harmed (Copland and Taylor 1995).

15 So-called      neo-institutionalists     argue that higher labour standards would raise worker

productivity      (see, e.g., Hanson 1983, pp. 53-63), but it is reasonable to assume firms will

have already recognised            any such possibilities     and incorporated      them in their work

practices.      Lf not, the first-best     role for government        is to subsidize      the provision    of

information      about those opportunities.

16 My thanks go to David Richardson                 for offering this suggestion.   Needless to say, the

first-best   response     to such a possibility       may be to adopt measures             to reduce illegal

immigration.

17 This could easily be shown using a Harris-Todaro                    type of model as modified,          for

example, by Corden and Findlay (1975). The consequences                   of raising labour standards in

a multi-good,      multi-country     world can be quite complex and sometimes counter-intuitive,

depending       on the assumptions        adopted. See the excellent theoretical analysis of several

possibilities    by Brown, Deardorff and Stem (1996).

‘8 I am grateful to Anne Krueger for suggesting this possibility.
                                                       46



‘9 In their recent simulation        work, Francois, McDonald and Nordstrom (1995) found real

wages in all country groups to increase as a result of implementing                    the Uruguay Round.

Using     a similar     global    CGE    model,      Tyers     and Yang       (1995)   found    through     both

backcasting     and projecting      forward that expanding          imports from Asia do contribute            to

wage dispersion and possibly lower real wages and/or unemployment                        in the US and EU,

although only to a minor extent. Significantly,                 they also found that restricting        imports

from Asia would be an ineffective             response         since its impact through contracting           the

global economy is to lower real rewards to all types of labour in industrial countries.

20The history is patchy but goes back more than a hundred years (Hanson 1983, p. 11 and

Chamovitz      1987). The text of the GA~             itself    mentions labour only briefly, in Article

XX(e) which allows contracting parties to exclude imports of goods produced with prison

labour.

21 Article    7 of Chapter        II of the 1948 (Havana)           Charter    of the International        Trade

Organization      addresses the issue as follows: “The members recognise that unfair labour

conditions,    particularly      in the production     for export, create difficulties         in international

trade, and accordingly,        each member shall take whatever action may be appropriate                     and

feasible to eliminate such conditions within its territory.” See Charnovitz                    (1987, pp. 566-

67).

22This is the opposite to the case of the environment,               concerns for which tend to fluctuate

pro-cyclically.

23The suggestion has been made, for example, that the WTO become active in monitoring

and enforcing         agreed     minimum    social     standards.     That    presumably       would    involve

environmental      and labour standards being reviewed as part of the GATT/WTO                            regular
                                            47



Trade Policy Reviews. Given that the WTO’S TPR mechanism         is already stretched to its

limit in covering even the major trade policies of contracting parties, such an addition to

its work load would require a very substantial addition to its resources -- not to mention

the extra burden on those employed in national capitals when the reviews are under way.

An even greater potential     increase in workload   would result for the WTO’S dispute

settlement mechanism.

24Surveys of the relevant theory can be found in Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1996), Wilson

(1996) and Brown, Deardorff and Stem (1996). For empirical evidence, see for example

Tobey (1990), Low (1992), Jaffe et al. (1995), and Levinson      (1996) on environmental

standards   and Krugman   and Lawrence (1993), Bhagwati      (1995), and the World Bank

(1995) on labour standards.
