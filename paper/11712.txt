Changing Looks and Changing “Discrimination:” The Beauty of Economists

                                            ABSTRACT

I estimate the effects of changing an ascriptive characteristic on a market outcome while keeping the
average amount of information unchanged. Taking advantage of candidates' multiple appearances
in elections to office in a professional association and of the presence of different photographs
accompanying the ballots, I show that exogenous increases in beauty raise a candidate's chance of
success. The results support the inference that differential outcomes are inherent in agents' responses
to an ascriptive characteristic and do not stem from correlations with unobserved differences in
productivity-enhancing characteristics.

I. Introduction

       An immense empirical literature in labor economics, spilling over into other sub-

fields and other disciplines, has produced estimates of differences in economic and other

outcomes by race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and other ascriptive

characteristics. Most of these studies have attempted to adjust for other (call them

productivity-enhancing) characteristics that might affect the outcome of interest. The

pervasive difficulty is that there may well be unobservable productivity-enhancing

characteristics that are correlated with the ascriptive characteristic of interest, biasing

estimates of the impact of the latter.

       One approach to circumventing this correlation is audit studies—sending probes

(resumés, individual testers) to random samples of decision-makers to infer how they

react to agents who may be otherwise identical except for the ascriptive characteristic.

(See Fix and Struyk, 1995, on race; Neumark et al, 1996, on gender; Weichselbaumer,

2003, on sexual orientation.) Their hypothetical nature and the difficulties in inferring

what their findings mean (Heckman, 1998) mean that they fail to solve this correlation

problem in the context of actual decision-making. Several studies (Blank, 1991; Goldin

and Rouse, 2000; Straus et al, 2001) deal with this issue in real-world behavior by

examining cases in which all the information on the ascriptive characteristic is removed.

This solves one problem; but it is difficult to claim that the giant leap to no information

about the characteristic will generate the same results as changing its distribution with no

change in the average amount of information available to agents.

       No study has examined how actual decisions are altered when individual variation

in the information changes with no change in the average amount of information. We do
that here in examining the effect of beauty, a characteristic that typically changes very

slowly and one that affects outcomes in labor markets and elsewhere through a variety of

mechanisms (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994; Biddle and Hamermesh, 1998; Mulford et

al, 1998; Möbius and Rosenblat, 2005).

II. Analytical Approach and Data

       The outcome studied is election as an officer of the American Economic

Association. Since 1935 the Association has conducted two annual four-person elections,

for two slots as Vice-President and two as members of the Executive Committee. In

addition to the ballot each AEA member receives an information sheet containing short

biographies and 1-1/4” x 1-1/2” snapshots of each candidate. All of this information was

available beginning with elections for officers for 1966 and continuing through the

elections for 2004, i.e., a total of 312 candidacies. The 312 consist of only 216 different

individuals, including 147 who appear once, 57 who appear twice, 13 who were

nominated three times and 3 who appear four times. Multiple candidacies are crucial to

the analysis. Because in most cases a candidate submitted a different picture each time

s/he appeared on the ballot, the same candidate presented the voters with a different

image in each candidacy. Even though the same person is on the ballot, the information

provided to voters by the candidates’ appearance may vary for this reason. Moreover,

because his/her competition changes, even with the same picture a candidate’s

appearance relative to competitors can change.




                                            2
        The goal is to analyze whether a candidate’s appearance affects his/her electoral

chances and how an individual’s changed appearance affects his/her chance of victory.1

We cannot determine whether voters react to the person’s appearance as a signal of

productivity, or whether voters have a preference for good looks independent of any

signal. With over 4000 economists voting in each of the elections, however, it is unlikely

that more than a small minority knows the candidates personally. Professional reputation,

including that conveyed in the written material accompanying the ballot, may matter, as

may the information contained in the photograph. By examining multiple candidacies we

can, however, infer whether changing one’s appearance affects how decision-makers (the

voters) react to changes in the ascriptive characteristic beauty, holding constant other

changes between ballots.2

        As shown in Donald and Hamermesh (2005), the probability of victory in these

elections is significantly positively affected by a candidate’s scholarly impact (citations

in journal articles, computed from the Social Science Citation Index)—his/her share of

the citations received by the four candidates in the election; by being a woman, and by

previously or currently holding a high-level government position. In addition to these

measures we also include other variables in describing the outcome: Affiliation (Top 5

School, or nonacademic); race (African-American); field (theorist/econometrician);

future Nobel Prize winner; and years since receiving the highest degree (essentially a

proxy for age).


1
 To my knowledge Klein and Rosar (2005) is the only study even to consider one-time appearances of
candidates in actual elections (rather than in hypothetical examples).
2
 Mythical anecdotal evidence that this is the case is provided by Eddie Murphy’s “White Like Eddie”
Saturday Night Live routine in the early 1980s.



                                                   3
        To examine the role of beauty in these elections we had the 312 photographs rated

independently by each of four observers. We needed to make sure that the raters did not

know any of the candidates, but that they were familiar with whatever gestalt academic

economists may typically present.3 To deal with this difficulty I employed four entering

first-year economics Ph.D. students, all of whom had attended undergraduate institutions

in the United States, as raters. To reflect the membership of the Association, three were

male and one female. Each was asked to rate the attractiveness of the candidate in each

picture on a scale from 10 (top) to 1 (bottom) and to try to maintain an average rating of 5

(without re-examining previously rated photos). I assume that the raters’ perceptions

represent the perceptions of the voters who confronted the photographs and the ballots.

        Table 1 presents statistics describing the ratings. There are substantial differences

among raters in the moments of the distribution of ratings. Accordingly, each rater i’s

scores were normalized to yield standardized scores, the minima and maxima of which

are shown in the final two columns of the first four rows. The six pairwise correlations of

these scores range from 0.28 to 0.40, with Cronbach’s alpha equaling 0.65. These

statistics indicate a very slightly lower concordance among the raters than has been

observed in other studies (e.g., Pfann et al, 2000), possibly because the photographs

provided are very tiny, inducing more noise than usual. Nonetheless, there is substantial

agreement among raters: All the pairwise correlation coefficients are highly significant

statistically.

        The four standardized ratings were averaged to obtain an average standardized

rating, Rij, for each candidate i in election j. A candidate’s beauty relative to the entire

3
 Several economists argued that this study would be impossible to conduct, since the beauty measure would
be identically zero.


                                                   4
history of candidates is unlikely to be relevant for his/her electoral chances. Rather, and

analogous to our treatment of citations, it is his/her relative beauty in the election that

may affect the outcome. Accordingly, for each candidacy we form:

(1)    R*ij = Rij – R.j ,

where R.j is the average of the average standardized beauty of all four candidates in the

j’th election. We focus on the impact of R*ij on the probability of election.

III. Effects of Beauty in Elections, All Candidacies 1966-2004

       The fraction of winners among the half of the 312 candidacies with above-average

beauty is 0.548 (standard error of mean = 0.040); among the half of the candidacies with

below-average beauty the winning fraction is only 0.452 (standard error of mean =

0.040). This simple cut of the data by whether the candidate’s beauty is above or below

the average for his/her competitors suggests that beauty does matter in these elections.

To examine this further, and as a baseline for comparing the results estimated over the

multiple candidacies, Table 2 presents estimates of the impact of relative average

standardized beauty on a candidate’s chance of victory. Because there are two winners,

standard probit/logit estimation methods cannot be used. While a conditional logit that

used the six (4C2) possible pairs of candidates in an election as observations would solve

the problem of two winners, the set-up violates the assumption of the independence of

irrelevant alternatives in the conditional logit (the absence of correlation of the

unobservables across pairs). To deal with this difficulty the coefficients presented in

Table 2 are based on the multinomial multiple response estimator developed in Donald

and Hamermesh (2005). We assume that the errors follow the extreme value distribution,




                                             5
so that the index indicating a candidate’s strength is estimated under assumptions

analogous to those underlying ordinary logit estimation.4

            The first column in Table 2 shows estimates of the basic equation determining the

probability of election. Only the parameter estimates on citation share and female are

presented: The estimated coefficients on most of the other variables—being in a Top 5

economics department, not being an academic, being a future Nobelist, a theorist or

econometrician, an African-American, and years of post-degree experience—had no

statistically or economically significant impacts. Having held a high-level government

position has a statistically significant positive effect but is not of interest here. The

second column adds R*ij to the equation. In this cross section the impact of beauty on the

probability of being elected is positive with a t-statistic greater than one, although not

statistically significant at conventional levels. The estimated effect of being better

looking than the other candidates is not small: At one standard deviation below the mean

beauty in an election an identical candidate has a chance of 0.44 of being elected; at one

standard deviation above the mean the chance is 0.56.

            Column (3) includes an interaction between R*ij and gender, based on previous

work (Hamermesh and Biddle, 1994) that indicated that the impacts of beauty on

outcomes are greater for males. The implications of the results are remarkable: In this

sample a woman’s looks relative to those of the other candidates in an election have

absolutely no effect on her electoral chances. Among men, however, the impact is

substantial and approaches statistical significance. Given the overriding importance of



4
    Coefficients using standard logit techniques are very similar to the correct ones displayed in Table 2.



                                                         6
gender in these elections (74 percent of female candidates are elected), it is perhaps

unsurprising that female candidates’ beauty has little marginal effect.5

        Columns (4) and (5) explore asymmetries in voters’ responses to the candidates’

relative beauty. The estimates in column (4) demonstrate that moving further below the

average looks in an election has no impact on one’s chances of winning; but it does pay

to be increasingly better looking than one’s competitors, and the effect is large and

statistically significant.    Moreover, as implied by the estimates in Column (5), the

asymmetry only matters for male candidates. Being below or above average in looks has

no impact on female candidates’ victory probabilities.

IV. Using Multiple Candidacies to Infer the Effects of Beauty

        The cross-section results in Section III suggest that even economists pay attention

to beauty when making decisions. For whatever reason this ascriptive characteristic

matters in determining an outcome that we assume is the result of maximizing choices

made by a set of presumably rational agents. The question is whether changes in the

characteristic, holding constant other changes that might affect a candidate’s electoral

chances, alter the outcomes. To examine this possibility we estimate models over the 73

candidates (165 candidacies) who appear in two or more elections.

        Variations in their perceived beauty are almost surely exogenous to the election

outcomes: It is extremely difficult to argue that the candidates learn about the role of

beauty from their prior electoral experiences and submit more appealing pictures on

subsequent ballot appearances. Indeed, in their first electoral outing Rij (R*ij) averaged

0.026 (0.003); in their final electoral outing, the second for most of the 73 sample

5
 In a reduced sample that excludes the 46 female candidacies the estimated impact of beauty among male
candidates is larger than the estimates in Column (1) and is significant statistically.


                                                  7
members, Rij (R*ij) averaged -0.083 (-0.010). The differences in average beauty between

a candidate’s first and final outings are statistically zero; but they do decrease, contrary to

what one would expect if the candidates submitted pictures based on their learning about

the role of beauty in the electoral process.

       Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 list estimates of the same equations as in Columns

(2) and (4) of Table 2. (With the elimination of nearly half the sample and thus no

adding-up constraint on predicted probabilities, ordinary logit estimation becomes

appropriate.)    The standard errors are robust, accounting for the clustering of

observations. The parameter estimates and their implications are very similar to those

estimated over the entire sample. The effect of R*ij is about the same (although the

statistical significance is lower). Again we observe an asymmetric impact of R*ij, with a

statistically significant advantage to being increasingly better looking than the average

candidate, but no disadvantage to being increasingly worse looking.

       In Column (3) the same specification as in Column (1) is re-estimated over the

reduced sample of 33 people who win at least one election and lose at least one. This

sample is quite small, only 82 candidacies, so that sample size limitations lead us to

expect a reduction in statistical significance compared to the earlier estimates. Despite

that, the t-statistic exceeds one in absolute value; and the point estimate of the marginal

impact of an increase in beauty in this sub-sample is larger than in the entire sample or in

the sample of all multiple candidacies.

       For comparison to other estimates, Column (4) presents logit estimates over this

same sub-sample of candidacies, including only those variables that change between

candidacies—citation share, relative average standardized beauty and years of post-



                                               8
degree experience.6 Again there is fairly little change in the estimated impact of beauty

on electoral outcomes compared to the other specifications and (larger) samples. The

parameter estimate is positive, and the t-statistic still exceeds one.

        The conditional fixed-effect logit estimates are based on variations within the 33

candidates who appear in 82 elections and who lost at least one election and won at least

one.   The average duration between appearances on the ballot is 7.2 years, with a

minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 21 years. In many cases these durations may be

sufficient to allow the candidate’s underlying beauty to change slightly.7                         More

important, however, with different photographs on the ballots voters’ perceptions of the

candidates’ looks, as proxied by the raters’ perceptions, will vary across a candidate’s

appearances. The within-candidate variance of relative average standardized beauty is 39

percent of the total variance in this measure.

        The estimates in the final column of Table 3 show the impacts of changes in

candidates’ citations and beauty relative to the other three candidates included in the

elections in which they appear. All of the variation is within the candidate (relative to the

changing variation among the competing candidates). Even with this stringent test we

find roughly the same effect of changes in the candidate’s relative beauty on his/her

chances of winning an election as we have seen in the other estimates. Moreover, the

standard error of the parameter estimate remains roughly what it was (conditional on the




6
 This last changes differentially across observations because of differences in the time intervals between
candidates’ appearances on the ballot.
7
 There is evidence, however, of extremely high autocorrelation in an individual’s looks, even over many
decades (Hatfield and Sprecher, 1986, pp. 282-283).



                                                    9
diminution of the sample size).8 The mean probability of election in this reduced sub-

sample is 0.49. When R*ij drops by one standard deviation, the electoral probability falls

to 0.43; when it increases by one standard deviation, it rises to 0.55. These effects are not

small and are nearly identical to those in the cross-section estimates over the entire

sample.9

V. Conclusions and Implications

         This study has not shown that there is discrimination against bad-looking people

or reverse discrimination in favor of the good looking. Rather, I have demonstrated that a

particular real-world outcome becomes more favorable for the same person when

perceptions of his/her looks improve exogenously. When sample sizes are reduced

sufficiently, the estimated impacts of beauty are no longer significant statistically; but the

estimated impacts of perceptions of beauty remain unchanged, and the uncertainty about

the estimates increases solely in proportion to the decrease in sample sizes. These

findings should strengthen the conclusion, both about beauty and by inference about

other ascriptive characteristics such as race or gender, that even with the same average

amount of information it is relative position that is important. The characteristic itself, not

any correlation with unobservable productivity-enhancing characteristics, generates the

apparent impacts on outcomes of interest.


8
 The substantial increase in the estimated effect of scholarly productivity—the share of citations—is
surprising. It does not stem from non-linearity in the impact of citations: In the cross-section estimates in
Table 2 a nonlinear term in this measure is insignificantly different from zero. It may arise from the fact
that within-candidate variation in the citation share is only 15 percent of the total variance.
9
 Re-estimating all the models in Table 3 by substituting Rij for R*ij does not alter the conclusions about the
importance of beauty. Indeed, the statistical significance of coefficients on Rij is greater than that of the
estimates in Table 3 in all specifications. This similarity is not surprising, as the within-candidate standard
deviation of average standardized beauty accounts for 33 percent of the total variation in this measure.
Clearly, the variation in this measure in this equation stems from changes in perceptions of the individual
candidate, not from changes in how the looks of his/her changing group of competitors are perceived.
