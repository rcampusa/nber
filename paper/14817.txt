Do Newspapers Matter? Short-run and Long-run Evidence from the Closure of The Cincinnati
Post

                                              ABSTRACT

The Cincinnati Post published its last edition on New Year's Eve 2007, leaving the Cincinnati Enquirer
as the only daily newspaper in the market. The next year, fewer candidates ran for municipal office
in the Kentucky suburbs most reliant on the Post, incumbents became more likely to win reelection,
and voter turnout and campaign spending fell. These changes happened even though the Enquirer at
least temporarily increased its coverage of the Post's former strongholds. Voter turnout remained depressed
through 2010, nearly three years after the Post closed, but the other effects diminished with time. We
exploit a difference-in-differences strategy and the fact that the Post's closing date was fixed 30 years
in advance to rule out some non-causal explanations for our results. Although our findings are statistically
imprecise, they demonstrate that newspapers – even underdogs such as the Post, which had a circulation
of just 27,000 when it closed – can have a substantial and measurable impact on public life.

“Give light and the people will find their own way.”
                                — motto of the E.W. Scripps Co., owner of The Cincinnati Post

1. Introduction
        A century ago, 689 cities in the United States had competing daily newspapers; by
2008, only 15 did, and today that number has fallen to 11.1 Many monopoly newspapers are
also struggling financially. The decline in competition and in the newspaper industry as a
whole has prompted concern that the nation is losing a crucial source of information about
public affairs. In the words of one observer, “More of American life will occur in shadows.
We won’t know what we won’t know.”2
        This paper offers a case study of the consequences of closing a newspaper. The Cincin-
nati Post published its last edition Dec. 31, 2007, leaving the Cincinnati Enquirer as the only
daily newspaper covering Cincinnati and its suburbs in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky.
The closing was particularly important in the northern Kentucky suburbs, where the Post
historically dominated circulation and, as we document, provided more than 80 percent of
the combined local news coverage in the two papers. We use a difference-in-differences strat-
egy to show that the Post’s closing made municipal politics in the Kentucky suburbs less
competitive along several dimensions: Fewer people voted in elections for city council, city
commission, and school board; fewer candidates sought those seats; the remaining candidates
spent less money on their campaigns; and, for councils and commissions, incumbents’ chances
of retaining office improved. These changes happened even though the Enquirer at least tem-
porarily increased its coverage of the Post’s former strongholds. The differences appeared
immediately after the Post closed; in the case of voter turnout, the impact persisted through
the 2010 general election, nearly three years later, while the other effects diminished with
time.

   1
      The 1909–1910 figure is from Busterna and Picard (1993). Today’s precise count depends on the definition
of competing newspapers. Cities with major competing, separately owned dailies include Boston; Charleston,
W.Va.; Chicago; Detroit; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Los Angeles; New York; Salt Lake City; Trenton, N.J.; York, Pa.;
and Washington. Denver, Seattle, and Tucson, Ariz., all dropped from the list in 2009, with the closures of
the Rocky Mountain News, Post-Intelligencer , and Citizen, respectively. Honolulu fell from the list in 2010
with the merger of the Advertiser and Star-Bulletin.

      Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, quoted in
Starr (2009).
        We do not report analyses of election results in the Ohio suburbs because the Post
largely withdrew from covering these suburbs as early as 2001 (Philipps, 2007; Rutledge,
2007), implying that the closing itself would not be expected to have much impact in Ohio.3
In results not reported here, we apply to the Ohio suburbs the same methods used in this
paper to analyze the Kentucky suburbs and estimate a negative effect of the Post’s closing on
political activity in Ohio, but the effect is statistically insignificant and much less precisely
estimated than the already imprecise estimates in Kentucky.4
        Our results shed light on two important public policy concerns. First, our findings
suggest that even a small newspaper — the Post sold about 27,000 copies daily in 2007,
compared with 200,000 for the Enquirer — can make local politics more vibrant. Although
competing publications or other media such as TV, radio, and the Internet may take up some
slack when a newspaper closes, none of these appears so far to have fully filled the Post’s
role in municipal politics in northern Kentucky. Our findings confirm the fears of community
leaders such as Boone County Judge-Executive Gary Moore, who said on learning of the
Post’s impending closure: “I’m very concerned about Northern Kentucky news getting to
our constituents. The Post has done a wonderful job through the years of being the daily
informant of what’s going on in the community to our residents” (Duke, 2007). To the extent
that our findings apply beyond Cincinnati, they also suggest that local politics will become
less competitive after closures of the much larger second newspapers in cities such as Denver
and Seattle (where the Rocky Mountain News and the Post-Intelligencer , respectively, ceased
printing in 2009) or of monopoly papers in places such as Ann Arbor, Mich. (where The Ann
Arbor News closed two years ago).
        Second, the Post, an afternoon newspaper whose weekday circulation fell nearly 90
percent in its last 30 years,5 survived as long as it did thanks to an implicit government sub-

   3
     By 2007, just 30 percent of the Post’s weekday circulation was in Ohio, even though three-quarters of
the Cincinnati Metropolitan Statistical Area’s population is in Ohio; on weekdays the Post reached just
2.4 percent of households in Hamilton County (which includes Cincinnati), compared with 13.9 percent of
households in Kenton County and 16 percent of households in Campbell County in Kentucky (Audit Bureau
of Circulations, 2007).
   4
     We do not analyze elections in Ohio around the time that the Post reduced its coverage there because,
unlike the timing of the paper’s closing, the timing of the coverage reduction in Ohio was not predetermined
and may have been endogenous. We also cannot use the Ohio suburbs as a control group for comparison with
the Kentucky suburbs because Ohio and Kentucky hold municipal elections in different years.

sidy for newspaper competition. Under the Newspaper Preservation Act (1970), competing
newspapers that are in “economic distress” can obtain an exemption from antitrust laws and
form a joint operating agreement (JOA) that charges monopoly prices for subscriptions and
advertising, as long as the papers retain independent newsrooms. The Post and the Enquirer
formed a JOA in 1977. In passing the act, Congress determined that the value for democracy
of preserving independent editorial voices outweighed the potential deadweight losses from
monopoly pricing.6 As then-Rep. Spark Matsunaga, Democrat of Hawaii and a sponsor of
the act, put it in House debate: “Let us make no mistake about it, we are here being forced
into making a choice between preserving a free press as opposed to keeping the sanctity of
the antitrust laws. In a democratic society such as ours the choice is obvious — the free
press must be preserved” (Matsunaga, 1970). Despite the explicit congressional rationale for
the Newspaper Preservation Act, and even though 27 JOAs have existed over the years, ours
is the first analysis we know of to measure the political impact of preserving competition
through a JOA.7

total Monday-to-Friday circulation of 246,323 in 1977. The decline was linear with time. The Enquirer ’s
weekday circulation in 1977 was 190,407.
   6
     Newspapers in a JOA also combine their printing and delivery operations to exploit economies of scale,
but publishers can obtain these savings without an antitrust exemption so long as they continue to compete
in advertising and subscription sales.
   7
     An existing literature investigates the effect of JOAs on newspaper content and profits (see, e.g., Busterna
and Picard, 1993).


                                                                    3
       The JOA between the Post and the Enquirer is central to our empirical strategy.
Figure 1 lays out the timeline of events. Like most JOAs, the Cincinnati agreement specified
a terminal date, in this case Dec. 31, 2007. Unusually, though, the Post survived exactly
until this date chosen 30 years in advance, and no longer. (Of the 21 other JOAs that have
ended so far, 17 ended early when the owners decided that publishing two newspapers was
unprofitable and closed one paper or merged the two papers together. The other four lapsed or
were dissolved with both newspapers continuing to publish.) The Enquirer ’s owner, Gannett
Co., announced in January 2004 that it would not renew the agreement at the terminal
date, suggesting that Gannett thought publishing two newspapers no longer maximized joint
surplus. (If Gannett had merely thought that profits from going it alone would exceed its
share of JOA profits, it could have tried to renegotiate the agreement.) But the E.W. Scripps
Co., owner of the Post, apparently preferred to keep publishing: Instead of agreeing with its
partner to close the Post before the end of the JOA, as has been typical in other cities,8 Scripps
said it would explore “whatever options it may have to continue publishing newspapers in the
Cincinnati market in some form” (E.W. Scripps, 2004). These options proved unattractive
because, with the Enquirer managing the JOA’s business operations, Scripps would have
had to buy printing presses and hire advertising and circulation salespeople to keep the Post
open. Still, Scripps took more than three years to announce that it would close the paper
(E.W. Scripps, 2007).
       The Post’s central role in Scripps’ history may have motivated the company’s reluc-
tance. Company namesake Edward Willis Scripps made his reputation in the 1880s when he
bought the Post and built it into what was, at the time, Ohio’s largest daily (Baldasty, 1999;
Stevens, 1968). The family-controlled media chain’s headquarters remain in Cincinnati, and
many corporate executives once worked in the Post newsroom. But even if Scripps’ deci-
sion has an explanation other than historical sentiment, it seems unlikely that Scripps chose
the Post’s exact closing date near the actual time of the closing.9 Rather, the JOA partners
picked a date 30 years in advance, and the Post closed on that date because it was the default

outcome if the partners never changed the agreement.
       Because the Post’s closing date was fixed so far in advance, changes in local politics
after early 2004 — when Gannett announced it would not renew the JOA — cannot have
caused the paper to close exactly when it did. Third factors such as short-run municipality-
level economic fluctuations that might affect both local politics and the paper’s viability
are also less likely to be responsible for the timing of the closing, though Scripps perhaps
would have kept the paper open if the towns it covered had experienced a sudden economic
boom. Therefore, we can more plausibly attribute changes in political outcomes after the Post
closed to the paper’s closing instead of some other source. To help rule out the possibility
that the political changes occurred for other reasons and only randomly coincided with the
Post’s closure, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy, comparing changes in political
outcomes before and after the closure in suburbs that received relatively more or less coverage
from the paper. Suburbs that received less coverage serve as controls representing the likely
change over time if the Post had never existed. We also account for the possibility that
political outcomes and Post coverage both responded to the 2004 announcement on the
paper’s future by instrumenting for post-2004 coverage with 2003 coverage.
       Many previous researchers have also studied newspapers’ political impact. Most closely
related are studies measuring the effect of newspapers’ existence. Gentzkow et al. (forthcom-
ing) analyze historical data from 1869 to 2004, with a particular focus on the 1869–1928
period, and show that the presence of a local daily newspaper raised presidential and con-
gressional election turnout. Trounstine (2009) finds that incumbent advantage in city council
elections is lower in cities with their own daily or weekly papers. Oberholzer-Gee and Wald-
fogel (2005) show that blacks are more likely to vote in areas that have black-targeted weekly
papers. George and Waldfogel (2006, 2008) show that competition from The New York Times
reduces local papers’ circulation among highly educated readers and makes those readers less
likely to vote. Adserà et al. (2003) show that states and countries with higher newspaper cir-
culation per capita have less corruption. Mondak (1995) finds that voters in Pittsburgh saw
themselves as less informed about local elections during a newspaper strike. More broadly,
Gentzkow (2006) studies the effect of television on voter turnout, while Erikson (1976), Ger-
ber et al. (2009), Kahn and Kenney (2002), Chiang and Knight (forthcoming), Snyder and


                                              5
Strömberg (2010), and others measure the effect of newspapers’ content on voters’ and politi-
cians’ preferences and behavior, taking newspapers’ existence as given.
        Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, nearly all previous studies — like
our study — use observational data,10 but even the most sophisticated observational studies
run the risk that correlations between newspapers and political outcomes do not reflect a
causal impact of newspapers: Unobserved and uncontrolled-for third factors may influence
both newspapers and politics, or causality may run from politics to newspapers’ content and
availability rather than vice versa. In our case, the Post’s predetermined closing date reduces
such concerns, though at the cost of limiting the analysis to a small number of municipalities
in just one state. Second, the market for news media is changing rapidly with the rise of the
Internet. Our data, more recent than those in other papers, show that newspapers’ impact
persists in the present-day market environment.
        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 summarizes our data, section 3 lays out our
empirical strategy and results, and section 4 concludes.

2. Data
        Our analysis covers all 48 incorporated municipalities in seven Kentucky counties:
Boone, Campbell, and Kenton, which formed the core of the Post’s Kentucky circulation area,
as well as Bracken, Gallatin, Grant, and Pendleton, which border the core counties.11 We
have data on the number of stories about each municipality in both the Post and the Enquirer
in each year from 2003 to 2007, as well as the number of stories in the Enquirer in 2008, 2009,
and 2010; the results of every school board, city council, and city commission election from
2004 to 201012 ; candidates’ campaign spending in each election; and demographics from the
2000 census.

  10
      The main experimental study is Gerber et al., which uses a randomized controlled trial to measure the
effect of receiving a newspaper subscription. However, the impact of receiving a newspaper can differ from the
impact of the newspaper’s existence if readers tell nonreaders about stories or if politicians behave differently
when a newspaper might write about them.
   11
      Our sample excludes the former city of Latonia Lakes, Kenton County, which was dissolved in 2006.
   12
      We exclude mayoral elections because only three municipalities in our sample held mayoral elections in
2008.




                                                       6
A. Newspaper coverage
         We use the 2003 to 2007 Post and Enquirer story counts to construct an index of the
Post’s importance in covering each municipality: the fraction of stories about that munici-
pality that appeared in the Post. This index is a useful measure of the Post’s role because,
all else equal, communities where the Post’s share of coverage was higher lost more coverage
when the Post closed. (We cannot base our analysis on circulation data because independent
dealers delivered the Post and the paper had no centralized list of subscribers’ addresses. We
also cannot use the Audit Bureau of Circulations’ zip-code-level data because some towns in
our sample share zip codes. Regardless, because broadcasters and bloggers often quote news-
paper stories, the number of stories a paper publishes may matter more than the number of
subscribers: One subscriber with a well-read blog or popular broadcast can multiply a story’s
impact many times. Such repetition may help explain how the Post could have a meaningful
political impact despite its low circulation.) The Post’s share of coverage is highly serially
correlated: R-squareds in regressions of 2004 through 2007 indexes on the 2003 index range
from 0.71 to 0.83. Thus the index measures relatively permanent differences in the Post’s
importance across municipalities.
         We obtain the 2003 to 2007 story counts by searching the widely used NewsLibrary
database.13 We include the county name as well as the municipality name in the searches to
avoid counting irrelevant stories that would otherwise appear for municipalities with generic
names such as Union. To see whether certain kinds of stories disproportionately include
the county name, we picked two municipalities at random and performed searches with and
without their respective county names. We found no salient differences in the content of
stories with and without county names. We also found that the searches with county names
returned very few irrelevant stories.
         The Post published both an Ohio edition and a Kentucky edition, with some stories
appearing in both editions. In general, the Kentucky edition provides a more accurate mea-
sure of coverage in Kentucky. However, every Kentucky-edition story appears in our searches
for the city of Covington because the Post’s Kentucky reporters were based there. There-
fore, for all municipalities except Covington, we count stories in the Kentucky edition. For

                                              7
Covington, we count stories in the Ohio edition and multiply by that year’s average ratio in
other municipalities of Kentucky-edition stories to Ohio-edition stories. (This ratio ranges
from 6 to 10.)
          We also counted stories in the Enquirer in 2008, 2009, and 2010 to investigate whether
it changed its product positioning after the Post’s exit: If the Enquirer added coverage in
an effort to capture the Post’s former readers, it could have offset the loss of the Post’s
coverage. We could not obtain the 2008–2010 story counts from NewsLibrary because the
Enquirer removed all its stories from NewsLibrary in early 2009 and switched to a competing
archive service, ProQuest Archiver.14 Story counts in ProQuest are not directly compara-
ble to those in NewsLibrary because ProQuest includes much material that does not appear
in NewsLibrary and does not represent actual coverage by the newspaper, such as death
announcements submitted by funeral homes and event listings. We excluded the death an-
nouncements from our ProQuest searches but could not find an efficient way to exclude other
material. (ProQuest’s charges for viewing full articles prohibited us from examining each
story to determine whether to exclude it.) When we regress the ProQuest story count for
each community in 2006 on the NewsLibrary count for that year, we obtain a statistically
insignificant intercept of 14, a highly significant slope of 5.6, and an R-squared of 0.82, sug-
gesting that ProQuest story counts are a multiple of NewsLibrary counts plus random error.
We therefore think comparisons of ProQuest counts in 2008–2010 vs. 2006 (the last full year
before the Post’s closing was confirmed) are useful for examining changes in the Enquirer ’s
coverage. We prefer not to use the ProQuest counts for our main analysis both because
irrelevant results inflate the ProQuest counts and because ProQuest does not index Post
stories.

B. Political outcomes
          News coverage potentially influences election outcomes in many ways. By revealing
incumbents’ misdeeds or making it easier for challengers to get their message out, a newspaper
may reduce incumbent advantage (Trounstine, 2009). Alternatively, if newspaper stories
increase incumbents’ name recognition (Snyder and Strömberg, 2010), then a newspaper

  14
       http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/enquirer/search.html


                                                8
could increase incumbent advantage. Newspaper stories could also raise interest in politics or
make citizens feel more connected to their communities, thus inspiring more people to vote
or run for office. In addition, the closure of a newspaper could change campaign spending.
Candidates may spend less if reduced competition lowers the need to advertise, or spend
more if they must use paid ads to substitute for the free newspaper coverage they received
previously.15
        To measure these aspects of political engagement and competition, we obtained elec-
tion records for 2004 through 2010 for every municipality in the counties of interest.16 Ken-
tucky holds all regular municipal and school board general elections in November of even-
numbered years, simultaneously with elections for president, Congress, and state legislature
(but not for state executive offices, which are elected in odd-numbered years). The records
include the date of the election; the election type (general or primary, although only two
municipalities in our sample hold primaries); the name of the municipal body (for instance,
City of Bromley or Covington Independent School District); the title of the elected office
(for instance, city council member); the candidates’ names and party affiliations (however,
virtually all candidates are nonpartisan); the number of votes each candidate received; the
identities of the winners; and the number of votes each voter could cast (some elections allow
voters to cast multiple votes, corresponding to multiple seats). We also obtained records of
each candidate’s campaign spending from the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance.
        We use the election dataset to construct several measures of political engagement and
competition. Our first measure is an estimate of voter turnout. Ideally, we would measure
turnout in elections with only local races on the ballot, but we cannot do so because regular
municipal elections in Kentucky are always simultaneous with national elections. Instead, we
estimate the number of people who voted in each municipality’s local races in the 2004, 2006,
2008, and 2010 general elections. This approach helps us to measure citizens’ engagement

  15
      Many other outcomes are also potentially of interest but would be difficult to study in the context of
Kentucky municipal elections. For example, we cannot study party affiliation, because nearly all candidates
are nonpartisan. We also cannot study victory margins, because most races involve multiple candidates
competing for multiple seats, with voters allowed to cast multiple votes, so that strategic voting is possible
and vote totals do not necessarily reflect the strength of voters’ preferences.
   16
      We obtained the 2004 through 2008 records by contacting county election supervisors and downloaded
the 2010 records from the Kentucky State Board of Elections (http://www.elect.ky.gov/results). The
elections board Web site does not provide municipal election results before 2010.


                                                      9
with local elections because people who vote for national but not for local offices will not
affect our estimate of local voters. (People who vote for local offices but would not have
come to the polls without a national election can still influence our results, however. For this
reason, our empirical analysis controls for whether the election took place in a presidential
election year.) Because election records do not show the actual number of voters in a given
race, we construct our estimate of the number of local voters in two steps. For each local race
on the ballot, we estimate the number of voters casting ballots in that race as the larger of the
most votes received by any candidate or the ratio of total votes cast to the number of votes
allowed per voter in that race. We then estimate the number of voters in all local races by
the maximum across races of the number of voters in each race. There is no municipal-level
data on voting-age population after 2000 for the small suburbs in our sample, so we use the
number of voters as a proxy for turnout rates.
       Our second measure is the ratio of candidates for local office to seats up for election.
For each municipality and year, we count the people whose names appeared on a primary or
general election ballot. We divide this number by the number of seats up for election.
       Our third measure is the fraction of seats in a municipality that incumbents win in
a given year. We measure incumbent advantage by the fraction of seats won by incumbents
rather than by the difference in probabilities of winning for nonincumbents and incumbents
conditional on running because unpopular incumbents might not seek reelection. In that
case, incumbents who appeared on the ballot would have a high probability of winning even
if voters were, in effect, throwing out many other incumbents. Election records do not identify
incumbents, so we determine whether a candidate is an incumbent by checking whether that
candidate won the previous election for the same office. We verified a random sample of the
results by contacting officeholders and found that our method was accurate. Because our
election data start in 2004, this method allows us to identify incumbents starting in 2006
for city council and city commission seats, which have two-year terms. We do not examine
incumbent advantage in school board elections, because these elections are for four-year terms
and our data would allow us to identify school board incumbency starting only in 2008, after
the Post closed.
       Our fourth measure is campaign spending per candidate: the total campaign spending

C. Describing the data
      Table 1 summarizes the baseline data on demographics and news coverage. The mu-
nicipalities range in size from California, voting-age population 55 in 2000, to Covington,
voting-age population 32,151. The Post dominated coverage of the Kentucky suburbs, pub-
lishing 82 to 87 percent of total stories in each year. But the Post’s importance varied
substantially across municipalities, with the two papers splitting coverage of some places
roughly equally and the Post publishing 100 percent of stories about other places.
      Table 2 reports descriptive statistics on the outcomes we examine. No clear patterns
are evident over time, except that the Enquirer ’s overall level of coverage of the Kentucky

suburbs remained stable in the first year after the Post closed and then fell dramatically.
However, other factors may also have changed from year to year — for example, the 2008
presidential election had unusually high turnout — and influenced election outcomes or En-
quirer coverage. Our task in the next section is to examine how the Post’s closure affected
outcomes, holding other factors constant.

3. Empirical strategy and results
       Our basic model for the effect of Post coverage on an outcome yit in municipality i in
year t is
                 yit = αi + θ0,t + x0i θ 2,t + θ1 Post Share i × Post Closed t + it ,       (1)

where Post Share i is the Post’s share of all stories about community i in the period before
the Post shut down; Post Closed t is an indicator for whether the Post had closed as of date
t; xi represents demographic characteristics of the municipality; and it is all factors other
than postshare that affect the outcome. The coefficient θ1 is the effect of closing the Post on
outcome y in a community that received all its news coverage from the Post; a positive value
of θ1 implies that closing the Post raised outcome y in communities where the Post provided
a large share of coverage, compared with communities where the Post provided less coverage.
       We use the Post’s share of stories instead of the total number of stories in the Post as
our measure of the Post’s importance in covering a municipality because larger municipalities
may tend to have more stories in both newspapers. Taking the ratio of stories in the two
papers controls for the overall level of coverage while limiting the number of regressors, which
is desirable because we have data on only 48 municipalities. We calculate Post Share i as the
average over 2004–2007 of the Post’s share of stories in each year. Averaging helps to remove
year-to-year fluctuations that might result from random news events but do not reflect true
changes in the Post’s importance for a community. In addition, averaging guarantees that
we use the same measure of the Post’s importance for all years that it was open, so we are
identifying the effect of the paper’s closing rather than the effect of short-run fluctuations in
Post and Enquirer coverage while both papers were open.
       Our model controls for a variety of factors other than Post coverage that could affect
election outcomes. The municipality fixed effects αi account for time-invariant unobservable


                                                  13
differences across municipalities, such as permanent differences in voters’ interest in politics.
The year fixed effects θ0,t account for unobservable differences across years that affect all
municipalities equally, such as any national political events that have the same influence
on all voters. Finally, the interaction of year effects with demographics x0i θ 2,t accounts for
differences in how national events affect places with different observable demographics.
        To understand how equation (1) identifies the Post’s effect on elections, it is useful to
consider what would happen if we had only two years of data — 2004 and 2008, say. In that
case, we could estimate equation (1) by taking first differences. If we subtract equation (1)
for 2004 from the same equation for 2008, we obtain


 yi,2008 − yi,2004 = θ0,2008 − θ0,2004 + x0i (θ 2,2008 − θ 2,2004 ) + θ1 Post Share i + (i,2008 − i,2004 ). (10 )


Equation (10 ) represents a difference-in-differences strategy: It compares changes in outcomes
across years in municipalities with different levels of pre-shutdown Post coverage. In practice,
we have four elections’ worth of data, so we estimate (1) rather than (10 ), but the intuition
from (10 ) remains: We identify the effect of the Post by comparing how outcomes changed
over time in municipalities that, before the closing, received different amounts of coverage
from the paper.
        Equation (10 ) also gives intuition into what factors might bias our results. The error
term in (10 ) is (i,2008 − i,2004 ). Hence ordinary least squares estimates of θ1 based on (10 )
— and fixed-effects estimates based on (1) — will be biased if changes in other factors
(i,2008 − i,2004 ) are correlated with the initial level of Post coverage. The fact that the Post’s
closing date was set 30 years in advance helps rule out many sources of correlation. For
example, if Scripps had chosen the closing date based on economic trends around 2007 in
the communities where the Post was strong, and if local economic trends were correlated
with local political trends, then the error term would be correlated with the Post’s share in
2004. Because Scripps appears not to have set the closing date based on contemporaneous
economic trends, we think this type of correlation is unlikely to be a problem.
        Other sources of correlation may remain, however. Although the municipality fixed
effects αi and year fixed effects θ0,t remove any permanent characteristics of municipalities


                                                       14
and any differences between years that affected all municipalities equally, the municipality
and year fixed effects cannot remove differences between the years that affected some muni-
cipalities more than others. Our leading concern is that Barack Obama’s historic presidential
candidacy in 2008 may have increased turnout among young or black voters. Kentucky and
national exit polls show that blacks made up a larger fraction of voters in 2008 than in 2004.
National polls also show a slight increase in turnout among the young, though Kentucky
polls show no such difference. (See National Election Pool, 2004 and 2008. The polls show no
other significant differences between the 2004 and 2008 electorates in Kentucky.) Exit polls
do not break down data by municipality, but if the statewide and national differences carried
through to the places we study, and if Post coverage varied with the age structure or racial
composition of a community,17 then we might see outcomes change differentially in places that
had high Post coverage even if Post coverage had no causal effect on turnout. We account
for this possible correlation by including as demographic controls xi in (1) the fraction of
voting-age people who are black and the fraction who are ages 18 to 34 in the 2000 census.18
Since the coefficients θ 2,t on the demographic variables are different for each year, the model
allows events in a given year to have systematically different effects on municipalities with
different demographics. Related studies such as Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel (2005) and
George and Waldfogel (2008) also include jurisdiction and year effects and interactions of
year effects with demographics to eliminate bias.
         Some municipalities might also have unobservably different trends in factors that affect
the outcomes we study — for example, population growth rates might vary across munici-
palities — and these differences might be correlated with Post coverage. Therefore, in some
specifications, we control for this possibility by adding municipality-specific trends to the
model:
              yit = αi + θ0,t + βi × t + x0i θ 2,t + θ1 Post Share i × Post Closed t + it .           (2)

         Another concern is that any unobserved factor i,2004 that affected politics in 2004 could

  17
     We find marginally statistically significant evidence that the Post’s share was higher in communities
where a larger share of the voting-age population is black or ages 18 to 34.
  18
     We measure the fraction who are ages 18 to 34 as of 2000, rather than the fraction who will reach ages
18 to 34 by 2008, because the number of teenagers in 2000 will be a poor predictor of the number of young
adults in 2008 if different communities are particularly attractive to people of different ages.


                                                    15
also have prompted the newspapers to change their coverage, again producing a correlation
between the error term and the Post’s coverage share in 2004. If political behavior and Post
or Enquirer content both changed after 2004 in anticipation of the JOA’s end, we could also
find a spurious correlation. To guard against these possibilities, in some specifications we
instrument for Post Share i , which is the Post’s average share over 2004–2007, with its 2003
share. The 2003 share will be uncorrelated with i,2004 if the errors are serially uncorrelated.
Instrumenting for the Post’s share can also reduce attenuation bias in the estimate of θ1
if the Post’s share in any given year is a noisy measurement of the paper’s true long-run
importance in a community.19
        We weight all of our estimates by the municipality’s voting-age population (measured
in 2000). There are both statistical and policy grounds for weighting. From a statistical per-
spective, all of our outcomes except number of voters are averages, so random fluctuations in
outcomes will likely be larger in smaller municipalities, and the efficient estimator will weight
by population. From a policy perspective, policy-makers may care more about outcomes
in places where more people live. The appendix shows that — except in a few cases that
we highlight below — our qualitative results are robust to calculating the estimates without
weights.20
        Table 3 presents the results. On all four measures of political engagement and com-
petition, we find indications that the Post’s closure made elections less competitive:

Number of voters: In all specifications, our estimates show that relatively fewer people
       went to the polls after the Post closed in places where the Post was more important. The
       point estimates are large: The Post’s closing is estimated to reduce the number of voters
       by between 59 percent (1 − e−0.88 ) and 92 percent (1 − e−2.55 ) in a municipality where

  19
     The measurement error in the Post’s share appears to be classical: If postshare it is the Post’s share in
community i in year t, we find that corr(postshare it , postshare is ) does not depend on t − s for t 6= s, consistent
with a model where postshare it = trueshare i + uit with i.i.d. uit .
  20
     In an earlier version of this paper that examined only the short-run impact of the Post’s closing, we
also considered specifications that accounted for the limited range of the dependent variables. (For example,
campaign spending is left-censored at zero, and no matter how big or small incumbents’ advantage is, the
probability of an incumbent victory cannot exceed one or fall below zero.) We found that the results were
generally similar to those obtained with ordinary least squares estimation of (1). However, the limited-
dependent-variable estimators do not let us use an instrument for Post Share i , so we do not employ them in
this version.

       the Post provided all coverage, compared with a municipality where the Post provided
       no coverage. Notice, though, that the range of Post Share is substantially smaller than
       zero to one. Our estimates will not reflect nonlinearities in the effect of Post Share
       outside the observed range. The standard deviation of Post Share is 0.10; thus, for
       each one-standard-deviation increase in the Post’s share of coverage, the Post’s closing
       reduced the number of voters by between 8.4 percent (1 − e−0.88×0.1 ) and 22.5 percent
       (1 − e−2.55×0.1 ). Because our dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the number
       of voters, we can interpret our results as describing the effect on turnout rates: Changes
       in the voting-age population, which is unobserved but is the denominator of the turnout
       rate, will enter the error term of (1), and our estimates will be unbiased if the population
       growth rate is uncorrelated with the Post’s coverage share.21 The effect is statistically
       significant at least at the 5 percent level in both OLS and IV specifications when we
       do not include municipality-specific trends. Controlling for municipality-specific trends
       makes both the point estimates and standard errors larger, so that the effect is not
       always statistically significant. The appendix shows that we obtain similar results,
       slightly smaller in magnitude but with larger standard errors, when we do not weight
       by population.

Number of candidates: Relatively fewer people ran for office after the Post closed in places
       where the Post was more important. According to the estimates that do not control
       for municipality-specific trends, for each one-standard-deviation increase in the Post’s
       share, the paper’s closing reduced the ratio of candidates to seats by between 0.03 and
       0.11. In most specifications, the effect is not statistically significant at conventional
       levels. The appendix shows that the estimated effect is smaller but still negative when
       we do not weight by population.

Incumbent advantage: Incumbent advantage rose after the Post closed in places where
       the Post was more important. According to the estimates that do not control for
       municipality-specific trends, for each one-standard-deviation increase in the Post’s

  21
    We cannot check this assumption about population growth because the Census Bureau has no population
counts after 2000 for communities as small as those we study.



                                                  18
     share, the paper’s closing raised incumbent advantage by between 7 and 10 percentage
     points. The point estimates are generally slightly larger than the standard errors but
     are not statistically significant. This is the sole outcome for which the choice of weights
     matters for our qualitative results: The appendix shows that if we do not weight by
     population, then the Post’s closing reduced incumbent advantage.

Campaign spending: Candidates spent relatively less money on their campaigns after the
     Post closed in places where the newspaper was more important. For each one-standard-
     deviation increase in the Post’s share, the paper’s closing reduced spending by between
     $177 and $1,469 per candidate. The result suggests that the lower need for spending
     in less-competitive elections outweighed the potential need to buy campaign ads to
     replace newspaper coverage. The estimated effect is surprisingly large relative to average
     spending, but because average spending includes many candidates who spent no money,
     the estimated effect is more plausible compared with the average spending of candidates
     who reported positive spending. As with the other outcomes, the largest point estimates
     come when we control for municipality-specific trends. The point estimates are usually
     larger than the standard errors but not statistically significant. The appendix shows
     that the estimated effect is an order of magnitude smaller, but still negative, when we do
     not weight by population. In regressions not reported here, we also found a consistently
     negative effect of the Post’s closure on spending when the dependent variable was total
     spending or the natural logarithm of spending.

      Controlling for race and age structure proves not to affect the qualitative results,
though the magnitudes of the coefficients change in some cases. In regressions not reported
here, we obtained similar results when we controlled only for race and when we controlled
for adult population in addition to race and age structure. The small sample size makes the
dangers of specification searching particularly high, so we deliberately did not experiment
with other controls. For all outcomes, controlling for municipality-specific trends makes
the estimated effects larger in magnitude; thus, our results are not driven by unobserved
differences in trends between municipalities where the Post played a larger or smaller role.
      The impact of the Post’s closing could be larger in the short run than in the long


                                              19
run if it takes some time for other media to replace the Post’s coverage. Our estimates of
(1) would obscure this possibility by averaging together short-run outcomes from 2008 (less
than a year after the paper closed) with long-run outcomes from 2010 (nearly three years
after the closing). We investigate whether the short-run and long-run impacts are different
by estimating an equation with separate short-run and long-run coefficients:


  yit = αi + θ0,t + x0i θ 2,t + θ1,SR Post Share i × Post Closed SR t

                                               + θ1,LR Post Share i × Post Closed LR t + it . (3)


In equation (3), Post Closed SR t is 1 in 2008 and 0 otherwise, while Post Closed LR t is 1
in 2010 and 0 otherwise. The coefficient θ1,SR describes the impact of the Post’s closing in
the short run, 2008, while the coefficient θ1,LR describes the impact in the long run, 2010.
Note that if we include municipality-specific trends in (3), identification requires data on
at least two years before the Post closed; thus, when we estimate (3), we cannot include
municipality-specific trends for the incumbent-advantage outcome, for which we have data in
only one pre-closing year.
       Table 4 shows the results from estimating (3). In almost all specifications, the standard
errors are large and we cannot reject the hypothesis that short-run and long-run effects are
equal. However, some general patterns appear in the point estimates. When we examine
the number of voters, the short-run and long-run effects of the Post’s closing are similar;
if anything, we estimate that the closing depressed turnout more in the long run than in
the short run. For all other outcomes, however, the short-run effects are generally larger in
magnitude than the long-run effects, and in a few specifications, the long-run effects change
sign. The point estimates thus suggest that the Post’s closing had a long-lived effect on
voter turnout but that the impacts on the number of candidates, incumbent advantage, and
campaign spending diminished with time.
       In table 5, we use equation (3) to study how the Post’s closure affected the Enquirer ’s
coverage in the short run and the long run. Our dependent variable yit is the ratio of Enquirer
stories about municipality i in year t to Enquirer stories about municipality i in 2006. (Thus
yit = 1 for all municipalities in 2006.) A 0.01-unit change in this variable reflects a 1 percent

change in Enquirer coverage in year t relative to 2006. We calculate the percent change
rather than taking the logarithm of stories in each year because some municipalities had zero
Enquirer stories in 2008 and 2010. We take 2006 rather than 2007 as the baseline year for
measuring Enquirer coverage because the Enquirer may have already begun to change its
coverage in 2007 in anticipation of the Post’s exit.
       The estimates show that in 2008, Enquirer coverage rose relatively more in municipal-
ities where the Post initially provided a larger share of coverage. The finding survives when
we instrument for the Post’s share, indicating that the result is not merely a consequence of
reversion to the mean. Quantitatively, a one-standard-deviation increase in the Post’s initial
share led to an increase in Enquirer stories of 16 percent to 24 percent in the year after the
Post closed. However, the effect was transitory: As of 2010, municipalities where the Post
had been more important experienced little or no gains in Enquirer coverage. Unweighted
estimates, reported in the appendix, are even more stark: The estimated increase in Enquirer
coverage in 2008 is larger, and three of the four long-run estimates are negative.



                                                   22
        The Enquirer ’s transitory change in product positioning makes our results on political
outcomes especially striking: Local politics changed when the Post closed even though its
erstwhile competitor tried to replace the Post’s coverage. In addition, if the Enquirer ’s
added stories about towns with a high Post share came at the expense of stories about
towns with a low Post share, then our estimates of the Post’s political impact are lower
bounds on the true impact: If the Post’s closure caused the Enquirer to reduce coverage of
the “control” municipalities where the Post was initially unimportant, then the differences
between municipalities with high and low Post shares would be attenuated.22 Of course, the
quantity of stories is an imprecise measure of how much information a newspaper provides.
The quality of the Enquirer ’s stories — for example, their accuracy, timeliness, and readability
— may differ from the quality of the Post’s stories, either in all years or simply in 2008 or
2010, if the Post’s exit changed the Enquirer ’s incentives for producing high-quality stories.
The story count data do not measure such effects, if any. The story counts also do not
measure any changes in coverage from other media. Growth of other media might explain
how some political outcomes recovered by 2010 even though the Enquirer ’s added coverage
did not last. The impact of newspaper closings on alternative media would be a valuable
topic for future research.

4. Conclusion
        The logo of the E.W. Scripps Co., printed on the front page of all its newspapers,
is a lighthouse. This paper describes what happened when one of Scripps’ lights went out.
The Cincinnati Post was a relatively small newspaper, with circulation of only 27,000 when
it closed. Nonetheless, its absence appears to have made local elections less competitive
along several dimensions: incumbent advantage, voter turnout, campaign spending, and the
number of candidates for office. The effect on voter turnout persisted for several years after
the newspaper closed. We caution, however, that while our preferred point estimates tell
a compelling story, the results are statistically imprecise and sometimes sensitive to the

  22
     Since the Enquirer ’s total stories about the Kentucky municipalities fell slightly from 2006 to 2008, the
increased coverage of towns with a high Post share tells us that coverage fell in towns with a low Post share.
However, since we do not know what would have happened to Enquirer coverage if the Post had not closed,
this finding does not prove that the Post’s closure caused the Enquirer to reduce coverage of those towns.

use of weights. In addition, this paper is a case study of the closing of one newspaper;
future research could investigate the consequences of closings of other newspapers, though a
significant challenge is to find an exogenous or at least predetermined closing.
       Several other well-known newspapers have closed since the Post — the largest being
Scripps’ Rocky Mountain News, circulation 210,000, in February 2009 — and more are in
danger. Observers are energetically debating whether these closings matter: Do newspapers
play a valuable, irreplaceable role in American democracy, or can new media fill the gap
left when a paper closes? Starr (2009) argues that the newspaper industry’s decline “raises
practical questions for anyone concerned about the future of American democracy.” On the
other hand, after the Rocky closed, U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, said the
paper’s demise was “mostly for the better” (Crummy, 2009). Whether our results support
Starr’s view or Polis’ depends on how one values competitive elections. But if voter turnout,
a broad choice of candidates, and accountability for incumbents are important to democracy,
we side with those who lament newspapers’ decline.

A1. How weights affect the estimates
       Tables A.1 and A.2 investigate the effect of weights on our results by recalculating
the estimates in tables 3 and 5, respectively, without weighting municipalities by voting-age
population. For three of the four political outcomes, the results are qualitatively similar to
what we obtained using weights: The Post’s closing reduced the number of voters, reduced
the ratio of candidates to seats, and reduced campaign spending. However, the estimated
magnitudes of these effects are substantially smaller without weights in many specifications.
For incumbent advantage, weights change the qualitative conclusion: Without weights, the
Post’s closing is estimated to have slightly decreased the chance an incumbent would win
the election. When we examine Enquirer coverage, the unweighted estimates tell an even
sharper story than the weighted estimates: The estimated increase in Enquirer coverage of
Post strongholds in 2008 is larger, while in three of the four specifications, the Post’s closing
had a slightly negative long-run effect on Enquirer coverage.
