                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, we propose an extension of the productivity decomposition method developed by Olley
& Pakes (1996). This extension provides an accounting for the contributions of both firm entry and
exit to aggregate productivity changes. It breaks down the contribution of surviving firms into a component
accounting for changes in the firm-level distribution of productivity and another accounting for market
share reallocations among those firms – following the same methodology as the one proposed by Olley
& Pakes (1996). We argue that the other decompositions that break-down aggregate productivity changes
into these same four components introduce some biases in the measurement of the contributions of
entry and exit.

We apply our proposed decomposition to the large measured increases of productivity in Slovenian
manufacturing during the 1995-2000 period and contrast our results with those of other decompositions.
We find that, over a 5-year period, the measurement bias associated with entry and exit is substantial,
accounting for up to 10 percentage points of aggregate productivity growth. We also find that market
share reallocations among surviving firms played a much more important role in driving aggregate
productivity changes.

1    Introduction

Aggregate productivity is a weighted average of productivity at the producer level (firm or plant).
Empirically, these producers have vastly different productivity levels, even when the aggregation
occurs over narrowly defined sectors. Aggregate productivity changes over time then need not
only reflect shifts in the distribution of producer-level productivity. Holding this distribution fixed,
aggregate productivity can also change due to composition changes between firms: Due to changes

in market shares among surviving firms, but also due to the entry of new producers and the exit
of old ones. Empirical studies spanning many different countries, industries, and time horizons
have consistently shown that those composition changes are an important driver of aggregate pro-
ductivity changes (See Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan, 2001; and Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and
Scarpetta, 2013). This finding has spurred the development of productivity decomposition methods
that can break-down aggregate productivity changes into those 4 different components (produc-
tivity distribution shifts among survivors, market share reallocations among survivors, entry, and
exit). Several of these decomposition methods are based on following individual producers from one
period to the next, tracking changes in both their market shares and their productivity (An entrant
is interpreted as a firm whose market share increases from zero; Similarly, an exiter is interpreted as
a firm whose market share decreases to zero.). One notable exception is a decomposition based on
moments of the joint distribution of market shares and productivity developed by Olley and Pakes
(1996) – hereafter OP. That method does not accommodate entry and exit, in the sense that it
does not decompose aggregate productivity changes into components that are driven by entry and
exit. For a given set of firms, the weighted average of productivity is decomposed into a moment of
the firm productivity distribution (the unweighted mean), and a moment of the joint distribution
with market shares (the covariance between productivity and market shares).
    In this paper, we extend the OP decomposition to also measure the contributions of entry and
exit. We argue that this extension eliminates biases in the measurement of those entry/exit contri-
butions that are a feature of the other decomposition methods that follow individual producers over
time. Empirically, we show that these biases are substantial for the case of Slovenia’s transition
period from 1995 to 2000, especially when considering longer time spans. Our empirical results
also show that the contribution of market share reallocations among surviving firms to productiv-
ity growth is much more substantial, once the biases regarding entry and exit measurement are
eliminated.
    Setting aside the measurement of entry and exit, the OP decomposition has an attractive
feature relative to the decompositions that track individual firms over time: Because it is based on
moments of the distributions of productivity and market shares, it can be more directly connected
to theoretical models with firm productivity heterogeneity that have been developed to analyze the
pattern of market share reallocations across firms and its consequences for aggregate productivity.1

Given a distribution of firm productivity, these models feature a market mechanism that determines
an allocation of market shares to those firms based on their productivity and other firm and market
characteristics. This implies a given covariance between those market shares and firm productivity
– which is one of the key moments tracked by the OP decomposition. The other moment, the
unweighted productivity mean, tracks shifts in the distribution of productivity. (Of course, higher
moments of both the productivity distribution and its joint distribution with market shares may
also be important for the theoretical models, but nailing down the first moments is a necessary first
step.) Historically, the analysis of aggregate productivity changes across countries and over time
has focused on the distribution of firm productivity (centered at its unweighted mean). However,
much of the recent literature has shown that differences in the market-share covariance account for
substantial portions of those aggregate productivity changes (both over time and across countries).
   Since our goal is to highlight differences in decomposition methods, we have picked an empirical
case of an economy in transition that exhibits very large productivity changes: depending on the
measure of productivity used (labor or TFP), aggregate manufacturing productivity in Slovenia
increased between 40% and 50% from 1995 to 2000 (See Polanec, 2004). There is thus a substantial
productivity change to be decomposed into the 4 components we have discussed (productivity
distribution shifts among survivors, market share reallocations among survivors, entry, and exit).
We contrast the results from our decomposition method with the two main methods that are
currently used to break-down productivity changes into those same 4 components: One by Griliches
& Regev (1995) – hereafter GR – and the other by Foster et al. (2001) – hereafter FHK. Both
methods are refinements of a decomposition developed by Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992) -
hereafter BHC, who were the first to report a break down of aggregate productivity change into
those 4 components for U.S. manufacturing. These decomposition methods all produce different
measures for the same four components of aggregate productivity. This has induced some discussion
detailing the sources of those differences. In this paper, we argue that all those decompositions
suffer from some biases that stem from their construction method. In general, the theoretical
direction of those biases (as well as their magnitudes) is ambiguous. For the case of a fast growing
economy (such as Slovenia from 1995 to 2000), we show theoretically that this bias involves an over-
measurement of the contribution of entry. Our empirical decompositions show that the magnitude
of this bias is substantial and is then also reflected in a substantial under-measurement of the
contribution of surviving firms to aggregate productivity growth. In particular, the component
reflecting market share reallocations among surviving firms is most severely under-measured: we


                                                 3
find that its contribution to productivity growth is 2-3 times larger than in the GR and FHK
decompositions.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we review the existing
decompositions for aggregate productivity. In the following section, we define our new decompo-
sition and discuss the key measurement differences with the other decompositions. In the fourth
section, we empirically decompose Slovenia’s substantial productivity growth, contrasting the re-
sults obtained from our decomposition with the ones from the GR and FHK decompositions. The
fifth and last section concludes.


2       Review of Existing Decompositions

All methods start with a definition of aggregate productivity at time t as a share-weighted average
of firm productivity ϕit :
                                                         X
                                                  Φt =        sit ϕit ,                                            (1)
                                                          i

where the shares sit ≥ 0 sum to 1. The key variable of interest is the change in aggregate pro-
ductivity over time (from t = 1 to 2) ∆Φ = Φ2 − Φ1 . There are many potential choices for the
data counterparts representing the share weight sit and productivity measure ϕit . We review those
choices below with our empirical application. For now, we note that our decomposition does not
depend on any particular choice of weight or productivity measure. Our starting point is that those
choices are such that ∆Φ captures a meaningful dimension of aggregate productivity change (which
we seek to decompose). Since this productivity change is measured in differences, we assume that
the underlying productivity measure ϕit is in logs – so ∆Φ represents a percentage change. In
the appendix, we develop an alternate version of our decomposition that applies to productivity
measures in levels.2
        In their seminal contribution, Baily et al. (1992) follow firms over time, tracking their changes
to both shares sit and productivity ϕit . The contribution of each firm to the aggregate productivity
change ∆Φ, si2 ϕi2 −si1 ϕi1 , is then separated into three categories for surviving, entering, and exiting
firms – where si1 = 0 for entrants and si2 = 0 for exiters (and the unoberserved productivity ϕit
when sit = 0 is irrelevant). The change in weighted productivity for the surviving firms can then be
    2
    The existing literature on productivity decompositions typically uses a productivity measure in logs. The advan-
tage of the firm-level measure in levels is that the aggregate productivity measure can have a direct data counterpart.
For example, if productivity is measured as valued-added per worker and the weights are employment shares, then
Φt measures aggregate value added per worker.

decomposed into a sum of the productivity changes holding the firms’ shares constant (within-firm
component) and a sum of the share changes holding the firms’ productivity constant (between-firm
component). The resulting decomposition of the aggregate productivity change is:

                            X                              X                 X
                 ∆Φ =             (si2 ϕi2 − si1 ϕi1 ) +         si2 ϕi2 −         si1 ϕi1                                      (2)
                            i∈S                            i∈E               i∈X
                            X                           X                          X                 X
                        =         si1 (ϕi2 − ϕi1 ) +          (si2 − si1 )ϕi2 +          si2 ϕi2 −         si1 ϕi1 ,
                            i∈S                         i∈S                        i∈E               i∈X


where S, E and X denote the sets of surviving, entering and exiting firms, respectively. The first
line breaks down the productivity change across those three groups, and the second line further
breaks down the contribution for surviving firms into two sub-components. The first term is the
within-firm sub-component. It aims to capture the contribution of productivity improvements
within surviving firms. The second term is the between-firm sub-component that seeks to capture
the contribution of market share changes between surviving firms.
     The GR and FHK decompositions use the same approach as the BHC decomposition, following
firms over time and tracking both share and productivity changes. The main difference with
BHC is that both methods introduce a reference average productivity level. Since the shares sit
sum to one in both periods, the contribution of each firm to the productivity change ∆Φ can
be written as a difference with respect to any chosen reference productivity level ΦREF : ∆Φ =
X
   [si2 (ϕi2 − ΦREF ) − si1 (ϕi1 − ΦREF )]. This reference productivity level ΦREF is then used as
 i
a benchmark to evaluate the contributions of entrants and exiters relative to surviving firms.
     Griliches and Regev (1995) use the average aggregate productivity level between the two periods,
Φ̄ = (Φ1 + Φ2 )/2, as the reference productivity level. Their decomposition is then given by:



                X                                X                  X
        ∆Φ =           si2 ϕi2 − Φ̄ − si1 ϕi1 − Φ̄ +   si2 (ϕi2 − Φ̄) −   si1 (ϕi1 − Φ̄)                                        (3)
                i∈S                                                   i∈E                    i∈X
                X                          X                                 X                         X
            =         s̄i (ϕi2 − ϕi1 ) +         (si2 − si1 )(ϕ̄i − Φ̄) +          si2 (ϕi2 − Φ̄) −           si1 (ϕi1 − Φ̄).
                i∈S                        i∈S                               i∈E                       i∈X


In the second line, the contribution of surviving firms is broken into within- and between-firm sub-
components using an average (between periods) firm share s̄i = (si1 + si2 )/2 and an average firm
productivity ϕ̄i = (ϕi1 +ϕi2 )/2 constructed in the same way as the average aggregate productivity Φ̄.
The first line of the decomposition clearly shows how the introduction of the reference productivity


                                                                  5
level Φ̄ impacts the measured contributions of entry and exit relative to surviving firms. In the
BHC decomposition (where ΦREF = 0), the contribution of entry is always positive – regardless
of the productivity of entrants – and the contribution of exit is always negative – again regardless
of the productivity of exiters. The GR decomposition more accurately reflects the fact that the
contribution of entrants and exiters to aggregate productivity changes can be positive or negative,
depending on whether the productivity levels for that subset of firms are above or below the
reference productivity level. However, in the next section we will argue that the GR decomposition
still introduces some bias into the measurement of the contributions of entry and exit (and hence
also to the contribution of surviving firms) to aggregate productivity changes.
   Foster et al. (2001) use the aggregate productivity level in period 1 Φ1 instead of the time
average Φ̄ as a reference productivity level. Their decomposition is then given by:

                  X                                                   X                         X
           ∆Φ =         [si2 (ϕi2 − Φ1 ) − si1 (ϕi1 − Φ1 )] +               si2 (ϕi2 − Φ1 ) −         si1 (ϕi1 − Φ1 )    (4)
                  i∈S                                                 i∈E                       i∈X
                  X                          X                                   X
             =          si1 (ϕi2 − ϕi1 ) +         (si2 − si1 )(ϕi1 − Φ1 ) +            (si2 − si1 )(ϕi2 − ϕi1 )
                  i∈S                        i∈S                                  i∈S
                                                                      X                         X
                                                                  +         si2 (ϕi2 − Φ1 ) −         si1 (ϕi1 − Φ1 ).
                                                                      i∈E                       i∈X


As with the 2 preceding decompositions, the first line separates out the contributions of surviving,
entering, and exiting firms to the productivity change. The second line then also splits the contri-
bution of surviving firms into within- and between-firm sub-components (the first two terms), but
also incorporates a new third sub-component (labeled as a “cross” firm component) that captures
the covariance between changes in market share and changes in productivity. As with the GR de-
composition, the contributions of entry and exit can be either positive or negative, although their
sign now depends on the productivity of entrants and exiters relative to a different productivity
benchmark (the aggregate productivity in period 1 Φ1 ). This also attenuates the bias previously
mentioned with respect to the BHC decomposition, but we again will argue that some bias still
remains.
   The other commonly used decomposition proposed by Olley & Pakes (1996) eschews following
firms over time and instead is based on a decomposition of the aggregate productivity level Φt in




                                                              6
each period. This decomposition is:

                                                    X
                                       Φt = ϕ̄t +       (sit − s̄t )(ϕit − ϕ̄t )                     (5)
                                                    i

                                          = ϕ̄t + cov(sit , ϕit ),

              1    Pnt
where ϕ̄t =   nt    i=1 ϕit   is the unweighted firm productivity mean and s̄t = 1/nt is the mean market
share. We have introduced a slight abuse of notation with the definition of the cov operator, which
would typically be multiplied by 1/nt . However, since sit s are market shares, they essentially already
incorporate the division by the number of firms nt . Changes in productivity over time ∆Φ are then
simply given by the change in the unweighted mean ∆ϕ̄ and the change in covariance ∆ cov. This
provides a natural way of decomposing productivity changes into a component capturing shifts
in the productivity distribution (via the change in the first moment ∆ϕ̄) and another component
capturing market share reallocations via the change in covariance. This term is different than
the cross term from the FHK decomposition, which captures the covariance of market share and
productivity changes for an individual firm. On the other hand, the OP covariance is measured
purely in the joint cross-sectional distribution of market shares and productivity: it increases
with the correlation between market shares and productivity. In the next section, we extend this
decomposition to accommodate entry and exit, and argue that it more accurately captures the
separate contributions to aggregate productivity changes of entrants, exiters, and surviving firms.
Within these 3 groups of firms, our decomposition preserves the attractive features of the original
OP decomposition in providing a natural additional decomposition between shifts in the distribution
of productivity and market share reallocations.


3   Dynamic Olley-Pakes Decomposition with Entry and Exit (DOPD)

Let sGt = Σi∈G sit represent the aggregate market share of a group G of firms and define ΦGt =
Σi∈G (sit /sGt ) ϕit as that group’s aggregate (average) productivity. We can then write aggregate
productivity in each period as a function of the aggregate share and aggregate productivity of the
three groups of firms (survivors, entrants, and exiters):


                              Φ1 = sS1 ΦS1 + sX1 ΦX1 = ΦS1 + sX1 (ΦX1 − ΦS1 ) ,

                              Φ2 = sS2 ΦS2 + sE2 ΦE2 = ΦS2 + sE2 (ΦE2 − ΦS2 ) .



                                                          7
From this, we obtain the productivity change ∆Φ in terms of those components and then separately
apply the OP decomposition (5) to the contribution of the surviving firms:


                        ∆Φ = (ΦS2 − ΦS1 ) + sE2 (ΦE2 − ΦS2 ) + sX1 (ΦS1 − ΦX1 )

                             = ∆ϕ̄S + ∆ covS +sE2 (ΦE2 − ΦS2 ) + sX1 (ΦS1 − ΦX1 ).                                  (6)


The first line decomposes the aggregate productivity change into components for the three groups
of firms: survivors, entrants, and exiters. In the second line, we apply the OP decomposition (5)
to the contribution of surviving firms – further separating that component into one induced by
a shift in the distribution of firm productivity (the unweighted mean change in the productivity
of surviving firms ∆ϕ̄S ), and another one induced by market share reallocations (the covariance
change between market share and productivity for surviving firms ∆ covS ).3 We can also further
decompose the contributions of entrants and exiters in a similar way.4
       As our decomposition leverages the cross-sectional OP decomposition, the first step of sepa-
rating out the contributions by survivors, entrants, and exiters need not use the same reference
productivity level for all three groups. This is a necessary feature of the other decompositions that
track individual firms over time. Table 1 highlights those differences between our decomposition
and the GR and FHK decompositions. It contrasts the contributions of surviving, entering, and
exiting firms across the three decompositions. The first two columns clearly show how the same
reference productivity level must be used to evaluate the contributions of the three groups of firms
for the GR and FHK decompositions. In our proposed decomposition (third column), we can use
different reference productivity levels for all three groups.
       All three decompositions feature a contribution of entry that increases with the aggregate pro-
ductivity of entrants ΦE2 , a contribution of exit that increases with lower aggregate productivity
of exiters ΦX1 , and a contribution of surviving firms that increases with the aggregate productivity
difference ΦS2 − ΦS1 . (Needless to say, all three also add up to the same aggregate productivity
change ∆Φ.) However, we argue that our decomposition more accurately reflects the contributions
of those three groups in the sense that we can relate each group contribution to a specific couter-
   3
     The relevant market shares for this covariance term is the firm’s market share within the subset of surviving firms
(so those market share sum to 1 within this subgroup).
   4
     The contribution of entry can be decomposed into one component reflecting differences in the productivity
distribution between entrants and surviving firms, sE2 (ϕ̄E2 − ϕ̄S2 ), and another component reflecting differences in
the covariance between market shares and productivity for the two groups, sE2 (covE2 − covS2 ). The decomposition
for exit is very similar. We do not show those further decompositions above in order to maintain the parallel with
the 4 components of the GR and FHK decompositions.

factual scenario as follows: The contribution of surviving firms is simply the aggregate productivity
that would have been observed absent entry and exit. Since neither the productivity of entrants
in period 1, nor the productivity of exiters in period 2, are observed, we cannot use an identical
counterfactual for those two groups of firms. Instead, we can use the set of surviving firms as a
benchmark and ask how adding the group of entrants (or exiters) affects the aggregate productivity
change. Thus, our contribution of entry, sE2 (ΦE2 − ΦS2 ), is the change in aggregate productiv-
ity ∆Φ generated by adding/removing the group of entrants. Similarly, our contribution of exit,
sX1 (ΦS1 − ΦX1 ), is the change in aggregate productivity ∆Φ generated by adding/removing the
group of exiting firms.
   We note that using a different reference productivity level for entrants and exiters is critical
in order to apply this ‘counterfactual’ definition. Entrants generate positive productivity growth
if (and only if) they have higher productivity ΦE2 than the remaining (surviving) firms ΦS2 in
the same time period when entry occurs (t = 2); Exiters generate positive productivity growth if
(and only if) they have lower productivity ΦX1 than the remaining (surviving) firms ΦS1 in the
same time period when exit occurs (t = 1). Because the GR and FHK decompositions follow
surviving firms over time, they need to use the same reference productivity levels for entrants and
exiters. Any choice of reference productivity level will necessarily lead to a bias in measuring the
contribution of one group or the other (and potentially to a bias for both groups). When there is
productivity growth, the reference level for surviving firms reflects that growth and ΦS2 > ΦS1 .
The reference productivity levels Φ1 (for FHK) and Φ̄ (for GR) are then below ΦS2 , leading to
an over-measurement of the contribution of entry for both decompositions (and hence an under-
measurement of the contribution for the remaining two groups of firms).
   Consider the following hypothetical example of an economy with productivity growth rate γ > 0
among representative firms (same productivity level across firms that is growing at rate γ). Now add



                                                   9
entry and exit of a portion of those representative firms. The economy’s rate of productivity growth
is still γ, which is the same growth rate as in the absence of entry and exit. Our decomposition
therefore assigns a zero net contribution to the γ rate of productivity growth for entry and exit.
On the other hand, the GR decomposition assigns a net contribution of sE γ/2 for entry and sX γ/2
for exit; The FHK decomposition assigns a net contribution of sE γ for entry and zero for exit.
In both cases, a positive net contribution is assigned to entry when this entry does not affect the
economy’s rate of productivity growth. In the following section, we apply all three decompositions
to the fast growing Slovenian economy, and show that this over-measurement is quite substantial.
        For any given contribution of surviving firms to the aggregate productivity growth, our empirical
application also exhibits substantial differences in the decomposition of this growth into within-
and between-firm components. For the 1995-2000 cumulative period, we find a substantially larger
contribution of the between-firm component (relative to GR and FHK). These discrepancies relative
to the existing OP, GR, and FHK decompositions that have also been highlighted in other work.
(A priori, there is no clear way of signing the direction of those discrepancies.) As we argued in
the introduction, the OP decomposition has the attractive property of a direct connection with
theoretical models of firm productivity dynamics. The contribution of our current work is to adapt
this decomposition to incorporate entry and exit.


4       Empirical Application: Slovenian Manufacturing 1995-2000

We use accounting firm-level panel data covering the entire Slovenian manufacturing sector (NACE
2-digit industries 15-37) for the 1995-2000 period.5 During this time, the manufacturing sector
(and the rest of the economy) went through significant structural changes that were triggered
by economic reforms adopted in the late 1980s and early 1990s (e.g. liberalization of prices and
wages, deregulation of firm entry, and privatization of state-owned firms). The shock caused by
economic reforms initially led to large declines in both aggregate output and labor productivity,
followed by a fast reversal to high growth, which was sustained through our entire sample period.
During that time, value added per worker increased nearly 50%. Previous empirical research using
Slovenian manufacturing data (Polanec, 2004; Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta, 2009) has
established that an important part of this aggregate productivity growth was driven by market share
reallocation between surviving, entering and exiting firms. This evidence that all four channels

contributed to substantial aggregate productivity gains makes our data set ideal for illustrating our
new decomposition, and contrasting its predictions with the GR and FHK decompositions.


Description of Data

The data set contains information on firm identity, year of reporting, annual sales, costs of materials
and services, nominal physical capital and employment. From these we can calculate (or estimate)
all the standard measures for labor and total factor productivity at the firm level. We deflate firm
revenue and material costs by the firm’s NACE 2-digit producer price index, and physical capital
by the price index for investment goods. The reported number of employees is calculated from the
annual number of hours worked by all workers.
   Table 2 reports summary statistics for the first and last year of our sample (1995 and 2000).
In order to include the same set of firms in all decompositions (regardless of the productivity and
share measure used), we only keep firms that employ at least one worker, have positive physical
capital, and generate positive value added. The remaining number of firms in our sample increases
by 18.4% between 1995 and 2000, from 3,867 to 4,580. Among these firms were 2,677 survivors,
1,903 entrants and 1,191 exiters (based on transitions from 1995 to 2000; we break down transitions
at intermediate time intervals later on). Over this time, the average size of active firms, measured
by employment, decreased from 60.1 to 45.2 employees, mainly driven by the entry of smaller new
firms (size reductions by surviving firms played a more minor role).6 The downsizing of surviving
firms and the exit of firms also contributed to a decline in aggregate employment by 11.2%, from
233 to 207 thousand workers. Nevertheless, real aggregate sales, real aggregate value added and
real aggregate physical capital all substantially increased over that time span: by 46.1%, 45.8%
and 25.3%, respectively.


Choice of Productivity Measure and Weights

There are numerous possibilities for the choice of a productivity measure and associated mar-
ket share weight. Foster et al. (2001) discuss how these choices can affect the decomposition of
aggregate productivity for a given decomposition method. Our goal is to contrast the different
decomposition methods for a given choice of productivity measure and weights. We restrict our
analysis to two main productivity measures and associated weights: one measure of labor pro-
   6
     The average employment of surviving firms between 1995 and 2000 declined from 67.4 to 59.4 employees. In
2000, the average employment of entrants was 25.1 employees.

ductivity with employment shares as weights, and one measure of total factor productivity (TFP)
with nominal-value-added shares as weights. We directly compute labor productivity as the log of
value-added per worker. We estimate TFP for our second measure as the residual of the firm-level
production function regression separately for all NACE 2-digit industries:


                                   ln T F Pit = ln Yit − α̂ ln Kit − β̂ ln Lit ,                               (7)


where Yit , Kit and Lit denote the real value added, real capital and employment of firm i in period
t, and α̂ and β̂ denote the regression coefficients for capital and labor. We use a value-added
production function (and nominal-value-added weights) instead of one based on gross output (with
intermediate inputs in the production function), as Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) argue that the
former yields productivity estimates that have a much more direct welfare interpretation. However,
we have also experimented with TFP based on gross output production function regressions and
corresponding weights equal to gross output shares, and the qualitative features that we emphasize
are robust to this alternative productivity measure.7
       There is a vast (and growing) literature on productivity estimation that explores many asso-
   7
    The results are also robust to estimates of production function using the control-function approach proposed by
Olley and Pakes (1996).

ciated measurement and estimation issues. One of those issues is the simultaneity bias between
shocks to productivity and changes in variable inputs (typically labor in a value-added production
function framework). For our sample, correcting for this bias does not substantially change the
labor and capital elasticities, and hence has negligible effects on the productivity rankings and year
to year changes that are the key ingredients for our productivity decompositions (along with the
shares, which are directly measured). Another important issue is the unobserved firm price, which
affects the measures of output (gross or value-added). Foster et al. (2008) find that entering firms
charge lower prices relative to incumbent firms. This depresses the measurement of the physical
output of entrants relative to incumbents. Thus, we should be clear that our productivity measure
relates to revenues and not physical output.
   More generally, we emphasize again that our focus is on the contrast between decomposition
methods for a given set of productivity measures and weights. Addressing the numerous measure-
ment issues for firm productivity will lead to a different starting point for the decompositions; but
the contrast between the decompositions that we highlight will remain. Those differences are based
on the use of a sample featuring strong productivity growth among incumbent firms. In addition,
one of our productivity measures, value added per worker, is directly computed, and thus of direct
interest. In the appendix, where we adapt our decomposition to productivity changes in levels (not
in logs), the aggregate productivity measure is simply aggregate manufacturing value added per
worker. This variable is clearly relevant and important, regardless of the productivity measurement
issues discussed above.


Results

We report the results from the GR and FHK decompositions, and our proposed dynamic OP
decomposition with entry and exit (DOPD) in table 3. In order to focus on the differences associated
with the contribution of entry, we initially report a single productivity contribution for the surviving
firms – along with the contribution of entering and exiting firms (following the first line of the
decompositions 3, 4, 6). We then separately report the within- and between-firm components
for surviving firms in the next table. The top panel is based on the labor productivity measure
with employment shares, and the bottom panel is based on the TFP measure with nominal-value-
added weights. We report decompositions between 1995 and all subsequent years until 2000 in
order to illustrate how the measurement biases are affected by the length of the time span. For
each decomposition, the contributions of surviving, entering, and exiting firms sum to the same

  as log percents (or log points) – and can thus be interpreted as percentage point changes.

        As we compare the contributions of entry across the three tables, we can easily verify the direc-
  tion of the over-measurement that we previously motivated for the GR and FHK decompositions
  (relative to our decomposition). All three decompositions roughly measure the same contribution
  for entry over the 1 year interval from 1995 to 1996: negative 2-3 percentage points for labor
  productivity and 0 for TFP. However, as the time span increases, we see that the contributions
  of entry for the GR and FHK decompositions steadily increase, up to 9-10 percentage points for
  FHK and up to 4-5 percentage points for GR. On the other hand, our decomposition reports that
  this contribution of entry remains steady at all the different time spans: slightly negative for labor
  productivity and slightly positive for TFP.
        Consider first the case of labor productivity. Table 4 reports the underlying aggregate labor
  productivity and share data for all three groups of firms across all time spans. Our decomposition
  reports a negative contribution of entry to aggregate labor productivity change because, in any
  given year, entrants have an aggregate productivity ΦE2 that is below the aggregate productivity
  of surviving firms ΦS2 for that time period (see bottom panel of Table 4). Thus, in all sample
  years, the entrants’ productivity is below the overall aggregate productivity level Φ2 : their presence

                                                      14
pulls the aggregate productivity level downward. Concurrently, the aggregate productivity of both
surviving firms and entrants is steadily growing, year over year. Part of this growth is attributed
to the contribution of entry to aggregate productivity growth in the GR and FHK decompositions.
(This is why those decompositions report a contribution of entry that is growing with the time-
span.) We describe this finding of a large positive contribution of entry for those decompositions
as a bias, because it does not reflect the fact that entrants are pushing the aggregate productivity
level downward (in any given year). Table 3 shows that this bias can be empirically substantial,
accounting for 6-12 percentage points of aggregate productivity growth over 5 years.

   Consider next the case of TFP. The same reasoning explains the over-measurement of the
contribution of entry to aggregate TFP changes for the GR and FHK decompositions. The only
difference is that entrants have roughly the same TFP levels (on average) as surviving firms. Thus,
the contribution of entrants to productivity change is roughly nil, rather than slightly negative.
(This is due to the fact that entrants use capital less intensively than surviving firms; this depresses
their labor productivity relative to their TFP in comparison with surviving firms.) Nevertheless,
the aggregate TFP of both entrants and surviving firms is growing year over year, leading to the
same over-measurement issue that we previously described for labor productivity.

                                                   15
      In the case of a growing economy such as Slovenia, the over-measurement of the contribution of
entry will be most severe for the FHK decomposition as it uses a lower reference productivity level
Φ1 than the GR decomposition reference productivity level Φ̄. (In both cases, the over-measurement
is induced by the fact that the reference productivity levels are below ΦS2 .) By the same token, this
also means that the bias in the measurement of the contribution of exit for the FHK contribution
will be less severe than for the GR decomposition. As we have argued in the previous section,
the reference productivity level for the contribution of exit should be the aggregate productivity
of surviving firms in that same time period, ΦS1 . The reference productivity level Φ1 for the FHK
decomposition is closer to this reference point than the reference productivity level Φ̄, which is
substantially greater than ΦS1 . Thus, the GR decomposition will substantially over-estimate the
contribution of exit to productivity growth (as Table 3 also makes clear). As we previously noted,
the use of a single reference productivity level for both entry and exit implies that the substantial
productivity growth of surviving firms, ΦS2 − ΦS1 , will be attributed either to the contribution of
entry or to that of exit.
      For both the GR and FHK decompositions, this implies that the joint contribution of entry
and exit will be substantially over-measured – leading to an equally-sized under-measurement of
the contribution of surviving firms. Empirically, Table 3 reveals that the extent of this under-
measurement sums up to 7-10 percentage points of aggregate productivity growth over 5 years.
      This under-measurement of the contribution of surviving firms is especially important for the
quantitative relevance of the between-firm sub-component in explaining aggregate productivity
changes. Table 5 breaks down the contribution for surviving firms into the within- and between-
firm sub-components specified by the three decomposition methods (see the second line of the
decompositions 3, 4, 6). These two sub-components are expressed as shares of the surviving firm
productivity change from Table 3 in order to isolate differences associated with this subsequent
decomposition. Thus, those shares sum to 100 percent for the GR and DOPD decompositions.
In the case of FHK, the cross term is not reported; along with this missing term, the other two
components sum to 100 percent. A priori, there is no clear direction for the differences between
our within-between decomposition (which just mirrors the OP decomposition) and the other two
decompositions. Empirically however, Table 5 shows that the share of the between component
is substantially larger for OP-DOPD relative to the other two decomposition methods over our
full 5 year sample.8 When we combine this under-measurement with the previously mentioned
  8
      The between component is even negative for the FHK decomposition of TFP changes.

                  component is omitted.


under-measurement of the surviving firm contribution, we obtain an even larger gap for the over-
all contribution of this between-firm sub-component to Slovenian aggregate productivity growth.
Over the 5 year interval from 1995-2000, we find that those market share reallocations towards
more productive firms added 12 percentage points to aggregate labor productivity and 10 per-
centage points to aggregate TFP growth. These numbers are over double those given by the GR
and FHK decompositions and represent a quarter of the overall productivity gains for Slovenian
manufacturing.


5   Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an extension of the productivity decomposition method developed by
Olley & Pakes (1996). This extension provides an accounting for the contributions of both entry
and exit to aggregate productivity changes; and it also breaks down the separate contributions
of firm-level productivity shifts and market share reallocations among surviving firms. We argue
that the other decompositions that break-down aggregate productivity changes into these same
four components introduce some biases in the measurement of the contributions of entry and exit.


                                                     17
Furthermore, our proposed decomposition also inherits the attractive properties of the original Ol-
ley & Pakes (1996) decomposition that aligns more directly the measured components of aggregate
productivity changes within the framework of recent theoretical models featuring heterogeneous
firms. We apply our proposed decomposition to the large measured increases of productivity in
Slovenian manufacturing during the 1995-2000 period, accounting for the separate contributions of
firm-level productivity changes, market share reallocations, entry, and exit. We contrast our results
with those obtained from the other commonly used decompositions that break-down productivity
changes into the same four components. Our results highlight that the magnitudes of the measure-
ment bias relative to those other methods can be substantial over a five year period. In contrast
to those other decompositions, we also find that market share reallocations among surviving firms
played a much more important role in driving aggregate productivity changes.
   In this paper, we have focused on decompositions at the firm-level, which is the finest level of
aggregation in our data. However, our decomposition can also be applied at higher levels of aggre-
gation. For example, the unweighted mean-covariance decomposition can be applied to industries
as well. This generates a break-down of aggregate productivity into within- and inter-industry
components. So long as firms do not switch their industry affiliation, our firm-level decomposition
can be nested within the industry level decomposition. There are many other interesting groups of
firms to which this decomposition method can be applied.

A    Alternative Decomposition of Firm Productivity in Levels

In the main text, we developed a decomposition of aggregate productivity as a weighted average of
firm productivity measured in logs. Although this is typically the aggregate productivity measure
that is reported and decomposed in the literature, it suffers from one potential drawback: it does not
directly correspond to a measure that is relevant for aggregate welfare (see Petrin and Levinsohn,
2012, for a further discussion of this topic). Alternatively, one can define aggregate productivity
as the weighted average of firm productivity in levels. This aggregate variable has a direct welfare-
relevant interpretation, as it captures the economy’s output per unit input (aggregate value added
per worker in our example with labor productivity).
    In this appendix, we show how our decomposition can be applied to this case. The only required
modification relates to the covariance measure: we need to define a scale-independent covariance
measure that is invariant to proportional changes in measured productivity. Such a measure is
obtained simply by dividing firm productivity by aggregate productivity. Our scale independent
measure is defined as cov
                       f = cov(s, ϕ/Φ) = cov(s, ϕ)/Φ. As with the covariance used in the main
text with productivity measured in logs, cov
                                          f represents the share of aggregate productivity Φ that
is driven by the correlation between productivity and market share; the remaining share ϕ̄/Φ
represents the contribution of the productivity distribution – independent of its correlation with
market shares.
    Using this scale-independent covariance, we can express the relative change in aggregate pro-
ductivity as:

        Φ2 − Φ1   ΦS2 − ΦS1        ΦE2 − ΦS2       ΦS1 − ΦX1
                =            + sE2           + sX1

                                          f S + sE2           + sX1           ,                 (A.1)
                       f S Φ̄
                  1 − cov        Φ̄S                      Φ̄            Φ̄

where Φ̄ = 1/2(Φ1 + Φ2 ), Φ̄S = 1/2(ΦS1 + ΦS2 ), cov
                                                  f S = 1/2(cov
                                                             f S2 + cov
                                                                     f S1 ) represent time averages
over periods 1 and 2. By construction, cov
                                        f < 1 and hence cov
                                                         f S < 1. This alternate decomposition
breaks-down aggregate productivity changes (now measured in levels) in a very similar way as the
one we introduced in the main text (see (6)). The separation into the contribution of surviving,
entering, and exiting firms in the first step proceeds in an identical fashion. We then separate out
the contribution of the surviving firms into the same two components: one reflecting shifts in the

                                                 A-1
distribution of firm productivity in levels via the change in the unweighted mean ∆ϕ̄S (within-
firm productivity changes), and the other reflecting the change in our scale-independent covariance
measure (between-firm productivity changes). Unlike our original decomposition, these two terms
require a common scaling factor so that they add up to the percentage change in the level of
aggregate productivity.1
       We report the results of this alternate decomposition in Table A.1 using the level of value added
per worker and employment weights. This table is thus the counterpart to the DOPD columns in
Tables 3 and 5. We see that the percentage changes in the level of aggregate productivity track
the changes in the aggregate of log productivity quite closely, though the former are slightly below
the latter by about one percentage point. However, the four separate components of this aggregate
productivity change exhibit some larger deviations. Using productivity in levels leads to smaller
contributions of exit and of within-firm productivity changes among surviving firms. On the other
hand, this alternate decomposition of productivity changes in levels leads to a higher contribution
of market share reallocations among surviving firms.
