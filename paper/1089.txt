                       Optimal   Price arid Inventory Adjustment
                  in   an Open-Economy Model of the Business Cycle



                                        ABSTRACT

       This paper devf lops an open-economy macroeconomic model which can

be used to interpret the observed fluctuations in output, inventories, prices,

and exchange rates in the medium-sized economies of the world. The model is

consistent with the major empirical regularities that have been discovered in

studies of business cycles as closed-economy phenomena arid in empirical studies

of prices and exchange rates. The empirical regularities are (i) changes in

the nominal money supply cause real output fluctuations, (ii) deviations of

output from a "natural rate" show persistence, (iii) exchange rates are more
volatile than nominal prices of goods, and (iv) depreciations of the currency
coincide with deteriorations of the terms of trade. A controversial aspect of

the model is that only unperceived money has real effects. The channel through

which these effects arise involves a misperception by rational maximizing firms

of the true demand that they will face after having set prices. The firms learn

about their environment from equilibrium asset prices, and the dynamics of the

model reflect the optimal response of inventory-holding firms rather than ad hoc

price dynamics.

         The purpose of this paper is to develop an open—economy model which

 can be used to interpret the observed fluctuations in output, inventories,

 prices, and exchange rates.          We have constructed the model to be
 consistent with the empirical regularities that characterize fluctuations

 in these magnitudes discovered in studies of business and inventory cycles

 and with the empirical regularities concerning prices and exchange rates

 ciscovered in open—economy studies.

      At the center of our model is the optimization problem of domestic

 firms   facing uncertain demand. The representative firm   must set its price

at the beginning of the period without      knowledge of actual demand which
occurs during the    period.   Although firms have less than full information
about the current state of the economy, they do observe market clearing
prices in asset markets, the government's preliminary announcement of     the

monetary aggregate, as well      as  prices being charged by other firms.
Consequently, firms use this      information to make inferences about what
demand will actually occur, and they set their
                                               prices to maximize the
present value of profits. It is crucial to our analysis of real effects

of monetary disturbances that asset       markets be informative about real
aspects of the economy.2 The firm's problem is nontrivially intertemporal

because inventories are carried through time.

     ach period firms make two sequential decisions.         First, they set
their prices based on incomplete information.
                                                     Second, after they have
received orders for their procucts, they decide how much of the orders to

meet out of current production and how much out of inventories.

     Cur model is consistent with two major empirical regularities
alscovered in studies of business      cycles.   These two regularities are:
                                        2



(i)     changes in the money supply result in real output fluctuations and

(ii) deviations of output from a "natural rate" of output show
persistence. Fully perceived monetary shocks have no real effects in our

model, but unperceived monetary shocks affect real variables in our
framework because price—setting firms        are unable to infer from asset
prices the exact values of monetary disturbances and demand disturbances.

        because   the demand for money in our model depends on expenditure by
domestic residents,      a positive expenditure disturbance (for example) is

also a positive money demand disturbance.         In this structure either a

positive money supply disturbance or a negative expenditure disturbance

will elicit incipient excess supply in the money market. Since firms see

only the equilibrating asset price responses to such incipient excess

supply, there is a tendency for firms to misperceive a positive money

supply shock as a negative disturbance to real demand for the home good.

Firms are led to lower their relative prices below what would be optimal

wtn full information. Since real demand actually has not shifted       in   this

example, firms experience unexpectedly high demand once orders are
processec.        because we assume that these orders must be filled at the

posted prices, the typical firm's optimal response to the unexpected

demana is to meet part of it by raising current production and part of it

out of current stocks of inventories.       The firm carries smaller inventory

stocks into the future than previously intended.                Deviations of
inventories fran their optimal levels are       costly,   and the avoidance of

these costs causes persistence of deviations of output from its natural

rate.     In the example above, a monetary disturbance in this period causes

inventories to be lower than previously intended next period.           Hence,
                                            3



 firms produce     more in future periods than      previously   intended in order to

 make up the inventory shortfall.

        A controversial aspect of our model is that real effects of money

 shocks depend on the part of those        shocks   that is unperceived rather than

on the full unexpected shock.             An unexpected shock is one which is
 unpredictable based on       past information.      An unperceived shock is one

wnlch cannot be inferred from current. information.          It is the distinction

between unperceived money and unexpected money which separates the

monetary business cycle models of the Lucas (1973) — Barro (1976, 1980)

type (the island models) from those of the Gray (1976) — Fischer (1977)

type (the wage indexing models). The well known empirical work of Barro

(1977, 197) examines only the effects of unexpected money.                 Since all

unperceived money must      also   be unexpected, the Barro work does not clarify
the    type   of monetary shock important for business cycles.

       The more recent work of Barro and Hercowjtz (1980) and Boschen and

Grossman (1983) does attempt to disentangle these two types of shocks.

Both sets o± authors find evidence which                they interpret as being
unfavorable to the hypothesis that the monetary portion of the U.S.
business cycle is due entirely to unperceived money.               Interpreting the
evidence as these authors have done requires the imposition of some strong

exogeneity assumptions involving the money supply process and the behavior

of the U. S. Federal Ieserve Board as well as some additional arbitrary

restrictions involving lack of correlation among disturbances.               A more
precise consideration of these issues will be given below in the context

of our model.

       The    major empirical regularities confronting theories of exchange
rate   determination are the following closely related facts: (i) exchange
                                        4




rates are more volatile than nominal goods prices in the sense that for

one period ahead, exchange rates are harder to predict than are goods

prices, and (ii) countries' exchange rates are negatively correlated with

their terms of trade, that is, a currency depreciation tends to coincide

with a deterioration in the terms of trade. In light of these facts, the

dominant model of exchange—rate determination has become the one developed

by Dornbusch (1976).

      In the Dornbusch model, markets in goods are in disequilibrium with

prices increasing in response to excess demand, but asset tnarkets are

continually     in equilibrium.   In typical stochastic presentation of the

framework, such as Mussa (1982), the domestic price of the home good is

treated as a preoetermine variable, unresponsive to current disturbances.

Thus, a positive monetary shock increases real balances which requires a

decrease in the nominal interest rate to reequilibrate the money market.

The   fall in the nominal interest rate is accomplisned by an over
depreciation of the domestic currency accompanied by the expectation that
the currency will appreciate. The currency depreciation deteriorates the
country's    terms of   trade increasing domestic and forei&n demand for the
home good,    which slowly drives up its nominal and relative price.

      Despitethe large number of extensions of the basic Dornbusch model,
several   awkward aspects remain prevalent in the literature. First, as
mentioned    above, domestic prices   of home goods are typically treated as

predeterminec      variables with respect to current disturbances.          In
contrast,    domestic prices of foreign goods are taken to be proportional to

the exchange rate, and they jump with jumps in    the   exchange rate. Neither

the   precetermjnation of prices nor the assumed asymmetric treatment of
home and foreign goods prices appears to characterize the observed
                                          5



 macroeconomic price aggregates.         In the   Dornbusch model, predetermined

 prices are perfectly predictable given last period's information set.
 While it      is difficult to imagine what macroeconomic price aggregate
 fulfills the       condition of perfect predictability,         presumably the
 predetermination of prices is intended as an abstraction which captures

 the stylized fact that prices do not appear to respond fully and

 immediately to monetary or other disturbances.            Indeed, the essential
 aspects of the Dornbusch analysis are preserved in a model where price

 adjustment    to past excess     demand is not perfectly predictable.       Price

adjustment may have an unpredictable stochastic component which is

uncorreJ.ated with other monetary and real disturbances.         It is not   clear
though   how such a disturbance arises, and it    is   not obvious to what extent
the results of      the   L)ornbusch model depend on predetermination of prices

per se versus some other form of incomplete current
                                                          price adjustment. The
second unappealing aspect of constant output versions of the Dornbusch
model such as the presentations of Flood (1981) or Mussa (1982) concerns

the reconciliation of the disequilibrium between demand and supply in the

goods market.        These models never specify how the aisequilibriurn is
allocated across agents.

       In the present paper both of these awkward aspects are confronted.

because firms      are    using asset market information when setting prices,
Qomestic prices in our model are correlated with current
                                                                   disturbances.
but, since the agents do not see and are unable to infer exactly the
values of the actual disturbances
                                       affecting asset prices, domestic price
adjustment    to   a money supply disturbance, for example, is less     than its
full
       information counterpart Decorning complete only    with the resolution of
uncertainty.       Further, the firms in our model      are engaged in pricing,
                                       6




production, and inventory management.        Any   deviation    between current

demand     and current production is accomodated by corresponding optimal
inventory adjustment.
      The exchange rate and price solutions of the model reflect the
inherent dynamics induced by a current disturbance and propogated        through

time by    optimal management of prices and inventories. The model was set
up   to match Dornbusch's with respect to initial effects of real and

monetary disturbances.      The dynamics of the Dornbusch model, though,

result from slow price adjustment, while our dynamics result from slow

inventory adjustment. This divergence implies quite different adjustment

paths for exchange rates and relative prices following initial impact
effects.   For example, in the Dornbusch set up a one—time monetary
disturbance causes the exchange rate to overshoot its long—run value and
to be expected to approach that long—run value slowly but directly from
above. In contrast, in our set up a one—time monetary disturbance causes

the exchange rate to overshoot its long run initially and to be expected
to undershoot it subsequently, approaching the long run from below. The
crucial difference between these two response patterns centers on the real
impact of a money surprise in our model.            Such a surprise drives

inventories down and output up. Inventories and output adjust directly to

their long—run values.      But, rising inventories are associated with a

depreciating   domestic currency, so the exchange rate must undershoot after

overshooting and then depreciate to its long—run level.        Consequently, the

dynamics of our uiodel imply even more wild gyrations of exchange rates

than those implied y a Dornbusch—type model.

     The macdel of price and inventory adjustment employed in this paper is

a descendant Iran a long line of similar optimizing cnocels.          The early
                                              7



 work on this type of model as a theory of the firm was done by Halt,

 Moai.glianj, Muth and Simon (1960) and by L.ovell (1961) and was extended by

 label (1972). More recently, Feldstein and Auerbach (1976) and Eichenbaum

 (193) have implementea versions of the model to study inventory
 aajustment at the firm and             industry level, while Blinder and Fischer

(192), Blinder (1982), Amihud and Mendej.son (1982), Haraf (1981), and

1runner, Cukierman and Meltzer (19b2) have worked with variations of the

framework at the macroeconomic level. These latter models are designed to

incorporate optimal price and inventory adjustment into rational

expectations, closed economy macro models. While our model differs from

each of the above in many details, two points stand out.                    First, the

dimension of price aggregation is different across our work and •the other

models. Because the other models are constructed for hypothetical closed

economy analysis, the only relative prices which concern firms are those

arising in comparisons across firms producing the same product.                     In

contrast, our open economy firms must be concerned with their relative

prices ccmpareu       to   foreign good as well as their prices compared to other
domestic firms.            Second, our firms make price and output decisions
sequentially, whereas the other models have simultaneous price and output

decisions and often treat both variables as predetermined with respect to

current period information.            While our   sequential   decisions are slightly

more difficult to anlayze, our results are consistent with three empirical

regularities.

     The     first regularity, noted by Feldstein and Auerbach (p. 363,
197b)   ,   is that   average absolute sales forecasts errors for durable goods

are typically nine           times larger     than average absolute changes in
inventories.      This     fact   suggests that   procuction brtcs the gap between
                                      3



actual sales and forecasts of sales, indicating that production responds

to unanticipated demand as in our   framework.   Since Feldzteiri and Auerbach

are quite cautious about the quality of the sales forecast data used        to
establish the point, we are correspondingly reluctant to use their data as

the only support for our modeling strategy.

     The second and third regularities have been documented by Barro

(1977, 197a).    They concern the positive response of real output to

monetary shocks and the lack of strong econometric evidence in support of

"price surprise" terms in estimated aggregate supply functions. Our model

produces a positive response of output to monetary shocks only when output

is allowed to respond to actual demand. When output must be determined by

the firm at the beginning of the period using its current information set,

positive monetary shocks would induce firms to lower output because firms

misperceive positive monetary shocks as decreases in real demand.         Our

sequential decision strategy produces a positive response of output to

positive monetary shocks because positive monetary shocks are associated

with unexpectedly high demand given the posted prices of firms derived in

the first stage optimization. The final feature of our model which should

be noted in this introduction concerns a difference across moels in

transmission of the real effects of monetary shocks.      Since firms in our

model have full knowledge of the prices charged by other firms, monetary

shocks do not have real effects because of a "price surprise" term in the

aggregate supply function, which is a common feature of open and closed

economy models of the business cycle.5

    While price surprise terms are crucial to many recent models of

business cycles, it. is disturbing that such shocks have not played an

.mportant role in econometric macro models.      Indeed, Barro (1981, p. 71)
                                           9



                                                                          I

 writes,   !t(.iven the relatively minor role played by price surprises in the

 results of Sargent (1976) and Fair (1979) ...,        it   appears that monetary
 influences on output involve channels that have yet to be isolated."

 Although additional econometric work may show that price surprise terms

 are the primary transmission mechanism of monetary shocks, the response of

 output in our model is consistent with the current evidence.

       Our investigation yields three principal results.          First, monetary
 disturbances produce persistent real output effects. The impact effect is

due to price—setting agents' confusion concerning the true nature of

disturbances impinging on asset markets.         The persistence is due to the
effect of inventory movements on future production decisions.         Second, our

rnoael precicts that output variance will be higher under fixed exchange

rates than under floating rates unless the monetary authority announces

the extent of intervention required to maintain the fixed rate.
                                                                              This

result, which is similar to one derived by Kimbrough (1d2), is due to the

fact that fixing the exchange rate removes it as an information source

firms may use to infer real disturbances. Unless that information source

is replaced by intervention announcements, the quality of firms' infor—

cnation is poorer with fixed rates than with floating rates, and firms will

have a tenoency to react to disturbances with output changes rather than

with price changes.      Third, the model matches the open—economy empirical

regulrjtjes the Dornbusch (1975) model was designed to explain even

though prices in our model need not be predetermined.          A special case of

our model results in precetermined home goods prices.
                                                                However, because
our   inventory—based dynamics are different from the Dcrnbusch—type price-
basec dynamics,   our   model does riot   generate a Dornbusch—type tnoOei as a
special case.

        Our analysis is presented in the next two sections. In Section II we

develop the model b focussing first on the goods markets and second on

the asset markets.         At the end of Section II we summarize the model.

Section III presents the full reduced form           solution   of the model, and

Section IV is an analysis of the dynamic responses of the endogerious

variables to the exogenous stochastic shocks that drive the model.             The

consistency of the predictions of the model with the various stylized

facts is discussed in Section V.               The volatility of output under

alternative exchange rate regimes is discussed in Section VI which is

followed by some concluding remarks.



II.     The Open Economy Macro Model

        This section presents an open economy macro model based in part on

the decision problems of rational profit maximizing firms.                     Our

presentation is in two parts. In the first part, we develop the equations

of    the   goods markets which consist of demands for and supplies of the

goods produced in the medium sized open' economy being examined.               The

result of this part is a set of optimal decision rules governing pricing,

inventory accumulation, and production.           These decision rules are not

reduced forms, however, since imbedoed in the rules are beliefs concerning

currently unobservable disturbances.          The formation of those beliefs is
based on information extracted from      asset   markets.   In the second part of

this    section   we provide the asset market structure. We emphasize that the

gooas    markets determine only relative prices and the interaction of the
ooos ana asset markets is required to aetermine nominal prices.
       Our macel is one in which same irrevocable aecisions are made
                                                                      6
sequentially,      and they are based on incomplete information.          At   the
                                               11




 beginning of the period, agents choose their asset portfolios for the

period, and firms choose their prices for the period. These decisions are

based on identical incomplete information concerning the state of the

economy. Later in the period, firms and agents discover the actual level

of demand facing the firms.              Given the prices posted at the beginning of

the period, firms respond to the actual quantities demanded by choosing

profit maximizing levels of production and inventory accumulation.

II&. Demand in the Goods Markets

       There are k firms in the economy, each facing a demand curve of the

form

charged by firm j      which is equal to that firm's nominal price divided by

II. Pricing, Production and Inventory Holding

       Firm j faces the demand curve given by (1).             If   the   firm charges the

average economy—wide relative price,                    then its demand is its share

backlogged orders are costly to the firm           because   it nust discount price to

               The firrrrs'     first   stage contingency plans are found from the following

maximization problems:

The firm's maximization problem is subject to an initial stock of

inventories, N1, and to the relationships (1) and (3).                                   The discount
rate a is a constant between zero and unity.9 The operator Et denotes the

mathematical expectation conditional on the information available to the

firm at the beginning of period t. All firms have                           identical information

sets, so the operator is not specific to the firm.

               In finding the firm's optimal plans we have assumed that k is
sufficiently large that each firm takes the economy—wide variables
N          ,    and   Y         as invariant to the firm's decisions.          Such a strategy is

to preclude k                    ,   and    the reader may want to interpret out results in
terms of this special case.1°

        The problem stated in (4) implies a pair of linear Euler equations

for each of the k firms.             These equations are recorded in Appendix A and

must oe used to find firm—specific decisions.                     Since our concern is with

aggregates, we record here only the "aggregate Euler equations't, which are

obtained by summing the firm—specific Euler equations.                       These aggregate

        Equation ('(a) gives both the contingency plan for Rt and actual Rt
since triese values are identical.                However, equation (Tb) does not give

actual Nt, only expected Nt, since actual inventories will not be
determined until the second stage of optimization when actual demand is

revealed to the firms.            Equations (Ta) and (Tb) make intuitive sense.
Since          < 0 and !ff2 > 0,       responds negatively td beginning of period

inventories and responds positively to expected demand disturbances.
Since 0 <          < 1, expectea inventories obey a stable autoregression; and

since 'N2 < 0 inventories are expected to fall in response to a positive

cemand disturbance.

       After the firms set prices, they are confronted with actual demand.

We    assume that the firms may       not alter their posted prices after they see

demand.     however, the firms need not follow their contingency plans for
inventory, accumulation. Instead, upon seeing demand the firms satisfy the
demand with an        optimal combination of           current production and inventory
change.    This is the second stage of optimization, and in this stage each

firm takes as given its own                 price,      the economywide average price,
beginning of period inventory, ana actual demand for the current period.

The    economy—wide Euler equations for this stage of the optimization are

obtained in a manner similar to (5a) and (Sb) except that                  is now not a

aecision var1Le and the information set relevant to the                optimization now
induces    the actual value of demand at time t.

 our expressions for these magnitudes all contain the expectation Etwt. To

 determine this magnitude agents use their knowledge of the entire economy

 which consists of both the goods markets and the asset markets. We turn

 now to the development of the asset markets.

 lic. The Asset Markets

        The economy we are portraying is one which is small in the world

 securities markets, where all securities are perfect substitutes, and

small in the markets for foreign produced goods.
                                                                 However, the country is
large    in the markets for domestically produced goods and for domestic
money.        Thus, foreign interest rates and foreign goods prices are
exogenous to our economy.                The principal equations describing the asset

however, we assume that u is composed of two uncorrelated white noise

components, e and a, U,,                     e + a. Further, we impose                         0.

cisturoance, u, he always thinks that disturbance to be dominated by the

individual—specific component, e.                         Hence, the agent cannot use his

ouservation or' u to form                   useful    inferences concerning Ut or other

       Before turning to the formal   solution   of the model, it is useful to

summarize informally the working of the model.          At the beginning of each

perioa prices are set, and the exchange rate and interest rate are
determined. However, agents do not know, at this stage, the actual values

of the disturbances v, w and z.              The agents see all prices, the

exchange rate, the current money number, and both the domestic and foreign

interest rates. From these data the agents form inferences concerning the

values of the disturbances.       It is the inferred value of w, Etwt, which

teeds into the pricing decision. After prices are set, the actual value

of the demand disturbance aria the other disturbances are revealed to the

agents.        The firms then choose optimal production and inventory
accumulation based on the actual quantity demanoed which is determined in

part by the prices set under partial inforatiori and in part by the demand

distrubance, w.




III.   The Solution

for the level of output, imventories, the exchange rate, the average

relative price of the domestic good, and     the nominal price of the domestic

 good.        The first step required in obtaining a solution is to extract

 information from the clearing of the asset markets and from the money

 number to form                 agents'         perceptions about current disturbances.                        Agents
 will be able to observe two signals of the three underlying aggregate

 disturbances.

 lilA. Information and the Asset Markets

        At the beginning of the period each agent has the information set I'

which contains the values of                                                                               k),

decisions at the beginning ot' the period in both price setting and in the

asset markets depend on their perceptions of these distrubances, they will

use the information in I to draw inferences about the disturbances. We

assume that Etvt, Etwt, and Etzt denote the linear least squares
projections of the respective disturbances onto the information set

        To find the values of these linear least squares estimates we must

isolate the new information entering I concerning the disturbances at the

beginning of           the period.14 Two of the disturbances                             impinge directly on
the asset markets, and it                           is   from these markets that agents extract one

sinal concerning the disturbances.                                Using international capital market
equilibrium, (12b) , money market equilibrium may be written as

IV. The Dynamics of the Mode].

        As the reduced—form equations (20) indicate, the beginning of period

inventory stock, Nti, the actual money supply from the previous period9

            and the stochastic disturbances v, w, and z. are the state
variables of the system.              We assume that actual money is known with a one

period lag. Therefore, the lagged nominal money stock does not influence

the real sector of the mode]., and since the logarithm of the actual

nominal money supply is assumed to follow a random walk, the exchange rate

and domestic price change equiproportionality to known changes in rn1.

Consequently, ANm =
                            A         A1       0, and Asm Xm 1.
     The dynamic path               of the economy is              induced by innovations in the
exogenous stochastic processes, the innovation in the actual money stock,
v, the domestic demand disturbance, w, and the error in the money
number, z. These contemporaneously unobservable disturbances shock the
system away from its steacy state which is labeled with an F subscript in

 Figure          1.    In that figure, the NN, Yl, , and s(m0)s(m0) loci indicate

 the va.Lues at' Nt. 'r R and s that are consistent with any particular

 value of Nti given a level of money,                  m1 =    m0, and no new shocks to the
 system.               Figure   la   demonstrates that when inventories are away from

 their steady state, they converge over time in a stable autoregression
 toward the full equlibrium
                                         NF.     As YY indicates, output is above YF when
 inventories are below NF.                    Along the adjustment path firms set their
 relative prices higher when inventories are low as indicated by R' and

 for Nt_i             < NF the exchange rate is expected to depreciate, as

 indicates, as the economy moves toward full equilibrium.                              This is
 consistent with asset market equilibrium and with the expected fall in R.

e turn now to consideration of how the economy responds to the stochastic

disturbances.

        Consicer how the economy responds to                   an unobservable stochastic
increase in the money supply, vt., given that it begins in full

equilibrium and given that              w =           0.    From (1gb), notice that EtWt
wi +             2)v     <      indicating that agents misperceive the increase in the

money supply as a reduction in real goods demand. This occurs because the

information provided by the equilibrium values of prices, the interest

rates and the exchange rate obtained                       by firms in observing        g iS
consistent            with an increase in the money supply arid with a reduction in
expenditure.             As (19a) indicates, combining g with the information in

the money number allows firms to infer that v has increased, but Etv

                                                                        Since   firms expect a
fall    in real demana, they lower their relative price to                       in   Figure ic
which       is   the intersection of the locus R(v) and                 At   this point firms

along a shifted aggregate demand curve.                        When real demand is        actually
realized, it         occurs along            the unshifted demand curve because we are
discussing the influence of a monetary shock and are holding w =                               0
Since firms have set low relative prices, detnand is unexpectedly high.
Firms       respond with an optimal combination of increased production, at the
intersection        of the locus Y(v,w) and NF in Figure                    lb, and inventory
aepletion, at the intersection of the locus N(v,w) and NF in Figure la,

The domestic currency depreciates in response to the Vt shock for two

reasons.          First, to the extent that the monetary shock is               perceived,    all

nominal prices including the exchange rate rise equiproportionately.

second,       part of the deterioration in the terms              of   trade, i.e. the decrease
in ,          is accomplished by a            depreciation of the currency, the exchange
rate    rises.          In Figure          id, the exchange rate is determined by             the
intersection       of   the locus s(v) with NF.
        A    fundamental insight of Dornbusch (1976) was that                  monetary    shocks

woula cause exchange rate overshooting if goods prices were fixed and the

money market was in equilibrium.                        In this model overshooting is not a

necessary result although it                      is more    likely the smaller is            the

semi—eiasticity of the demand for money with respect to the interest rate.

To demonstrate this result, notice that X5,,,, the initial response of the

exchange rate to a money shock, can be written as its full information

response plus an            additional term:


                            L.

                                       31




      After the initial response to the monetary shock, the economy adjusts

 over time back to its unconditional equilibrium unless new stochastic

 disturbances alter its path. Inventories begin to accumulate since firms

 produce output in excess of demand which firms constrain by raising the

 relative price of their product above its
                                              unconditional equilibrium value.
 The exchange rate falls in period t+1 to facilitate the improvement in the

 terms of trade.     As Figure id indicates, the exchange        rate is then
 expected to depreciate over time to its unconditional equilibrium value

SF(ml).   Rather than approach its new steady state from above as in the

Dornbusch (1976) framework, the approach is from below.

      Now consider the influence of a positive shock to real demand which

we nornaljze to have the same effect on inventories and output as the

previously discussed money shock in Figure 1.     This shock is considered in
isolation fran other shocks, i.e.,
                                      v          =   0.   When a positive but
unobservable real shock occurs,
                                  w, > Ew > 0, since EtWt        _U3wlt and
O <          < 1.    Firms expect an increase in demand and raise their
relative prices.    In Figure ic, i   is    given by the intersection of the
locus (w,z) and NF.       Firms expect to draw down inventories and to

increase proauctjon, but they are surprised by the magnitude of actual
demand.   Output for period t occurs at the intersection of the locus

1(v,w) and NF in Figure lb. and     is given by the intersection of N- and
the locus N(v,w) in Figure la.     The exchange rate falls as the currency
appreciates for two reasons.        First, the currency appreciates to
facilitate the improvement in the terms of trade.         Second, agents think

that the supply of money has fallen since EtVt                           < 0.
Consequently, the exchange rate falls to reflect the perceived decrease in
tie money supply.
                                                    32



          The dynamic adjustment in period t÷1 and afterward is exactly as in

the case of the positive monetary disturbance except that the exchange

rate in period t+i+1, j =                0,   1, 2, ...,   is   given by the intersection of
N
    t+i
          and the locus s(m )
                               0
                                    in    Figure id.

          Next,   consider   the   response of the economy to z the reporting error
between the logarithms of the measured nominal money supply and the actual

money supply, given Vt               w         0.   The money number,        is a source of

"news" about the actual money supply.                      Knowing m, allows agents to make

inferences about the state of the economy. Frenkel (1981) and Frenkel and

Mussa (1980) have stressed that modern asset theories of the determination

of the exchange rate predict that much of the observed changes in exchange

rates will be in response to new information or news.                       If that news is

measured with error, such as                    is, then the noise in the news will be a

fundamental determinant of all of the endogenous variables of the economy

includjri the exchange rate.

          Given the stochastic structure of the economy, agents misinterpret

positive z disturbances as positive real demand disturbances, since Etw

            > 0, and as positive money supply disturbances, since
                                                                               EtVt
> 0.       Gonsequently, for the real sector of the economy, a positive money

supply reporting error operates exactly like a negative disturbance to the

actual money supply.               Firms expect an increase in demand, raise their

relative prices, and expect to increase production                          and decumulate
inventories.        when actual demand is realized, it is lower than expected,

and firms must cut back on production and increase inventories.                       iecause

the positive z is misinterpreted as a positive increase i.n the actual

:noney supply, the effect of z on the exchange rate is ambiguous without

 overshooting with               respect.   to   a v disturbance, A       < 0 since

        The effects of             the   disturbances on the nominal price of the domestic

 good are also generally indeterminate in algebraic sign which is why we

 have not discussea the effects of the shocks on this endogenous variable.

        The next section discusses the consistency of'                        the    model with this

various stylized facts mentioned in the introduction of this paper.



V. Consistency with Empirical Regularities

       Several empirical regularities were mentioned in the introduction,

and this section discusses the consistency of the implications of our
model with       these    regularities.

       The first regularity addressed is that nominal monetary disturbances

must have persistent real effects.                       This is true in our model since
                                                                                                   v
affects        all   real variables and because the                       explicit modeling of
inventories induces persistent dynamics.                        A potential criticism of the
rnode..i. is   that the real effects of'               money are caused only by unperceived
money.

       Two empirical papers, one by Barro and Hercowitz (19d0), hereafter

referrea       to as B—H, ano one by Boschen and Grossman (19b3) , hereafter                     3—G,

address this issue. It is important to discuss the relationship between
the present structure of our model and the regressions used to test
hypotheses in b—H and b—G because the results of these                              studies provide
                                             34




some evidence against the hypothesis that unperceived money is the primary

channel through which nominal money affects real variables.

     For clarity of presentation, the stochastic processes v,               and

were specified as being jointly orthogonal as well as being independently

and identically distributed.           It turns out that the predictions of our

mocel in the jointly orthogonal case are inconsistent with the evidence

presented in B—G and B—h.           In each case, though, significant covariance

between v and z in one case and                   and w in the other is enough to

overturn the apparent inconsistencies between the model and the data.

     The two empirical propositions of B—G and B—H are the following: (i)

the measurement error between actual money and reported money should have

a sinjficant effect on real output, and (ii) reported money, since it is

fully perceived, should have no real effort.               The first hypothesis is

tested and   rejected   in B—H with U.S. annual average data from 1950-.75 and

in B—u with U. S. quarterly average data i'or 1953—78 while the second

hypothesis is rejected in B—G.

     The hypotheses are most easily discussed in terms of the reduced form

for output which may be written as



                      + Y2 —                          + 2(v÷z)J + ir13w       (23)




where Y2           13) < 0.         Define             —          where     is the

innovation in Y.        The first    empirical    proposition is that zt the noise

in the news about the money supply, should have a significant coefficient

in orctinary least squares regressions (OLS) of Y On Z. Consider the
estimation   of   equation (24)
                                                   35



             zzt +                                                                     (24)

                                              1%

 by   OLS. The estimated parameter,           B,

             E(zt ( zt it
                    z +v )J                  E(zwit)
                         2              B+         2                                   (25)
                    E(zt)                    E(z)
If z and             are uncorrelated,             is an unbiased estimate of the true
influence of z on                     In the present form of our model the population
parameter    Y2 =      2 < 0, and        =
                                           Y2 Y3wi + 2)vt +             —


         —
         Y3  3w1 + r3Jw Which is orthogonal to Zt making OLS
appropriate. Since 8—0 and 8—li estimate     to be insignificantly
different from zero, this specificatjon of our model is suspect. Relaxing
the restriction that v, w, and z are mutually orthogonal, though,
implies that the OLS estimates 3 given in (25) is not an unbiased
estimate. A sufficient condition to bias the coefficient toward zero is a
negative covariance between v and z. In a more complicated framework
with a complete covariance matrix, presumably other combinations of
                                                        -S
covarlances wou1 bias the OLS estimate                       toward zero as well.
       Now consider the second empirical hypothesis of B—U.                         In OLS
regressions of output on perceived money, the OLS estimate should be zero,
but it is estimated to be significantly different from zero by 9—0. This
is inconsistent with the present version of the model because OLS
regression of      on
                            m1 woula produce a zero coefficient if the
                                  —



covariances between v and    with w are zero. Notice from (23) that

frcin the definitions of                               and w2             Intuitively, m —     m1         v +       is
uncorrejated witn w, hence it provides no information about EtWt and

consequently cannot affect anything real in the model.                                                 Clearly, this
would not be the case if the covariance of                                        with z,, or v was nonzero in

which case the money number would provide direct evidence about the shock

to areate demand for the home good.16

     The second empirical regularity that was mentioned in the
introduction was that the exchange rate and the relative price of the

export ood of the country were negatively correlated.                                                           Thus,
depreciations of the currency and deteriorations of the term of trade tend

to coincide.             Let C1(A;B)                            Ei(At —           EiAt(st      —
                                                                                                   E1E)       be the

conditional covariance of two random variables At and 3 conditional on

full information about variables dated t—1 and earlier.                                            Then the   formal
requirement on the model is that C1(R;s) < 0.                                                  This condition is
satisfied        for our model since



                                                  +                      +           < 0                         (2)

    The third empirical regularity discussed in the introduction requires
exchange rates to be more volatile than domestic price indexes where by
volatility is meant one—step—ahead predictability. Let V1(At)
                                                                                  Ei(At

implies that

In    (jo) each term mu.i.tiplying the terms in square brackets is negative.

Hence, if each term in square brackets is positive, the condition is
satisfied.        A sufficient condition for each of the terms in square
brackets to be positive is that L2/(1+)J > 1.                   This is only a sufficient

condition and is not necessary.                  The point is that the model allows
coinestic prices of domestic goods to be determined within the                 period   as

opposec to assuming them to be predetermined variables, yet it                   remains
consistent with the empirical regularity for at least some values of free

parameters of the     model.

VI. A Positive Aspect of Exchange—Rate Regime Choice

        In this section we investigate the predictions of    our    model regarding

the extent to wnich unsterilized intervention in the foreign exchange

market influences the conditional variance of output,              The conditional

variance measure is




        Vt(Yt) Ett —       E(Y)]2                                                (31)



which captures the variability of output relative to the level planned by

firms at the beginning of the     period.17
        Implicitly, the analysis so far has been based on the assumption of

freeiy floating exchange rates.         Discussion of unsterilized intervention

requires that we introduce high—powered money created by purchases of

domestic credit or international reserves and recognize that monetary

transactions balances are a multiple of high—powered money.            As a linear

approximation, let



                  +
                      (1-)b +       0 < w < 1,                                   (32)



where       is the natural logarithm of domestic credit, bt is the natural

logarithm of the book value of international reserves and              mint 15    the
logarithm of the money multiplier.             We assume that the    logarithms     of

Oomestic crecit and the money multiplier follow random walks:          dt    dti +
    where        is independently and identically distributed, and mm
+
    c    tiere         is independently and identically distributed.          Under

flexible exchange rates, international reserves are constant, b =
wnile   unsterilized intervention is captured by the following policy       rule:
                                              39




         bt                                                                          (33)



 When    ri   =0   as was assumed        in preceding section of the paper, the
 innovation in monetary transactions balances is Vt =                     +
                                                                v1.             Ct. When
 r is finite and nonzero, the innovation in transaction balances can be
 written as         Vl —                — ESt).
        The first point to notice is that the choice of any finite Ti does not

 affect the conditional distribution of output.                In this case the new
 intormatjon in the asset markets
                                            regarding the underlying disturbances
 remains g v1 —             3w•     Output volatility in this case is


                   2 2 22
        Vt(Y)      Y3       v1°wz''                                                 (3Lj.)




where A                 +              + afl and           represents the variance of

vit.

        The only choice f that does influence the conditional distribution

of output is Ti         .      In   this case the exchange rate is      fixed   at some
constant level , which is not expected to change.
                                                                  This choice of the
monetary authority may affect the information available to firms              regarding
the underlying     disturbances     driving the economy.

        when the exchange rate is fixed, the supply of money is entirely
eznanu ceterminea.          If the change in the supply of domestic credit plus

the change in the money multiplier produces an incipient amount of nominal

money differert than that demanded by individuals, international reserves

must aejust to bring the actual nominal amount of money supplied into
equality with the nominal amount of money demanded. Consequently,. the
nominal supply can be written as
                                                       40



                                     +
                            2((lRt        K2EtYt) +
              =         +
                   Pt


Knowing that the money and capital markets are in equilibrium now provides

no new information regarding the underlying disturbances.                               Nevertheless,

agents obtain               information        about the disturbances     from the money nuzner
which now conveys

                                z
which is an exact linear combination of the information received under
flexible exchange rates or with                   finite   intervention since

        Output volatility under a fixed exchange rate                    regime   is

                                          o)/PI(Yt),                                              (38)


and the term in square brackets in (38)                             is   a   positive fraction.

Intuitively, the volatility of output under either regime is                              produced   by

the inability ot' firms                   to    forecast demand precisely.             Under flexible

exchange rates, firms receive two sources of information about the
underlying cisturbances while under fixed exchange rates, they receive a

linear comoination of the two information sources which is a                                  smaller

information             set.    Since the forecast of demand, Etw,                is calculated      to

ninimize          the forecast       error variance, forecast errors must be             laNer   under
                                                   41




 fixea exchange rates in which the forecasts are made with a strictly

 smaJ.ler information set.              These larger forecast errors increase the
 volatility of

         This result depends critically
                                                   on our assumption about the rate of'
 release     of money supply information. If high—powered money information is

 available at the beginning of the
                                               period, then high—powered money does not
 influence aggregate output regardless of exchange rate regime choice.

 Furthermore, if        under fixed rates, the monetary authority releases              the
 extent of current intervention, bt —
                                                   bti,     at the beginning of the period,
then bt will be in agents' information sets and the asset markets will

convey the information variable                     as under floating rates.       Complete
information that is made available at the beginning of the period on the

quantity of intervention under fixed rates is equivalent to the

information carried by the exchange rate under floating rates, and if such

information is         revealed,     the stochastic distribution of output will be

invariant to exchange—rate regime choice.

        An apparently important restrictive aspect of our model is that our
demand disturbance, w, is uncorrejated with any foreign variable.
                                                                                      Less
restrictive would be an assumption that the disturbance to demand for
domestic gocas consists of two components, Wt as in our set up, plus w, a

foreign—basea disturbance.            The complete demand disturbance would then be
    -
        w.    The w portion of the disturbance would be correlated with other

foreign variables known to uomestic agents. In particular we would expect
1* ana        to be correlated with w, and we would drop the assumptions that

i   aria       are    constant.      In this   circumstance adopti.ng a fixed exchange
rate    or a floating one will be       irrelevant        to agents' inferences concerning

.          However,   i i     aria        remain        uncorrelated with w, fixing the
                                           42



exchange rate, without revealing intervention, still removes an
information source relevant to inferring that disturbance.         Consequently,
the prediction errors of w +          w   will be larger under fixed rates than

with any finite degree of intervention, and output variance also will be

larger under fixed than under floating rates.

        The result that setting s at a constant        results is higher output

variance than that available under floating rates when intervention is not

announced immediately is not standard and seem to us to be at odds with

traditional sticky price models of the open economy.          In the traditional

moael, the domestic currency price of domestic output is predetermined
with     respect   to current shocks.      Thus, when these shocks disturb the

exchange rate, they alter the relative price of domestic output, which

thereby affects the quantity of domestic output demanded. With domestic-

output demand determined, a current shock therefore alters domestic

procuction.        Our model does not presume that the domestic price is

predetermined.        Price setting agents see the exchange rate and the nominal
interest rate      arid set their relative prices using the information from the

asset    market.      This is the crucial difference between our model and
previous    models.     Our agents use the information content of the exchange
rate in setting prices and when that information is removed, as when the
exchange rate is fixed, output becomes more variable. In the tracitional
model,    prices   are set without the use of exchange rate information so
movements at' the exchange rate contribute to relative price and demand
variability rather than conveying information concerning demand
cisturbances.
       The decisiveness of our result concerning vY) ,  intervention is
                                                           when

not revealed, is due largely to our assumption that the country being
                                         L3



 studied is small in world capital markets.             If this assumption were
 relaxec, tien        Would be correlated with
                                                      Wt and i would convey
 information concerning w even with fixed exchange rates.
                                                                     Consequently,
 it would no longer be true under fixed rates that forecasts of

 necessarily have a larger variance than under flexible rates.            Since we
 have not yet modeled the correlation of i and w, we do not know the

 results for output in such a case.



VII. Concluding Remarks

       Our macel was constructed to be consistent with the major empirical

reularitjes discovered in studies of business cycles and those discovered

in Studies of prices and
                           exchange rates. Unexpected monetary disturbances
are not neutral in our model because price setting agents do not observe

money directly. They see only indicators of the underlying disturbances,

and they tena to confuse positive (negative) monetary shocks with negative

(positive)   demand shocks. 3usiness cycles are      propagated through time via
optimal   inventory adjustment.
      Prices in our model are set at the beginning of      the   period, prior to
the   revelation of actual values of the underlying disturbances.       Thus, our

prices are sticky in the sense that they do not respond as quickly to

monetary disturbances as they would if pricing were based on full
information. Our model is consistent with the observations that exchange

rates are more difficult to predict than are commodity prices and that

countries' exchange rates and terms of   trade are   negatively correlated.
      In presentin our results we worked with unrealistically simple time

series processes governing   the supply of money and the level of real
expenciture.   These processes were   chosen   for clarity of presentation and
                                          4L



none of the results we have emphasized concerning the effects of

unperceived monetary disturbances on output depend on our choice of

processes.   These effects stein   only   from innovations to the money supply

arid to money demand.   Consequently, these results will be robust to any
stationary time series processes for the money supply.            What will change

witn change in the time series process for the money supply are the time

series properties of nominal prices.

     We recognize that much work remains to be done on our framework.           In

particular, the linkages between firm          level   outcomes and the levels of

aggregate domestic expenditure and aggregate money demand need to be
incorporated into the maximizing framework.            However, we conjecture that

the crucial analytic feature of our model in this area, which is the

correlation between the scale variable in money demand and the scale

variable in goods demand, will appear in a wide variety of sensible

specifications.

1.       barro (1981) and Lucas (1975) summarize the business cycle empirical
regui.atities, while Mussa (1979)                and Flood (1981) have discussed
regujarjtj      for prices and exchange rates.

2.       The information content of asset prices has been emphasized
                                                                     by Barro
(1O), King (1982), and (irossman and Weiss (1982) in the context of

business cycle models and by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) and many others

in the context of microecorlomic financial markets.

3.    That only unexpected changes in money result in real output effect is
a controversial       aspect of   our   model.    Some non—supportive results are
presented by     Makin   (1982)   and   Mishkjn (19b2). The work of Barro (1977,
19(8), arro and Rush (1980), Leiderman (1980), and Wogin (1980),                is
supportive of the proposition.               In our model unexpected money is
unperceived.       The empirical support for          such disturbances has been
challeneu by Tboschen ano rossman (13) and by arro and Hercovitz
           an we ciscuss their results        in Section V in   the context of our
cue.L.

4.   In contrast, the dynamics in the Dornbusch.-type model are

rationalized in terms of slow and 'costly price adjustments.

5.   Price surprises typically enter aggregate supply either through the

information confusion channel of Lucas (1973) or through the incomplete

wage indexing channel of Qray (1976) and Fischer (1977). The Gray—Fischer

framework has been particularly amenable to open economy analysis such as

that of Flood and Marion (1982).           Marston (1982) surveys recent open

economy models that generate aggregate supply curves containing price

surprise terms generated via wage indexation.
6
     This seems to be a popular method for introducing monetary induced
business cycles into models. The wage indexing models of Gray (1976) and

Fischer (1977) follow this pattern. An alternative method for introducing

monetary influences into business cycles is that of Lucas (1973) where

decisions are not importantly sequential but important information
channels are assumed   not   to exist.     8oth approaches assume some curcial

transactions costs prohibit otherwise profitable transactions, and thus

both are somewhat unsatisfactory.

     It is notable that not all business cycle models depend on price

surprise terms.     In particular, the simple Keynesian model, popular in

undergraduate texts, postulates demand—determined output with all prices

known to agents.    Further, Urossman and Weiss (182) and McCallum (1982)

present moaels designed to avoid price surprise terms in aggregate supply.

7.   i'cr now we make foreign demand non—stochastic. In section VI we will

oiscuss stochastic foreign demand.

.    We    adopt the functional form           for concreteness.   An arbitrary
function     4(k) with 3(k)/3k > 0 and trn8,(k)           ,   would have served

equally well. None of our macro results would be altered if we set            0

  and maxijuizea the objective with respect to , as
                                                    in Blinder (1982).          We
 include 84 > 0 to allow some price
                                         and inventory dispersion at the macro
 level.       Allowing idiosyncratic shocks to the firm demands would add

 additional micro dispersion without
                                        changing the macroeconomic paradigm.
 9.      Our specification abstracts from       possibly   important aspects of a
 tiwe—varying     discount rate.
 10. In a set up much like ours, Eichenbaum (1983) has shown the
 observational equivalence (i.e., equivalence of decision rules at the
 incustry level) of an unknown number, n, of firms acting as (i) perfect
 competitors,      (ii)   an n—plant monopolist, and (iii) Nash competitors.
 Consequently,      we expect the qualitative properties of the aggregate
 decision rules we derive to be robust to a wide variety of firm—level

 specifications.

 11.    We view equation (12) as a useful
                                               simplifying assumption that allows
us to focus directly on production, exchange rates and prices without

complicating the theory with a model of a time—varying risk premium. The
evidence      in Hansen and hodrick (1983)         suggests that statistically
significant risk premia may characterize
                                                the relationship between forward
exchange rates and the expected future spot rates.                However, their
evidence also suggests that if risk premia exist, they are small in

comparison to unexpected changes in exchange rates.

1. The assumption that the three
                                       disturbances are mutually orthogonal is
taade strictly for clarity of presentation.         The implications of relaxing
the
       assumption are investigated in Section V.
1.     If   the   underlying disturbances were normally distributed, maximun

l.kelihood estimates of tne disturbances would be obtained by
                                                            linear least
squares projections of the disturbances onto the information set. while
                                                   48




it is plausible to assume that
                                           v     and z are normally distributed, such an

assumption about w =             p2u   Would be absurd because           is a disturbance to
                                                                   Ut
the    level of        real expenditure.       A normal   distribution    for u,   would imply

that       we sometimes would observe negative aggregate expenditure.                     See
sargent (1979) for a discussion of such projections.
14. Canzoneri, Henderson and Rogoff (1982) discuss the information
extraction         method we use.        The method tractably separates information

extraction front dynamics and is equivalent to extracting information

directly from          exchange rates or interest rates.
1.      In discussing the dynamics of the economy it is important to remember

that each period new stochastic shocks will buffet the economy.                        Hence,

the discussion of the path following a shock is only a discussion of the

conditional path given that the new disturbances have expected value of

zero.

lã. Consider, for instance, the case in which Wt and                      z   are correlated

and    v    and z. are correlated. In this case Y4.. =          ,(rn — tnt1) +          where

w2 are the new OLS regression coefficients in the linear prediction of w
using          and               An OLS regression of           On tn t% produces the

17.     Another popular measure of output variance is v(Y.)                    E(Y —    Y)2
wnerei is the full information Value of output. To find Y replace Et,wt
with w Ln (15c) resulting in the expression i         + ry1Nti +

1. Kimbrough (192) derives a similar result on the volatility of output

across exchange rate regimes for the same type of reason.

 Following argerit (1979) ,            the appropriate transversality condition is

 found by examinirig the finite
                                             horizon problem, differentiating with
 respect to the final inventory stock, NT, and taking the limit as T goes

 to infinity. The tranzversality condition is



       in
            E[—1Y             2t+T + NT        —
                                                   NTl)T = a.                                     (A5)


In a finite horizon world1 the firm
                                               would be tempted to meet entire final
period demand out of its negative inventory stock since it would accept

payment today but never deliver the goods and never incur any inventory

carrying cost. This tendency remains in the infinite horizon problem, but

the transversality condition prevents inventories from growing faster than

the rate 1/a.

     The aggregate Euler equations in the text, (5a,b)                                  are found by
                                                       ,


summing (A4a,b) across the k firm in the economy using the definitions of

    N, ana R.
     A solution to the two Euler
                                           equations requires several steps. First,
solve (Sa)        for E            and substitute this into (Sb)
                        t t+i                                                           The resulting
equation    is a second order difference equation in EtNt+. The solution to

the equation is readily obtained by the method of undetermined
                                              52




coefficients.        Conjecture that the      solution    will have the form of (Tb).

substitute this into the equation to eliminate terms in EtNt and

The resulting coefficients can then be equated and solved for the ii

coefficients.       There are two possible values for N1' one less than 1 and

one greater than 1/a.             We choose the stable value since otherwise

aggregate inventories would grow at a rate greater than 1/a.                      The

transversality condition derived above prevents each firm from following

an inventoryaccumulation path that grows faster than 1/a, hence the
choice of the stable root is the only choice consistent with the
optimizing strategies of' the firms.
     Rather than treating        and                as   thechoice variables in (Al),
we couJ.d have chosen         t+i and   t+i
                                              as   the choice variables in which case
the   same   firm   behavior would have been indicated, but it would have been

clearer that finns choose their relative price to pick an expected level

of sales which      equates   expected marginal revenue to expected marginal cost

of procuction even though sales and production are not equal. The second

first—order condition requires equality between the marginal cost of

production today plus the expected marginal inventory holaing costs and

the discounted expected marginal cost of producing in the future.
