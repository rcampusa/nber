                                              ABSTRACT

The U.S. had 14% fewer exchange-listed firms in 2012 than in 1975. Relative to other countries, the
U.S. now has abnormally few listed firms given its level of development and the quality of its institutions.
We call this the “U.S. listing gap” and investigate possible explanations for it. We rule out industry
changes, changes in listing requirements, and the reforms of the early 2000s as explanations for the
gap. We show that the probability that a firm is listed has fallen since the listing peak in 1996 for all
firm size categories though more so for smaller firms. From 1997 to the end of our sample period in
2012, the new list rate is low and the delist rate is high compared to U.S. history and to other countries.
High delists account for roughly 46% of the listing gap and low new lists for 54%. The high delist
rate is explained by an unusually high rate of acquisitions of publicly-listed firms compared to previous
U.S. history and to other countries.

1. Introduction.

    In a famous article, Jensen (1989) wrote that “the publicly held corporation has outlived its usefulness

in many sectors of the economy.” He went on to predict the eclipse of the public corporation.1 His view

was that the conflict between owners and managers can make public corporations an inefficient form of

organization. He argued that new private organizational forms promoted by private equity firms reduce

this conflict and are more efficient for firms in which agency problems are severe. The evolution of

listings in the U.S. is consistent with the view that public corporations are now less important. While the

number of U.S. listed firms peaked in 1996, that number is now 39% lower than when Jensen wrote his

article. However, this evolution is specific to the U.S. as listings in the rest of the world increased sharply

over the same period. As a result, the U.S. has developed a “listing gap.” In this paper, we demonstrate

the existence of the listing gap and examine potential explanations for it.

    Jensen’s view stands in sharp contrast to the literature on financial development. This literature views

the size of the stock market as a measure of financial development and provides evidence that greater

development leads to greater economic growth (see La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny,

1997, hereafter LLSV, and Levine, 1997). Since 1996, U.S. listings per capita have fallen. By this

measure the U.S. is less financially developed now than it was in 1996, or even in 1975. In 1996, the U.S.

had 30 listings per million inhabitants; by 2012, it had only 13, a 50% decline. Thus, evidence that the

U.S. has a listing gap and has fewer listed firms now than anytime during the last 40 years is a source of

concern as it implies lower potential economic growth. However, it may not be a concern if, as suggested

by Jensen, the U.S. has evolved so that public corporations are replaced with more efficient organizational

forms that lead to higher growth. Understanding why the U.S. now has a listing gap and has so many

fewer listed firms is critical to uncovering whether such a deficit should be a source of concern or is just a

natural evolution as the economy moves towards more efficient forms of corporate organization.

    Many studies focus on legal institutions as an important factor that affects stock market development

(see LLSV, 1997, and Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 2008, hereafter DLLS).

Countries with stronger investor protections have better developed stock markets. We show that the U.S.

has a listing gap relative to other countries with similar investor protection, economic growth, and overall

wealth. The listing gap arises in the late 1990s and widens over time. It is statistically significant,

economically large, and robust to different measurements. We also find that the U.S. has a listing gap

when compared to its own recent history and after controlling for changing capital market conditions.

     The number of U.S. listings fell from 8,025 in 1996 to 4,101 in 2012, whereas non-U.S. listings

increased from 30,734 to 39,427.2 To understand the U.S. listing gap, we focus our investigation on why

the U.S. now has so few listed firms. We consider two types of explanations: composition-related and

flow-related. Composition-related explanations make predictions about the evolution of the composition

of the population of listed firms. We examine whether it has changed as predicted. To study flow-related

explanations, we examine the evolution of net listing flows. The net listing flow is the difference between

new lists and delists.3 For listing counts to fall, net flows have to be negative. We investigate why net

flows became negative after the listing peak in 1996 and why they stayed negative from 1997 to 2012.

We refer to this as the post-peak period in contrast to the pre-peak period before 1996.

     We investigate four potential composition-related explanations. The first is that the decline in listings

can be explained by a decrease in the total number of firms (public and private) and/or by a decrease in

firm creation (startups), so that there are fewer firms eligible to be listed. If the number of listed firms is a

constant percentage of the total number of firms, listings decrease if the total number of firms falls.

However, we find that the total number of firms increased. We also find that the percentage of the total

number of firms that list is relatively constant during the pre-peak period but decreases sharply thereafter.

Similarly, the decline in startups (Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda, 2014) cannot explain the

low number of listed firms. We find that the relation between new lists and startups experienced a

structural break after 1996. Had the relation between new lists and startups stayed the same after 1996,

the U.S. would have had 9,000 more new lists in the post-peak period than it actually had. Thus, the

  The decline in U.S. listings has been noted by others, including “Wall Street’s Dead End”, The New York Times (February 13,
2011), “Missing: Public Companies – Why is the Number of Publicly Traded Companies in the US Declining?” CFO Magazine
(March 22, 2011), “The Endangered Public Company: The Big Engine that Couldn’t”, The Economist (May 19, 2012), and “The
State of the Public Corporation: Not So Much an Eclipse as an Evolution”, Journal of Applied Corporate Finance (Fall 2014).

  We use “new listings” and its shorter form “new lists” interchangeably. Similarly, we refer to both “delistings” and “delists” as
departures of publicly listed companies from stock exchanges.


                                                                2
decrease in listings in the post-peak period appears to be due to a lower propensity of firms to be listed

rather than a decrease in the number of firms available to be listed.

    We next investigate whether the drop in listings can be attributed to a changing composition of firms

by industry group. If the decrease is due to an industry reallocation, we would expect some industries to

have an increase in listings and others, a decrease. We reject this explanation. In fact, listings decreased in

all but one of the 49 (Fama and French, 1997) industries after 1996.

    The third composition-related explanation is that U.S. public markets became unattractive to smaller

firms, as suggested by some studies (e.g., Weild and Kim, 2009; Gao, Ritter, and Zhu, 2013). We find

that there were many fewer firms listed in 2012 that were comparable in size to the smallest firms listed in

1996. In general, listed firms became larger, so that the entire size distribution for listed firms shifted to

the right. While these results seem at first supportive of the hypothesis that listing became less attractive

for smaller firms, our tests show that listing became less attractive for firms of all sizes. Therefore, the

listing gap cannot simply be due to the fact that small firms in particular are no longer choosing to be

listed and/or are delisting from the exchanges.

    To understand whether the increase in size for listed firms is unique or whether all firms in the

economy evolved similarly, we use data from the Longitudinal Database of the U.S. Census Bureau, the

only comprehensive data source for the size of firms in the U.S. economy. The Census Bureau classifies

firms into size groups based on number of employees. After 1996, the number of listed firms fell in all

employee size groups, though by a relatively smaller pace among the largest firms since the increase in

firm size implies that firms moved into the largest employment size group. In contrast, the total number of

firms in the economy increased for all size groups, so that the evolution of listed firms diverged from the

evolution of firms in the economy. As a result, the percentage of all firms that are publicly listed

decreased for all size groups, but admittedly at a slower pace for the largest firms.

    It is often argued that the regulatory and legal changes in the early 2000s, including Regulation Fair

Disclosure (“Reg FD”) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”), made it more expensive for small firms to

be listed relative to large firms so that these changes led to a drop in the number of listed firms, especially

for small firms. The fact that the decrease in listed firms was well on its way before these changes took



                                                      3
place implies that they alone cannot explain the listing gap. Similarly, it implausible that the explanation

for the drop in listed firms is that small firms have become less competitive. We find that the total number

of firms in the smallest size groups (100 to 499 employees) increased in the overall economy.

    Lastly, listing standards could have changed in a way that made it harder for firms to list and, more

importantly, to remain listed. NASDAQ’s listing standards changed in 1996, just before the number of

listings in the U.S. started to fall. A natural concern is that the two events are related. However, the

impact of the change was mixed. The new standards increased asset size requirements for listed firms but

also allowed firms to go public that would not have been able to do so under the previous standard.

Moreover, the time series pattern of the number of listings on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),

where listing standards were unchanged, is the same as that on NASDAQ.

    We next analyze a series of explanations related to the determinants of the net flow of listings. To

better understand why the U.S. has so few listed firms, we investigate the relative contribution of new

lists and of delists to the overall decrease in listing counts. Each year from 1997 through 2012 the net new

list rate, the change in the number of listings relative to the count of total listings the prior year, is

negative. A negative net new list rate can result from a low new list rate, a high delist rate, or both.

Historically, the delist rate was lower than the new list rate in the U.S. After 1996, we find that the new

list rate was low and the delist rate was high by historical standards. We also find that the U.S. new list

rate was low and the delist rate was high compared to other countries over that same period.

    Deviations from historical averages of both the U.S. new list rate and the delist rate are required to

explain the listing gap. We predict the number of listings the U.S. would have had each year from 1997 to

2012 if the average new list and delist rates from 1975 to 1996 applied to those years. When we replace

the actual listing counts with the predicted counts in our regressions, we find that the listing gap relative

to other countries disappears. However, if we use the historical new list rate and the actual delist rate to

predict post-peak period counts, the listing gap decreases but does not disappear. The same is true if we

use the historical delist rate and the actual new list rate. Our estimates imply that missing new lists

explain about 54% of the listing gap and the abnormally large number of delists explains about 46%. In

other words, the low number of U.S. listings from a global perspective is not just due to too few IPOs



                                                     4
alone (see Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2013, for evidence of a U.S. IPO gap relative to the rest of the

world). Rather, it is also due to too many delists.

    Firms can delist essentially for three reasons: they are acquired (hereafter “merger delists”), they are

forced to delist (“delists for cause”), or they choose to delist (“voluntary delists”). We show that changing

economic conditions do not explain the high delist rate after 1996, whatever form delists took. Fama and

French (2004) find that weaker firms, measured in terms of lower profitability and slower growth in

assets, increasingly went public over their sample period. As weaker firms go public, new list survival

rates should fall and delists should increase. We find that delists for cause are not higher among younger

firms after the listing peak. Further, firm characteristics cannot explain the increase in delists after the

peak, irrespective of the type of delists.

    Following the adoption of SOX in 2002, there was much concern that more firms would go private.

Though the number of firms that voluntarily delisted increased after SOX, the number of voluntary delists

is far too small to explain the high number of delists. What we do find is that the U.S. had an unusually

high number of merger delists after 1996. The number of mergers is high compared to both U.S. history

and to other countries. We test for and reject the notion that the increase in mergers is due to an increase

in the number of firms about to be delisted for cause that were acquired instead. From 1997 to 2012, the

U.S. had 8,327 delists, of which 4,957 were due to mergers. If the U.S. merger rate over that period had

been the same as the average from 1975 to 1996, the U.S. would have had 1,655 fewer delists. Had the

U.S. experienced this historical merger rate and had it retained the same number of delists for cause, the

U.S. would have gained back almost 45% of the listings it lost in the post-peak period.

    Our paper is related to the literature on new lists and delists in the U.S. For the decrease in new lists,

Gao, Ritter, and Zhu (2013) find little support for the regulatory-overreach hypothesis which posits that

the regulatory and legal changes in the early 2000s, including Reg FD and SOX, made it less

advantageous to be a public company. They advance an economies-of-scope hypothesis, which states that

“the advantages of selling out to a larger organization, which can speed a product to market and realize

economies of scope, have increased relative to the benefits of operating as an independent firm” (p.

1663). Weild and Kim (2009) argue that market conditions for new public firms became worse in the late



                                                      5
1990s and early 2000s as small firms received less support and attention. Increased concentration among

investment banks and lower bid-ask spreads made it less advantageous for investment banks to devote

resources to young public firms. We find that the percentage of listed firms fell for all size groups, which

suggests that the listing gap cannot be due to missing listings of small firms alone. Moreover, the U.S.

listing gap cannot be explained by the economies-of-scope hypothesis as this hypothesis is not specific to

the U.S. and should apply across the globe. It also predicts a similar evolution for listed firms and total

firms, yet we find a decline in listed firms and steady growth in the total number of firms.

    The existing literature on delists focuses on the role of listing standards, the implications of delisting,

and on firms that deregister their securities, which requires them to delist. This literature, as discussed by

Djama, Martinez, and Serve (2013), largely ignores mergers as a driver of delists. In our analysis, we find

that mergers play a critical role for the decrease in U.S. listings. Fama and French (2004) show that

increasingly weaker firms listed in the 1980s and 1990s and that these firms had higher delist rates. They

attribute the change in listing patterns to a decrease in the cost of capital. Their sample ends in 2001, so

that their analysis has little evidence on firms that went public after the U.S. listing peak in 1996. Klein

and Mohanram (2005) focus on NASDAQ listings and show that firms that went public under a market

capitalization standard introduced in 1996 were more likely to delist. Macey, O’Hara, and Pompilio

(2008) examine delists from 1995 to 2005 and, for a subset of firms that delisted from the NYSE in 2002,

they study the implications of delisting. The number of delists in their sample is much higher than ours

and, perhaps for this reason, they reach the conclusion that the proportion of involuntary delists is almost

50%. One important reason for the difference is that their study includes all delists as reported by the

stock exchanges, whereas our sample is limited to U.S. corporations that stop being listed after having

had their stock price reported on the Center for Research on Security Prices (CRSP) database. The

literature on firms going dark finds an increase in deregistrations following the adoption of SOX and that

the increase occurred among smaller, more poorly-performing firms. However, only a small number of

these firms were listed on a major exchange. Most traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets (Marosi

and Massoud, 2007, Leuz, Triantis, and Wang, 2008). Mehran and Peristani (2009) and Bharath and




                                                      6
Dittmar (2010) show that decreased stock liquidity and analyst following make it more likely that a firm

will go private.

    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we document that the U.S. in the post-peak period

has had a low number of listings compared to its past and compared to other developed countries. In

Section 3, we estimate cross-country regressions to show that there is a growing listing gap for the U.S.

Section 4 investigates the composition-related explanations for the listing gap and, in Section 5, we

pursue the flow-related explanations. In Section 6, we focus on the high delist rate of the U.S. after 1996.

The paper concludes in Section 7.



2. The phenomenon.

    In this section, we document the dramatic difference in the evolution in listings between the U.S. and

other countries around the world over the past two decades. We use data on the number of listed firms in

each country from two sources: the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database and the

World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) database. Each year, these databases collect information from

their member and affiliated exchanges on the number of domestically incorporated companies listed on

each country’s stock exchanges at the end of the year. They do not include investment companies, mutual

funds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), or other collective investment vehicles.4 The WDI data, by

contrast, is primarily sourced from Standard & Poor's Global Stock Market Factbooks and supplemental

S&P data. WDI data start in 1988 with information for 50 countries and for 111 countries by 2012. WFE

data starts in 1975 with information for 22 countries. The number of countries it covers increases to 90 by

1998 and then declines to 48 by 2012.

    To create a comprehensive dataset, we merge the WDI and WFE databases (the WDI/WFE dataset).

For the country-years that overlap, the listing counts are typically close. Over the period from 1988 to

2012, 69% of listing counts from these databases are within a 10% margin of error of each other and 81%

are within a 25% margin. For country-year observations in which the counts differ by 10% or more, we

4
 The official definition from the WFE website states: “A company is considered domestic when it is incorporated in the same
country as where the exchange is located. The only exception is the case of foreign companies which are exclusively listed on an
exchange, i.e. the foreign company is not listed on any other exchange as defined in the domestic market capitalization
definition.” September 2013 is the last update.


                                                               7
manually checked the data to resolve the differences. Many large discrepancies are explained by errors or

inconsistencies in one of the databases and around years when stock exchanges merged or amalgamated

listings (say, from regional exchanges into a single national exchange like Spain’s Bolsas y Mercados

Españoles in 2002). In addition, some large discrepancies are due to double or triple counting across

exchanges in the WFE data and when the WFE counts include OTC listings or listings on unregulated

markets (e.g., Frankfurt’s open, unregulated Freiverkehr market). We resolve the majority of these

discrepancies by searching on stock exchange websites for historical factbooks, annual reports, and other

listing-related information. For the U.S., the WFE data does not include NASDAQ listings until 1991. We

use CRSP to construct listing counts from 1975 through 1988 and use the WDI and WFE counts in

subsequent years.

    We start with the evolution of listings in the U.S. since 1975. Figure 1 (left axis) reports the number

of firms listed in the U.S. since 1975. The figure shows an inverted u-shaped time-series pattern. Table 1

also shows the number of listings for selected years. The number of listed firms in 1975 was 4,775. In

2012, the number was 4,102, the lowest count across the four decades and 14% lower than in 1975. The

peak number of listings was 8,025 in 1996. From 1975 to 1996 (the pre-peak period), the number of listed

firms increased steadily from 4,775 to 8,025, a cumulative increase of 68%. Since the peak in 1996,

listings fell each year from 1997 to 2012 (the post-peak period) and cumulatively declined by 3,923, or

49%, by 2012.

    We turn next to the number of listings in other countries. The dataset used to produce this count

includes 16 countries in 1975, increases to 56 by 1990, peaks at 116 in 2006, and declines to 111 in

2012.5 Throughout the paper, we restrict the sample to the 71 non-U.S. countries included in DLLS

(2008) that we can use in later regressions. These countries account for 96% of listed firms during our

sample period.

    Figure 1 (right axis) shows the number of listings in non-U.S. countries followed a sharply different

path than those in the U.S. Table 1 shows that in 1975, there were 12,361 listings outside the U.S. and

5
  To create the final dataset across countries, we use the following process. If the overlapping observations from the WDI and
WFE datasets are close, we use the dataset with the longest series. Where possible we also combine the datasets to create the
longest series possible. When there are large discrepancies, we resolve them and use the correct data. If we cannot resolve the
discrepancies or if there are large gaps in the data, we drop those observations.


                                                              8
91% of them were domiciled in developed countries (using the Morgan Stanley Capital International,

MSCI, country classification scheme as of 2014). The number of non-U.S. listings peaked in 2011 at

39,543 where it has remained. From 1975 to 2012, the number of non-U.S. listings increased by 219%

whereas the number of U.S. listings decreased by 14%. The increase in non-U.S. listings is due to an

increase in listings within countries as well as to the addition of new countries to the sample. Note,

however, that there are no changes in the number of developed countries since 1994 and few changes in

the number of emerging ones. Since the U.S. peak in 1996, the number of non-U.S. listings increased by

28% while the number of U.S. listings fell by 49%. As a result of this evolution, there was a sharp

increase in the number of non-U.S. listings relative to the number of U.S. listings. At the U.S. peak in

1996, the ratio of non-U.S. listings to U.S. listings was 3.8-to-1. It increased every year tripling to 9.6-to-

1 by 2012.

    The figure also shows the evolution of listing counts for MSCI-classified developed countries.

Because the number of developed countries with data on listing counts increased from 13 in 1975 to 23 in

2012 (see Table 1), we show total listing counts for all developed countries and for the 13 countries that

were classified as developed in 1975. For the constant sample of 13 countries, the number of listed firms

was 11,261 in 1975. This count was 11,624 in 1996, peaked in 2006 at 17,846 and stayed relatively

constant thereafter. In 2012, the count was 17,210 so that listings in these countries increased by 52%

over our sample period. The evolution is similar when we include all non-U.S. developed countries.

Therefore, the evolution of listings in other developed countries since 1996 is dramatically different from

that of the U.S. While U.S. listings dropped by about half since 1996, listings in other developed

countries increased by 48%. Another way to see that U.S. listings have declined is that the ratio of listings

in this sample of developed countries to U.S. listings was 2.4-to-1 in 1975. This ratio dropped until 1996,

when it was 1.4-to-1. After 1996, it took off sharply increasing almost every year (and never falling by

much) to reach 4.2-to-1 in 2012.

    Table 1 shows that in 1975, our data included only three emerging countries (we include MSCI

emerging and frontier countries as well as countries not classified by MSCI in this category). The number

of emerging countries in our sample increases to 43 by 1996 and changes little afterwards. The number of



                                                      9
listings in emerging countries increased from 1,100 in 1975 to 16,580 in 1996 and reaches 18,622 by

2012. While listings in the U.S. fell by half since 1996, listings in emerging countries increased by 12%.

The ratio of non-U.S. listings in emerging countries to U.S. listings in 1996 was 2.1-to-1 and it more than

doubled to 4.5-to-1 by 2012.

    We now turn to country-specific comparisons which are not sensitive to changes in the classification

of countries or to the inclusion of additional countries. Our first comparison is to assess how listings

evolved across the world since the U.S. reached its peak in 1996. For this comparison, we arbitrarily

require countries to have at least 50 listings in 1996 and identify 54 countries that meet this requirement.

Figure 2 shows the percentage change in listing counts from 1996 to 2012. During that period the number

of listings in the U.S. dropped by 49%; it increased in 32 countries and decreased in 22. Among the 22

countries with a decrease, only six had a greater percentage decrease than the U.S. (Venezuela, Egypt,

Colombia, Portugal, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic). Few other developed countries had a significant

decrease in listings.

    An obvious issue is that the number of listings differs across countries because countries differ in

economic size. All else equal, larger countries should have more listings. A frequently-used approach to

adjust for country size is to compute the number of listings per capita. Using general population data

available from WDI, we compute the number of listings per one million inhabitants, which we call

listings per capita. Table 1 shows listings per capita for the U.S. every five years, starting in 1975, but

shows the number for the last year of our sample period, 2012, instead of 2010. It also includes 1996, the

year U.S. listings peaked. With this measure, the evolution of the U.S. is even more dramatic because its

population increased while listings fell. In 1975, the U.S. had 22.1 listings per capita; this ratio peaked in

1996 reaching 29.8 and then fell to 13.1 in 2012. The number of listings per capita in 2012 was 59% of

what it was in 1975 and 44% of its peak value. The number of listings per capita fell by 56% during the

post-peak period.

    As shown in Table 1, listings per capita for all non-U.S. countries (computed as the total number of

listings divided by the total population) increased from 3.8 to 7.4 from 1975 through 2012. During that

period, the number of countries in the sample increased from 16 to 71. For non-U.S. developed countries,



                                                     10
the number of listings per capita was 21.5 in 1975 compared to 22.1 for the U.S. By 1996, the U.S. had

29.8 listings per capita while other developed countries were at 24.5 per capita. After the U.S. peak, the

number of listings per capita for developed countries reached 35 in 2006 (not shown) and held steady

before falling slightly to 33.5 in 2012. While U.S. listings per capita fell by 56% after 1996, those in other

developed countries increased by 37%. The listings per capita ratio among emerging countries declined,

but only by a small percentage between 1996 and 2012. Although the number of listings increased by

12%, population increased by 20% in these countries.



3. Measuring the U.S. listing gap.

    Much research in finance views the number of listings per capita as a measure of financial

development. In particular, LLSV (1997) use the number of listed firms per capita as a measure of a

country’s financial development and examine its determinants. In their data, the U.S. had 30.1 firms per

capita in 1994. They find that countries that legally protect investors better have higher financial

development. Using a country’s legal origin as an exogenous measure of investor protection, they show

that countries with laws of English origin have a much higher number of listings per capita than the

countries with laws of French origin. Specifically, the average number of listings per capita for countries

with laws of English origin was 35.5 (their Table II, for 1994). In contrast, it was 10.0 for countries of

French origin. They estimate regressions of listed firms per capita on various determinants which include

the log of GDP, GDP growth, a rule of law index, and an index of investor protection, the anti-director

rights index. They find that the index for the rule of law and the anti-director index have positive,

significant coefficients. They also show that French origin countries have fewer listed firms per capita.

DLLS (2008) use the average number of listed firms per million habitants for 1999-2003. After

controlling for the log of GDP per capita, they find that listings per capita are strongly related to the anti-

self-dealing index, a measure of the extent to which related-party transactions are limited in a country.

    Given these findings, we can predict how many listings per capita the U.S. should have had given its

institutions and economic development. Multiplying the fitted value for the U.S. from these regressions

by the actual population, we can then compare the predicted number of listings to the actual number of



                                                      11
listings to assess whether the U.S. has too few or too many listings given its institutions and economic

development. Following DLLS, we estimate a regression of the log of listings per capita on the anti-self-

dealing index and on the log of GDP per capita. In addition, DLLS use a variable which is the time that it

takes to collect on a bounced check. That variable is not significant in the relevant regression in their

paper and we ignore it. Model (1) of Table 2 estimates a cross-country regression for 1990. We start with

1990 as it is the first year for which we have at least 50 countries. We find that the anti-self-dealing index

has a positive significant coefficient and so does GDP per capita. The coefficient on the anti-self-dealing

index is very similar to the coefficient in DLLS. They report a coefficient of 1.08 compared to 1.416 in

our table. Models (2) and (3) re-estimate the regression for 1996 and 2012. The coefficients are similar to

those in Model (1). Though we do not report the results in the table, we also estimate these regressions

using a common law indicator variable instead of the anti-self-dealing index and find similar results.

    We next estimate regressions using a panel from 1990 through 2012, with standard errors clustered by

country. In these regressions, we include GDP growth as an additional variable to better capture changing

economic conditions as well as year fixed effects estimated relative to 1990 (not reported). In Model (4)

we again find significant coefficients for the anti-self-dealing index and GDP per capita while that for

GDP growth is not significant. The adjusted R2 is 48%. In Model (5) we add an indicator variable that

equals one for non-U.S. countries. The coefficient is positive and significant but adding that variable has

no impact on the other variables. Finally, in Model (6), we allow the indicator variable for non-U.S.

countries to interact with the year fixed effects. The coefficients on the year fixed effects capture the U.S.-

specific residuals. They allow us to assess how actual U.S. listings differ from the predicted listings for

the U.S. in each year given its characteristics. Again, we re-estimate the regression specification with the

common law indicator variable but do not report the results which are similar.

    In Figure 3, we extract from the coefficients on the year fixed effects in Model (6) the size of the

listing gap in terms of the number of missing listed firms. The U.S. residuals (measured relative to 1990)

are statistically insignificant until 1995, positive and significant in 1995 and 1996, insignificant for the

next two years, and then significantly negative and increasing in absolute value until 2012. In other

words, the U.S. has a listing gap from 1999 to 2012 and the gap becomes larger every year. By 2012, the



                                                      12
listing gap is 5,436 listings. Without this gap, the U.S. would have had 9,538 listings instead of 4,102.

Using a different approach in Section 6, we show that the U.S. also would have had a listing gap when

compared to its own recent history and even after controlling for changing for capital market conditions.



4. The listing gap and the changing composition of the population of U.S. firms.

    In this section, we evaluate explanations for the U.S. listing gap based on the changing composition

of the population of U.S. firms. We investigate four such explanations in turn. First, we study whether the

percentage of listed firms has fallen relative to all public and private firms in the U.S. and whether the

decrease in the rate of firm creation can explain the decrease in new lists. Second, we address the

possibility that the decrease in listings is explained by industry shifts. Third, we investigate whether U.S.

public markets became unattractive to small firms. Fourth, we study whether changes in exchange listing

standards have played an important role in the evolution of the number of listings in the U.S.

    4.1. Has the number of firms that can potentially become publicly-listed fallen?

    Only existing firms can choose to be listed. There is no publicly-available database in the U.S. that

provides characteristics of a comprehensive sample of unlisted firms over our sample period. The lack of

such a database limits the analysis that can be conducted as ideally we would estimate the probability that

an identical firm is listed in 1996 and in 2012. However, the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) of

the U.S. Census Bureau does provide information about the total number of firms (public and private

firms) in the U.S. from 1977 until 2012. With this database, we can examine whether the number of listed

firms fell because the total number of firms fell. That is, if the ratio of the number of listed firms to the

total number of firms is constant the number of listed firms would fall if the total number of firms falls.

    Table 3 shows in Columns (1) through (3) the total number of firms, the number of U.S. listed firms,

and the percentage of the total number of firms that are listed, respectively. The U.S. had 3,417,883 firms

in 1977. This number increased to 4,693,080 in 1996, the peak year for the number of listings. Since that

year, the number of firms increased further to reach 5,030,962 in 2012. Though the rate of increase in the

number of firms was higher from 1977 to 1996 than it was during the post-peak period, there is little




                                                     13
evidence that the number of firms fell in the post-peak period. In contrast, Column (2) shows that the

number of listed firms decreased each year during this period.

    The percentage of firms that are listed in Column (3) shows that changes in the total number of firms

cannot explain the drop in the number of listed firms. From 1977 to 1996, the percentage of listed firms

increased from 0.138% to 0.171%. Since the peak in 1996 it fell steadily to 0.082% in 2012, so that in

2012 it was 52% lower than what it was in 1996. From 1977 to 2012, the smallest percentage of listed

firms was in 2012. In other words, firms have never been less likely to be listed from 1977 to 2012 than in

2012. Had the percentage of listed firms to total firms been the same in 2012 as it was in 1996, the

number of listed firms would have been 8,602 rather than 4,102 so that there would have been 578 more

listed firms than at the peak in 1996.

    We now consider whether the drop in startups can help understand the drop in new lists and thus, the

drop in the number of listed firms. Similar to Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2014), we

define startups as firms with age equal to zero.6 Column (4) of Table 3 reports the number of startups.

Startups decreased from 1977 to 1983, increased until 1988, and then were stable until 2003. Startups

increased from 2004 to 2006, but fell sharply after 2006 and were lower during the last four years of the

sample than any other year. If the number of startups is steady while the total number of firms increases,

the startup rate falls, and that is what we see in Column (5). The average annual startup rate was 12.24%

from 1978 to 1996 compared to 9.74% in the post-peak period, a statistically significant decrease (the t-

statistic from a two-sample, unequal variance t-test equals 6.11). Though the startup rate from 2008 to

2012 is lower than any prior year, the average post-peak startup rate is only marginally higher at 10.43%

if we exclude these years. Based on these statistics it is plausible that the drop in startups could explain

part of the drop in new lists. However, the startup rate fell steadily throughout our sample period so that

the difference in averages between the pre-peak and post-peak periods just reflects a continuously falling

startup rate. This makes it implausible that changes in the startup rate could explain why listings peak in

1996 and fall steadily afterwards.


6
  Birth year for a firm is defined as the year an establishment first reports positive employment in the LBD. See a detailed
discussion of methodology at https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/methodology.html. Acknowledging that the LBD
series start in 1976, it must be that observed age is by construction left-censored as at 1975.


                                                            14
    In Table 4, we investigate the relation between startups and new lists. Unfortunately, WDI does not

provide information on new lists so we use data from the CRSP Monthly Stock File to identify the

number of U.S. listed domestic firms using the same criteria as the WDI and WFE datasets. Thus, in a

given year, we exclude: records that are not U.S. common stocks (Share Codes 10 and 11); stocks not

listed on the AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE (Exchange Codes 1, 2, and 3); and, investment funds and trusts

(SIC Codes 6722, 6726, 6798, and 6799). From this dataset, we identify new lists each year.7

    In the models estimated in Table 4, the dependent variable is the number of new lists divided by the

total number of firms in the prior year, multiplied by 100. The explanatory variable is the number of

startups divided by the total number of firms in the prior year (“Startup rate”).8 Model (1) shows results

with startups lagged by one year, estimated over 1979 to 2012. The coefficient on startups is 0.002 and it

is significant at the 1% level. The adjusted R2 of the regression is 26.71%. The average rate of new lists as

a percentage of all firms is 0.01% over our sample period. Using the estimated slope coefficient and the

number of total firms in 1996, the regression predicts that a decrease in startups of 1% corresponds to a

drop of 99 new lists in 1997. It follows that the slope coefficient in the regression together with the

decrease in the startup rate explains about a third of the drop in new lists in 1997. Model (2) includes two

additional lags of the startup rate to Model (1) in order to capture potential delays in the process of

converting startups into listed firms. The coefficient on the first lag does not change much and it remains

significant at the 10% level. The coefficient on the second lag is positive and that on the third is negative.

Both are significant at the 10% level.

    In Model (3) we allow the intercept and slope coefficient to shift with an indicator dummy variable

that equals one after 1996. The constant for 1979 to 1996 is positive and significant while the slope

coefficient is negative but not significant. In contrast, the constant for the post-peak period is negative and

significant, while the slope coefficient is positive and significant.



7
  Section 5.1 provides additional details on our approach for identifying new lists using CRSP.
8
  This reduced-form model, of course, ignores how fundamental economic factors may impact both the startup rate as well as the
new listing rate. Though we have only a small number of annual observations, we also estimated models that include lagged
market index returns, average first day IPO returns, and Tobin’s q and inferences are similar. Because our goal here is simply to
evaluate whether the joint dynamics in these two series have shifted over these three decades in a significant way we focus on the
simpler models that do not include these variables.


                                                               15
    When we use the coefficients for 1979 to 1996 from Model (3) to predict new lists over the post-peak

period using the actual startup rate in that period, we obtain 13,581 new lists between 1997 and 2012 in

contrast to the actual number of 4,535 new lists during that period. Hence, using the relation between

startups and new lists prevalent before 1997, the U.S. would have had over 9,000 more new lists than it

actually had, despite the fall in the startup rate. In fact, in this scenario, there would be no listing gap. It

follows from these results that the change in the startup rate cannot explain the drop in new lists.

    4.2. Is the listing gap due to industry shifts?

    We investigate next whether the drop in listings can be attributed to a changing composition of

industries. If that were the case, we would expect some industries to experience an increase in listings and

others a decrease. Such an industry reallocation could result in a decrease in the number of listed firms.

To examine this possibility, we consider the evolution of the number of listed firms across industries

since the peak of U.S. listings in 1996. For this analysis, we need to identify the industry of a listed firm

and this information is not provided in the WDI dataset. We use the CRSP dataset discussed earlier to

identify U.S. listed firms and their SIC codes. We then assign SIC codes to the Fama-French 49 industries

(Fama and French, 1997). In our dataset, 1,451 firm-years out of 211,259 have an SIC code but no Fama-

French industry classification. We ignore these firms.

    Figure 4 shows that, although the evolution of listings differs across industries, all but one

experienced a decrease in the number of listings since 1996. The Financial Trading and Electrical

Equipment industries had the most dramatic drops. In 1996, the Financial Trading industry had 693 firms.

By 2012, it had only 119, representing a drop of 83% in the number of listings. The Electrical Equipment

industry had the second largest drop. In 1996, this industry had 247 listed firms, and, in 2012, it had only

99. In percentage terms, this industry lost 79% of its listings. For industry reallocation to explain the drop

in listings, some industries should have had an increase in the number of listings. However, as Figure 4

shows, there is just one industry that did not experience a decrease in the number of listings: Non-Metallic

and Industrial Metal Mining retained its 25 listed firms in 1996 and in 2012.




                                                      16
    These results are inconsistent with an industry reallocation explanation for the decrease in the number

of listings. However, the wide range of percentage decreases across industries means that it is possible

that industry-specific factors help explain the extent of the overall decrease.

    4.3. Is the listing gap due to a shift in the distribution of firms by size?

    A number of potential explanations for the listing gap focus on firm size. For example, some

explanations for the drop in the number of IPOs in the U.S. advance the hypothesis that capital markets

have evolved in such a way that it has become harder for small firms to be listed. One explanation focuses

on the evolution of the market’s infrastructure; that is, lower bid-ask spreads imply lower profits which

makes it less advantageous for brokers and investment banks to provide market-making services or to

produce analyst reports for small firms. Other explanations suggest that the regulatory costs of being

public increased relatively more for small firms. Many of these arguments were put forward in the years

leading up to the passage of the Jumpstart our Business Startups (JOBS) Act in 2012 (e.g., Pinelli and

Muscat, 2007; Weild and Kim, 2010; Ernst and Young, 2009; the IPO Task Force Report to the U.S.

Treasury, 2011). Alternatively, Gao, Ritter, and Zhu (2013) advance the economies-of-scope hypothesis:

small firms have become less profitable and are better off selling out rather than operating as an

independent firm. As a result, we would expect small firms to be acquired and firms to become larger,

irrespective of whether they are private or publicly-listed. In other words, with the economies-of-scope

hypothesis, all firms should become larger, not just publicly-traded firms.

    Data for private firms is limited and we can measure firm size only by the number of employees.

Based on this measure, the LBD provided by the U.S. Census Bureau classifies firms into size groups. We

employ eight such groups.9 To get data on the number of employees for listed firms, we merge our dataset

of listed firms from CRSP with Compustat. We then compute the percentage of total firms (private and

public) in each size group that are listed. Panel A of Figure 5 shows these percentages for each size group

over our sample period. It is immediately clear from the figure that the percentage of listed firms falls for

all size groups throughout our sample period.

9
 The eight size groups are: (1) less than 100 employees (this group aggregates five groups reported separately by the LBD, 1 to
4, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, and 50 to 99); (2) between 100 and 249 employees; (3) between 250 and 499 employees; (4) between
500 and 999 employees; (5) between 1,000 and 2,499 employees; (6) between 2,500 and 4,999 employees; (7) between 5,000 and
9,999 employees; and, (8) over 10,000 employees.


                                                             17
    In 1996, 563 firms in Compustat had more than 10,000 employees, the largest LBD size group. In

contrast, there were 1,156 firms with less than 100 employees, the smallest LBD size group. In 2012,

there were more listed firms in the largest size group (542) than there were in the smallest size group

(409). For firms in the largest size group, the percentage of listed firms fell from 48.36% to 42.71%

during the post-peak period, a decrease of 11.7%. The decrease was much sharper for firms in smaller

size groups. For example, the percentage of listed firms fell by 60.03% for firms with 100 to 249

employees and by 53.61% for firms with 1,000 to 2,499 employees. Except for the largest size group,

there is no statistically significant difference across groups in the drop in the percentage of listed firms.

    While the number of listed firms fell for all size groups, the total number of firms increased for all

size groups. Moreover, the evolution of the number of listed firms and the total number of firms across

size groups is strikingly different. For the largest size group, the total number of firms increased by 9.02%

whereas the number of listed firms fell by 3.73%. In contrast, for firms in the 100 to 249 employee size

group, the total number of firms increased by 10.79% and the number of listed firms fell by 55.71%. For

total firms, the smallest and the largest size groups experienced the least growth while firms in the 500 to

999 employee size group had the highest growth. In contrast, among listed firms, the rate of decline is

highest for the smallest , but it is not significantly different from the other size groups except for the very

largest size group of firms with more than 10,000 employees.

    In summary, there was a strikingly different evolution for listed firms compared to total firms. The

results imply that it has become less advantageous for firms to be listed, but less so for the largest firms.

However, it has not become any less advantageous for smaller firms to operate if they are not listed.

Indeed, the number of such firms has increased. This diverging evolution - the decline in listed firms and

the growth in the total number of firms - is hard to square with the economies-of-scope hypothesis to the

extent it predicts a similar evolution across private and public firms.

    Given the attention paid to small firms, in Panel B of Figure 5 we show the number of listed firms

with 100 to 499 employees (“Small Size Category”) as a percentage of the number of listed firms. We

also form an equivalent Small Size Category for all firms (both public and private). To compute the

percentages, we do not include firms with less than 100 employees because the number of these firms



                                                      18
dwarfs that of all other firm size groups when we consider all firms. It is striking that the percentage of

firms in the Small Size Category among all firms is roughly constant over time. By contrast, the

percentage of only listed firms in the Small Size Category has an inverted U-shape; it increases steadily

from 1977 to 2000 and then falls so that by 2012 that percentage is the same as it was at the beginning of

the 1980s. The percentage of such firms among listed firms falls from 38% in 2000 to 27% in 2012. This

evolution does not appear to be taking place across the whole population of firms - note how the

equivalent lines in that same figure for the percentages of firms in the Large Size Category (firms with

5,000 or more employees) are virtually unchanged over the entire period.

    We turn next to the evolution of the size of listed firms. In this analysis, we use more traditional

measures of firm size reported in Compustat. We focus on total assets, measured in 1990 constant dollars,

though the results are similar for total revenue, market capitalization, and number of employees. Panel C

of Figure 5 shows the log of total assets for all Compustat firms at five size percentile thresholds (the four

quintiles plus the median) each year from 1975 to 2012. Listed firms became steadily larger since the

listing peak in 1996. However, the increase in size occurred across all size percentiles. In other words, the

entire size distribution for listed firms shifted to the right.

    As a result of increasing firm size, it follows that small firms in 2012 were much larger than small

firms in 1996. In 1996, the 20th percentile for total assets was $18.67 million (inflation-adjusted) and there

were 1,360 listed firms with data in that quintile. By 2012, there were only 267 listed firms (or 7.93% of

3,366 listed firms in Compustat) with less than $18.67 million in assets. Another way to see this is that

the 20th percentile was $18.67 million in 1996 compared to $68.50 million in 2012. If we use total

revenue, market capitalization, or number of employees, we find that in 2012, only 10.32%, 10.48%, and

13.33% of listed firms were smaller than the respective 20th percentile cutoffs in 1996.

    There is evidence that the smallest firms that were listed in 1996 were much less likely to be listed in

2012. Consequently, our results provide support to the theories that argue markets have become less

inviting for the smallest firms. The increase in the size of listed firms starts well before the regulatory

changes made at the beginning of the 2000s such as Reg FD in 2000 or the passage of SOX in 2002. It

follows that the regulatory changes cannot wholly explain the change in asset size even though they may



                                                        19
have contributed to it. Further, our evidence shows that the decrease in listings of the smallest firms can

explain only part of the listing gap. This is because the percentage of listed firms falls for all size groups

and the size of the percentage decline is statistically indistinguishable among the size groups except for

the largest size group.

    4.4. Is the listing gap due to changes in listing standards?

    A change in listing standards affects the population of firms that can be listed. Exchanges have

standards for new listings as well as maintenance standards for listed firms. Tougher standards do not

necessarily imply that fewer firms will be listed as tougher standards could make a listing more valuable.

However, if tougher standards imply fewer listings, they could explain their decline. Exchanges altered

listing standards following the passage of SOX in 2002 to include additional corporate governance

requirements (see, for instance, Aggarwal and Williamson, 2006). These changes were approved by the

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2003 and became fully effective in 2004. They

require firms to have: (a) a majority of independent directors on the board; (b) to have some board

committees be composed exclusively of independent directors; or, (c) to ensure that decisions by such

committees be made by a majority of independent directors. These changes took place after the decline in

listings was well under way. Specifically, 48% of the decrease in listings occurred before 2002.

    From 1996 to 2002, there was no toughening in the initial or maintenance listing standards. Listing

standards did change in 1996 for NASDAQ. However, the impact was mixed. NASDAQ increased the

asset size requirement, but at the same time, made it possible for firms that could not list before to now do

so. As discussed by Klein and Mohanram (2005), the changes in 1996 made it possible for firms to list

based on a market capitalization criterion alone. According to their analysis, most of the internet firms

that went public after 1996 listed under this new market-capitalization-based standard. The study shows

that these firms performed poorly and had a higher delisting rate for cause. If anything, changes in listing

standards were likely to have inflated the number of new lists in the late 1990s.

    We use CRSP data to examine (not reported) differences in the evolution of the number of listings on

the NYSE and on NASDAQ. There were 1,417 firms listed on the NYSE in 1975. The number of listings

decreased to 1,298 by 1988 and then increased sharply. The number of listings peaked in 1997 at 1,828



                                                     20
and then decreased steadily to 1,290 by 2012. Thus, the NYSE had fewer listings in 2012 than in 1975

and 29% fewer listings compared to 1997. Listings on NASDAQ followed a similar rise-and-fall pattern

but more dramatically: 2,566 listings in 1975, 5,105 at the peak in 1996, and a steady decrease to 2,095

by 2012. The number of listings on NASDAQ in 2012 was the lowest during the sample period and 58%

lower than in 1996. Like the NYSE, NASDAQ also had fewer listings in 2012 than in 1975.

     It follows from this analysis that the decrease in listings is not exchange-specific. Both the NYSE and

NASDAQ experienced an inverted U-shaped evolution in the number of listings. Exchange-specific

listing standards may have accelerated or slowed down this evolution but the change in NASDAQ’s

listing standards in 1996 cannot explain why listings started to fall in 1997.



5. The evolution of new lists and delists.

     Our next set of explanations for the U.S. listing gap is based on the flows of new lists and delists and

how they have evolved over time. The only way the number of listings can fall is if the number of delists

exceeds the number of new lists. In this section, we examine the evolution of new lists and delists for the

U.S. and then compare it to the evolution for other countries. This exercise presents new data challenges

as the WDI/WFE database does not disclose information on new lists and delists.

     5.1. New lists and delists in the U.S.

     To analyze new lists and delists for the U.S., we use the CRSP database again as discussed in Section

4.2. We count a new list as such in the year a record first enters the database and we count a delisting as

such in the year in which a record drops out of the database.10 Using these criteria each year from 1975

through 2012, we compute the number of U.S. listed firms as well as the number of new lists and delists.

     Panel A of Table 5 shows the number of new lists and delists from 1975 to 2012. It is immediately

clear that there is considerable time-series variation in these numbers. However, the patterns for more

10
   Information for a security can change over time in CRSP. For example, a record might initially have a share code or SIC code
that we exclude, e.g., SIC code 6722. We do not count these records as a new list or include them in the listing counts. If in a
subsequent year, CRSP assigns a different SIC code to a record that we do not exclude, we do not count it as a new list, but do
include it in the listing counts. To ensure that the listing counts and the annual flows add up (e.g., a list count in year t-1 plus new
lists in year t minus delists in year t equals the new list count in year t), we keep track of these “false new lists.” Similarly, we
keep track of “false delists,” which could arise if a security is initially included in the list counts, but CRSP later changes its SIC
code to one that we exclude. We drop it but do not count it as a delisting. Finally, stocks switching exchanges are not counted as
new lists or delists.


                                                                  21
recent years are strikingly different. On average, there were 518 new lists and 408 delists per year during

the pre-peak period compared to 283 and 520 during the post-peak period. Before 1996, there were no

extended periods with more delists than new lists and net new lists were positive on average. During the

post-peak period, the number of delists exceeds the number of new lists every year so that net new lists

are always negative.

    New lists peaked at 987 in 1996 and fell sharply to 152 by 2001. The number of new lists in the

2000s was lower than in every year since 1980. Delists peaked in 1998 but remained high through 2001

and then started to decline. The drop in delists is also significant, but delists dropped less than new lists,

which explains why the net change in lists was negative. It is interesting to note that there was a surge of

delists following the surge in new lists of the 1990s. As young firms have been shown to have a higher

delist rate (Fama and French, 2004), this may not be surprising. What is surprising, however, is that after

this surge of delists the historical pattern of new lists exceeding delists did not re-establish itself.

    The post-peak period is exceptional during our sample period, but it is also exceptional over the

whole history of the public equity universe captured by the CRSP database. Compared to 1997 to 2012

when the number of delists exceeded the number new lists each year, the period from 1926 to 1996 saw

delists exceed new lists in only 17 out of those 70 years (data available from the authors). The largest

number of consecutive years in which delists exceeded new lists is four – from 1931 to 1934 during the

Great Depression. Before NASDAQ was added to CRSP in 1972, years with more delists than new lists

were extremely rare (only six out of 46 years). After NASDAQ was added to CRSP, years with more

delists than new lists were more frequent. From 1972 to 1996, there were 11 such years out of 24 and six

of these occurred immediately after NASDAQ was added to the CRSP database.

    CRSP also provides delisting codes which allow us to categorize the reason firms delist. First, firms

can choose to delist because they no longer find it valuable to be listed (“voluntary”). For instance, a firm

might delist because it wants to stop being subject to some or all of the SEC’s disclosure requirements, an

objective it could achieve by becoming a private firm or could partially achieve by delisting and having a

low number of shareholders. A number of the critiques of SOX argued that it led to delists because firms




                                                       22
did not want to be subject to the incremental compliance provisions, which do not apply to private firms.11

Second, a firm can be delisted by the exchange because it no longer meets the continuing listing

requirements (“for cause”). For instance, delisting for cause may arise if the firm has not been profitable

for several years, if its market capitalization becomes too small or if the stock price is too low. Third, a

firm could be delisted because it is acquired by another firm (“merger”). In that case, the firm could be

acquired by a listed firm or by a private firm. We follow Fama and French (2004) in categorizing CRSP

Delist Codes 200-399 as mergers and Codes 400 and above as delists for cause except for Codes 570 and

573, which we categorize as voluntary delists.

     Panel A of Table 5 shows that the most likely reason a firm delisted during our sample period is

because of a merger (9,749), the second most likely is for cause (7,120), and the third is that it chose to

voluntarily delist (434). There were more delists for cause than for merger in eight out of 38 years during

our sample period and only two of these years were after the listing peak in 1996. From 1975 to 1996,

45% of delists were for cause compared to 37% from 1997 to 2012. Though the proportion of delists for

cause is lower in the post-peak period, there is evidence of a surge in delists for cause from 1997 to 2003

due perhaps to the preceding surge in new lists.

     Rather than focusing on the number of delists, we can look at delists as a percentage of the number of

listed firms in the prior year. These delist rate percentages are shown yearly and for selected subperiods in

Table 5. For the pre-peak period, the average delist rate was more than two percentage points lower than

it was during the post-peak period (7.29% versus 9.49%). The difference is statistically significant (the t-

statistic from a two-sample, unequal variance t-test equals 3.10). The increase is due to an increase in the

merger rate which increased significantly from 3.92% to 5.64% (t-statistic equals 3.59%). The average

rate of delists for cause over these two periods is not significantly different (3.25% vs. 3.50%).

     Macey, O’Hara, and Pompilio (2008) study delists from 1995 to 2005. Their study differs from ours

in that they have a much larger number of delists than we do and, in particular, they have a much larger

11
   See Leuz (2007) for an extensive review of the empirical evidence on the impact of SOX. Leuz, Triantis, and Wang (2008), in
particular, distinguish between firms going private, in which the firms are no longer publicly-traded after the transaction, and
firms going dark, in which firms deregister from disclosure obligations to the SEC. They find a large increase in going dark
decisions immediately after the Act was passed. However, most firms going dark were not listed on an exchange before going
dark but instead traded on the OTC markets. For instance, Marosi and Massoud (2007) have a sample of 261 firms going dark
from 1996 to 2004, but only 38 of these firms announced their deregistration while trading on a major exchange.


                                                              23
number of delists for cause. The total number of delists in their sample period is 9,273. Over this period,

we record 6,932 delists using CRSP. The difference between these two numbers likely has to do with the

data source. Macey, O’Hara, and Pompilio (2008) obtain their data directly from the exchanges. Since

their data includes all delists from each exchange, the counts include delists by firms that are not

incorporated in the U.S., delists from firms that switch from one exchange to another, and delists of

listings that are excluded from our sample because they are not operating firms (such as REITs and

trusts).

    Throughout the sample period there were few voluntary delists. There were 163 voluntary delists

from 1975 to 1996 and 271 from 1997 to 2012, accounting for 1.82% and 3.25% of delists during these

periods. Both before and after 1996 voluntary delists are not important for understanding the evolution of

the number of listings in the U.S. An important caveat is necessary, however. Suppose that management

decides to take the firm private and to do so by creating a private shell company that acquires the public

company. Such a transaction would be counted as a merger and not as a voluntary delisting. Yet,

functionally, this is equivalent to a transaction in which the public company acquires the shares of most

investors and then delists and deregisters, which would be counted as a voluntary delisting. We return to

this concern at the end of Section 6.

    5.2. New lists and delists outside the U.S.

    We next examine whether the new list and delist rates in the U.S. after 1996 were unusual relative to

the equivalent rates in the rest of the world. Since the WDI/WFE databases provide annual information on

listing counts but not on new lists and delists, we use Datastream International and Worldscope to get

new lists and delists for other countries. We start by downloading all public equity records in Datastream

for each country for which we have data for the regressions reported in Table 2, including those in the

Worldscope stock lists as well as in Datastream’s research file of stock lists and dead lists. We merge

these lists and drop the duplicate records.

    There are a number of challenges with this data. In contrast to CRSP which keeps historical

information, Datastream keeps only the most recent information for each record. Moreover, specific share

codes like those in CRSP are not available. Though we screen the records to drop records that are not



                                                    24
common stocks (or the main record for a firm’s traded equity) and that are investment funds and trusts to

make the data as comparable as possible to our other datasets, the final counts of new lists and delists we

produce is likely to be less accurate. To mitigate this problem as much as possible, we focus on the 41

countries that are in Datastream and for which the listing counts correspond to those in the WDI/WFE

dataset.12 In addition, Datastream’s coverage for many countries is less complete prior to the early 1990s.

Therefore, we start our analysis in 1990 instead of 1975. Finally, unlike CRSP, Datastream does not

provide delisting codes. We can determine the number of firms that delist each year but not why they

delisted. To determine the number of publicly-traded firms delisted due to mergers, we obtain data from

the Securities Data Company’s (SDC) Mergers and Acquisitions database. For each country, we

download all completed mergers and acquisitions in which the acquirer owns 100% of the target’s shares

upon completion.

     Panel B of Table 5 shows the evolution of the new list and delist rates for non-U.S. countries. Since

the peak number of the U.S. listings was in 1996, we compare the post-peak period to the pre-peak period

(defined here from 1990 to 1996). To compute the non-U.S. new list (delist) rates we sum all new lists

(delists) across the 41 countries and divide by the total number of listings in those countries in the prior

year.

     Listing and delisting activity outside the U.S. evolved differently than it did in the U.S. The average

non-U.S. new list rate was 9.42% from 1990 to 1996 and 6.04% during the post-peak period. In contrast,

the delist rate increased from 2.85% to 4.14%. Thus, the net new list rate outside the U.S. fell from 6.57%

to 1.90%. In contrast, the net new list rate for the U.S. computed from Datastream data fell from 2.08% to

-2.38% over these periods (using CRSP data, the net new list rate fell from 3.45% to -4.43%). Although

the net new list rate fell in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries, it actually became negative in the U.S.

while it remained positive in these other countries. A large part of this difference is due to the higher

delist rate in the U.S. after 1996. The net new list rate in the U.S. was 1.38 percentage points lower than




12
   For each country we compute the absolute difference between the Datastream and WDI/WFE listing counts each year. We
keep countries for which the average percentage difference from 1990 to 2012 is 25% or less. Out of the 65 non-U.S. countries in
this dataset, 41 meet this criterion (24 developed and 17 emerging countries).


                                                              25
that for non-U.S. countries while the delist rate was 2.90 percentage points higher (the same comparisons

made using CRSP data for the U.S. are 0.98 and 5.35 percentage points, respectively).

    In our analysis of U.S. delists in Section 5.1, we find that the typical delist is a merger delist. We also

find that merger delists were more likely after 1996 than before. Because Datastream does not provide

delisting codes it is not possible for us to identify which firms delisted because of a merger. To assess the

importance of merger delists for non-U.S. countries, we use SDC. For each year since 1990, we count the

number of public targets acquired in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries. For comparability, we continue

to focus on the same 41 non-U.S. countries although the results are similar if we include all non-U.S.

countries.

    We find that from 1990 to 2012, 7,858 non-U.S. public targets were acquired, of which 6,367 were

completed during 1997 to 2012. In contrast, the U.S. recorded 6,452 and 4,997 acquisitions over these

periods. However, throughout the post-peak period, these non-U.S. countries had 4.98 times more listings

than the U.S. on average. If these countries had experienced the same frequency of public target

acquisitions as that in the U.S., they would have had roughly 21,400 acquisitions over that period.

Consequently, the rate of merger delists in the rest of the world was proportionally much lower than it

was in the U.S. Another way to see this is that if the U.S. had the same merger delisting rate as these

countries from 1997 to 2012, it would have had 3,729 fewer delists over that period.

    5.3. New lists, delists, and closing the listing gap.

    Recall that our regression estimates from Table 2 show that the U.S. has a listing gap relative to the

rest of the world. The gap arises because the new list rate dropped sharply after 1996 in the U.S. while the

delist rate increased. In this section, we investigate whether the changing pattern of new list and delist

rates in the U.S. can explain the listing gap. If the new list and delist rates in the U.S. from 1975 to 1996

applied to 1997 to 2012, would there still be a listing gap?

    To address this question, we combine two of our datasets. We use the WDI/WFE data because it has

listing counts for the U.S. and for the non-U.S. countries and we use the CRSP data to compute new list

and delist rates for the U.S. We then simulate predicted WDI/WFE listing counts for the U.S. from 1997




                                                     26
to 2012 by applying the historical CRSP new list and delist rates to them. 13 Recall from Table 5 that the

historical new list and delist rates computed as the averages from 1975 to 1996 are, respectively, 9.22%

and 7.29%. We apply these rates each year from 1997 to 2012 to compute the number of new lists, delists,

and listing counts that the U.S. would have had if the historical rates applied to this period. For example,

the U.S. had 8,025 listings in 1996. Applying the historical rates to this base yields 740 predicted new

lists, 585 predicted delists, and overall 8,180 predicted listings for 1997 (compared to only 7,905 actual

listings).

     With this approach, the U.S. would have had 10,897 listed firms in 2012, a count which is 6,795 more

than it actually had. The reason the number of listed firms is higher is that the historical net new list rate

in the U.S. was positive and we applied that rate to 1997 to 2012 when the actual net new list rate was

negative. To isolate the impact of only the decrease in the new listing rate, we apply the historical new list

rate to 1997 to 2012, but instead use the actual delisting rates in the post-peak period. In this case, the

U.S. would have had 7,659 listings in 2012. Similarly, we can isolate the impact of the increase in the

delisting rate by applying the historical delisting rate to the post-peak period but by using the actual new

list rates. In this case, the U.S. would have had 5,570 listings in 2012. The impact of the increase in the

delist rate is lower than that of the decrease in the new list rate, in part, because the higher delist rate

applies to fewer firms.

     We use these predicted listing counts to test whether the U.S. listing gap disappears if there had not

been missing new lists and/or too many delists from 1997 to 2012. In Table 6, we estimate panel

regressions of listings per capita on the anti-self-dealing index, the log of GDP per capita, GDP growth, a

non-U.S. indicator variable, year fixed effects, and interactions of the non-U.S. indicator variable with

year fixed effects (1990 is the excluded year). The year fixed effects provide estimates of the U.S. listing

gap. Model (1) of Table 6 reproduces the estimates from Model (6) of Table 2, which were featured in

Figure 3 as missing firm counts. This regression shows that the U.S. has a listing gap every year starting




13
   Combining these datasets is a reasonable approximation because the net new list rates for CRSP and WDI/WFE are similar.
For the CRSP data, the average net new list rate implied by changes in listing counts for 1975 to 1996 is 2.0% compared to 2.4%
for the WDI/WFE data. For 1997 to 2012, the averages are -4.29% and -4.06%, respectively.


                                                             27
in 1999 through 2012. The coefficient on the year fixed effect for 2012 is -0.840, which represents the

equivalent of 5,436 fewer actual listings (4,102) than predicted by the panel regression model (9,538).

    Model (2) of Table 6 shows that if we replace actual listing counts with predicted listing counts using

historical new list and delist rates, the listing gap no longer exists. From 1997 to 2000, the coefficients are

positive but not significant. After 2000, they are positive and significant in most years through 2012 so

that an excess of listed firms would actually have developed. The coefficient in 2012 is 0.137 which

represents the equivalent of a surplus of 1,360 listed firms relative to predicted. In Model (3), we apply

the historical new list rate but use actual delist rates to predict the counts from 1997 to 2012. In 1999, the

year fixed effect is still negative but is not significant. The coefficients for 2000 and for years thereafter

are still negative and significant so that the U.S. still has a listing gap from 2000 to 2012. In 2012, the

coefficient is -0.216 (equivalent to a deficit of only 1,879 listed firms) compared to the much larger

deficit count (5,436) associated with the coefficient of -0.840 in Model (1). Finally, Model (4) uses

predicted listing counts based on actual new list rates and the historical delist rate. In this case, there is no

listing gap until 2002. Like Model (3), the listing gap narrows but remains through 2012. The coefficient

for 2012 is -0.534 (the equivalent of a deficit of 3,967 listed firms).

    The panel regression framework allows us to assess the relative contribution of the missing new lists

and the abnormally high delists toward closing the listing gap. In Model (1), the base case scenario that

uses actual listing counts, the listing gap is significant from 1999 onwards. On average, from 1999 to

2012 there is a listing gap of 3,616 firms per year. By contrast, the average listing gap from Model (3),

which uses predicted listing counts based on actual new list rates and the historical delist rate, is 1,679

firms per year. That is, missing new lists explain an average of 1,937 missing listings per year, or 54% of

the missing listings overall. Similarly, excess delists explain 46% of the missing listings. With these

regressions, using either the historical delist rate or the historical new list rate narrows the listing gap but

does not eliminate it. Thus neither new lists nor delists alone can close the gap.




                                                       28
6. Why have there been so many delists since 1996?

     We showed in the previous section that the listing gap cannot be explained by missing new lists

alone. As discussed in the introduction, a number of studies examine missing new lists but there is only

limited evidence on the excess delists. Consequently, in this section, we focus on alternative explanations

for the excess delists.

     6.1. Market conditions, new lists, and delists

     One explanation for the negative net new list rate since the listing peak in 1996 is that market

conditions were less favorable to new lists and more conducive to delisting implying that a common force

may be at work for both phenomena. To examine whether market conditions can explain the decrease in

the net new list rate, we estimate a vector-autoregression (VAR) model for new list and delist rates. It

captures not only the joint dynamics of the new list and delist rates and their interactions, but it also

allows for exogenous forces from the capital market environment to play a role. We use the estimates

from this model to simulate the path of the number of listings through to 2012 to assess whether capital

market conditions explain the listing gap. For this analysis we construct a new quarterly times series of

new lists, delists, and listing counts from the CRSP dataset as well as capital market time-series variables

that influence these listing patterns. We are motivated to pursue this analysis at a higher frequency based

on prior work.14

     Panel A in Table 7 shows the VAR model estimates over the period from 1975 to 2012. These models

account for the joint dependence of new lists on past delists and of delists on past new lists. As discussed

earlier, we would expect the delist rate to be higher if there are more new lists (Fama and French, 2004).

Model (1) shows estimates from a VAR with only new lists and delists; it purposefully excludes the

influence of capital market variables. We allow for four lags of each variable and an indicator variable for

the first quarter each year (see Lowry, 2003).15 The first two lags of the new list rate are significant and

positive in the new list regression. The third lag is negative and significant at the 5% level and the fourth

   Lowry (2003) establishes the economic and statistical importance of aggregate capital demands of private firms, the adverse-
selection costs of issuing equity, and the level of investor optimism as determinants of U.S. IPO volumes, which she measures as
the number of IPOs relative to the existing number of listed companies.
15
   Using a Bayes–Schwarz criterion, we estimate a number of lag structures to the system and determine that four quarterly lags
were enough to capture linear dependencies for the new list and delist rate series.


                                                              29
lag is not significant. In the delist regression, the most notable coefficient is for the fourth lag of the new

list rate, which is positive and statistically significant. In other words, there is some evidence that a high

new list rate leads to a higher delist rate some quarters later. Turning to the lags for the delist rate in the

new list regression, the third lag is positive with a t-statistic of 1.60 and, in the delist regression, the first

lag is positive and significant. The two series appear highly autoregressive. Overall, these feedback

effects are important. F-tests show that jointly the four lags of the new list rate and delist rate (at the 1%

level) are statistically significant for future delist rates.

     In Panel B, we report the impulse responses of a one-standard deviation shock to one variable for the

lagged response to another variable. The own shocks for the new list and delist rates are economically

large for the first three quarterly lags, but die down by the sixth quarter after the shock. Interestingly, we

see on balance positive responses from shocks to new list rates to future delist rates and even from shocks

to delist rates to future new list rates by the sixth quarter, though they are relatively small effects. The

variance decomposition analysis in this panel of the table confirms that the fraction of the overall

variation in either series that is explained by its dependence on the other series ranges between 6% and

15% in the long run (i.e., by the 12th quarterly lag).

     We then turn to VAR estimates where we add capital market variables as exogenous variables. Given

the limited length of the sample period, we estimate a model where we add three variables. These include

the IPO first-day return, the value-weighted market return, and average Tobin’s q, all lagged by one

quarter.16 The estimates are in Model (2). Adding these variables increases the adjusted R2s, but they were

already quite high. There is only one difference in the sign or significance between the two sets of

regressions for the lagged coefficients on the new list and delist rates themselves. In the new list rate

regression, the third lag of the delist rate is now significant at the 10% level. And, as before, the

coefficient on the Quarter 1 dummy is negative and significant for the new list rate. For the new list rate,

Tobin’s q, the IPO return and the value-weighted market returns all have positive and significant

16
   IPO first-day returns are from Jay Ritter’s website (http://bear.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipodata.htm). The dataset includes
monthly data for the number of IPOs and the average first-day return. We compute a quarterly average of the monthly
observations where each observation is weighted by the number of IPOs that month. The value-weighted market return is from
CRSP. Data for Tobin’s q is from Compustat. For each firm we compute Tobin’s q as total assets minus the book value of equity
plus the market value of equity, divided by total assets. Following Lowry, we compute the average Tobin’s q across U.S. firms
that are at least three years old and have a book value of equity of at least $100,000 (in 1990 dollars).


                                                              30
coefficients. For the delist rate, the coefficient for the value-weighted market returns is negative and

significant.17

     We next simulate the evolution of the number of listings based on Model (2). In these simulations, we

use the estimated coefficients from the 1975 to 1996 sub-period and extrapolate the new list and delist

counts and the resulting cumulative total firm count each year from 1997 to 2012. The simulation predicts

14,128 listings by 2012. In other words, accounting for the changing capital market environment after the

listing peak in 1996 actually leads us to predict more, not fewer, listings. As a result, it is not the case that

the number of listings is so low because of poor capital market conditions.

     6.2. Firm characteristics and the increase in delists after the listing peak

     After the listing peak, there were fewer small firms and fewer young firms. To assess whether

changes in the characteristics of listed firms can explain the change in the pattern of delisting, we estimate

multinomial logistic (“logit”) regressions at the firm level across all years. Hence, the sample constitutes

over 175,000 firm-year observations. Firms that do not delist in a given year constitute the base category

and we consider three delisting outcomes, namely merger, for cause, and voluntary, which are treated as

independent in the multinomial logit setting. We include the following lagged firm characteristics: size,

earnings over assets (Profitability), the percentage change in assets over the last year (Asset growth), and

a dummy that indicates whether a firm became listed within the last five years (Young listed). We

measure size (in terms of total assets, inflation adjusted) using quintiles defined in 1996 to ensure that

small and large firms are defined similarly over the sample period. The largest quintile is the omitted

category. We also include an indicator variable for the years after the listing peak in 1996 (Post-peak

dummy). If firm characteristics explain the pattern of delisting over our entire sample period, the post-

peak dummy should not be significant. Finally, we include industry fixed effects. Given the data

requirements, we omit firms in their first two years after the IPO. Standard errors are clustered at the firm-

level.


17
  We explored a number of different specifications with the macroeconomic and capital market variables used by Lowry (2003).
These included different proxies for capital demand, future growth opportunities, as well as market sentiment and with different
numbers of lags. We also explored VAR specifications in which some of these capital market series were part of the joint
dynamics with the new list and delist rates. Regardless of the specification shown, the basic dependence between the new list and
delist rates remains similar to those reported in the table.


                                                              31
    Table 8 shows the estimates of the multinomial logit regressions. Model (1) shows that the smallest

firms are less likely to delist by merger (significant negative coefficient of -0.359) and more likely to

delist for cause (significant positive coefficient of 2.319). Our statements here are defined relative to

firms in the largest size quintile. As firm size increases, a delisting by merger becomes more likely and a

delisting for cause becomes less likely. Voluntary delists become less likely as firm size increases. Not

surprisingly, less profitable firms are more likely to delist for cause. Lower asset growth is associated

with a lower probability of each type of delisting. Young listed firms are more likely to delist by merger

and for cause than seasoned firms. The coefficient on the post-peak dummy is positive and significant for

all types of delists. It follows that accounting for firm characteristics does not explain away the increase in

the probability of delisting after the peak.

    In Model (2), we allow for an interaction between size groups and the post-peak dummy to assess

whether the change in delisting patterns differs across size groups. We find that there is no significant

change in the probability of a merger regardless of the size category of the firm in the post-peak period.

Surprisingly, however, the interaction term for the firms in the smallest size quintile offsets the increase in

the probability of delisting in the post-peak period, so that there does not appear an increase in delisting

for cause for the smallest firms after 1996. The coefficient on the interaction of the post-peak dummy

together with the Size 1 category is a significant -0.931, which is almost as large as that on the post-peak

dummy alone of 0.958. The fact that the coefficient of the post-peak dummy is associated with the largest

quintile of firms by size implies that there is still an increase in the unconditional likelihood of delisting

for cause among the largest firms. This result is hard to reconcile with the view that small firms somehow

became less competitive as stand-alone firms, but it raises the question as to whether small firms that

were less competitive somehow exited using the merger route when earlier they would have exited with a

for cause delisting. We address this question in Section 6.4 below.

    Finally, we add an interaction between the post-peak dummy and the young listed indicator variable

in Model (3). We find that young listed firms are more likely to be acquired after 1996 and less likely to

delist for cause or delist voluntarily. As shown in Model (4), however, much of the significance of that

interaction disappears when we also include the interactions with firm size. Regardless of the interactions



                                                      32
we include with the post-peak dummy, we find that the coefficient on the post-peak dummy remains

highly significant. Consequently, the firm characteristics that we consider cannot explain the change in

delisting patterns after 1996.

     6.3. The survival of new lists

     Fama and French (2004) show that over the 1980s and the 1990s, new lists increasingly had lower

profits and no history of positive profits. They also find the survival rate of new lists fell sharply. Their

sample covers new lists from 1973 to 2001, a period that has little overlap with the period of negative net

new list rates that started after the listing peak in 1996. Nevertheless, it could be that weaker new lists

explain the abnormally high delists in a way that is not captured by our multinomial logits in Section 6.2

because the weaker new lists would have been present mostly early in the post-peak period. Therefore, we

investigate the survival of new lists over time after the listing peak.

     The first important fact we uncover is that during the pre-peak period, 63% of new lists survived at

least five years compared to 60% from 1997 to 2007 (not tabulated but available from the authors).18

Hence, the survival rate fell, but only slightly, after the peak. However, for the IPO cohorts from 2001 to

2007, the survival rate is actually higher at 65%. This implies that the lower post-peak survival rate is

explained by a low survival rate in the years immediately after the 1996 peak. For the new list cohorts

from 1997 to 2000, the survival rate is only 51%.

     To compare the delisting behavior of newly-listed firms to that of seasoned firms more formally, we

proceed as follows. We first classify firms as “young” listed or “seasoned” listed firms, where young

listed firms are those that became listed within the last five years. To examine whether delisting activity

of young listed firms can help explain the overall higher delisting rate among all firms after 1996, we

compare delisting rates for young listed firms and seasoned listed firms during the pre-peak period to the

post-peak period.19 During the pre-peak period, the rate of delists averages 7.4% for young listed firms

and 7.9% for seasoned listed firms. A paired t-test cannot reject the hypothesis that the two rates are the

19
  NASDAQ stocks were added to the CRSP database in 1972 and were all assigned a listing date of 1972. We therefore start
assigning firms into “young” listed and “seasoned” listed categories starting in 1977.


                                                          33
same. After the peak, both rates are notably higher. The rate for young listed firms is 9.1% and that for

seasoned listed firms is 9.7%, and again, the two rates are not significantly different.

     When we examine the reasons for delisting among young and seasoned listed firms, we find a sharp

change between the pre-peak period and the post-peak period. From 1977 to 1996, 40.35% of the

delistings of young listed firms are merger-related and 57.91% are for cause. After 1996, merger delists

became more important for young listed firms. The percentage of young firms delisted because of a

merger was 55.15% over that period, while only 41.16% of delists were for cause. By contrast, the

percentage of delists due to mergers for seasoned listed firms did not change much from the pre-peak to

the post-peak period (62.41% vs. 61.99%).20 For young (seasoned) firms, the percentage of voluntary

delists increased from 1.73% (1.68%) to 3.69% (4.05%) from the pre-peak to the post-peak period. While

voluntary delists became more important, they remain a small fraction of all delists for both young and

seasoned listed firms.

     It follows that while the delist rate increased after the peak, it is not simply because the delist rate

among young listed firms increased in a disproportionate manner. While the delist rate of young listed

firms did increase, the delist rate of seasoned listed firms increased by the same amount. For both young

listed firms and seasoned listed firms, merger delists were the most frequent type of delists after the peak.

     6.4. Merger as alternative to delist for cause

     The higher delist rate after the listing peak cannot be explained by delistings classified as for cause by

CRSP. We infer then that it must arise from an unusually high merger delist rate. An obvious concern is

that there could have been a higher merger rate because firms about to be delisted for cause sought to be

acquired instead. That is, a growing number of mergers may have been de facto delists for cause.

     To examine this possibility, we estimate a logit model to predict whether a firm that delists is doing

so because of a merger or for cause. Exchanges have formal initial and continuing listing requirements.

However, a firm can meet the listing requirements in several different ways. Further, as Macey, O’Hara,

and Pompilio (2008) show, firms that fail to meet listing requirements are not necessarily delisted for

cause by the exchange. However, we know from listing criteria that exchanges pay attention to
20
  This increased importance of mergers for young firms during the 1990s compared to earlier periods is also documented in
Arikan and Stulz (2014).


                                                          34
profitability, market capitalization, assets, level of the stock price, recent stock returns, and the number of

shareholders. Using a logit model in which a delist for cause takes a value of zero and a delist for merger,

a value of one, we predict whether a firm that delists does so for cause or because of a merger using the

firm-level characteristics the exchanges are known to consider in making their decision to delist for cause.

Using this model, we would like to determine whether the number of false positive associations of merger

delists increased after the peak. In other words, we ask whether the number of firms that delisted because

of a merger but that were predicted to delist for cause based on their firm-level characteristics increased

after the peak.

     In Panel A of Table 9 we show estimates of four different logit specifications. The sample includes

14,863 delisting observations (out of 17,303) for which we have complete data on the prior one-year total

return, price on the day closest to the end of the delisting month, profitability, measured as earnings

divided by assets, and size. We use the log of assets to measure size, but results are similar if we use a

firm’s market capitalization.21 These models differ in their use of industry and year fixed effects. We

show that conditional on delisting, the probability of a merger delist increases when prior returns are

higher, the stock price is higher, profitability is higher, and log(assets) is bigger. This is true for all the

models we estimate and the coefficients are similar across the models. The coefficients on profitability are

larger when we have industry fixed effects, but the other coefficients seem little affected by industry fixed

effects.

     We next use Model (3) to predict which delists are classified as mergers. This model includes year

fixed effects to allow for the fact that delisting criteria changed over time but it does not include industry

fixed effects because industry affiliation is not a criterion for delisting used by the exchanges. Predicted

values from logit models are between zero and one and we need to choose a probability cutoff to assign

predicted delists as either a merger or for cause. We use a cutoff of 0.491%.22 Panel B shows the actual

delisting classifications, the predicted classifications, and the difference between actual and predicted

21
   Requiring data on the number of shareholders reduces the sample size by about 2,000 observations. It is not statistically
significant when size is included in the regression. These results are not reported, but available from the authors.
22
   To choose the cutoff, we graph sensitivity versus one minus specificity against probability cutoffs. Sensitivity is the fraction of
observed positive-outcome cases that are correctly classified; specificity is the fraction of observed negative-outcome cases that
are correctly classified. The point at which the two curves cross is the optimal probability cutoff. See Hosmer and Lemeshow
(2000).


                                                                 35
mergers. Overall the model accurately predicts delists for cause and mergers. Out of 14,863 delists, it

classifies 14,513 correctly. Said differently, it incorrectly classifies only 2.35% of the delists. There were

three waves of unusually high false classifications during 1977-1979, 1990-1992, and 2001-2004, but

these are few and rarely do the error rates exceed 5% in a given year.

    From 1997 to 2012, there were 4,786 mergers. Over that period, the model predicts 4,609 mergers. In

other words, only 177 of these 4,786 mergers involve a firm that we predict would otherwise have been

delisted for cause. These potentially falsely-identified 177 mergers that could have been delists for cause

are so few in number that they make no difference to our overall conclusions.

    6.5. Who acquires firms that delist because of mergers?

    The acquirers of young and seasoned publicly-listed firms could be public firms or private firms. If

the acquirer is a public firm, the firm’s assets continue to be owned by public shareholders. If it is less

valuable to have corporate assets owned by publicly-listed firms, we would expect an increase in

acquisitions from private firms. An additional consideration is that firms going private can go private

through an acquisition by a shell company private firm. We use SDC to identify the ownership status of

acquirers of U.S. public target firms. We start in 1981 as earlier data is sparse. Gao, Ritter, and Zhu

(2013) conduct a related analysis focused on recent IPO firms and show that the fraction of recent IPO

firms acquired by private firms has not increased. Our analysis considers all firms and compares the

experience of the U.S. to that of non-U.S. countries.

    Panel A of Figure 6 shows that the percentage of public U.S. firms acquired by other public firms (as

opposed to those by private firms) varies greatly over time. From 1981 to 1996, 68.6% of listed firms

were acquired by public firms. This percentage falls only slightly after 1996 to 66.0% and the difference

is not statistically significant. If we exclude the credit crisis and subsequent years, the average after 1996

is 70.0%. It does not appear that acquisitions by private firms occurred at an unusually higher rate after

the peak.

    Jensen (1986), as cited in the introduction, argues that the private equity form of organization would

emerge as the dominant form. However, acquisitions by private non-operating firms acquired an average

of 12.2% of public firms each year from 1981 to 1996 and 12.9% afterwards. Figure 6 shows that the



                                                     36
percentage of public firms acquired by private non-operating firms increased after 2002, but did not reach

the peak levels from the 1980s. Finally, leveraged buy-outs (LBOs) – shown as a dashed line in the figure

– accounted for 8.06% of the acquisitions from 1981 to 1996 and 6.84% afterwards.23 It follows from this

that there is little evidence that acquisitions corresponding to going-private transactions and acquisitions

by private equity firms became more important after 1996.

     Panel B of Figure 6 shows the equivalent results for publicly-listed targets in non-U.S. countries. This

figure starts in 1990 because earlier data in SDC is not reliably available. The percentage of public firms

acquired by public acquirers in non-U.S. countries was actually lower than the same rate in the U.S. From

1997 to 2012, the rate across non-U.S. countries was 60.89%, five percentage points lower than that in the

U.S. The percentage of acquisitions by private non-operating companies for non-U.S. countries was

11.51% after 1996, which is slightly lower than the percentage in the U.S. of 12.74%. It follows from

these comparisons that there is little evidence that acquisitions by private equity firms were more

important in the U.S. after 1996 than they were abroad.



7. Conclusion.

     The U.S. has experienced a dramatic decrease in the number of publicly-listed firms whereas listings

increased in the rest of the world. As a result, the U.S. has developed a listing gap compared to other

countries and this gap has become large, exceeding 5,000 firms. We not only quantify the magnitude of

this listing gap, but we also investigate various explanations for it. Because the U.S. has a distinctly

different evolution in listing counts from that of the rest of the world, the explanation has to be focused on

changes in the U.S. The listing gap does not arise because there are fewer firms or startups. Though the

size of the smallest listed firms is larger at the end of our sample than at the listing peak, all listed firms

have generally become larger. While these changes indicate that the exchanges have become less

hospitable to the smallest firms, the probability that a firm is listed has fallen for all firm sizes, albeit less

so for the very largest firms. We conclude that firm size alone cannot explain the listing gap.



23
  We use industry information from SDC and the flag “Acquirer type” to identify private non-operating firms. We use the flag
“LBO” to identify leveraged buy-outs.


                                                            37
    Before the listing peak in 1996, the net new list rate in the U.S. was positive. After 1996, it was

negative because the delist rate increased and the new list rate fell. We show that if the new list and delist

rates from the pre-peak period applied after 1996, there would be no gap today. Similarly, the net new list

rate in non-U.S. countries was positive and sufficiently large after 1996 that there would be no gap if the

U.S. had had new list and delist rates similar to these countries.

    The listing gap cannot be explained by just the decrease in the new list rate. We show that the U.S.

would still have a listing gap if the new list rate had not fallen. To explain the gap, one has to explain both

the fall in the new list rate and the rise in the delist rate. We show that the delist rate rose because of an

increase in merger activity involving publicly-listed targets. After 1996, the percentage of firms delisted

for cause did not increase, but the percentage of firms delisted because of a merger did. Much has been

made of the increase in firms going dark or going private after SOX. We show that the percentage of

firms delisting voluntarily is too small to explain the listing gap or even to contribute meaningfully to

closing the gap.

    More than two decades ago, Jensen (1989) predicted the demise of the public corporation because the

type of organization favored by private equity firms would displace public corporations. The type of

organization favored by these firms is one in which management is heavily incentivized both by high

ownership of equity and by high leverage. Because of the role of private equity firms and the high

ownership of managers, the agency conflict between managers and shareholders would be much smaller

than in public corporations and would possibly disappear altogether. While the number of public firms

decreased in a way that is consistent with Jensen’s predictions, the role of private equity cannot explain

the decrease in the number of public firms. During the post-peak period, the average percentage of public

firm acquisitions involving private equity was the same as it was in the pre-peak period and lower than it

was in the 1980s. Another paradigm is needed to explain the eclipse of the public corporation in the U.S.

Table 1. Listing counts, population, and listing counts per capita for select years.
This table reports the number of domestic, publicly-listed firms in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries for raw counts
and for listing counts per capita (in terms of millions of inhabitants). Listing counts are from the WDI and WFE
databases. Investment companies, mutual funds, REITs, and other collective investment vehicles are excluded. The
set of non-U.S. countries comprises the 71 countries included in Djankov et al. (2008). Countries are classified as
developed or emerging based on the MSCI classification scheme as of 2014.

Table 2. Institutions, economic development, and listings per capita.
This table presents cross-country regressions and panel regressions estimated from 1990 to 2012. The dependent variable is a country’s annual listing count per
capita (in millions of inhabitants). Listed firms include domestic, publicly-listed firms from the WDI and WFE databases. Investment companies, mutual funds,
REITs, and other collective investment vehicles are excluded. The sample comprises 72 countries included in Djankov et al. (2008). The cross-sectional
regression t-statistics are based on robust standard errors. The number of countries is indicated as the number of observations for each column. The panel
regression t-statistics are adjusted for clustering by country. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

This table reports the total number of firms in the U.S., including public and private firms, the number of listed
firms, startups, and the startup rate. The total number of firms and startups are from the Longitudinal Business
Database provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Listed firms include domestic, publicly-listed firms in the U.S., from
the WDI and WFE databases. Investment companies, mutual funds, REITs, and other collective investment vehicles
are excluded. Startups are firms with age equal to zero. The startup rate equals the number of startups in a year
divided by the total number of firms in the prior year.

Table 4. New lists and startups.
This table presents regressions where the dependent variable equals number of new lists over the total number of
public and private firms multiplied by 100. New lists are from CRSP and include U.S. common stocks (share codes
10 and 11) and firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3). Investment funds and
trusts (SIC codes 6722, 6726, 2798, and 6799) are excluded. The total number of firms and startups are from the
Longitudinal Business Database provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. The main explanatory variable is the startup
rate, defined as startups divided by the total number of firms multiplied by 100. Startups are defined as firms with
age equal to zero. The Post-peak dummy equals one from 1997 to 2012. Models (1) and (3) are estimated over 1979
to 2012 and Model (2) is estimated over 1981 to 2012. t-statistics are computed with Newey-West standard errors
with one lag. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively

Table 5. Listing counts, new lists, and delists.
In Panel A, data for listed firms, new lists, and delists are from CRSP. The counts include U.S. common stocks and
firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE. Investment funds and trusts are excluded. We count a new list as such
in the year a record first enters the database and a delisting as such in the year in which a record drops out. We use
CRSP delist codes to categorize delists as mergers, for cause, and voluntary. Panel B reports data for 41 non-U.S.
countries from Datastream. The non-U.S. new list (delist) rate equals the sum all new lists (delists) across 41
countries divided by the total number of listings in those countries in the prior year.

Table 6. Closing the listing gap.
This table presents panel regressions estimated over 1990 to 2012. The dependent variable is a country’s annual
listing count per capita. Listed firms include domestic, publicly-listed firms from the WDI and WFE databases.
Investment companies, mutual funds, REITs, and other collective investment vehicles are excluded. The sample
comprises 72 countries included in Djankov et al. (2008). Model (1) reproduces the estimates of Model (6), from
Table 2. In Model (2), we apply historical new list and delist rates from CRSP to adjust the WDI listing counts for
the U.S. for 1997 to 2012. In Model (3) (Model (4)), we apply the historical (actual) new list rate and the actual
(historical) delist rate. t-statistics are adjusted for clustering by country. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 7. Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) models of new list and delist activity in the U.S.
VAR models are estimated for the new list and delist rates by quarter in the U.S. New list (delist) rates are computed as the number of new lists (delists) in
quarter t divided by the number of listed firms in t-1. Data for listing counts, new lists, and delists are from CRSP. The counts include U.S. common stocks (share
codes 10 and 11) and firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3). Investment funds and trusts (SIC codes 6722, 6726, 2798, and
6799) are excluded. We count a new list as such in the year a record first enters the database and we count a delisting as such in the year in which a record drops
out. The model is                                      , where                where yt is a 2×1 vector of the new list rate and delist rate, and C and B s are 2×1 and
2×2 matrices of parameters, L is the lag length for the VAR, and u t is a column vector of forecast errors of the best linear predictor of yt given all the past y’s. A
is R×1 matrix of parameters for a series of R exogenous variables, Z. The (i,j)-th component of Bs measures the direct effect that a change in the return on the jth
variable would have on the ith variable in s quarters. We estimate this system in two specifications: Model 1 without any exogenous variables, and Model 2, with
exogenous variables included.

Table 8. Multinomial logits for delisting types.
This table presents multinomial logit regressions estimated over the period from 1975 to 2012. The dependent variable equals one if a did not delist. It equals one
for delistings because of merger, two for cause, and three for voluntary. Data for listed firms and delists are from CRSP. The counts include U.S. common stocks
(share codes 10 and 11) and firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3). Investment funds and trusts (SIC codes 6722, 6726, 2798,
and 6799) are excluded. We count a delisting as such in the year in which a record drops out. We use CRSP delist codes to categorize delists as mergers (codes
200-399) and for cause (codes 400 and above except 570 and 573). Size 1 is a dummy for firms in the smallest size quintile in 1996. The omitted category is Size
5, a dummy for firms in the largest size quintile. The Post-peak dummy equals one from 1997 to 2012. The Young listed dummy equals one for firms that
became listed within the last five years. Firm characteristics are lagged by one year. t-statistics are based on standard errors clustered at the firm-level. *, **, and
***
    indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 9. Predicting merger delists.
Panel A presents logit regressions estimated over the period from 1975 to 2012. The dependent variable equals one
if a firm delisted because of a merger and zero if it delisted for cause. Data for listed firms and delists are from
CRSP. The counts include U.S. common stocks (share codes 10 and 11) and firms listed on AMEX, NASDAQ, or
NYSE (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3). Investment funds and trusts (SIC codes 6722, 6726, 2798, and 6799) are
excluded. We count a delisting as such in the year in which a record drops out. We use CRSP delist codes to
categorize delists as mergers (codes 200-399) and for cause (codes 400 and above except 570 and 573). t-statistics
are based on robust standard errors. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively. Panel B shows the actual counts for delists because of mergers and for cause and compares them to
those predicted by the Model (3) in Panel A. For each delisting, we compute the predicted probability of being a
merger based on the estimated coefficients and the realized values for each variable. Probabilities above 0.491 are
predicted to be mergers.

This figure shows the U.S. listing gap, measured as the number of missing listed firms each year. The listing gap is computed from the year fixed effects
estimated in Model (6) of Table 2. The dependent variable in this regression is a country’s annual listing count per capita (in millions of inhabitants). The
explanatory variables include the anti-self-dealing index, Log(GDP per capita), GDP growth, a non-U.S. dummy, year fixed effects, and interactions of the non-
U.S. indicator with the year fixed effects. Listing counts are the number of domestic, publicly-listed firms from the WDI and WFE databases. Investment
companies, mutual funds, REITs, and other collective investment vehicles are excluded. The sample comprises 72 countries included in Djankov et al. (2008).
The panel regression t-statistics are adjusted for clustering by country. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. A
black bar indicates that the coefficient on a given year fixed effect is statistically significant at the 5% level or better. A white bar indicates the coefficient is not
statistically significant.

Figure 5. The size of U.S. firms.
Panel A shows the percentage of total firms (public and private), in each employee size group that are listed. The
total number of firms is from the Longitudinal Business Database provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Listed firms
are from Compustat and CRSP and include U.S. common stocks (share codes 10 and 11) and firms listed on AMEX,
NASDAQ, or NYSE (exchange codes 1, 2, and 3). Investment funds and trusts (SIC codes 6722, 6726, 2798, and
6799) are excluded. Panel B shows the percentage of small (100 to 499 employees) and large firms (5,000 or more
employees) that are listed and the percentage of total firms in the economy. Panel C shows the evolution of the log
assets (in 1990 dollars) for the 20th, 40th, 50th, 60th, and 80th percentiles.

Figure 6. Acquisitions of U.S. public firms by acquirer type.
Panel A shows the percentage of U.S. public firms acquired by public firms and by private firms from 1981 to 2012.
Data on acquisitions is from SDC. We include acquisitions in which the acquirer owns 100% after the transaction. A
U.S. target is classified as public if the SDC flag “Target status” equals public and the target’s stock exchange is one
of AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE. Investment funds and trusts are excluded. Acquirers are classified as public if the
SDC flag “Acquirer status” equals public and information on the acquirer’s stock exchange is provided. A deal is
classified as an LBO based on the “LBO” flag in SDC. Private acquirers are classified as a non-operating company
based on the SDC flag “Acquirer type” and industry information. Panel B is similar but starts in 1990 for
acquisitions of non-U.S. targets.
