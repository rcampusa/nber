Monetary Policy in the Open Economy Revisited:
Price Setting and Exchange Rate Flexibility
Michael B. Devereux and Charles Engel
NBER Working Paper No. 7665
April 2000
JEL No. F3, F4



                                            ABSTRACT


       This paper develops a welfare-based model of monetary policy in an open economy. We
focus on the extent to which monetary policy should be employed in maintaining the exchange rate.
The traditional approach maintains that exchange rate flexibility is desirable in the presence of real
country-specific shocks that require adjustment in relative prices. However, in the light of empirical
evidence on nominal price response to exchange-rate changes – specifically, that there appears to be
a large degree of local-currency pricing in industrialized countries – the expenditure-switching role
played by nominal exchange rates may be exaggerated in the traditional literature. In the presence
of local-currency, we find that optimal monetary policy in response to real shocks pricing is fully
consistent with fixed exchange rates. On the other hand, when real country-specific shocks are not
important, and when a country’s monetary sector is stable, the case for freely floating rates (a
monetary policy in which exchange rates are not a consideration) is strengthened in the presence of
local-currency pricing.

        In the last decade, one of the central issues facing monetary policy makers in open

economies has been the degree to which policy choices should be affected by exchange-rate

considerations. There is an abundance of different experiences around the world. Eleven countries

of the European Union, by adopting a single currency and eliminating exchange rate changes, have

abandoned independent national monetary policy. The currency boards of Hong Kong and

Argentina have given their monetary policy completely over to the maintenance of an exchange rate

fixed to the US dollar. On the other hand, the US and Japan, and smaller countries like Australia

and Canada, have focused domestic monetary policy on the goal of achieving low and stable rates

of inflation, allowing their exchange rates to fluctuate more or less freely.

        There is little clear evidence on the overall success of alternative exchange rate regimes (e.g.

Ghosh, Gulde, Ostroy and Wolf, 1997). Many critics have raised doubts about policies that fix the

exchange rate in the context of the “optimum currency area” criteria, originally enumerated by

Mundell (1961). They argue that free exchange rate movements would improve the functioning of

capital markets and the allocation of resources in Europe, and in the Southeast Asian countries

following the crisis of 1997-1998.1 Frankel (1999) takes an intermediate position, arguing that

exchange-rate objectives for many countries should be but one of several concerns for monetary

authorities.

        This paper develops a welfare-based model of monetary policy in an open economy. We

focus on the extent to which monetary policy should be employed in maintaining a fixed exchange

rate. The analysis is based around two very traditional ideas, central to the recent debate on

exchange rate policy: On the one hand exchange rate flexibility is desirable in the presence of real

country-specific shocks that require adjustment in relative prices. But on other hand, a fixed

exchange rate allows a country to inherit monetary stability from a regime that has manifested

strong monetary discipline.



                                                   1
         The modern case for flexible exchange rates goes back to Friedman (1953). Real country-

specific productivity or demand shocks require adjustment of relative price levels between

countries. If nominal prices adjusted quickly, Friedman argues, the choice of exchange-rate regime

would be irrelevant because the relative price adjustment could be achieved by nominal price

changes:

         If internal prices were as flexible as exchange rates, it would make little economic
         difference whether adjustments were brought about by changes in exchange rates or
         by equivalent changes in internal prices. But this condition is clearly not fulfilled.
         The exchange rate is potentially flexible in the absence of administrative action to
         freeze it. At least in the modern world, internal prices are highly inflexible.

         Freely floating exchange rates allow the needed relative price adjustment to occur

instantaneously when nominal goods price-adjustment is sluggish. As Feldstein (1992) puts it,

         Either form of adjustment [exchange-rate or price] can bring the real exchange rate
         to its equilibrium value, but a decline in domestic prices is likely to require a period of
         increased unemployment. It would certainly be better to have a decline in the nominal
         exchange rate. The shift to a single currency in Europe would preclude such nominal
         exchange-rate adjustments and force real exchange-rate reductions to be achieved
         through lower local wages and prices.

         This type of reasoning lies behind the recommendation of the optimum-currency area

literature that countries subject to sizable country-specific real shocks should not target exchange

rates with monetary policy.2 But the argument relies on the notion that exchange-rate movements

have a large immediate impact on aggregate demand, by allowing instantaneous adjustment of

relative prices. Recent empirical work, however, indicates that in the short run there is very little

response of consumer prices to changes in nominal exchange rates.3 The short-run adjustment role

of nominal exchange rates is eliminated to the extent that consumer prices are unresponsive to

exchange rate changes: the so-called “expenditure-switching effect” may be negligible.

         There is a voluminous literature on optimal monetary policy in open economies under price

stickiness.4 But none of that analysis has been based on choice-theoretic models, and therefore has

lacked an adequate welfare criterion. In this paper we develop a two-country, stochastic, sticky-

price general equilibrium optimizing model, drawing on the work of Obstfeld and Rogoff

(hereinafter referred to as OR, 1995, 1998). To conduct a realistic analysis of the role of the

exchange rate in monetary policy, we allow for both country specific productivity or supply shocks,

and country specific monetary or velocity shocks. We evaluate optimal monetary policy using the

welfare of consumers as the criterion. As in OR (1998), our model is simple enough to admit an

exact solution for prices, exchange rates and all real allocations. An implication of this is that

monetary policy rules affect both volatility and levels of macroeconomic variables. This has an

important implication for the conduct of monetary policy with respect to the exchange rate.

         While we are solely concerned with monetary policy under sticky prices, a critical

distinction in our analysis is the currency in which prices are set. We allow two different

specifications of price-setting. Our first specification follows OR (1995, 1998), and implicitly the

Friedman and Feldstein analyses, assuming that nominal prices are preset in the currency of the

producer (denoted producer-currency pricing or PCP). As a result, when exchange rates fluctuate,

imported goods prices move one-for-one with exchange rates. But we also allow another type of

price stickiness –prices that are preset in consumers’ currency (denoted local-currency pricing or

LCP).5 This specification is more in accord with the empirical findings cited above.

         The model delivers a strikingly simple representation of the objective functions of monetary

policy6. Under PCP, monetary authorities in each country should attempt to minimize a linear

   See Devereux and Engel (1998) for a long but partial list of citations.
5
   Notably Betts and Devereux (1996, 2000a) have also made this assumption in open-economy sticky-price models,
but not in a fully stochastic model which is required to analyze optimal monetary policy.
6
  This contrasts particularly with the older literature on optimal monetary policy in open economies, which often
employed ad hoc objective functions consisting of output and balance of trade volatility. In our analysis the balance of
trade is an entirely irrelevant objective for monetary policy.

                                                            3
combination of consumption variance, exchange rate variance, and the covariance of consumption

and exchange rates with country specific productivity shocks. Under LCP, the appropriate

monetary policy objective ignores the exchange rate, rather minimizing a linear combination of

consumption variance and the covariance of consumption with productivity shocks.

        The distinction between price-setting specifications is critical for our analysis of the

adjustment benefits of the exchange rate in face of country-specific productivity shocks. Under the

Friedman type of price stickiness – PCP – fixed exchange rates are strictly sub-optimal when real

country-specific shocks dominate. The exchange rate must be employed as part of optimal

monetary policy in order to achieve a change in relative prices, precisely as described by Friedman.

In fact, with exchange-rate flexibility, optimal monetary policy can replicate the equilibrium of the

economy with fully flexible prices. Flexible exchange rates are a perfect substitute for flexible

goods prices. In contrast, exchange-rate flexibility confers no advantage if prices are set in

consumers’ currencies, (as the empirical evidence suggests). Under LCP, an optimal monetary rule

does not utilize exchange rate movements at all! Optimal monetary policy, followed by policy

makers in each country, is in fact fully consistent with fixed exchange rates.7

        A methodological implication of our results relates to the appropriate mapping between

consumer’s utility functions and monetary policy objectives. In our model, a simple Taylor-series

approximation of utility would suggest that monetary rules should minimize consumption variance

alone. But our exact analysis shows that the optimal rule should take account of both consumption

variance and expected consumption. In fact, it is the incorporation of expected consumption into

the monetary policy objective leads the policy-maker to add exchange rate variance, and the




7
 An implication of our analysis is that an optimal monetary policy outcome involves policy-makers in both countries
choosing optimal rules. Although monetary policy is described as a game between policy makers, in this model there is
no welfare losses from independent monetary policy-making, and no therefore no gains (or losses) from policy
coordination.

                                                          4
covariance of consumption and exchange rates with productivity disturbances, to the linear policy

objective function to be minimized.

       Our formal welfare analysis also allows us to consider the optimal degree of exchange-rate

intervention for a country that experiences shocks to money supply or velocity. In accordance with

traditional thinking, we find that if the variance of domestic monetary shocks is sufficiently large, it

would like to inherit the monetary stability of a country that has a track record of monetary

discipline. But if it has a very stable monetary sector relative to the outside world, it would prefer

more exchange rate flexibility. But we also find here that the type of price-setting behavior is

important. Under PCP, a country would never choose a clean float, even if it had a completely

stable monetary sector, because the volatility of exchange rates imparts a direct welfare cost on

expected consumption. On the other hand, with LCP, exchange rate volatility causes no

independent welfare cost, and a float is fully optimal for a country with complete monetary stability.

Thus, while the traditional case for floating rates as providing an expenditure-switching mechanism

is nullified under LCP, the case is strengthened when considering monetary factors for a country

with a stable monetary sector.

       Section 1 sets out the general equilibrium model. In section 2, we discuss features of the

solution to the model . The optimal monetary policy rules are derived and examined in section 3.

Some conclusions follow. Most of the derivations of our results are contained in an Appendix at

the end of the paper.




                                                   5
1.     The Model

       The model economy has the following structure. There are two countries, home and foreign.

In each country, households maximize expected lifetime utility, taking prices and wages as given.

Firms are monopolistic competitive, and maximize utility for their owners. There are shocks to

both money supply and to production technologies.

       We work with two alternative specifications for the pricing of consumer goods. In all

specifications, producers must set prices prior to the realization of shocks. This is an institutional

constraint in our model, although it can be justified by the presence of menu-costs of price

adjustment. Prices fully adjust to all shocks after one period; i.e., there is no persistence to the

price-adjustment process8. In the first specification, producers set prices in terms of their own

currency. For example, the home currency price of home goods is set, and unresponsive to

monetary shocks. The price for home goods paid by foreign consumers then changes when there is

an unexpected exchange rate change. We denote this specification ‘producer-currency pricing’, or

PCP.

       In the other specification, producers set prices in consumers’ currencies. For example, home

firms set one price for home-country consumers in the home currency and another price for foreign-

country consumers in the foreign currency. Unexpected changes in exchange rates have no effect

on consumer prices, either at home or in the foreign country. This specification is referred to as

one of ‘local-currency pricing’, or LCP.

       It is natural to focus on the two extreme cases of price-setting behavior: complete PCP or

complete LCP. PCP is the traditional assumption in open economy macroeconomics (see for

instance, Obstfeld and Rogoff 1996). Moreover, it is the central core behind the defense of flexible

exchange rates of many writers from Friedman onwards. But there seems to be widespread




                                                    6
evidence for LCP in at least in North American and Europe, as discussed in the introduction. On

the other hand, for developing economies, and especially high inflation economies, PPP seems to

hold more accurately in the sense that the nominal exchange rate is significantly more variable than

the real exchange rate (e.g. Obstfeld 1998). In addition, there is evidence that the link between

exchange rates and imported goods prices is much closer for some emerging market economies than

for the economies of the OECD (Takagi and Yoshida 1999).

         Betts and Devereux (2000a) develop a model where PCP and LCP coexist, as a fraction of

firms set their export prices in their own currency, while the rest set prices in consumers currency,

and the fraction can vary between zero and one. But incorporating this arrangement in our model

would mean sacrificing the ability to obtain exact solutions. Moreover, because we have essentially

identified either extreme of this continuum, this alternative approach would provide little extra

insight into the properties of exchange rate regimes or monetary policies.



Consumers

         The representative consumer in the home country is assumed to maximize

                                                           ∞            

where

                                                                               1− ε

                                      us =      C s1− ρ +                         − ηLs ,       ρ > 0, ε > 0 .

C is a consumption index that is a geometric average of home and foreign consumption9:

 This assumption is made so that monetary rules can be derived analytically. Qualitatively, it affects none of results.
To apply our model to the realistic design of optimal monetary policies, it would be necessary to introduce more
persistent price stickiness, as in Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), or Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (1997).
  All variables in this section are implicitly functions of the state of the world zt ∈ Ζ , where Z is a suitably defined
9                                                                                               t        t

set of all possible states at time t. To economize on space, we omit this state notation until we explicitly define the
stochastic processes governing money and productivity shocks in the next section.

                                                  n n (1 − n )1−n

We assume that there are n identical individuals in the home country, 0 < n < 1 .      Ch and Cf are

indexes over consumption of goods produced at home and in the foreign country, respectively (see

the Appendix for further details). The elasticity of substitution between goods produced within a

country is λ , where λ > 1. There is a unit elasticity of substitution between the home goods and

foreign goods indexes. M         are domestic real balances, and L is the labor supply of the
                             P

representative home agent.

        This is a special functional form for utility, but it has the appealing property that it allows us

to derive exact expressions for welfare across a range of alternative exchange rate regimes and

monetary policies. It is a slight variant of the specification used by OR (1998). While the

separability of the utility function may be problematic for analyzing some aspects of exchange-rate

and current-account dynamics, it is very helpful in making the model more tractable analytically.

Bacchetta and van Wincoop (1998) have emphasized (in a two-period framework) the importance

of non-separabilities of leisure and consumption for the impact of the choice of exchange-rate

regime on the volume of trade.

        The price index, P, is defined by

(1.1)                                           P = Phn Pf1−n ,

where Ph and Pf are price indexes for home and foreign goods, respectively.

                There are 1 − n identical individuals in the foreign country. Their preferences are

identical to those of the home country, except being functions of foreign real balances and foreign

labor supply.

        We assume that there are complete asset markets. Residents of each country can purchase a

full set of state-contingent nominal bonds. When the law of one price holds (as it does under the

                                                      8
PCP specification), consumption risk is completely shared, even without complete assets markets.10

But under the LCP specification, the law of one price does not hold. We consider the assumption of

complete asset markets to be one of convenience, which approximates the assumption of perfect

capital mobility, while ruling out dynamic effects of wealth redistribution, which in both a

quantitative and welfare sense are likely to be of second order importance.

        Consumers obtain wages Wt from working, receive profits from firms and transfers from

government, and get payments on state contingent bonds. They choose their holdings of money

balances, consumption, labor supply and bonds. The money demand equation for the representative

home-country resident is given by:

                                                               1   ρ

        The optimal trade-off between consumption and leisure implies:

                                              M t = M t −1 + Tt .

In the discussion below, we will be more specific about the form of the optimal monetary rules.

Firms

        Firms are monopolistic competitors. The production function for firm i is given by:

                                                Yit = θ t Lit ,

where Lit is employment of firm i at time t, and θ t represents a country-specific productivity shock.

The objective of the domestic firms is to set prices to maximize the expected utility of the owners.

Because there are complete markets, it does not matter whether the owners of firms are home or

foreign residents. But prices must be set before information about random money supplies and

productivity shocks is known.

        The optimization problem can be expressed as maximizing the expected present value of

profits using the market nominal discount factor for the owners of the firm. The solutions for

optimal pricing rules are given in Table 1.

        Under the PCP specification, firms choose a single price, in domestic currency, to maximize

the state-contingent value of profits. Take for instance the optimal price set by the home firm,

PhtiPCP = PhtPCP , given in the top left hand entry of Table 1. In a world of certainty, the price would

simply be a fixed mark-up over unit labor costs. Here, there is an additional mark-up arising from

the covariance of nominal wages with Ct1− ρ . The term represents a risk premium arising from the



                                                     10
covariance of the firm’s profits with the marginal utility of consumption.12 Specifically, the ex post

increase in costs from lowering prices by one unit is proportional to Pht−λ −1C tWt , while the increase

in revenue is proportional to Pht− λ C t . Then weighting each side by the discount rate for period t-1,

and equating in expectations, we arrive at the optimal price as given by the expression in Table 1.

           The law of one price holds for the price charged to foreigners by the home firm, Pht*PCP , in

the PCP model. Analogous relationships hold for the prices set by the foreign firms, Pft*PCP and

PftPCP .

           Under the LCP specification, the firm chooses two different prices – one to charge residents

of its own country, and one to charge residents of the other country. The price charged by the home

firm to the home residents is given by the same expression as in the PCP case. The price charged to

foreign residents, Pht*LCP is explained as follows. In selling to the foreign market, the firm calculates

that the ex post increase in costs from lowering prices by one unit is proportional to Pht*−λ −1Ct*Wt ,

while the increase in revenue is proportional to Pht*−λ Ct* S t . Weighting both sides by the marginal

utility of the home consumer, using the risk sharing rule (1.4), and equating, we obtain the

expression for Pht*LCP in Table 1. Note that with perfect certainty, the price would be set so that its

home currency value is a fixed mark-up over unit labor costs. Likewise, under LCP, the price

charged by foreign firms to its own residents is the same as under PCP, but the price charged to

home-country consumers is not.13

        Given equal consumption at home and abroad, the goods-market equilibrium condition in

the home country under PCP can be written as

                                                                Pt Ct

        With LCP the goods-market equilibrium in the home country is written as:

                                                       Pt C t          P *C *

        For suitably defined stochastic processes governing M t , M t* , θ t , and θ t* , the 13 functions

(of the state of the world) C , C * , Ph , Ph* , Pf , Pf* , P , P * , S , W , W * , L , and L* , are determined

by the 13 equations (1.1) and its foreign equivalent, (1.2) and its foreign equivalent, (1.3) and its

foreign equivalent, (1.4), (1.5) (under PCP) or (1.6) under LCP and its foreign equivalent, and the

four pricing equations from Table 1.


13
   OR (2000) have criticized the LCP assumption on the grounds that it contradicts some empirical regularities
concerning the terms of trade – that an appreciation of a country’s currency tends to be associated with an improvement
in its terms of trade. LCP pricing implies the opposite relationship. But Devereux, Engel and Tille (1999) show that the
LCP model is equivalent to one in which producers price in their own currency, but in which intermediaries set prices
for consumers in local currencies. That model predicts appreciations lead to improvements in the terms of trade.

2. Model Solution

        The economy is exposed to two types of disturbances; shocks to money supplies (nominal

shocks) and shocks to productivity (real shocks) 14. We let the productivity disturbances, θ t and θ t* ,

be governed by the following processes

                                                 ln θ t = δ ln θ t −1 + u t

                                                 ln θ t* = δ ln θ t*−1 + ut*

where 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1 , and u t and u t* are mean-zero i.i.d. normally distributed random variables.

        The log money supply for each economy is given by:

(2.1)                             mt = mt −1 + υ t + γ ( st − Et −1 st ) + a1ut + a2 ut*

(2.2)                                       mt* = mt*−1 + υ t* + b1u t* + b2 u t

These monetary rules allow for the authorities to react directly to productivity shocks arising from

either country. In addition, (2.1) allows the home country to choose a feedback intervention rule for

adjusting money to movements in the exchange rate. When γ < 0 , this rule displays ‘leaning

against the wind’. For given values of a1 and a 2 , the value of γ defines the exchange rate regime.

When γ=0, we say that the exchange regime is a free float, while as γ → −∞ , the feedback rule

prevents the exchange rate from adjusting at all, so that we have a fixed exchange rate regime. The

υ t and υ t* terms represent uncontrollable mean-zero i.i.d. normally distributed disturbances to the

supply of money15.

        Because all shocks are log-normal, the solution of the model will take on a log-normal

distribution. From section 1, all equations save for (1.2) are log-linear, and therefore, in the


14
   We ignore shocks to government spending. Since utility is linear in labor effort in this economy, government
spending shocks have no effect on consumption. There is therefore no role for monetary policy in responding to
government spending shocks.
15
   These might be thought of as shocks resulting from financial innovation. They are also formally equivalent to
velocity disturbances in the solution of the model.

                                                            13
presence of log-normal distributions, offer exact solutions. But the money market equilibrium

conditions in each country require an approximation. Following OR (1998), the appendix shows

that the following approximation can be employed to represent an equilibrium in the home country

money market.

                                      ρ      1

                                      ε     iε

where Γm is a constant. An analogous condition may be derived for the foreign country. The

accuracy of this approximation may be gauged by the extent to which the parameter ε deviates from

unity. It is shown in Devereux and Engel (1998) that in the case ε=1, the money market clearing

equation may be solved exactly, and thus, (2.3) involves no approximation.


The Flexible Price Solution

        To get a perspective on the effect of price rigidities and to understand the motivation for

optimal monetary rules, it is useful to see the solution to the model in an environment of fully

flexible prices. With flexible prices, the profit maximizing price rules obtain in each state of the

world, and not just in expectation. We may then establish that

                                                              1

                                                                  (θ                    )
                                                              ρ                             1
(2.4)                                  Ct =                            θ t*(1− n )
                                                                         n                  ρ

                                                                        t




        Consumption is unaffected by money shocks, but depends positively on both home and

foreign productivity shocks. Employment in each country is also equated in the flexible price

economy:

                                                          1

                                                              (θ    n
                                                                       θ t*(1− n)   )   ρ       .
                                             λ −1
                                                                   t




Finally the terms of trade under flexible prices are given by:




                                                      14

                                                   St Pft θ t

        A nice feature arising from the log-normality of shocks is that we can easily express

expected utility of consumption in terms of the mean of consumption and the variance of the log of

consumption:

                                                                  ρ (1 − ρ ) 2
(2.5)                             EC 1− ρ = ( EC )1− ρ exp( −               σc ).
                                                                      2

Since expected labor supply will be a linear function of EC 1− ρ , it turns out that to understand

optimal policy it is sufficient to understand the effects of policies on the mean and variance of

consumption.

        The Appendix gives the solution for the variance and the conditional expectation of

consumption with flexible prices. Consumption variance is positively related to the variance of

productivity shocks. Expected (conditional) consumption is increasing in the variance of (log)

consumption.

Producer-Currency Pricing

        Under producer currency pricing, we may obtain an explicit solution for the exchange rate

                                              (a1 − b2 )     (a − b )  (υ − υt* )

        If the feedback rules on productivity shocks are identical across countries, then the exchange

rate will be independent of productivity shocks. As the degree of exchange rate intervention rises

(i.e. γ → −∞ ), the influence of all shocks on the exchange rate diminishes. We can show (see the

Appendix) that

                                                                φn       φ (1 − γ − n) *

           Unlike the flexible price solution, consumption may be either increasing or decreasing in

productivity shocks, in the absence of monetary rules that target these shocks. When a persistent

(i.e. δ > 0 ) positive technology shock occurs, it raises expected future consumption, and reduces

expected future prices. With ε > 1 , the rise in expected future consumption dominates the fall in

expected future prices, so the nominal interest rate rises . Then there is present period excess supply

of real money balances, which with sticky prices, increases current consumption. On the other

hand, when ε < 1 , a productivity shocks leads the nominal interest rate to fall, and therefore current

consumption falls.

           Consumption is increasing in shocks to the money supply of both countries. As shown in

OR (1995), a foreign monetary expansion will lead to a home country appreciation, a fall in the

price level, and an expansion in real balances. As a result, consumption will rise. A home money

expansion on the other hand will directly increase consumption, but part of that is dissipated by an

exchange rate depreciation. So consumption rises by less than proportionally to the monetary

expansion. Intuitively, the greater is the degree of foreign exchange rate intervention (the more

negative is γ), the smaller will be the impact of home monetary shocks on consumption.

           With sticky prices, the expected level of consumption takes on the form

where Φ (t − 1) is a function of last period productivity shocks, and σ~u2 = nσ u2 + (1 − n)σ u2* ,

σ~cu = nσ cu + (1 − n )σ cu* . Expected consumption depends upon consumption variance, exchange

rate variance, the variance of productivity shocks, and covariance terms.

          Expected consumption is increasing (decreasing) in consumption volatility as ρ > 1 ,

( ρ < 1 ). It is always decreasing in exchange rate volatility, and for given consumption and

exchange rate volatility, expected consumption is decreasing in the variance of technology shocks.

To see the relationship between consumption volatility and expected consumption, note that from

equation (1.3), the wage is proportional to C ρ . If ρ > 1 , this means that the wage is negatively

correlated with the firm’s marginal utility-discounted demand, C 1− ρ . Therefore, given the price

setting problem facing the firm, the price will be lower the higher is the variance of consumption,

when ρ > 1 . But a lower price implies a higher expected consumption.

          Higher exchange rate volatility increases expected marginal costs directly, since when there

is full pass-through of exchange rates to domestic prices, the CPI’s and therefore wages will be

affected by exchange rate volatility. From the pricing equations in Table 1, it can be shown that

higher exchange rate variance raises average prices and leading to lower expected consumption. In

this sense the model implies a pure welfare cost of exchange rate volatility. In the presence of

nominal rigidities and optimal pricing, exchange rate volatility leads to higher average prices. Of

course this welfare effect of exchange rate volatility arises because of nominal price rigidities.

When prices are fully flexible, there is no effect of exchange rate volatility on the average level of

prices.

    To compute welfare, we will need to evaluate expected employment. Under PCP expected

employment is

                                                   (λ − 1) Et −1C t1− ρ

                                                         λη

Expected employment for the foreign country is identical to (2.9).

Local-Currency Pricing

         Under local-currency pricing, PPP will not generally hold. Thus, home and foreign

consumption will differ. We may combine the pricing equations, the money supply rules (equations

(2.1) and (2.2)) and the money-market clearing condition (2.3) to obtain the value of expected home

country consumption:

                                                                   1           γρφ *

                                                                1 − φγρ      1 − φγρ

where Ω1 = φ  1             + ψn and Ω 2 = φ  2             + ψ (1 − n) .
               (1 − γφρ )                        (1 − γφρ ) 

         Home country consumption is affected by both home and foreign productivity shocks, both

because home money responds to productivity shocks in both countries, and because nominal

interest rates are influenced by persistent productivity shocks. But foreign money shocks affect

home consumption only due to the exchange rate intervention undertaken by the home country. In

the absence of intervention, home consumption would be unaffected by foreign money shocks,

since these shocks do not pass through to domestic goods prices under LCP.

         In the same way, we may establish that foreign country consumption is

(2.11)                                ct* = Et −1ct* + Ω *2 u t + Ω1*u t* + φυ t*

where Ω1* = φb1 + ψ (1 − n) , and Ω*2 = φb2 + ψn . Foreign consumption is unaffected by home

country money shocks, under LCP.

         The solution for expected (home country) consumption under LCP is derived in the

Appendix as:

                                          (1 − ρ )σ c2 σ~u2 σ~cu 

         Unlike (2.8), this does not depend on the distribution of the exchange rate. Without

exchange rate pass-through, wages are not directly affected by exchange rates. Therefore, average

                                                         18
prices and expected consumption are unaffected by exchange rate volatility. Expected consumption

for the foreign country is symmetric to equation (2.12).

         Expected employment in the LCP specification is determined by using equation (1.6) above.

Again, expected employment is identical for home and foreign countries, and given by:

                                      n(λ − 1) Et −1Ct1− ρ (1 − n)(λ − 1) Et −1Ct*(1− ρ )

3. Optimal Monetary Policies

         We now investigate the optimal choice of monetary policy. Home and foreign governments

choose monetary policy rules to maximize welfare for their domestic residents. Due to the one-

period ahead pricing policies of firms, and the presence of complete markets, the equilibrium is

stationary. Optimal monetary policies are obtained by maximizing expected utility for any period.

         From a welfare perspective, the utility of real balances is likely to be of minor significance.

Hence, following OR (1995, 1998) and Corsetti and Pesenti (1998), we ignore this term. Expected

utility may be represented as

                                                       Et −1Ct1− ρ
(3.1)                                     Et −1U t =               − ηEt −1Lt
                                                       (1 − ρ )

         The choice of monetary policy rules may be represented as a game between home and

foreign governments. The home government chooses the degree of foreign exchange rate

intervention γ and its response to home and foreign productivity shocks, taking the monetary rule of

the foreign country government as given. The foreign government chooses its response to home

and foreign productivity shocks, taking the home country monetary rule as given. The pair of

monetary rules that satisfy these conditions form a Nash equilibrium of the monetary policy game.

3.a Producer Currency Pricing

        Under producer currency pricing, consumption and expected employment are identical in

the home and the foreign country, so that both governments will face the same objective function.

Using (2.5), (2.8) and (3.1), we may write common expected utility as


                                    (Et −1Ct )1− ρ exp(− ρ (1 − ρ ) σ c2 )  λ − (1 − ρ )(λ − 1) 
(3.2)                  Et −1U t =                               2                              
                                                    (1 − ρ )                       λ           

   Using the expressions for the mean and variance of consumption from the Appendix, the

objective function under PCP can be written as

                                          σ c2 n(1 − n) 2 σ~u2 σ~cu           (σ − σ su* )
(3.3)         Et −1U t = Θt exp(1 − ρ )(−     −        σs −    +    + n(1 − n) su          )
                                           2     2ρ         2ρ   ρ                ρ

                                     1− ρ
             λη nδ *(1−n )δ         ρ      λ − (1 − ρ )(λ − 1) 
where Θ t =       θ t −1θ t −1                                 .
             λ −1                               λ (1 − ρ )      

        Equation (3.3) indicates that the objective function of the monetary authority under PCP is

represented in a very simple form; minimize a linear function of consumption variance, exchange

rate variance, and the covariance of consumption and the exchange rate with home and foreign

productivity shocks. Given the simple assumptions of our model, the objective function for

monetary policy becomes a quadratic, as in much of the earlier literature on optimal monetary rules

based on more ad-hoc models and objective functions. The appeal of the present model however is

that it delivers the appropriate welfare-based set of variables to be included in the objective

function, and their relative weighting. Note also that monetary policy should explicitly take account

of its effect on average consumption (and output). A Taylor series approximation to (3.2) around a

constant average consumption level would lead us to conclude that minimizing consumption alone

was the best objective for monetary policy; exchange rate variance and the covariance’s with

productivity shocks would be ignored.


                                                               20
         Given the dependence of consumption and the exchange rate on the monetary rules, we may

implicitly write expected utility as: EU = EU (γ , a1 , a 2 , b1 , b2 ) .

         A Nash equilibrium in monetary policies is defined as the set {γ N , a1N , a 2N , b1N , b2N } which

satisfies the problem Ρ1,

                      Max                                                Max
P1                                EU (γ , a1 , a 2 , b1N , b2N )                   EU (γ N , a1N , a 2N , b1 , b2 )
                   γ , a1 , a 2                                          b1 , b2

         Both countries face the same objective function. So in fact it is clear that the solution to Ρ1

is identical to the equilibrium of a cooperative monetary policy game, where the governments of

both countries jointly choose the monetary rules to maximize joint welfare. Therefore, in the PCP

environment, there are no gains to monetary policy coordination16.

         We characterize the solution to Ρ1 in two stages. First, we describe the solution for the

monetary rules when there are only productivity shocks, holding the home country intervention rule

γ fixed. Then, we solve for the optimal intervention rule in the presence of monetary shocks.

Productivity Shocks

         The values of a1 , a 2 , b1 , b2 that satisfy Ρ1 are given by

                                            ni(ε − 1)                              (1 − n)i (ε − 1)
(3.4)                    a1 = 1 − γ −                                   a2 = γ −
                                          (1 + iε − δ )                             (1 + iε − δ )



                                     (1 − n)i (ε − 1)                                ni (ε − 1)

                                      (1 + iε − δ )                                (1 + iε − δ )

         For the foreign country government, the optimal monetary rule is to respond positively to

foreign productivity shocks, but respond negatively (positively) to home country productivity

shocks as ε > 1 ( ε < 1 ). For the home country government, the optimal response to productivity


16
  If we had allowed discretionary monetary policy rather than a system of rules as in (2.1) and (2.2), policy
coordination would make a difference - see Betts and Devereux (2000b).

                                                                   21
shocks depends on the degree of foreign exchange market intervention. With zero intervention, the

rule is the mirror image of the foreign rule: respond positively to home country shocks and either

negatively or positively to foreign shocks, depending on ε. But when there is positive exchange rate

intervention, the response to productivity shocks for the home country may be in the opposite

direction.

        Monetary authorities attempt to use the rules (3.4) and (3.5) to sustain the flexible price

allocation. Essentially, the economy has three departures from full efficiency. Prices are sticky, so

consumption and employment do not respond to money and productivity shocks as they would in a

flexible price environment. There are monopolistic competitive markups. Finally, there is a

departure from the Friedman rule of zero nominal interest rates. The second loss cannot be

affected by the monetary rules (2.1) and (2.2), since these rules cannot influence the markups

obtained in Table 1.17 The third loss is neglected from the analysis because we ignore the utility of

real balances. Thus, the best that the monetary policy rules can do is to attempt to replicate the

flexible price equilibrium.18

        To attain the flexible price allocation, the authorities must ensure that consumption equals

(2.4). This requires that in the aggregate, monetary policy should react in a pro-cyclical manner to

productivity shocks19. Take the case where there is only a home country productivity shock. Then

                                                                           (1 + i − δ )
in face of a u shock, if the world money supply responds by n                           , consumption variance is
                                                                          (1 + iε − δ )

the same as in the flexible price equilibrium. But expected consumption would not necessarily be at

its desired level. For instance, if both home and foreign monetary authorities reacted in the

17
   Although monetary policy rules do influence expected output levels in our model, they cannot eliminate the distortion
from imperfect competition, because the markup depends only on constant elasticities. Gali and Monacelli (1999) show
that the welfare impact of deviations from competitive pricing can be eliminated by a production subsidy to firms that
operates independently of monetary policy. In our analysis, it is easy to show that an equivalent optimal production
subsidy exists. But this does not affect any of our conclusions below.
18
   Similar observations in a related model have been made by OR (2000).

exchange rate would have zero variance. From (2.8) however, expected consumption would then be

too low. In order to achieve the desired level of expected consumption, it is necessary that the

exchange rate responds positively to u shocks. This is facilitated by the monetary rules (3.4) and

(3.5), which ensure that the home country money supply response is positive and exceeds that of the

foreign country.

         An alternative intuition on the role of exchange rate changes may be described in terms of

the movements in employment. In order to achieve the optimal employment response in the home

and foreign economy, it is necessary to alter world relative prices, through movements in the

nominal exchange rate. In response to a home country productivity shock, the nominal exchange

rate must depreciate, to ensure world demand is substituted towards the home country’s products.

For this, it is necessary that the home country monetary reaction to a home productivity shock is

positive and exceeds that of the foreign country. Optimal monetary policy therefore relies on the

expenditure switching mechanism of the exchange rate under the PCP pricing regime. The

exchange rate movement in fact replicates the required terms of trade movement that would take

place under fully flexible prices20.

         It is easy to establish that with the monetary rules given in (3.4) and (3.5), the equilibrium

under PCP replicates the flexible price allocation under productivity shocks alone. This can be

shown by substituting (3.4) and (3.5) into (2.7) and deriving the expression for expected utility (3.2)

with the optimal monetary rules, when υ = υ* = 0 . An immediate implication of this is that

exchange rate flexibility is a requirement for an optimal monetary policy rule, under PCP, in the


19
   Note the even if γ is sufficiently positive that a1 is negative, the overall money supply will still be increasing in u
shocks.
20
   The objective function (3.2) does not contain employment. But from (1.5) and (2.7) it may be established that there is
an equivalence between using monetary rules to achieve the desired mean and variance of consumption and achieving
the desired mean and variance of national employment levels.

                                                           23
presence of productivity shocks. The optimal monetary policy is one that must not only ensure that

distribution of consumption is identical to that under flexible nominal prices, but also that the

distribution of the exchange rate is identical to that of the terms of trade under flexible prices.

Exchange rate adjustment is necessary to achieve the desired terms of trade adjustment. This is the

essence of Friedman’s argument for floating exchange rates quoted in the introduction.

        A critical aspect of the optimal monetary rules given in (3.4) and (3.5) is that they require

participation by both monetary authorities. It is interesting to contrast problem P1 with an

alternative case, where only the home monetary authority chooses optimal feedback rules, assuming

that the foreign monetary authority follows a purely passive monetary policy, where bi=0, i =1,2.

Problem P2 is thus defined as

                                            Max
P2                                                      EU (γ , a1 , a 2 ,0,0)
                                         γ , a1 , a 2

The optimal rules for a1 and a 2 are now given by

                      (φn + (1 − n) − ψnρφ )                          (1 − n)(φ − 1 − ψρφ )
(3.6)          a1 =                          (1 − γ )          a2 =                         (1 − γ )
                        ((1 − n) + φ 2 ρn)                              ((1 − n) + φ 2 ρn)

        It can easily be established that a1 is consistent with the solution for P1 only when ε = 1 ,

and a 2 is in general never consistent with the solution for P1. A policy maker optimizing alone

cannot support the flexible price allocation. Take the case where ε > 1 . Under problem P1, the

home monetary authority will expand money supply in response to a home country productivity

shock, while the foreign authority will contract money supply. This achieves the right combination

of increasing world demand and exchange rate depreciation. But with problem P2, the rule given

by (3.4) would entail too high a response in consumption, since the foreign government does not

respond to the disturbance. The optimal rule under P2 is to respond to domestic productivity shocks

less than is indicated in rule (3.4). Consumption still rises by too much, while the exchange rate

rises by too little, relative to P1. Also, in response to a foreign technology shock, the home
                                                          24
government cannot adequately respond. The reason is that the desire to increase domestic

consumption calls for a monetary expansion ( a 2 > 0 ), but the desire to generate a terms of trade

improvement calls for a monetary contraction ( a 2 < 0 ). The optimal a 2 may therefore be either

positive or negative.

Monetary Shocks

        Given optimal choices ai , the home country government chooses the degree of exchange

rate intervention according to P1. From (2.6), we see that the optimal intervention rule is that which

minimizes the following function of consumption variability and exchange rate variability:

                                                  σ c2           σ2

The optimal intervention rule is given by

                                             σ v2                  1         σ v2
(3.7)                                 γ =−         + (1 − n )(1 −      )(1 +       )
                                             σ v2*                ρφ 2       σ v2*

The rule depends solely on monetary variability. It is independent of the distribution of real

shocks.21 The optimal intervention depends on the strength of home country monetary variability

relative to foreign monetary variability. When foreign monetary variability tends to zero, γ tends to

negative infinity; i.e. the exchange rate is prevented from moving at all in response to monetary

disturbances. This supports the traditional result that a fixed exchange rate regime is optimal when

the only shocks arise from the domestic monetary sector. One might think then that a floating

exchange rate ( γ = 0 ) would be preferable when home country monetary variability becomes

arbitrarily small. But in fact we see that as home country monetary variance gets arbitrarily small,

the intervention coefficient approaches a limit of


21
  This property that the intervention rule is independent of the distribution of supply shocks will remain even if the
authorities do not target supply shocks at all. If monetary rules (3.4) and (3.5) did not contain a response to supply
shocks, the exchange rate would be independent of supply shocks. Therefore, the degree of exchange rate intervention
could not alter the economy’s response to supply shocks.

                                                                 ρφ 2

The optimal intervention in face of foreign monetary shocks will lie between a fixed exchange rate

and a free float, when ρφ 2 > 1 .

       The reason that a free float is not in general desirable is that the authorities are not trying to

minimize consumption variance only, but are also concerned with exchange rate variance. Floating

exchange rates would tend to minimize the extent to which foreign monetary disturbances

contribute to consumption variance, but would leave exchange rate variance too high. Excessive

exchange rate variance has a welfare cost through the reduction in expected consumption. An

optimal intervention rule will trade off the benefits of exchange rate adjustment in reducing

consumption variance against the welfare costs of exchange rate variability itself.


3.b Local Currency Pricing

Under LCP, home and foreign consumption are not equated, because the real exchange rate is no

longer constant. This implies that the objective functions for home and foreign governments will

differ. For the home government, the objective function depends on expected consumption,

consumption variance, and expected employment. Substituting (2.13) into expected utility given in

(3.1), gives

                                           λ − n (λ − 1)(1 − ρ )  (1 − n )( λ − 1)
                 Et −1U t = Et −1C t1− ρ                         −               Et −1C t*(1− ρ )
                                                λ (1 − ρ )               λ

In a symmetric fashion, foreign country expected utility equals:

                                             λ − n( λ − 1)(1 − ρ )  (1 − n )(λ − 1)
                 Et −1U t* = Et −1C t*1− ρ                         −              Et −1Ct(1− ρ )
                                                  λ (1 − ρ )               λ

These functions may again be decomposed into means and variances of consumption. Then

substituting for these values from the Appendix, we can establish:


                                                         26
                                                   1− ρ                        σ c2 σ~u2 σ~cu
(3.8)                                    Et −1Ct            ∝ exp((1 − ρ )(−       −    +     )
                                                                                2 2ρ      ρ

                                                 *(1− ρ )                      σ c2* σ~u2 σ~c*u
(3.9)                                  Et −1Ct              ∝ exp((1 − ρ )(−        −    +      )
                                                                                2 2ρ        ρ

The optimal monetary rule with LCP requires policymakers to target a combination of two separate

functions of consumption variance and the covariance between consumption and productivity

shocks. But because under LCP, foreign consumption is independent of the parameters of the home

country monetary rule, the home country problem amounts to simply minimizing the expression:

                                         σ c2 σ~u2 σ~cu
                                             +    −     .
                                          2 2ρ      ρ

An essential difference from the PCP case is that exchange rate volatility is no longer an

independent argument in the objective function.22

         The determination of monetary rules in the LCP case can be described as the Nash

equilibrium {γ N , a1N , a 2N , b1N , b2N }

                    Max                                                   Max
Ρ3                              EU (γ , a1 , a 2 , b1N , b2N )                      EU * (γ N , a1N , a 2N , b1 , b2 )
                 γ , a1 , a 2                                             b1 , b2

Again, we characterize the solution to P3 first in the presence of productivity shocks, and then we

allow for monetary shocks and optimal intervention.

Productivity Shocks

         The solution to P3, holding γ constant, is given by

                                           (1 + i − δ )                                  (1 + i − δ )
(3.10)                           a1 = n                                 a 2 = (1 − n)
                                          (1 + iε − δ )                                 (1 + iε − δ )




22
   The parameters of the foreign country’s money rule do enter into home country consumption as long as home engages
in some exchange rate intervention. But in the first order conditions for the choice of the optimal policy rule for the
foreign country, envelope conditions imply that this dependence is ignored.

                                                                     27
(3.11)                               b1 = a 2                          b2 = a1



           Again, as in the case of PCP, these rules ensure that consumption is identical across

countries, and has the same variance as in the flexible price equilibrium. But unlike the case of

PCP, these rules do not entail exchange rate adjustment. Each government responds in an identical

way to a home or foreign productivity shock. The optimal monetary rules are consistent with a

fixed exchange rate.23

           The reason that optimal monetary rules do not require exchange rate adjustment in the LCP

case is that the exchange rate plays no role in determining expected consumption. Exchange rate

changes do not pass-through to price levels and therefore do not influence wages. Thus, they do not

influence either marginal costs or expected prices and expected consumption.

           An equivalent perspective on the monetary rules (3.10) and (3.11) is that in the LCP case,

exchange rate adjustment does not play a role in altering patterns of expenditure between home and

foreign goods. Therefore, it cannot influence the determination of employment in either country.

Optimal monetary policy no longer tries to move the exchange rate so as to achieve an optimal

terms of trade adjustment, since the terms of trade do not influence demand or employment.

           The absence of exchange rate movement in the optimal rules in the LCP environment is at

variance with the Friedman/Mundell argument for exchange rate flexibility, and more generally

with the conventional statement of the costs of a single currency area. In the conventional

argument, countries that are subject to idiosyncratic real shocks will benefit from exchange rate

adjustment in face of these shocks. This argument is borne out in the PCP case. But with LCP,

even country-specific shocks do not require exchange rate movement as part of an optimal policy

response. Thus, even in the presence of distinct country specific real disturbances, there is no



23
     Equation (A.17) of the appendix gives the exchange rate equation under LCP.

                                                           28
sacrifice of macroeconomic adjustment by eliminating the exchange rate as a tool of

macroeconomic management (when the predominant disturbances are country specific productivity

shocks), if we take the institutional structure of goods pricing as given.

         Although optimal monetary policy under LCP does not require exchange rate adjustment, a

natural guess would be that the absence of exchange rate pass-through comes at a cost. This is

correct. The optimal monetary policy under LCP does not support the full flexible price optimum.

While the monetary rules (3.10) and (3.11) keep the response of home and foreign consumption

equal to that at the flexible price optimum, they cannot ensure that employment in each country is

identical to the flexible price optimum. Equivalently, the monetary rules lead consumption variance

to match the flexible price equilibrium, but the mean level of consumption falls short of the flexible

price equilibrium. Thus, the presence of LCP imposes welfare costs on the world as a whole, by

preventing terms of trade adjustment from having macroeconomic effects.

         Problem P3 describes an environment where both domestic and foreign governments choose

an optimal response to productivity shocks. What happens when the home country alone chooses

an optimal monetary policy, assuming that the foreign government follows a purely passive

monetary growth rule? Defining a choice for the home country government analogous to P2 gives

optimal monetary rules equal to:

                            (1 + i − δ )                                (1 + i − δ )
(3.12)            a1 = n                 (1 − γφρ )    a 2 = (1 − n)                 (1 − γφρ )
                           (1 + iε − δ )                               (1 + iε − δ )

Examining (3.12) allows us to establish that the home country consumption variance is identical to

problem P3. But the foreign country consumption variance is not the same as under P3. Thus, as

regards home country consumption, the home country government, acting alone, can do as well as it

can when the foreign government also chooses optimal monetary policy. Unlike the PCP case,

there is no alteration in the policy rules when governments act alone – the optimal rules support the

same consumption process for the home government. Of course, because expected utility does

                                                      29
depend upon both home and foreign consumption, overall welfare must be lower when the foreign

country government does not follow an optimal rule.


Monetary Shocks

       Under LCP, the government’s choice of exchange rate intervention is designed simply to

minimize the variance of consumption. The optimal exchange rate intervention rule is given by

                                                    σ v2
                                            γ =−
                                                   ρφσ v2*

Again, the rule trades off the benefit of a fixed exchange rate, insulating the economy from

domestic monetary shocks, against the benefits of exchange rate adjustment, cushioning the

economy from foreign monetary disturbances. Unlike the rule under PCP, the intervention rule

under LCP will vary between fully fixed exchange rates to fully floating exchange rates, as the

importance of home and foreign monetary disturbances change in relative terms. In particular, if

there are no home monetary shocks at all, then the monetary authority should follow a clean float.

This is because, unlike the PCP case, there are no independent costs of exchange rate volatility

under LCP. The optimal intervention rule does not have to take account of the way in which

intervention affects exchange rate volatility. When there are only foreign monetary disturbances, a

floating exchange rate achieves the maximum insulation of home country consumption from the

effects of the shocks.

       When productivity shocks dominate, we have shown that welfare under LCP must be lower

than that under PCP. But the same result does not apply in the case of money shocks. A simple

example may be used to illustrate this. Say that the variance of productivity shocks is zero in both

countries, and that money shocks have identical variance equal to σ v2 in both countries. Finally,

imagine that the home country follows a zero exchange rate intervention rule (this is easily relaxed

– see below). Then in the PCP case, expected utility is a positive function of

                                                 30
            σ c2 n(1 − n)σ s2    φ 2 (n 2 + (1 − n) 2 )σ v2 n(1 − n)σ v2
        −       −             =−                           −
             2       2ρ                      2                   ρ

Under the same conditions, expected utility under LCP is a positive function of

          σ c2     φ 2σ           2
        −      = −                v
           2          2

From these two expressions, we see that the welfare comparison between PCP and LCP contains

two elements. On the one hand, consumption variance is lower under PCP, because part of a

monetary shock is dissipated through exchange rate adjustment. On the other hand, the exchange

rate volatility driven by money shocks imparts a welfare cost under PCP, but does not under LCP.

Expected utility is higher under LCP (PCP) whenever φ 2 ρ > 1 (<1). In general, either inequality

may be satisfied. Therefore, the welfare comparison across the two pricing specifications is

ambiguous; the adjustment benefits of the exchange rate in response to monetary shocks are

tempered by the welfare costs of exchange rate volatility.



 4. Conclusions

       The optimal response of monetary policy to exchange rates is an old theme in open-

economy macroeconomics. The novel aspect of this paper is that the analysis is undertaken within

an expected-utility-maximizing framework in the presence of nominal rigidity. We find that the

optimal monetary policy depends in a fundamental way on the type of price stickiness. Traditional

studies have assumed prices are fully preset in the currency of the producer, so that exchange rate

changes “pass through” one hundred percent to consumer prices. This modeling contrasts with the

recent empirical evidence suggesting very small short-run responses of consumer prices to

exchange-rate changes. When prices are not very responsive to exchange rates, monetary policy-

makers cannot rely on the exchange rate to provide the necessary adjustment to real shocks. To the

extent that consumers do not interpret exchange-rate changes as relative price changes in the short

                                                         31
run, monetary policy can only achieve an inferior outcome in which it is unable to control the

relative demand for domestic and foreign goods. The benefits of floating exchange rates are

diminished in the absence of strong expenditure-switching effects.

       There is a new literature on open-economy monetary policy-making, based on models in

which agents optimize. McCallum and Nelson (1999) and Svensson (2000) exemplify this recent

work, which builds on the earlier work by Rotemberg and Woodford (1997). These models are, in

many ways, more sophisticated than the model of this paper. In those models, prices adjust only

slowly over time, while here prices adjust fully after one period. They allow for investment

dynamics, while our model has ignored the role of investment in short-run macroeconomic

dynamics. But in our model, firms’ objectives are clearly integrated with the objectives of the firm

owners. We allow for deviations from the law of one price, in contrast to this new literature. And,

we do not take linear approximations around the steady state in solving the model. If we were to

follow the techniques of this recent literature, we would lose the important insights about the effects

of monetary policy on the expected levels of consumption and employment. Clearly a challenge for

the future is to merge the best elements of the literature generated by OR (1995, 1998) with the

research program initiated by Rotemberg and Woodford (1997).

       Finally, our modeling strategy follows the recent literature in taking the currency of price

setting as exogenous. A more sophisticated model would endogenize that choice. The choice of

currency to set prices in may not be independent of the monetary policy regime. Devereux, Engel

and Tille (1999) and Tille (2000) have enriched the current framework by introducing middlemen

that buy from producers at prices set in the producers’ currencies, and sell to consumers at prices set

in consumers’ currencies. We have noted that this model is equivalent to the one presented here

under complete financial markets. When asset markets are less fully developed, the structure of the

marketing and distribution scheme may depend on monetary and exchange rate regimes. The



                                                  32
interaction between price setting and monetary policy is likely to be a fruitful area for future

research into our understanding of optimal monetary policy in open economies.

Firms

        The optimization problem can be expressed as maximizing the expected present value of profits

using the market nominal discount factor for the owners of the firm. Given that there is no

intertemporal aspect to the firms’ optimization problems (see, Obstfeld and Rogoff (1998)), this

reduces to maximizing in the PCP case:

                                                                    [ (                                      )]
                                 nEt −1 [d tπ t (i )] = Et −1 d t ( Pht (i ) − Wt )( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i )) ,

where X ht (i ) = nC ht (i ) is total sales of firm i to home residents and X ht* (i ) = (1 − n )C ht* (i ) is total sales

to foreign residents.



                                                                           1
        In the LCP model, the firm chooses two different prices – one to charge residents of its own

country, and one to charge residents of the other country. The typical home firm maximizes:

                           [ (                                                                               )]
                      Et −1 d t −1 Pht (i ) X ht (i ) + S t Pht* (i) X ht* (i ) − Wt ( X ht (i ) + X ht* (i )) .



        Optimal prices in both cases are presented in Table 1 in the text.

Money Demand Approximation


The money market equilibrium condition (1.2) may be approximated by first writing (1.2) as:


                                                           ε
                                                    P     ρ            PC ρ

                                                    Mt                Pt +1C t +1


The right hand side may be expressed as


                       Pt Ctρ                                      σp         2
                                                                                         2 σc
                                                                                             2
(A.2)           βEt               = β exp( p   + ρc   − E  p
                                                          t t +1 +    − ρE     c
                                                                           t −1 t +1 + ρ       − ρσ cp )
                      Pt +1C tρ+1

                                                                    2                       2


The left-hand side of (A.1) may be approximated around a steady state where the nominal interest rate

                             Pt C tρ      1
is constant, so that βEt            ρ
                                       =      . This gives
                            Pt +1C t +1 1 + i

                                      ρ   1
                             Pt ε ε           1                                       i
(A.3)              ln(1 −       Ct χ ) ≈ ln(      ) + i(ε (mt − pt ) − ρct ) + i ln(     χ −1 )
                             Mt              1+ i                                    1+i



Equating the log of (A.2) and (A.3) gives the money market clearing condition (2.3) of the text.




                                                                   2
Solution for PCP Specification

        Under PCP, there is full PPP at all times, so we have Pt = S t Pt* and C t = C t* . By subtracting

the foreign country money market clearing condition from the home condition, using PPP and the

assumption of random walk money supply, we may derive a solution for the exchange rate given by

(A.4)                                            st = Γs + mt − mt* ,

where Γs is a constant.

        Now from (1.3) (and its foreign equivalent), and the pricing equations in Table 1, we may write

implicitly the equation which determines the period t-1 expected value of consumption as

                                                                n                    1−n
                                                       1−n  
                                                                             −n
                                                                                    
                                          Et −1  C t S t    Et −1  Ct S t     
                                                 θ                   θ*       
                                   λ                  t              t        
(A.5)                          1=      η                            1− ρ
                                  λ −1                     Et −1 (C t )

Now using (A.4) and (A.5), imposing the fact that the solution for consumption and the exchange rate

will be log-normal, and taking logs, we may solve for the value of expected consumption as



                        1     λη     (2 − ρ ) 2 n (1 − n ) 2    ( n ln θ t −1 + (1 − n ) ln θ t*−1 )
             Et −1ct = − ln(      )−         σc −         σs +δ
                        ρ    λ −1       2          2ρ                            ρ
(A.6)
                        ( nσ u2 + (1 − n )σ u2* ) ( nσ cu + (1 − n )σ cu* )            (σ − σ su* )
                    −                            +                          + n(1 − n ) su
                                  2ρ                         ρ                             ρ



        Now combine the home and foreign money market equilibrium conditions to obtain the

equation:

                          ~ −~   ρ    ρ                    1

                                                                pt +1 − ~
                                                                        pt ) + Γm
                                 ε    iε                  iε
                           t




                                                           3
where Γm is a constant, and ~                            ~ = nm + (1 − n)m * . Using (A6), taking
                            pt = np ht + (1 − n) p *ft , mt    t          t



expectations dated period t-1, and solving for ~
                                               pt gives:


(A.8)                      ~           ~ − δ (1 + i − δ ) (n ln θ + (1 − n) ln θ * )
                           pt = − Γm + m t −1                    t −1           t −1
                                              (1 + iε − δ )

Using (A.7) and (A.8), we may solve for time t consumption as :

(A.9)                                             ~ −m
                                ct = Et −1ct + φ (m  ~ ) + ψ (nu + (1 − n)u * )
                                                   t   t −1     t           t


where

                                   (1 + iε )                            δi(ε − 1)
                              φ=                  and       ψ=                            .
                                   ρ (1 + i )                     ρ (1 + i )(1 + iε − δ )



         Now assume that governments follow the following monetary rules given in equations (2.1)

and (2.2). Substituting these two equations into (A.4), we obtain the solution for the exchange rate

given by equation (2.6).

         Substituting (2.1) and (2.2) in (A.9), using the exchange rate solution (A.10), we obtain the

solution for consumption given in equation (2.7).

         The variance of the log of consumption can be calculated from equation (2.7) and is reported in

Table A1. We can obtain the expected level of consumption by using the relationship

(A.10)                                     Et −1Ct = exp( Et −1ct + 12 σ c2 )

and using equation (A.6). Equation (2.8) gives expected consumption.

         To evaluate welfare, we must compute expected utility, including expected utility from

employment. Employment for the home country may be written as in equation (1.5). Using the

pricing equation from Table 1, we may write expected employment as in equation (2.9). Substituting

this into expected utility gives equation (3.2).

Using the expression for Et −1ct in (A.6) and for σ c2 from Table A1, we can derive equation (3.3).



Solution for the LCP specification

         Under the LCP specification, PPP does not generally hold, and so there is a failure of full risk-

sharing. By using equation (1.3) and its foreign equivalent, the risk-sharing condition (1.4), and the

pricing equations in Table 1, we may write the equation which implicitly defines expected home

country consumption as

                                                                   n              1− n

                                                           Et −1 C t1− ρ  )
Using the log-normality assumption, and taking logs, we may solve for expected consumption as



                                    1      λη     (2 − ρ ) 2    ( n ln θ t −1 + (1 − n ) ln θ t*−1 )

                             −                            +
                                           2ρ                        ρ

A similar procedure establishes that

                                    1      λη     (2 − ρ ) 2       ( n ln θ t −1 + (1 − n ) ln θ t*−1 )

                                    ρ     λ −1       2                              ρ
(A.14)
                                 (nσ u2 + (1 − n )σ u2* ) ( nσ c*u + (1 − n )σ c*u* )
                             −                           +
                                          2ρ                          ρ

The critical difference from (A.6) is that exchange rate variability does not affect expected

consumption.


                                                              5
         From the home economy money market clearing condition (2.3), taking expectations, and using

(A.13), we may solve for the home price level as

                                                   (1 + i − δ )
(A.15)                  pt = − Γm + mt −1 − δ                   ( n ln θ t −1 + (1 − n ) ln θ t*−1 )
                                                  (1 + iε − δ )

Home consumption is determined again from the home money market clearing condition as

(A.16)                         ct = Et −1ct + φ (mt − mt −1 ) + ψ (nu t + (1 − n)u t* )

         We can use the risk-sharing condition (1.4), the money-market equilibrium conditions, and

equation (A.15) to solve for the exchange rate as:

                                                           i (ε − 1)
(A.17)                          st = ρφ (mt − mt* ) −                ( pt − pt* ) + Γs ,
                                                              1+ i

where Γs is a constant term.

         Assume that the monetary policy rules followed by the home and foreign governments are

given by (2.1) and (2.2). Then we can use equation (A.17) to write home monetary policy as

                                                                      φργ
(A.18)              mt − mt −1 =
                                       1
                                            (                     )
                                           a1u t + a 2 u t* + υ t −              (
                                                                            b2 u t + b1u t* + υ t*     )
                                   1 − φργ                          1 − φργ

Substituting (A.18) into (A.16) gives equation (2.10). The variance of the log of consumption can be

derived directly from equation (2.10), and is reported in Table A1. The expected level of consumption

can be derived as before using the relationship in equation (A.10), and is given in equation (2.12).

Using (1.6), and the pricing rules in Table 1, we may write expected employment as (2.13).
