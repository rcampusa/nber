                     Trade Deficits in the Long Run



                                ABSTRACT




      This paper provides an historical perspective on the recent behavior
of the U.S. trade deficit. Judged by U.S. historical experience, the trade
deficit has reached what is now unprecedented levels. That unprecedented
deficit has its principal source not in changes in market structure affecting
the speed with which quantities respond to prices but in the policy
environment, namely the monetary—fiscal policy mix. While other industrial
countries have run comparable merchandise trade deficits at various points
in the past, these countries either financed their deficits out of interest
earnings on prior foreign investments or through the large—scale export of
services, or used the debt they incurred to finance investment in infra-
structure and to expand their capacity to export. Neither of these
scenarios has a counterpart in current U.S. experience.


       How easily can the trade deficit be eliminated if historical experience
is a guide? Typically, the rapid reduction of deficits has been achieved
through the reduction of imports; this typically entails restraints on
aggregate demand from which recession results. Trade deficits have been reduced
most.quickly and at lowest cost when at least one of two conditions prevails:
a favorable shock to the terms of trade or a reallocation of resources toward
investment in export—oriented sectors. The first of these conditions is
largely beyond the authorities' control, while the second must be initiated
well in advance. Barring a fortuitous terms—of—trade shock, this does not
give cause for optimism that the conditions are present for rapidly eliminating
the U.S. trade deficit at low cost.

1.   Introduction

     Among policymakers, the U.S. trade deficit is increasingly viewed as the

problem that will not go away. In 1986 the deficit reached unprecedented

levels in excess of $140 billion. The trade gap has widened in nominal terms

in every calendar year since 1980. While the deficit's growth over the early

part of the decade could be straightforwardly attributed to the rise of the

dollar and to the consequent decline in the relative price of U.S. imports and

the rising cost to foreigners of U.S. exports, the persistence of deficits in

the face of the dollar's subsequent decline has sent shudders through

Washington, D.C. conference rooms and corporate boardrooms alike. Even those

who anticipate that import and export quantities will eventually respond to

the dollar's real depreciation entertain the possibility that the

competitiveness of exporting and import-competing firms has been permanently

damaged by the deficits experienced in the interim.

     Unlike international trade theorists, who have recently freed themselves

from the confines of two—sector, two-factor, two-country models, the thinking

of economists and others about trade as a policy problem remains dominated by

twos: two U.S. deficits (those on the trade and government budget balances),

two countries (the U.S. and Japan), and two periods (the two terms of the

Reagan Administration). The confining nature of the framework makes it

difficult to evaluate whether and in what respects the recent behavior of the

U.S. trade deficit is unprecedented and to answer such questions as the

 following. Are there other modern periods when the trade deficits of the U.S.

or of other countries have grown to comparable proportions? On prior
                                        —2—


occasions when the trade gap has grown exceptionally wide, how much time has

been required to close it? In particular, what have been the roles of the two

factors that have figured so prominently in recent discussions -—      relative
prices and the government budget --    in   the creation and elimination of trade

deficits?

     My purpose in this paper is to consider these questions from the

perspective of comparative history.     I examine the experience since 1870 of

four countries: the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Japan. Currently, popular

accounts view Japan's trade surplus as the foreign counterpart to America's

trade deficit. Hence it is of interest to ask whether Japanese trade has

diverged so widely from balance in the past, for how long her trade surpluses

and deficits have persisted, and with what factors they have been associated.

Canada's and Britain's deficits have received less attention in the United

States but are of equal interest. Late-lgth century Britain, like mid—2Oth

century America, entered the period as the leading international creditor of

her day. Like the United States after World War II, Britain at the turn of

the century typically ran current account surpluses while exporting capital on

a large scale. As the 20th century progressed, her traded goods industries

experienced growing competitive difficulties leading to trade deficits, the

decline of Britain's net foreign asset position, and mounting protectionist

pressures. Hence it is intriguing to explore parallels between early British

experience and recent trends -in   the U.S. economy. Canadian experience between
1880 and 1913 provides a dramatic example of an economy running substantial

trade deficits while importing capital on a huge scale. The capital imports

which have figured so prominently in recent U.S. experience bear more than
                                     —3—


passing resemblance to this Canadian episode. If trade deficits behave

differently in the long run when accompanied by capital imports (in contrast

to deficits financed by reserve outflows or invisible earnings), then the

differences should be evident in comparisons of Canada with these other

countries.

    While my focus on the years since 1870 can be defended on the grounds

that they comprise the period when these economies all had at least begun to

undergo significant industrialization, that choice is dictated by the

availability of historical statistics. Since imports pass through a small

number of ports, making it easy for nascent governments to tax international

transactions, trade accounts are among the first economic statistics gathered

and published. But other information required to construct estimates of the

economic variables upon which trade volumes and prices depend, notably

national incomes, typically becomes available only in the 19th or 20th

centuries. Hence the focus on the post-1870 period.

     The data I employ derive from the painstaking work of economic historians

of all four countries who have backcast their national income accounts. These

long time series are not without limitations, as their architects would be the

first to admit. Readers can cultivate the appropriate sense of caution by

referring to the data appendix following the concluding section.

     In this paper, I do not estimate formal structural models of U.S. import

and export supplies and demands. Doing so would entail estimating separate

models for different subperiods. The dramatic changes which have occurred in

U.S. and international markets since the late 19th century warn against

estimating a single set of structural equations over that period of time.
                                      —4—


The alternative, of estimating models for subperiods, even if possible would

exceed the confines of a short paper. Rather than losing sight of the forest

for the trees, I err in the opposite direction, focusing on the period since

1870 as a single economic era.   I devote most of my energy to characterizing

general features of that experience, to developing broad generalizations about

the data, and to offering hypotheses about changes in the long run behavior of

the trade deficit.

     My exclusive focus in this paper is on the macroeconomics of the trade

balance. Currently, import penetration and export competitiveness are of

equal concern at a variety of other levels, including the sectoral, where the

impact of foreign competition is felt unevenly and poses a threat to the

continued survival of particular U.S. firms and industries, and the political,

where import penetration is a source of political pressures threatening to

transform the traditional free trade stance of the post-WWII U.S. economy.

Both of these topics are the subject of a more extensive historical literature

than the macroeconomics of trade deficits.' Neither receives more than

passing attention here.


2.   Recent U.S. Trade Performance

     One of the most prominent features of the U.S. trade deficit in the 1980s

has been its persistence. Table 1 shows for the post-WWII period (starting in

1948 taking account of lags) autocorrelations of two measures of the deficit

in merchandise trade. The nominal deficit, in the first column, -is highly

persistent -in the short run. On average, 95 per cent of a deficit in one year

has persisted into the next, more than 87 per cent into the year subsequent to

that. Even after four years less than a quarter of trade deficits are

eliminated. Some but not much of the persistence in nominal deficits is due

persistence in the rate of growth of national income. But scaling the deficit

by GNP does not do much to moderate the persistence; while autocorrelation is

reduced at one year lags, it is increased at lags two through four.2

     Trade imbalances may persist not because disturbances take years to

dissipate but because a country's trade balance can remain nonzero even in the

long run. A country which specializes in producing and exporting services can

offset a deficit in merchandise trade with a surplus on service account.

Ignoring international interest payments, a country which persistently saves

more than it invests and exports capital can remain -in balance-of--trade

surplus for substantial periods before corrective mechanisms equalize savings

with investment and imports with exports. Once a country is a net foreign

creditor, current account balance is entirely consistent with a trade deficit

in equilibrium so long as the excess of imports over exports is offset by

interest payments from abroad. To assess the speed of adjustment of the trade

balance to its long—run (possibly nonzero) level, consider the following

minimal model.


(1) 0(t) — 0(t—1)   =   aO*(t)   —
                                     D(t—1)}


where 0 is the observed deficit, 0* is its long-run value, and t indexes

time. The deficit adjusts at speed a. Equivalently,


(2) 0(t) = (1—a)D(t--1) + aD*


In principle, 0* should be derived from a general equilibrium model of both

domestic and foreign economies. Here I simply specify D* as a function of

time, either linear (0* =        +           or quadratic (D* = B0 +          +
                            B0       B1*t)                             B1*t       B2*t2).
Estimates of equation (2) under this assumption are shown in Table 2. For the

nominal deficit, estimates with a coefficient on the lagged dependent variable

between zero and one are obtained only when the nonlinear term in time is

included. The persistence of the nominal deficit, as reflected in the

coefficient on the lagged dependent variable, is only slightly lower than that

in Table i. The nominal deficit moves only a tenth of the way toward its

long run equilibrium level in a year, less than 40 per cent of the way in five

years. When these equations are solved for the implied long-run value of the

deficit, they imply a surplus from the mid—1950s through 1969 and a deficit

thereafter. (The actual balance moves from surplus to deficit in 1971.)

     Like the nominal deficit, the deficit share of GNP exhibits less

persistence in Table 2 than in Table 1. Half of the deficit share of GNP is

eliminated within a year whichever long-run specification is assumed. The

reduction in persistence when the possibility of a nonzero long-run deficit is

introduced is considerably greater in the case of the deficit/GM' ratio than

in that of the nominal deficit.

     The different behavior of the deficit share than of the nominal deficit

points to the behavior of the trade balance over the cycle. Figure 1 plots

the deficit as a share of GNP together with a five-year moving average of the

rate of growth of real GNP. It makes clear that GNP growth explains only part

of the time-series behavior of the deficit. Another determinant -is relative

prices. Figure 2 shows the deficit as a share of GNP together with the real

exchange rate (defined throughout as the price of traded goods, proxied by the

average of import and export prices, relative to the GNP deflator). Figure 3

superimposes the terms of trade, defined throughout as the home country's

export prices relative to its import prices. Over the third of a century

since 1952, neither relative price series is highly correlated with the trade

balance as a share of GNP. The strong association between the real exchange

rate and trade deficit of which so much has been written in recent years

appears to be limited largely to the final decade of the sample.

     The other correlation of which much has been written is that between the

government budget deficit and the trade deficit. Figure 4 displays these two

variables scaled by GNP, with the appearance of a positive relationship

throughout the post-WWII period.4 Standard open-economy analysis like the

Mundell-Fleming model suggests that the impact of the government budget on the

trade balance should depend on the exchange rate regime. While there is

evidence of a shift around the time of the collapse of Bretton Woods, it is

not so much a change in the elasticity of the trade deficit with respect to

the budget deficit as an upward shift in the level of the trade deficit given

any level of budget deficit.5


3.   The U.S. Trade Balance in Historical Perspective

     A first question upon which an historical perspective can shed light is

whether the magnitude of the recent U.S. trade deficit is unprecedented in any

meaningful sense. Figure 5 shows the deficit share of GNP on an annual basis

since 1890.   It does suggest that the recent rise in the trade deficit

represents a break with the past.6 The deficit share seems to have risen in

two stages, once in the second half of the 1960s, again in the 1980s.

     From Figure 5 it is clear that the U.S. trade balance has remained

nonzero for substantial periods. Throughout the 19th century, the U.S. was a

net foreign debtor, and there was relatively little change in her net external

asset position from the turn of the century to the eve of World War i. Trade

surpluses were required to service the external debt, although these declined

relative to GNP as the economy grew. During 1*11, the U.S. emerged as a

large-scale capital exporter and importer of reserves; for both reasons

persistent trade surpluses were implied. After WWII, the U.S. was the world's

leading international creditor; trade surpluses no longer were required as a

counterpart of external debt service but as a corollary of continued U.S.

foreign investment.

     If the recent behavior of the deficit/GNP ratio is unprecedented, must

one turn for explanation to changes in the deficit relative to trade or in

trade relative to national income? Figure 6 uses the identity D/GNP =

(D/T)*(T/GNP) to decompose the deficit share, where 0 is the deficit and I is
trade (measured as the sum of imports plus exports). Both components display

considerable variability, and both have contributed to the recent rise in the

deficit share of GNP. But the two components have moved differently over

time. Relative to trade, the deficit falls sharply during World War I,

recovers and remains steady over the 1920s, and then grows as the U.S. enters

the Great Depression. 0/I falls sharply during WWII, recovers and remains

relatively stable over the 1950s, before rising after 1965 and again after

1980. Prior to WWII, movements in trade as a share of national income tended

to offset movements in the deficit as a share of trade. T/GNP rises sharply

during WWI, falls during the 1920s, and recovers gradually over the 1930s. It

rises during WWII although, in contrast to fluctuations in 0/1, T/GNP

 fluctuates less sharply during 1*111 than during WW1. It is steady through

1970 before rising dramatically to 1980 and falling back over the current

decade. Overall, openness traces out a u-shaped pattern, recovering to

pre-WWI levels after 1965. Thus, while openness has increased since the early

1960s, tending ceteris paribus to raise the deficit share of GNP, the recent

behavior of T/GNP, unlike the recent behavior of 0/1, is by no means

historically unprecedented.

     Table 3 compares the behavior of the trade deficit in periods of fixed

and floating dollar exchange rates. It is not easy to partition the periods.

Even under the gold standard, small but persistent variations occurred in the

foreign currency value of the dollar. Even in periods when the dollar was

tightly pegged to certain foreign currencies, its value was altered against

others. Changes in a peg entail uncomfortable decisions about whether to

assign the year in which the change occurs to the fixed or floating period.

Hence the periodization underlying Table 3 is very approximate. Neither is it

easy to interpret the statistics, since differences in behavior under

different regimes may reflect either the effects of the exchange rate regime

or the effects of the underlying economic environment on both the regime and

the variable of interest.8 At this point, I simply note overall patterns.

While there is relatively little difference in the average level of the

deficit share of GNP under different exchange rate regimes, there are

pronounced differences in variability. The standard deviation of the trade

deficit relative to GNP -is more than twice as large in periods of floating as

 in periods of fixed rates (lines 2 and 3 of Table 3). While some of the

 difference in standard deviations is attributable to the war years (as shown

 in the fourth line of Table 3), even after eliminating them from the floating

 period a difference -in standard deviations of nearly 100 per cent remains.

     Table 4 presents autocorrelations of various deficit measures analogous

to those in Table 1 but since 1895. Remarkably, the autocorrelation in the

nominal deficit has been almost precisely the same over the last 90 years as

over the post-WWII era. There is no evidence here that trade imbalances have

grown more persistent recently. But in contrast, the deficit share of GNP has

somewhat lower autocorrelation coefficients over the longer period. Bearing

in mind the problems with such comparisons due to the fact that retrospective

GNP estimates may exaggerate the volatility and understate the persistence of

income in earlier periods (Romer, 1986), Tables 1 and 4 suggest that the

different time series behavior of the trade balance after WWII reflects more

than the different time series behavior of GNP.

     Table 5 follows Table 2 in analyzing the speed of convergence of the

trade balance to a non-zero long-run level. Here I concentrate on the deficit

share of GNP. The long-run trade balance is again modelled as a function of

time and time squared but in addition is permitted to shift during WWI and

WWII. To minimize the problems of modeling the trade balance's equilibrium

level over long time spans, I divide the earlier period into two segments:

1895-1929 and 1930—1951. Although there -is little difference between Tables 2

and 5 in the speed with which the trade balance converges to its long-run

level, the coefficients on time and time squared are uniformly more important

-in the Table 2 equations for the post-1952 period than in the Table 5

equations for earlier eras. This suggests that insofar as the trade balance

has exhibited greater persistence -in recent years, this is due to more

persistence in its long-run level rather than to a slower speed of adjustment.

     One corollary of this very different long—run behavior of the trade

balance has been a change -in cyclical responsiveness. Recall from above that

in recent years the deficit has tended to move procyclically. Figure 7, where

the deficit share of GNP and a five-year moving average of the rate of growth

of real income are plotted for the nine decades from 1895, suggests shifts in

the relationship between these variables. Table 6 documents them. In

contrast to recent years, when the deficit has tended to worsen when GNP was

growing rapidly, prior to 1952 the deficit tended to shrink during cyclical

upswings.

     The most appealing explanation is changes over the cycle in the

composition of demand. For evidence the logical place to look is the behavior

of relative prices. Figures 8 and 9, depicting the terms of trade and the

real exchange rate, are long-term counterparts of Figures 2 and 3.     In

contrast to recent years, over the longer period U.S. experience seems to

be characterized by an inverse relationship between the terms of trade and the

trade deficit. Prior to the 1950s, in periods when terms of trade tended to

weaken (the mid-1890s and mid-1920s, for example), the deficit tended to grow.

During the two world wars, when the U.S. terms of trade strengthened

dramatically, the trade deficit tended to fall. This suggests that prior to

1950 it was mainly fluctuations in foreign demands for U.S. exports that drove

the trade balance over the cycle. An increase in the foreign demand for U.S.

exports would drive up their price, improving the U.S. terms of trade, and

move the trade balance into surplus (Figure 9). Increased foreign demand

would raise GNP, resulting in a negative relationship between the trade

deficit and output (Table 6). After WWII, in contrast, there are as many

instances of the terms of trade and the trade deficit moving together as of

them moving in opposite directions. Between 1955 and 1965 and after 1980, as

the terms of trade strengthened the deficit grew. The pattern suggests that

in recent years it has increasingly been fluctuations in the domestic demand

for imports (and in the residual supply of exports) that have driven the trade

balance over the cycle. By increasing the demand for imports and curtailing

the availability of exports, increased domestic demand has driven up U.S.

export prices, improving the terms of trade, and moved the trade balance into

deficit (Figure 9). Increased domestic demand has stimulated GNP, resulting

in a positive relationship between the trade deficit and output (Table 6).

     The relationship of the real exchange rate to the trade balance (Figure

8) is consistent with this interpretation. Overall, during periods when the

real exchange rate (the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables) tended

to rise, the deficit tended to fall, again as if it was mainly fluctuations in

foreign demand that were driving the U.S. trade balance over the cycle. This

relationship is attenuated after WWII, as if fluctuations in domestic demand

began to play an increasingly important role.1°

     It is logical to turn to monetary and fiscal policies for shocks to

domestic demand. The data on the government budget in Figure 10 are dominated

by the two world wars, when large budget deficits were associated, courtesy of

controls on domestic prices and international transactions and even larger

budget deficits abroad, with large trade-balance surpluses. But after

eliminating the wartime periods, as in Figure 11, the relationship is clearly

positive. An OLS regression for 1896-1913, 1920-38 and 1947-84 yields:

tended to move in the same direction, a common implication of models

emphasizing the absorption effects of government spending.

     A further implication of those models is that the precise impact of

government spending on the trade balance will depend on exchange rate and

monetary policies. Under flexible exchange rates, perfect asset

substitutability and high capital mobility, a fiscal expansion will put upward

pressure on the exchange rate. As absorption rises, the increased demand for

traded goods can be satisfied by increased imports and curtailed exports. The

market for nontraded goods can only clear, however, if spending on them is

restrained and resources are shifted into their production through a real

appreciation. Under fixed exchange rates, in contrast, monetary policy is

used to prevent appreciation, and due to the higher price of imports and

increased competitiveness of exports a smaller trade deficit results.11 To

probe for a difference in the trade balance-budget balance relationship

between fixed- and flexible-exchange-rate periods, I interacted the budget

balance with a dummy variable equaling unity for years in which foreign

currencies were floating against the dollar. Floating periods are defined as

above. Conventional theories would suggest a positive coefficient. Using

essentially the same sample as for eq. (3):


(4) DIV = -0.012   +   0.344 B/V + 0.069 B/Y(FLOATING PERIODS)      R2=.33
           (0.001) (0.134)        (0.153)


While consistent with the hypothesis, the data lend at best weak support to

this interpretation.12

    These differences in the behavior of the trade deficit during fixed- and

floating—rate periods point to the role of monetary policy. Figure 12 shows

the trade deficit share of GNP together with a five-year moving average of the

rate of growth of real balances relative to real income (rate of growth of M2

minus rate of growth of nominal GNP). On first glance, the relationship of

real money growth to the trade deficit is not apparent. But adding the

percentage change in M2 relative to GNP to eq. 3 and estimating over peacetime

periods yields:


(5) D/Y = -0.011 + 0.193 B/V - 0.074 (M2/Y)                            R2=.19
           (0.001) (0.055)     (0.023)


Clearly, budget deficits have had different effects on the trade balance

depending on the degree to which they have been monetized.13 Fiscal deficits

in conjunction with tight money tended to lead to trade deficits not just in

recent years but over the preceding century. In contrast, in periods when

fiscal deficits were accompanied by monetary expansion, the impact of domestic

policy on the trade balance was attenuated.

     This observation goes some way toward explaining the greater variability

of trade deficits in periods of floating rates. In periods of fixed rates,

the correlation of budget deficits and the growth of M2/GNP is positive (as if

monetary policy was loosened in periods of fiscal expansion so as to prevent

exchange rate appreciation, and tightened in periods of fiscal contraction to

prevent depreciation). In periods of floating, the correlation of the two

variables is negative.   Thus, in floating-rate periods monetary and fiscal

policies have tended to move deficits in the same direction, accentuating

trade-balance swings; in fixed-rate periods they have tended to have

offsetting effects.

     In summary, a long—term perspective suggests conclusions with strong

implications for understanding the recent behavior of the U.S. trade deficit.

Relative to the size of the economy, the deficit has reached proportions never

experienced previously in the modern history of the United States. The

magnitude of that deficit is all the more noteworthy because movements in the

trade balance have tended to grow more persistent over time. Yet there is

little evidence that, once perturbed, the trade balance takes longer to return

to its long—run underlying level. Rather, its persistence is a result of the

persistence of policy affecting the long—run level of the balance of trade.

Prior to WWII, fluctuations in the trade balance were dominated by foreign

shocks with relatively little serial correlation; since WWII, fluctuations

have been dominated by domestic shocks with considerably greater persistence.

Rather than a result of changes in market structure in the United States and

abroad, this suggests that the recent behavior of the U.S. trade deficit is

predominantly a consequence of policy.


4.   The U.S. Trade Balance in International Perspective

     If at no time in the last century have U.S. trade deficits approached

their current magnitude, have the deficits of other countries approached

comparable proportions? Figures 13 through 15, where the U.S. deficit as a

share of GNP is plotted along with comparable time series for the U.K., Canada

and Japan, point to an answer of yes. Noteworthy are the large deficits run

by the U.K. throughout the pre—WWII period, the large deficits run by Canada

through much of the pre—WWI period and, by contrast, Japan's large surpluses

during WWI. Yet the circumstances in which those deficits and surpluses were

incurred were very different from those prevailing currently.

     The magnitude of Britain and Canada's pre-WWII deficits reflects more

than their openness. Although compared to the U.S. the share of imports and

exports in GNP is higher in Britain, Canada and Japan alike, the relationship

of the import and export share of GNP in the U.S. and abroad has remained more

or less constant over time and thus cannot account for the exceptional

behavior of foreign deficits prior to the interwar years. Britain sustained

her large deficits despite running capital account surpluses prior to WWI.

She was able to export capital even while running merchandise trade deficits

by virtue of invisible earnings derived from shipping, insurance and, most of

all, the financial business in which the City of London specialized, and by

virtue of interest earnings on British capital previously invested abroad.

Although the precise magnitude of Edwardian Britain's foreign assets and

liabilities is debated (Platt, 1986; Kennedy, 1987), historians agree that

Britain's net foreign position continued to strengthen in the decades prior to

the Great War. Thus, Britain's pre-WWI deficits offer no parallel to

increasing debt to foreigners currently being accumulated by the United

States.

     Like current U.S. deficits, pre-WWI Canadian deficits were accompanied by

large scale capital imports. Canada had neither invisible exports nor foreign

investment earnings to defray merchandise trade deficits. Relative to the

size of the economy, Canadian capital imports were exceptional, leading

economists to study how her economy and her balance of payments accommodated

such large capital inflows (Viner, 1924). Canada's ability to sustain her

large pre-WWI trade deficits is readily explicable. Throughout this period

the Canadian economy was undergoing rapid development of her resource-based

and industrial sectors. Between the late 1890s and World War I, the wheat

economy of the Canadian plains expanded with exceptional speed. Foreign

capital was used to construct railways and navigable waterways and to purchase

machinery and equipment. The uses to which foreign funds were put generated a

stream of export revenues. Deficits which loomed large at the beginning of

the period did not give rise to a heavy external debt burden relative to the

size of the economy given the latter's rapid rate of growth, while the

development of Canada's capacity to export prevented serious transfer problems

from arising along the way.

     In contrast to Britain and Canada, there are no periods in recent

economic history in which Japan has run large deficits relative to GNP.

Moreover, Japan's current surplus has no peacetime precedent in that country's

modern economic history. During WWI in Europe, however, Japanese merchandise

trade surpluses reached seven per cent of GNP, a ratio in excess of current

levels. Still, the parallels are limited, since these surpluses resulted from

the sudden and substantial growth of Japanese exports arising from the

disruption of intra-European and North Atlantic trade, of which Japanese

exporters took full advantage (Eichengreen, 1986), not from secular trends in

competitiveness.

     Thus, while comparisons with earlier British, Canadian and Japanese

experience permit one to dismiss alarmist accounts based exclusively on the

magnitude of current U.S. deficits, they only underscore the relevance of the

intertemporal budget constraint and the importance of putting capital imports

to productive use.

     The time series behavior of U.S. trade deficits has differed from the

behavior of deficits abroad, although more so in the post-WWII period than

WWII. (While only peacetime periods are plotted, including the war years

would reinforce the point.) The comovement of the two variables is

particularly clear in their sawtooth pattern during the stop-go years of the

1960s. But after 1975, the two variables diverge. The explanation does not

lie in monetary expansion, especially after 1979. And there is no significant

depreciation of the real exchange rate to alter the trade balance—budget

balance relationship. Clearly, the severe and protracted recession which has

prevailed in Britain through much of this period has broken the trade

balance-budget balance link, the fall in incomes at the same time reducing

government revenues and depressing import demands. This underscores the point

that government budget deficits can bear different relationships to the trade

deficit depending on their source.


5.   Eliminating Large Trade Imbalances

     The historical experience of the countries considered in this paper

provides several examples of large trade deficits that have been eliminated

rapidly. There is nothing mysterious about the mechanism: if domestic demand

is radically curtailed, the volume of imports will fall with little delay.

Unfortunately, so will output and employment. More interesting is whether

historical experience provides instances where large trade deficits have been

eliminated rapidly without incurring a sizeable and prolonged recession. If

such instances exist, do their histories suggest some mix or sequencing of

policies that might be recommended to U.S. authorities?

     Identifying episodes to study is not as straightforward as one might

suppose. Since at no time in the last 100 years has the U.S. run a deficit
                                       —21—


whose magnitude approaches the current U.S. deficit as a share of GNP, case

studies of earlier American experience are not attractive. Many of the

largest deficits experienced by Canada, Britain and Japan resulted from those

countries' entry into war or were eliminated by the economic effects of war

abroad. Wartime experience is exceptional, although it may still contain

implications of relevance to officials attempting to formulate policy in

peacetime. The difficulty of identifying appropriate episodes reinforces the

point that recent U.S. experience is   highly   unusual.

     In fact, I have not been able to identify a large trade deficit in those

countries and periods depicted in Figures 13-15 that was eliminated without

the intervention of a recession. But there are at least three episodes, one

from each country and one from each period (prewar, interwar, postwar), where

the recession was unusually short: Canada after 1912, Japan after 1924, and

Britain after 1951. What was there about the sources of these deficits, the

circumstances under which they were eliminated or the policies pursued that

rendered their reduction less painful than was typically the case?

     Canada's trade deficits prior to WWII were associated with an exceptional

surge of foreign capital inflows. Canada was by far the leading capital

importer of the period, Viner (1924) estimating total foreign capital invested

in Canada during the period 1900-1913 to have been in excess of $2.5 billion.15

This was the period during which British capital exports reached their peak.

According to Viner's review of contemporary estimates, more than 2/3 of

Canadian capital imports were British in origin; $1.4 billion of the $2.5

billion total capital inflow was accounted for by British public investments

in Canadian securities alone. After fluctuating unevenly around a mean of $1?
                                        —22--



million per annum between 1900 and 1909, the gross capital inflow rose to $31

million in 1910 and $134 million in 1911. It then receded to $77 million in

1912 and fell to virtually nil in 1913.16

        Table 9 shows how the economy responded first to the inundation of

foreign capital and then to the drought. The immediate effect of the capital

inflow was to stimulate the economy. Economic growth proceeded at extremely

rapid rates in 1910-11, as gross domestic capital formation rose to more than

a quarter of GNP.17 Construction, most notably of Canada's second and third

transcontinental railways and feeder lines, accounted for more than 2/3 of

total investment between 1900 and 1914 and for a rising share as the period

progressed. The rate at which railways were expanded in the decade from 1906

has no precedent in either U.S. or Australian experience. Expansion of the

Canadian railways stimulated other forms of investment, notably residential

construction and infrastructure in the new urban centers of the plains.

Investment in manufacturing and mining were also stimulated by the ready

availability of foreign funds.

        Although the volume of exports rose with the economy's expansion,

import volumes rose more rapidly still, by 15 per cent in 1911 and by 29 per

cent in 1912, pushing the trade balance deeply into deficit. The concurrent

deterioration of Canada's terms of trade mainly reflected world market

conditions, since Canada was a price taker in most markets. In contrast, the

capital inflow and demand stimulus were directly responsible for driving up

the price of home goods, as reflected in the ten per cent fall in the real

exchange rate (price of traded relative to nontraded goods) between 1910 and

1912.

       Although capital inflows terminated abruptly in 1913, economic expansion

continued into the following year as new investments came on stream. Although

imports fell only slightly as foreign capital dried up, the volume of exports

continued to grow, considerably reducing the deficit. Thus, one lesson to

which this Canadian experience points is the relative ease of eliminating

large deficits when the excess of absorption over production is used to

finance investment rather than consumption.

       in 1914, as a result of the halt to capital inflows, Canada experienced a

short but severe recession, output falling by ten per cent. Investment

spending on construction fell by a fifth, on machinery and equipment by

roughly a third.18 The impact on Canadian incomes was reinforced by a

deterioration of roughly seven per cent in the terms of trade, dominated again

by conditions in the international wheat market. Yet the deficit was reduced

to less than one seventh of its level two years before. There is nothing

magical about the adjustment. Together, the recession and terms of trade

shock reduced the volume of Canadian imports very dramatically, cutting the

deficit at a stroke. The exceptional feature of this experience is that the

volume of exports continued to grow despite the recession. While the decline

-in   imports was mainly responsible f or reducing the trade balance so
dramatically, the continued rise in exports had a useful reinforcing effect.

Continued export growth likely reflected both the final 1910-12 -investments

coming on stream and strong demands for raw materials following the outbreak

of the European war.

       Neither is there anything mysterious about the short duration of the

slump. Canada was pulled out of recession by buoyant wartime demands for her
                                     -24-


primary commodity exports. Export values and volumes rose dramatically in

1915, and volumes continued to expand the following year. That Canada was

able to respond to foreign demands for her exports by increasing supplies

again reflects the extent to which previous foreign borrowings had been

devoted to investment.

     Japanese experience in the 1920s offers an interesting contrast. As

shown in Table 10, Japanese deficits reached high levels in 1923-24, before

declining over the remainder of the decade. Like Canada after 1912, the

reduction of Japanese deficits was accompanied by a relatively short

recession, growth turning negative for only a year. But both the origins of

Japan's deficit and the mechanisms through which it was reduced were entirely

different from the Canadian case. The Japanese trade deficit rose in two

stages, the first in 1919-22 and the second in 1923-24. The 1919-20 upswing

and 1920-21 recession in Japan were synchronized with the postwar boom and

slump abroad, although after the spring of 1920 Japanese prices fell less

rapidly than prices abroad. The government adopted a silk valorization scheme

and a Rice Control Act to support the prices of these two commodities, and

credit extended to finance these schemes prevented prices from falling as

rapidly as abroad.19 Meanwhile, the authorities expended foreign exchange

reserves accumulated during the war to prevent the dollar exchange rate from

diverging from its prewar parity. The yen was rendered seriously overvalued:

the real exchange rate (prices of imports and exports relative to GNP

deflator) fell by more than 20 per cent between 1919 and 1922, and a

substantial deficit emerged.

     The second stage in the growth of the deficit followed the 1923 Kanto

earthquake and the recession for which it was responsible. The large

quantities of raw materials and machinery required for reconstruction can be

seen in the rise in the volume of imports in the midst of the 1923 recession.

Meanwhile, export volumes declined precipitously. But if the 1923 recession

was serious, the 1924 recovery was rapid. The Bank of Japan extended large

amounts of credit to the private sector once the government guaranteed it

against losses on discounts of bills for financial institutions whose

solvency was threatened in the wake of the earthquake. As a result, not only

did exports recover with reconstruction, but imports boomed. Japan's trade

deficit reached its interwar peak in 1924. In contrast to Canada, where the

deficit resulted from the shock to demand attendant on capital inflows, in

Japan it resulted from both supply and demand shocks.

     Thereafter, the trade deficit was progressively reduced. The economy

experienced another brief downturn, as the government attempted to balance its

budget by winding down reconstruction expenditures and increasing taxes. The

main impulse tending to moderate the deficit was the steady growth of exports.

Export volumes increased even in 1925 when the economy was in recession. The

mechanism was depreciation of the yen. The 1924-25 trade deficits had

depleted the government's foreign balances, dictating the termination of

support operations. The nominal exchange rate against the dollar was then

allowed to fall by some 20 per cent. The effects of depreciation are evident

in Table 10: the 1923-25 decline in Japan's terms of trade is nearly 20 per

cent, while the prices of imports and exports rise relative to the GNP

deflator by about half that amount.2° Broadly speaking, Japan's deficits were

reduced by a combination of domestic demand restraint resulting in stagnant

economic growth and exchange-rate depreciation enhancing the competitiveness
                                     -26-


of Japanese exports and switching domestic expenditure away from traded

goods.

     British experience after 1951 was again very different. The backdrop to

the 1951 crisis was the 1949 devaluation of sterling.21 1949 was a year of

neither serious trade imbalance nor obvious convertibility crisis, and a 30

per cent devaluation in conjunction with wage and price restraints all but

eliminated the existing deficit on merchandise trade account. But in 1951 the

trade deficit suddenly rose to extremely high levels. Imports reached levels

not to be matched until 1957. Here too a combination of factors was at work.

Following U.S. entry into the Korean War in mid-1950 and purchases of raw

materials by the American Munitions Board, the prices of primary products were

greatly bid up. This is evident in the deterioration of Britain's terms of

trade in 1950-51. There was no obvious problem on the export side: despite

Korean-war-induced shortages of coal, steel and other commodities, which

hampered Britain's steel industry, export volumes rose by some 14 per cent in

the wake of the 1949 devaluation and remained steady -in 1951.22 The growth of

the trade deficit resulted entirely, therefore, from terms of trade

deterioration and import growth. Wile rapid import growth might seem curious

in the wake of a substantial devaluation, in 1950—51 it reflected the

relaxation of wartime controls on imports and continued stimulus to aggregate

demand. Under Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, government expenditures (mostly

on defence) were to increase by £973 million, but new taxation was projected

at only one seventh that amount.

     The crisis was resolved through a General Election and installation of a

new Chancellor of the Exchequer.23 Interest rates were raised, credit

conditions were tightened, import restrictions were reimposed, and the

rearmament program was scaled down. British firms had augmented their stocks

in anticipation of continued increases in materials prices; as price increases

first slowed and then reversed in mid-1951, inventory demands fell

precipitously.24 In 1952 the trade deficit was very considerably reduced by

declining import volumes and recovering terms of trade, but at the cost of

negative economic growth.

     Britain's 1952 recession, like the Canadian and Japanese cases discussed

above, is notable for its brevity, growth recommencing in 1953. Again, the

key appears to lie in a fortuitous terms-of-trade improvement. In 1953 the

government could afford to apply macroeconomic stimulus without violating the

external constraint because of the very dramatic improvement in the terms of

trade. Despite the fact that by 1953 import volumes had nearly returned to

1951 levels and export volumes still remained well below 1951, the trade

deficit remained at manageable levels by virtue of the change in relative

prices. In the words of Scott (in Worswick and Ady, 1962, p.217), the crisis,

"was due very largely to... [a] gigantic fluctuation in [Britain's] terms of

trade. As such, it largely cured itself."


6.   Concluding Remarks

     Judged by the country's historical experience, U.S. trade deficits have

reached what are unprecedented levels. While other industrial countries have

run comparable merchandise trade deficits at various points in their histories,

this should be of little comfort to American observers. Those countries

either financed their deficits out of interest earnings on prior foreign
                                     -28—


investments and through the large-scale export of services, or used the debt

they incurred to finance investment in infrastructure and expand their

capacity to export. Neither of these scenarios has a counterpart in current

U.S. experience, whose main legacy would appear to be a burden of debt service

to foreigners.

     That unprecedented trade deficit has its principal source not in changes

in market structure affecting the speed with which quantities respond to

prices but in the policy environment, namely the monetary-fiscal mix. While

the positive relationship of the trade deficit to the budget deficit is

predicted by every standard model of the balance of payments, a review of

historical experience underscores a subtler point also conveyed by many of

those models: that the precise impact on the balance of payments of fiscal

deficits depends not only on the magnitude of those deficits but on their

source, on accompanying policies and on the structure of domestic and foreign

economies. Recent U.S. fiscal deficits have had a sizeable impact on the

balance of trade because they have occurred in an environment of high capital

mobility and have not been accompanied by accommodating monetary policy.

     How easily can the trade deficit be eliminated if historical experience

is any guide? The answer, unfortunately, would appear to be "not easily."

More often than not, the reduction of deficits has been achieved through the

reduction of imports; typically this entails additional restraints on

aggregate demand from which recession results. Trade deficits have been

reduced most quickly and at lowest cost in terms of foregone output when at

least one of two conditions prevails: a favorable shock to the terms of trade,

and a reallocation of resources toward investment in export-oriented sectors.
                                     -29-


The first of these conditions -is largely beyond the authorities' control; the

second must be initiated well before other measures to reduce the deficit are

adopted if it is to increase export revenues within the relevant period of

time. Barring a fortuitous terms—of-trade shock, this does not give cause for

optimism that the conditions are present for rapidly eliminating the U.S.

trade deficit at low cost.

                              Data Appendix


1.   United States

     The basic source for trade data for the U.S. is the Department of

Commerce's Historical Statistics of the United States through 1970 and from

the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics

thereafter. Exports and imports of merchandise are at f.o.b. prices. Data

through 1915 are for years ending June 30, entries thereafter for calendar

years. Since variables for items other than trade are conveniently available

on a calendar year basis, I realigned the trade data through 1915 to minimize

problems of timing. On the assumption of a constant rate of flow over the

fiscal year, I averaged the figures for pairs of successive years to generate

calendar year estimates.

     It is tempting to Lipsey's (1963) estimates of U.S. imports and exports,

upon which many of HS's series are based. Lipsey presents calendar year

estimates for years prior to 1915, based on monthly trade accounts. Thus, use

of Lipsey's data would permit the assumption of a constant rate of flow over

the fiscal year to be relaxed. However, rather than total imports and

exports, Lipsey studies (i) total imports and (ii) exports of U.S. merchandise

only (excluding re—exports). While appropriate for his purposes, the

exclusion of re-exports (which average about 1.5 percent of the total) is not

desirable for this paper, whose focus is the macroeconomics of trade deficits.

Experimentation showed that differences due to the choice of series were

consistently small, however. In the case of import and export price indices,

no fiscal year-calendar year adjustment is required, since these indices prior
                                      —31-


to 1915 appear to be taken by HS directly from Lipsey (and apply only to

domestic exports). The vast majority of the analysis in this paper considers

the nominal deficit as a share of nominal GNP; hence the fact that the export

price index used covers only domestic exports is not a major problem. For

regression analysis, all price indices are benchmarked to 1967=100.

     Total receipts and expenditures of the federal government are available

in HS through 1970 for years ending June 30 and in IFS thereafter for years

ending September 30.    I took appropriately weighted averages of successive

years to construct calendar year estimates. M2 is taken from HS through 1970

and IFS thereafter.

     Through 1970 I used the uS series for GNP at current and constant 1958

prices, taking their ratio as the implicit price deflator. I spliced to this

series to GNP for the post-1970 period as reported in IFS and rebenchmarked

the IMF's series for GNP at constant 1980 prices to 1958 prices. Romer (1986)

has pointed to problems with the Kuznets and Commerce-Kendrick estimates upon

which the HS series are based. The late 19th and early 20th century estimates

may exaggerate the cyclical volatility of national income, making comparisons

over time of the income elasticities of imports and exports problematic.

Others such as Weir (1986) conclude that Romer's alternative estimates

underestimate the cyclical volatility of national income prior to World War I.

See also p. 10 above.


2.   United Kingdom

     Data for the U.K. are drawn from Feinstein (1972) through 1965 and from

IFS thereafter. All series are for calendar years. The export and import
                                     —32-


price indices are again based on the unit value of exports of domestic

products and of total imports. Through 1965 these are from Feinstein's Table

64. The volume of total exports and total imports is calculated from Table

15. Through 1965, gross national product at market prices, in millions of

pounds sterling and 1938 constant prices, is drawn from Feinstein's Tables 3

and 5. These are linked to IFS national income at market prices for

subsequent years. Government receipts and expenditures (the current account

of the central government, inclusive of National Health Insurance Funds) are

from Feinstein's Table 12, linked to total government revenue and expenditure

from IFS.


3.   Japan

     Most series for Japan are from Long Term Economic Statistics, as revised

by Ohkawa and Rosovsky (1973) and supplemented by IFS. Gross national product

at current market prices is from LIES through 1904 and from Ohkawa and

Rosovksy thereafter. (The Ohkawa-Rosovsky series differs primarily by virtue

of a revision of investment in agriculture.) GNP at constant prices is

available for the pre-WWII and postwar periods separately, but no attempt has

been made to link the two subsamples. Prewar GNP is at 1934-46 prices,

postwar GNP (from Okhawa and Rosovsky through 1965 and IFS thereafter) is in

constant 1960 prices. The GNP deflators are normalized to 100 in 1937 for the

prewar segment and in 1967 for the postwar segment. Current price GNP is

linked to the counterpart series in IFS, and current price GNP is linked to

GNP in 1980 prices from IFS, rebenchmarked to 1960 prices.

     The value of imports and exports and the import and export price indices

are from LIES, Tables 5 and 15. As with GNP, no trade data exist for 1945,
                                      —33-



and no price indices for imports and exports are available for 1940-50. While

Okhawa and Rosovsky provide import and export price indices derived from

the national income statistics for 1940-44 and 1946—50, these should be

regarded as provisional.   I rebenchmarked the 1940-44 values to link them to

the 1939 LIES figure and rebenchmarked the 1946-50 values to link them to the

1951 LIES figure. Ihese series are then linked to IFS figures on import and

export values (f.o.b.) and import and export prices (which are available in

addition to unit values for the post—WWII period).

     Finally, government revenues and expenditures, on a fiscal year basis,

are taken from Japanese Ministry of Finance (1986).


4.   Canada

     The basic source for Canada is Urquhart and Buckley (1965), as

supplemented and revised by Urquhart (1986) and extended by IFS. GNP at

current market prices and constant 1913 prices is drawn from Urquhart (1986)

for the period through 1925, to which the comparable series in Urquhart and

Buckley (1965) are spliced through the period through 1960, followed by the

comparable series from IFS. Real GNP is provided through 1925 at 1913 prices

by Urquhart (1986) and from 1926 at 1949 prices by Urquhart and Buckley

(1965).   I converted the post-1926 component to 1913 prices by assuming no

change in the GNP deflator between 1925 and 1926.

     Export and import values (f.o.b.) are provided by Urquhart and Buckley.

These are on a fiscal year basis through 1918 (ending March 31 of the year

given from 1908 through 1919 and June 30 from 1868 through 1906) and on a

calendar year basis thereafter. Fiscal year figures are transformed to a
                                     —34-


calendar year basis by assuming a constant flow throughout the year and taking

appropriately weighted averages. The import and export price indices are

drawn from Urquhart and Buckley, using their 1900 base series through 1915,

their 1913 base series from 1916 through 1926, and their 1948 base series from

1927 through 1960. These were benchmarked to 1900=100, the unit values of

imports and exports were appended for subsequent years, and the entire series

was normalized to 1967=100.

     total government revenue and expenditure are from Urquhart and Buckley

through 1960 and from IFS thereafter. Since tirquhart and Buckley's series are

on a fiscal year basis for years ending June 30 before 1907 and for years

ending March 31 thereafter, while the IMF's are for fiscal years beginning

April 1, the revenue and expenditure series were adjusted to a calendar year

basis assuming a constant flow throughout the year and taking appropriately

weighted averages.

1.   To cite but two examples, the relationship of trade to the political

economy of trade policy is the subject of Kindleberger (1951), while the

impact of trade at the sectoral and aggregate levels is the subject of Sayers

(1965).

2.   Throughout, I use the current value of exports and imports relative to

nominal GNP to avoid the index number problems which arise when comparing

import and export volumes to real GNP. These problems result from the

significant changes in the commodity composition of imports, exports and GNP

which occur over long periods of time; see Lipsey (1963) or Matthews,

Feinstein and Odling-Smee (1982), p.429. These same index number problems

must be borne in mind when the price indices of imports and exports are

compared with the GNP deflator.

3.   Throughout, it is impossible to reject that the coefficient on the lagged

dependent variable is unity - -inother words that the trade deficit follows a

random walk. However, the Dickey—Fuller test used is likely to be of low

power, and the random walk hypothesis would seem to be difficult to interpret

when applied to the trade deficit.

4.   For 1952-84 the correlation coefficient of the two variables is .72.

Note that in this figure separate scales are used for the trade and budget

deficits, making the correlation look closer to the naked eye.

5.   An OLS regression for 1952-84 yields:


     D/Y =   -0.011 + 0.386 B/V - 0.064 (B/Y)*F + 0.012 F
             (0.002) (0.210)      (0.254)        (0.005)

                                                     OW    = 1.22 R2 = 0.68
                                     -36-


where D/V is the trade deficit ratio, B/V is the budget deficit ratio, and F

is a dummy variable for the floating years from 1973. Standard errors are in

parentheses.

6.   A t—test of the hypothesis of no increase in D/Y after 1975 is rejected

at the 99 per cent level.

7.   Eichengreen (1987a), Table 1.

8.   For further discussion, see Eichengreen (1987b).

9.   Many but not all of these conclusions for the period prior to 1952 are

consistent with those of Mintz (1959).

10. A regression for the period 1895—1985 of the deficit relative to GNP

(O/Y) on the real exchange rate (RER), with an additional slope coefficient

for the post-1951 period, yields:


     0/V = 0.003 - 0.017 RER + 0.015 RER(POST 1951)
          (0.008) (0.006)     (0.003)                     p=0.003 R2=.39


with a first order autocorrelatjon correction and standard errors in

parentheses. Thus, the tendency of the trade deficit to fall as the relative

price of traded goods rose was weaker after WWII.

11. For a recent restatement of this literature, see Sachs and Wyplosz

(1987).

12. One might object that the relationship between the trade balance and the

budget balance simply reflects the influence on both budget and trade deficits

of cyclical factors omitted from the equation. Adding the deviation of output

from trend (computed as the residuals from a regression of real GNP on a

constant, time and time squared) to the list of regressors had minimal impact

on the results:
                                               -37-


      D/Y =   -0.022 + 0.173    B/V + 0.095 B/V(FLOATING) + 1.339 OUTPUT DEVIATION
              (0.002) (0.102)         (0.113)              (0.172)

                                                                        R2=.64

13. The sample period for this regression is 1896—1913, 1920—1938, 1945—1983.

Other proxies for the stance of monetary policy yielded similar results. For

example, when the level rather than the percentage change in the M2/GNP ratio

was used:


      0/V =   0.218   +   0.362 B/V - 2.334 M2/V
              (0.709) (0.065)        (1.622)                             R2=.32


Entering both the percentage change in the M2/GNP ratio and the budget

deficit/GNP ratio interacted with a dummy variable for floating rate periods

supports the conclusion that it is monetary policy which acocunts for the

shift:


      D/V =   -1.220  + 0.440 B/V - 5.719 %A(M2/Y) - 0.073 B/V(FLOATING)
               (0.124) (0.130)     (2.143)          (0.148)

                                                                         R2.35


14.      In Figure 16, the same tendencies are evident for the 1950s, when a

floating Canadian dollar similarly loosened the link between budget deficits

and trade deficits.

17. Calculated from Firestone (1958). Edelstein (1982, p. 272) suggests that

the figure is inflated by an exceptional amount of inventory investment in

1910. Adjustments are likely to change the picture only slightly, however.
