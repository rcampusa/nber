The spending obligations and revenue sources of colonial New Jersey’s provincial government for
the years 1704 through 1775 are reconstituted using forensic accounting techniques from primary sources.
Such has not been done previously for any British North American colony. These data are used to
assess colonial New Jersey’s provincial fiscal structure. The methods for raising revenue to meet normal
peacetime and emergency wartime expenses are identified and analyzed. The provincial tax burdens
imposed on New Jersey’s subjects are calculated. How the British interfered with New Jersey’s provincial
fiscal structure is identified. What revenues and tax burdens would have been without this interference
are estimated.

        The spending obligations and revenue sources of colonial New Jersey’s provincial

government for the years 1704 through 1775 are reconstituted using forensic accounting

techniques from primary sources. Such has not been done previously for any British North

American colony. These data are used to assess colonial New Jersey’s provincial fiscal structure.

The methods for raising revenue to meet normal peacetime and emergency wartime expenses are

identified and analyzed. The provincial tax burdens imposed on New Jersey’s subjects are

calculated. How the British interfered with New Jersey’s provincial fiscal structure is identified.

What revenues and tax burdens would have been without this interference are estimated.

         The Spending Obligations of Colonial New Jersey’s Provincial Government

        Colonial New Jersey’s legislature had two primary spending obligations. The first was to

pay for the “support of government,” namely paying the salaries of provincial government

officials and the other expenses incurred in running its administrative structure. The second was

to pay for military expenses, i.e. soldiers’ pay and military supplies, for the colony’s

participation in the wars of the British Empire.

        Table 1 reports the yearly support-of-government expenses. These data are derived from

a forensic accounting reconstruction of expenses listed in all surviving “support of government”

acts passed by New Jersey’s legislature. Support-of-government obligations were paid in other

Notes: £NJ = face value of New Jersey bills of credit (New Jersey pounds). Post-1723, at face value, 1.3275£NJ = 1£S (£S = pounds sterling). Incidental expenses are only for items connected with
“support of governments”, such as assembly printing costs, Sergeant-at-Arm expenses after 1740, assembly supplies, and so on. They exclude any military spending. Estimated per diem payments are
amounts paid to assemblymen for every day attended and to judges for every day the court sat. Because the incidence of these payments are unknown these values are estimated. For the 1741-75
estimate, see Grubb (2015). The 1709-10 estimate subtracts the salary and incidental expenses from the taxes authorized to pay these expenses and assumes the remainder was used to cover per diem
expenses. The 1709-10 values are converted to post-1723 values, see Grubb (2015).

years, but acts itemizing the obligations have not survived (Kemmerer 1940). Based on the

evidence in Table 1, total non-war spending on the support of government from 1704 through

1775 was approximately 145,524.53£NJ, or an average of 2,021.17£NJ per year. This estimate

uses linear interpolated values between the nearest years with data. The following adjustments

were also incorporated. The governor’s salary was not paid in 1744, 1745, and 1746, nor were

these salary arrears ever paid. The governor’s salary was also not paid in 1751, however, this

arrear appears to have been paid soon thereafter and so no adjustment is made for this 1751

salary nonpayment (Kemmerer 1940, pp. 180, 185-6, 229-30).

       The assembly did not meet in 1712, 1715, 1717, 1720, 1724, 1726, 1729, 1731, 1732,

1734, 1735, 1736, 1737, 1739, and 1774 (McChesney 1851, pp. 20-3). In these years, most of the

incidental and per diem obligations were not incurred. The courts met, thus some of the per diem

obligations were incurred in these years. The incidental and per diem obligations were reduced

by 75 percent (a best guess of the assembly’s share) in the years the assembly did not meet from

what their linear interpolated values would have been.

       Total non-war spending on the support of government from 1704 through 1775 based on

how actual revenues were spent was approximately 141,267.04£NJ, or an average of 1,989.68£NJ

per year (from Table 6 below). This estimate is biased low because of missing data on revenues

from trade duties. The interpolation exercise using data from Table 1 most likely produces a

biased high estimate. The two estimated amounts are relatively close. Given the opposing biases,

this closeness gives confidence that the true total spending on the support of government from

1704 through 1775 was between 141,300£NJ and 145,500£NJ.

       New Jersey participated in three major wars of the British Empire, namely Queen Anne’s

War (1702-13), the War of Jenkin’s Ear and King George’s War (1739-48), and the Seven



                                                                                                   3
Years—French and Indian War (1755-64). Britain expected New Jersey to participate in these

wars and to pay for that participation. Participation entailed providing militia for expeditions

against the enemy and providing war materials to support that militia as well as the regular

British military. New Jersey spent 5,829£NJ on Queen Anne’s War, 2,000£NJ in 1740 on the War

of Jenkin’s Ear, 17,850£NJ on King George’s War, and 312,500£NJ on the Seven Years War

(from Table 6 below). Overall, New Jersey’s provincial government spent 334,465£NJ on war

between 1704 and 1775, or 2.3 times total non-war spending in this period.

       War accounted for 70 percent, whereas support of government accounted for 30 percent,

of total spending by New Jersey’s provincial government between 1704 and 1775. War spending

was highly concentrated compared with support-of-government spending. When war came,

spending obligations rose 6 to 22 times that of normal peacetime spending. War required revenue

sources that were beyond historically acceptable and feasible contemporaneous tax levels.

       Colonial governments faced standard budget constraints. Tax receipts (Tj) had to match

government spending (Gj). When they didn’t, colonial governments had to adjust their borrowing

and asset positions. For the most part, colonial governments did not have asset positions, such as

stocks of gold and land. External markets where colonial governments could borrow were not

adequately developed or accessible. Thus, when war caused Gj > Tj, colonial governments had to

move tax revenues through time to balance current budgets.

       The New Jersey legislature did this by issuing bills of credit (M), see equation (1). These

bills were zero-coupon bonds that served as a legal-tender paper money in the local economy

(Grubb 2014, 2015). When war spending in year “j” threw the budget into deficit, Mj was issued

to make up for deficient Tj. Mj was directly spent by the legislature on soldiers’ salaries and war

supplies like it was current tax revenue. Budget surpluses in future years were designed to retire



                                                                                                      4
Mj from circulation. New Jersey provincial taxes were paid in these bills, or their specie

equivalence, at face value. New Jersey printed this specie equivalence for tax purposes on the

face of each bill (Newman 2008, pp. 249-59).

M      = face value of new emissions of bills of credit
T      = taxes paid in M or its specie equivalent at face value
G      = government spending

       Paper money creation was a credit-debt mechanism that matched budget deficits with

budget surpluses over a multi-year horizon. The balanced budget requirement was cut loose from

a strict time unit. It still had to be balanced, but now it could be balanced over a multi-year

horizon. Paper money acts included tax legislation designed to redeem and thereby remove the

bills from circulation. To maintain fiscal credibility and feasible annual tax levels, these taxes

were spread over many years into the future.

       By contrast, spending obligations for the support of government could be met each year

out of current tax revenues. New Jersey’s legislature, however, discovered another way to meet

these support-of-government spending obligations. New Jersey subjects demanded New Jersey

government bills of credit (M) as a preferred local medium of exchange. When war expenses

were insufficient to support the legislature directly spending bills into circulation, the excess

public demand for bills meant the legislature could loan them at interest to their subjects. This

was done through a land bank mechanism. The legislature had bills printed and placed in the

colony’s treasury. Subjects could borrow them by pledging their lands as collateral. The annual

interest subjects paid on their loans was a percentage point or two below the market rate. This

incentivized subjects to borrow the bills and put them into circulation. Land-bank emissions were

always fully loaned out (Grubb 2015).

                                                                                                     5
       Land-bank loans generated annual interest income (Et) that the provincial government

could use as a revenue source, see equation (2). Subjects paid their yearly interest either in bills

or the bills’ face-value specie equivalent. By spending Et as revenue, the government kept the

bills in circulation. This interest income could be used to reduce tax revenues, i.e. by substituting

Et for Tt in equation (1). Loan principals were paid to the treasury on a fixed schedule, thus

removing the bills from circulation, see equation (3).
                N
(2)    Et = [∑ (Lt)] * i
                   t

               N
(3)    Mj = ∑          Lt
               t = j+1

L      = loan principal paid (retired) each year
E      = interest earned by the government each year
i      = yearly interest charged on loans of M

       In summary, the New Jersey provincial government met its war-spending obligations

primarily by printing and spending bills of credit (paper money). These bills were redeemed with

future taxes over a lengthy span of years. The government met its normal yearly support-of-

government spending obligations with either current tax revenues (Tt) or with interest income

earnings (Et) from loaning out paper money. Fiscal and monetary policy were intertwined.

British interference with New Jersey’s provincial fiscal structure was largely through delaying or

disallowing land-bank paper-money acts, thus altering the province’s flow of Et revenue.

              Colonial New Jersey’s Provincial Government Revenue by Source

       Table 2 shows New Jersey’s provincial government yearly revenues by source. The

amounts are adjusted for tax arrears and when those arrears were paid (Grubb 2015). There are

five revenue sources: newly printed non-land-bank bills of credit, revenue property taxes, interest

income earned on loans of paper money, duties on imports and exports, and cash transfers from


                                                                                                       6

  This amount was received in installments from 1760 through 1765. 51,321£S = 68,128.63£NJ (face value), see
Greene (1980, p. 98). Fees and exchange costs reduced the spendable portion of this amount by approximately 7.46
percent (Bush 1982, pp. 10-13, 315-6), thus reducing the 68,128.63£NJ to 63,046£NJ. See note c of Table 5.

  The counterfactual tax collection takes the difference between the counterfactual interest income and the actual
interest income and reduces the property tax collection by that amount for that year. Any positive counterfactual
interest income remaining after that subtraction is applied to prior or successive years to reduce tax collection to
zero, as long as this movement did not exceed a 10-year contiguous span. The excess counterfactual interest income
during 1771-5, after reducing the property tax collection to zero, is assumed to be applied to reducing tax collection
after 1775. The counterfactual Total Yearly Revenue in Hand differs from the actual Total Yearly Revenue in Hand

  The estimate takes the black population for New Jersey from 1710 to 1780, with linear interpolated values between
decadal benchmarks, from Carter (2006, v. 5, p. 653) as synonymous with the New Jersey slave population. For the
years 1716 through 1723, the rate of natural increase of New Jersey’s black population is assumed to be zero, thus
all the growth in the black population was through slave imports. For the years 1763 through 1775, the rate of
natural increase of New Jersey’s black population is assumed to be 1 percent, with the residual growth in the black
population being slave imports. The rate of natural increase is assumed to be about 0.5 percentage points lower in
New Jersey than the average reported for all continental North America in Fogel (1989, p. 124) because of less
frequent slave family groupings in New Jersey and because slaves brought in by settlers were not taxed. See Carter
(2006, v. 5, p. 662) on gender and adult-child ratios of the black population in New Jersey. The duty per slave
import was multiplied by these estimated numbers of slave imports for each year that the duty was operative.

the Crown (British Parliament). The Crown transfers only came near the end of the Seven Years

War and were to defray some of that war’s expenses incurred by New Jersey.

        Bills of credit loaned out through the land-bank mechanism are not counted as revenue as

the legislature could not directly spend those bills. Land-bank emissions were 36,000£NJ in 1724,

20,000£NJ in 1733, and 40,000£NJ in 1737. The legislature earned interest income on loaning

these bills, but they could not spend the principal because it was loaned out. All land-bank loans

paid 5 percent interest annually on the outstanding principal. The rest of the new emissions of

bills were a revenue source that the legislature could directly spend (Grubb 2015).

        The tax revenues in Table 2 count only taxes that yield monies the legislature could

spend. Taxes collected to redeem and retire non-land-bank bills of credit are not counted as a

revenue source. The legislature could not turn around and spend those proceeds. Bill-redemption

taxes are, in effect, counted as revenue in the newly printed bills-of-credit column.

        The data in Table 2 comes from a forensic reconstitution of accounts using primary

sources. Grubb (2015) lays out the data reconstruction exercise used to identify the newly printed

bills that could be spent as revenue by the legislature. Table 3 shows how the data on interest

income and counterfactual interest income were reconstituted from primary sources. Subtracting

the interest income designated to pay for loan administration, and interest payment arrears, yields

the net interest income available to the legislature for paying current government expenses.

        British interference with New Jersey’s fiscal structure came in the form of delaying the

implementation of the second and third land-bank emissions, from 1730 to 1733 and from 1733

to 1737, respectively. British interference then took the form of disallowing the implementation

of new land-bank acts passed in 1748 and 1769. The counterfactual calculation assumes these

acts went into effect when passed, rather than when delayed by British oversight or cancelled by

Crown disallowance. The exception is the land-bank act of 1774. This act was a resubmission of

the disallowed act of 1769. The 1774 act was also disallowed. If the 1769 act had not been

disallowed, then the 1774 act would not have been resubmitted (Grubb 2015).

        The property-tax acts to retire bills of credit spent by the legislature and to pay support-

of-government expenses had the same structure. These acts began with a statement of the amount

to be raised each year covered by the act. The acts then listed the items to be taxed and their tax

amounts per unit measured (the rateables). The items taxed typically included land; servants and

slaves; cattle, horses, and sheep; coaches and wheel chaises; merchant, shopkeeper, ferry, boat-

haulage, mill, furnace and forge, distiller, and public-house (tavern) businesses; single men who

worked for hire; the non-propertied poor; and nonresident peddlers. These acts placed taxes on

most real and personal property, along with a head tax. 2

        The acts apportioned total taxes among the counties. Assessors and collectors for

townships, districts, and counties were appointed. Every subject was required to give a list of

their estates that were rateable by the acts to their local assessor, typically by early May. The

county assessors met, typically between mid-August and early October, to compute the tax on

each rateable item to raise the sum assigned to their county. Subjects had to pay their assessed

tax to their local collectors, typically by mid-October. The collectors had to deliver their taxes to

the county collector who then had to deliver the county’s taxes to the colony’s treasury, typically

between late November and early January. These acts also listed the penalties for non-

performance of each stage.

        Some additional taxes were periodically imposed to raise revenue on the provincial level.

A few of these taxes can have their revenues estimated, but most cannot. A five year excise tax

on liquor from 1718 through 1722 was farmed out for 350£NJ per year (Bush 1977, pp. 193-5;

Grubb 2015). These sums are included in the Property Tax Collection column in Table 2. The

other taxes are reported in Table 4. They are mostly duties on imports and exports. Most of these

taxes appear to be relatively trivial, given the small tax rate, the list of exceptions to their

application, the short number of years covered, and the lack of evidence in the treasury reports

on their collection. 3

        The exception is the import tax on slaves. Its revenue is estimated in Tables 2 and 4. The

non-slave taxes in Table 4 will be ignored. Being currently not measurable, there seems little that

can be done except to note that the overall revenue estimates are biased low. The surviving

treasury reports do not itemize revenues by the item taxed. They only itemize revenues by

county, with rare exceptions noting some bit of revenue received for a specific activity. 4

          The counterfactual revenues in Table 2 are from the counterfactual interest income in

Table 3. Holding total revenue constant, this counterfactual interest income entails adjusting

revenues extracted from other sources. The assumption here is that property taxes collected for

the support of government would be reduced by the extra amount of counterfactual interest

income. This adjustment was chosen because the primary expenses paid by both revenue taxes

on property and interest income were the same. 5

        Figure 1 illustrates the tradeoff between property tax and interest income revenues. With

the first land bank in 1724, the legislature initially thought they had to use the interest to redeem

and retire the paper money. They soon learned that repayment of the principal was enough to

retire all the bills loaned, and so the interest income could be spent on other obligations. By the

late 1730s this realization allowed for a full substitution of interest income for property taxes.

        As the interest income from the third land bank, which started in 1737, waned by 1750,

New Jersey enacted a fourth land bank in 1748. This land-bank act was disallowed by the

Crown. Thus, after 1749, New Jersey had to revert to property taxes to cover support-of-

government expenses. In the half-decade after the Seven Years War, New Jersey used leftover

bills of credit printed in the last two years of that war, bills that with the end of the war were not

needed to cover further military expenses, to pay for the support of government. When that

revenue source was exhausted in 1771, the legislature wanted to use interest income from a new

land bank to cover support-of-government expenses. This act, passed at the end of 1769, was

disallowed by the Crown (Grubb 2015). Thus, New Jersey had to shift once again to revenue

property taxes to cover support-of-government expenses.

                               Colonial New Jersey’s Provincial Taxes

        Total provincial taxes imposed on New Jersey subjects are different from taxes collected

as a revenue source for the legislature to spend. This is caused by provincial monetary policy’s

effect on fiscal policy. Taxes collected for supporting current spending on the support of

government are the same as shown in Table 2. The duties in Tables 2 and 4 are not counted as

part of provincial tax burdens. Besides their amounts being largely unknown, they were also

escapable, i.e. a subject did not have to import a slave. Monetary policy, however, imposed

additional taxes that were not a current revenue source for the legislature.

        Paper money emitted as direct spending by the legislature were in the form of zero-

coupon bonds that had legislated maturity dates when the bonds would be redeemed at face value

and retired from circulation. They were redeemed through property taxes imposed explicitly for

this purpose. These tax laws were embedded in the paper money acts or in contemporaneous

ancillary revenue acts passed by the legislature. Subjects had to pay these taxes in bills at their

face value or in their face value equivalent in specie (Grubb 2015). The tax structure was the

                                                                                                      17
same for taxes to redeem bills and taxes to pay for the support of government. Table 5 shows the

yearly tax take from these two taxing sources, adjusted for when tax arrears were paid, as well as

the total tax burden per white capita in Spanish silver dollars.

        Not included in Table 5 are the provincial militia acts which imposed an in-kind tax on

men between the ages of 16 and 50 in New Jersey. 6 These men were required to muster fully

equipped with personal military gear at their expense two or three times a year. Failure to

comply resulted in cash fines. A crude measure of the value of this in-kind tax uses the cash

penalties for not appearing at muster as its shadow cost. If the cash penalty for absence from

muster was designed to dissuade non-compliance, then it overstates the true cost of this tax.

        The fine for non-appearance multiplied by the number of required musters per year is

converted into Spanish silver dollars, then multiplied by 0.26 to get an approximate tax-in-kind

value extracted per white capita per year. The 0.26 factor is used because the militia acts taxed

only males between the ages of 16 and 50, which comprised only 26 percent of the white

population in New Jersey (Carter 2006, v. 5, pp. 652, 662). Thus, the militia acts’ tax take per

white capita per year amounted to $0.38 for 1704-23, $0.45 for 1724-9, $0.31 for 1730-45, $0.36

for 1746-56, and $0.80 for 1757-75. These sums can be added to the tax burden in Table 5 to get

a biased-high estimate of the total provincial tax burden when including militia-act taxes-in-kind.

        Some provincial government expenses were funded on a fee-for-service basis and not a

tax basis, and so are not counted as part of the tax burden. Fees-for-service included: two

shillings and six pence per warrant served, one shilling per warrant issued, seven pence per sheet

of deposition taken, nine shillings for a marriage license, seven pence for entering a deed on

record for every sheet with fifteen lines to a sheet and six words to the line, and so

  Expenses were priced in £NJ “as it now passes in the Western part of the colony,” but tax amounts were listed in £NJ
at face value, see Grubb (2015). Bergen County was required to pay 197.70£NJ of tax arrears owed for 1753 in 1754
along with its full 1754 tax assessment.

  Salaries for the support of government were paid with leftover war-spending bills in the treasury. This action did
not change the tax redemption structure for redeeming and removing these bills.
c
  The 1761 bill redemption tax of 14,030.20£NJ was reduced by the amount of sterling received in 1760 from the
British Crown as war-spending compensation for 1758, and applied to the following year’s bill redemption taxes.
The amount received, reduced by fees and costs, was 8,481.78£S which equaled 11,259.56£NJ in face value. This
sum was exchanged for New Jersey bills at the colony’s treasuries in 1761 with the bills received being sunk
(destroyed) and the redemption taxes imposed on the colony’s subjects reduced by that amount for that year (Bush
1982, pp. 10-13, 315-6; Greene 1980, pp. 98, 104-5). The rest of the Crown’s reimbursements were received from
1761 into 1765. They were used to reduce bill redemption taxes and are spread over the years 1762 through 1765.
d
  In 1771 the tax accounts of the counties were audited and tax arrears assessed (Bush 1986, pp. 64-8). Tax arrears
were 18.92£NJ in 1722, 31.15£NJ in 1730, 6.15£NJ in 1731 and again in 1732, 6£NJ in 1752, and 1.59£NJ in 1753.
These amounts were subtracted from the taxes imposed in those years. These arrears, totaling 69.96£NJ, were to be
paid in 1773. This amount was added to the taxes imposed in 1773.

the fact that these fees were somewhat escapable, they are not counted here as part of the

provincial tax burden nor as provincial revenue.

        Finally, only provincial level revenues and taxes are considered. Substantial taxes were

imposed on the township and county level with the revenues generated spent on those levels.

Such taxes and expenditures involved county or township poor relief; bridge, wharf, dam,

waterworks, and road building and repair; jail, workhouse, and courthouse construction; and so

on. 8 Because the incidence and amount of these local taxes could not be discerned, they are not

counted. This means that the total tax burden, considering all levels of New Jersey government,

is understated by looking only at the provincial level tax burden. Any comparisons of tax

burdens, e.g. residents of New Jersey versus residents of Britain, must keep the differential in

these missing lower level political unit tax burdens in mind.

                               Balancing the Budget: Peace versus War

        Table 6 shows how revenues from each source were applied to cover war versus non-war

spending during both periods of war and periods of peace. It shows the dominance of using

newly printed bills of credit to pay for war, and property taxes and interest income to pay for

non-war expenses. For the most part, property taxes and interest income were current revenues

used to cover current spending. Non-land-bank bills of credit, however, were current spending

that would be balanced in the budget against future revenues. This pattern created a timing

difference in budget balancing between peace-year spending and war-year spending.

        Figure 2 shows how colonial New Jersey balanced its provincial budget for normal (non-

war) support of government spending obligations. The average yearly expenses for the support of

government derived from Table 1 were largely met with property revenue taxes, slave import

duties, and interest income. Deficiencies in this revenue source that created arrears were often

made up by surpluses in subsequent years. In two periods, deficiencies in this revenue source

were covered by bills of credit either printed with this payment intended, i.e. the late 1710s using

bills issued in the mid-1720s to cover these arrears or, by chance, with leftover bills from

unspent Seven-Years-War allocations in the 1760s.

        The taxes for redeeming bills issued to pay for wars were spread over future post-war

years. Table 5 shows these war-expense taxes lasting some six years after Queen Anne’s War,

and some 12 years after King George’s War. Taxes to redeem bills issued to pay for the Seven

Years War ran through 1783 (Grubb 2015). Balancing the budget to meet war expenses involved

an inter-temporal exercise of balancing deficits against surpluses over a multi-year horizon. This

process is shown in Table 7, where annual per white capita tax burdens from Table 5 are grouped

by war versus immediate post-war years. Tax burdens rise in the first five years after each war.

        The relatively small bills-of-credit borrowing in support of Queen Anne’s War were paid

soon after that war with tax burdens falling thereafter. The bills-of-credit borrowing in support of

King George’s War was more substantial and was spread well into the next war period. This

caused a relatively small tax burden in the 1740s and early 1750s, but a relatively high tax

burden in the late 1750s. The bills-of-credit borrowing in support of the Seven Years War was

relatively large and its tax burden was spread over the years 1765 to 1783. It caused tax burdens

to remain relatively high from 1765 to the Revolution.

      Annual Provincial Tax Burdens per White Capita: Actual versus Counterfactual

        Table 5 shows the actual yearly provincial tax burden for New Jersey subjects per white

capita. Table 8 shows the counterfactual yearly provincial tax burden per white capita removing

British interference with New Jersey provincial monetary policy. Because removing British

interference would increase, as well as alter the timing, of the interest income earned by the

legislature from loaning out paper money, it offsets some of the tax burden shown in Table 5.

Table 8 holds total revenue constant over a short window of years. Thus, added interest income

lowers the tax burden, because interest income is not a tax.

       The primary adjustments in Table 8 occur in three periods. First, the altered timing of the

counterfactual interest income from the second and third land banks eliminated the need for

revenue property taxes between 1732 and 1735. Second, from 1752 through 1759, new

counterfactual interest income from the fourth land bank reduced the amount of revenue property

taxes required. Finally, the new counterfactual interest income earned after 1770 from the fifth

land bank was more than enough to reduce revenue property taxes collected for the support of

government to zero from 1770 through 1775. The excess interest income, above that needed to

fund support-of-government expenses in these years, is assumed to have been used after 1775.

       Table 7 groups the Table 8 counterfactual tax burdens by war versus immediate post-war

                                                                                                   26
years and compares them with the actual tax burdens so grouped. Annual tax burdens per white

capita would have been 10 percent lower from 1714 through 1738, 45 percent lower from 1749

through 1754, 16 percent lower from 1755 through 1764, and 7 percent lower from 1765 through

1775 with no British interference with New Jersey’s provincial monetary policy. These are not

trivial reductions from the viewpoint of New Jersey taxpayers. Resentment over this British

interference may have contributed to revolutionary sentiment.

       Table 9 shows the counterfactual yearly provincial tax burdens per white capita for New

Jersey subjects, with no British interference with New Jersey provincial monetary policy and

with no participation in British colonial wars. More exactly, it is assumes that the British,

French, Spanish, and Americans maintained harmonious relations throughout this period. The

counterfactual calculations in Table 9 require a number of assumptions about how revenues were

adjusted when war spending was not required. What follows keeps these assumptions to a

minimum by making the least change from the actual as possible.

       Table 9 removes or redirects war revenues from Table 8. First, newly printed bills of

credit that were spent on war are assumed not to have been emitted. This also removes all the

property taxes imposed to retire these war-spending bills. Newly printed bills that were spent on

non-war activities are retained where they originally appeared. The property taxes collected to

retire newly printed bills used to pay for non-war activities are adjusted to remove only these

bills in the years when they were originally designated to be removed.

       Second, the interest income used to retire war-spending bills emitted in 1740 and 1746-7

is assumed to now be free to cover non-war expenses. This interest income, so freed, was

7,389.87£NJ. It is assumed to be used to retire the 1,253.78£NJ of new bills used in 1748 for non-

war expenditures, and then used to reduce the property taxes collected for the support of



                                                                                                  27

government in 1752, 1753, and into 1754.

       Third, being a reimbursement for war expenses, the Crown cash transfer in 1760 is

removed. Having removed this, property tax collection was increased in 1758 through 1762 to

augment the interest income earned to meet peacetime revenue requirements. Fourth, the new

bills emitted in 1763 and 1764 used to cover non-war expenditures are assumed to still be

emitted and so used. Taxes to retire these bills were originally set to be collected in 1782 and

1783. It is assumed that this remained true, and so the tax burdens for these bills do not show up

before 1775. The extra 754.50£NJ counterfactual interest income in 1762 through 1764 is

assumed to be used to reduce the property taxes needed for the support of government in 1762.

        Table 7 groups the Table 9 counterfactual tax burdens by war versus immediate post-war

years and compares them with the actual tax burdens so grouped. Annual tax burdens per white

capita would have been 22 to 34 percent lower from 1714 through 1738, and 83 to 100 percent

lower from 1749 through 1775 without British interference with New Jersey’s provincial

monetary policy and with no participation in the wars of the British Empire. War costs,

especially after 1748, overwhelmed everything else.

       The actual and the two counterfactual yearly provincial tax burdens per white capita for

New Jersey subjects are shown in Figure 3. Annual tax burdens were relatively large and highly

variable before 1720. Most of these taxes were for support-of-government obligations. Queen

Anne’s War expenses added some, but did not dominate tax burdens in these years. After 1725,

New Jersey learned how to fund support-of-government obligations out of interest income from

land-bank loans of paper money. This allowed New Jersey to substantially reduce provincial tax

burdens from pre-1725 levels, until they were zero from 1736 through 1751. Post-1751, paying

the cost of colonial wars swamped everything and drove New Jersey provincial tax burdens to

unprecedented heights. The prospect of the British adding imperial taxes to these

unprecedentedly high provincial tax burdens after 1764 would have fostered serious concern and

resentment by New Jersey subjects and so contributed to revolutionary sentiment.

                                          Conclusions

       New Jersey’s provincial legislature developed innovative and efficient ways to fund its

non-war spending obligations. They were able to drive tax burdens to zero by funding these

expenses with interest income earned by creating and loaning out government paper money to

their subjects. This paper money provided a needed local medium of exchange and so made local

transacting more efficient. In the absence of British interference with New Jersey’s provincial

monetary policy and New Jersey’s participation in the wars of the British Empire, New Jersey

could have funded its government largely without taxing its subjects.

         New Jersey’s legislature also engaged in innovative ways to fund its war-spending

obligations. They issued bills of credit that functioned as zero-coupon bonds. This allowed tax

burdens to be spread over multiple years into the future, and so allowed more spending on wars

than what could be sustained with current tax revenues alone. Spending on King George’s War

and the Seven Years War, however, was so large that it swamped all other considerations.

Provincial tax burdens peaked in the late 1750s and the early 1770s. British interference with

New Jersey’s provincial fiscal/monetary structure, and the required participation in the war of the

British Empire, were costly to New Jersey subjects in the quarter century before the Revolution.
