                                               ABSTRACT

The existing literature on the relationship between the share of elderly in a community and the support
for local public education has led to mixed results to date. One potential reason behind this is that
the share of elderly in a community is endogenous, and it is very difficult to disentangle the effects
of individuals aging in place from that of dynamic Tiebout sorting. The point of this paper is to carefully
document the degree to which aging in place has occurred in the American suburbs, and to estimate
the degree to which it has influenced school finance once the initial settlers of these suburbs were no
longer the parents of school-aged children. We hand-match data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses
of Population and Housing to more recent data to link postwar suburban development to later school
finance. Using a novel method for identifying the causal effects of aging in place, we find that the
share of elderly adults who age in place is negatively related to the level of support for public schooling,
and that this is particularly true for school districts in metropolitan areas where the school-aged population
is more heavily nonwhite relative to the elderly population.

1. Introduction
During the 1930s and early 1940s, most industry was focused on supporting the war

effort and little housing stock was being built. After World War II ended, a number of

factors caused the demand for new housing to rise dramatically. Many marriages were

postponed until servicemen returned home after the war, and following the war the

number of young married couples increased dramatically, and with them the demand for

housing. These new families were able to afford to purchase homes largely because the

Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, usually known as the GI Bill of Rights, allowed

veterans to procure low-interest mortgages with no down payments. Indeed, from 1944

to 1952, the Veteran’s Administration backed nearly 2.4 million home loans (U.S.

Department of Veterans Affairs, 2009). The influx of black workers from the rural South

also resulted in white families fleeing the central cities, where blacks generally settled, to

newly built, race-restricted areas. The developing interstate highway system allowed

these new families, who would become the parents of the Baby Boomer generation, to

move away from the central cities but still be able to commute in for work. This

movement to previously undeveloped areas allowed for easy mass production of

affordable housing, and by 1955, suburban homes comprised more than 75 percent of all

new housing stock in metropolitan areas (Jackson, 1987). In fact, more houses were

built in the United States in the ten years following World War II than in the first 45

years of the 20th century (U.S. Department of Labor, 1960). The modern American

suburb was born.



After moving to the suburbs, a substantial number of the Baby Boomers’ parents aged in

place, and, their children grown, may have begun to prefer a different mix of publicly

                                              2
provided goods. This would have put pressure on the mix of goods provided by local

governments to change, causing conflict between the wishes of these aging adults and

those of younger families moving into the suburbs. As the much larger Baby Boomer

generation itself moves into grandparenthood, the potential consequences of this

intergenerational conflict for the provision of locally provided public goods are even

larger than in the postwar era. Exploring how the mix of goods and services provided by

local governments changed as the parents of the Baby Boomers aged may give us some

insights to what may happen as the Baby Boomers themselves age in place. Aging in

place is particularly salient in an environment in which younger Americans are more

racially and ethnically heterogeneous than are the older Americans. Indeed,

demographers estimate that around 2012 non-Hispanic whites will account for less than

50 percent of births in the United States (Johnson and Lichter, 2010).



The point of this paper is to carefully document the degree to which this aging in place

has occurred, and to estimate the degree to which it has influenced school finance in the

American suburbs once the initial settlers of these suburbs were no longer the parents of

school-aged children. Using a novel method for identifying the causal effects of aging in

place, we find that the share of elderly adults who age in place is negatively related to the

level of support for public schooling, and that this is particularly true for school districts

in metropolitan areas where the school-aged population is more heavily nonwhite relative

to the elderly population.



2. Contributions to existing literature



                                               3
There is a substantial literature exploring how intergenerational conflict has affected the

provision of public education. Most of these papers have focused on how an increase in

the elderly population in an area affects school revenues, but the results of these studies

have been inconclusive, and seem to vary with the level of aggregation and the empirical

specifications used. In a panel of Texas counties, Miller (1996) finds that the fraction

elderly have a significant negative impact on education spending, but the effect is

statistically insignificant in a panel of 48 states. Poterba (1997) finds in a state-level

panel that per-child education spending falls as the state’s fraction elderly rises.

However, the effect is not statistically significant if a measure of urbanicity is included.

Poterba does find that the states where the elderly are “whiter” than school-aged children

have significantly lower education spending. Ladd and Murray (2001) conduct an

analysis similar to Poterba’s, but at the county level with county and time fixed effects to

capture within-state differences in education finance. They find the elderly to have no

significant effect on school spending, but like Poterba, find that racial heterogeneity

between the elderly and school-aged children negatively affects spending. Harris, Evans

and Schwab (2001) conduct a school-district level analysis and find that a larger share of

elderly in the district significantly lowers education spending, but that the magnitude of

the effect is small. Fletcher and Kenny (2008) examine how an increase in a county’s

fraction elderly affects the identity of the median voter, and, like Harris, Evans and

Schwab, find that more elderly are associated with a small but statistically significant

decrease in education spending.




                                              4
A few authors have directly examined how the elderly affect votes on school bond

initiatives. Button (1992) performs a precinct-level analysis of the determinants of the

fraction voting for education bond initiatives in six Florida counties with large elderly

populations. He finds that precincts with a larger share of voters aged 55 or older had

fewer voters choosing to approve the initiative. Brunner and Balsdon (2004) use survey

data of individual voters on school bond initiatives in California to get direct evidence on

how a voter’s characteristics might be related to his choice at the ballot box, and find that

the elderly were less likely than younger voters to support the initiatives.



A number of authors have noted that while the elderly prefer less education spending than

younger families because of intergenerational conflict, there are some factors that might

still cause them support education. One such factor is the capitalization of better school

quality into housing prices. In a school district-level analysis, Hilber and Mayer (2009)

find evidence that there is greater capitalization of school quality into house prices, and

thus more support for education spending by the elderly, when little land is available for

development. As suburbs are developing, they are surrounded by easily developed land,

and as the suburbs fill in this land becomes more scarce and expensive. This would

suggest that as the suburbs age along with the people living in them, those people should

become more supportive of education as time passes. The results supporting the

capitalization of school quality into housing prices, and the role this may play in elderly

support for school spending, mirrors the findings of Black (1999) and Figlio and Lucas

(2004) that indicate that measured school quality is highly valued in the housing market.

Reback (2009) demonstrates the importance of the tax price in determining the degree to



                                              5
which elderly residents support school spending, and suggests that state-financed targeted

tax price subsidies to elderly homeowners may be an effective mechanism to reduce the

likelihood of intergenerational conflict.



Other authors, including Fletcher (2004) and Berkman and Plutzer (2004) have looked at

county-level migration patterns of the elderly to explain differences in school spending.

These authors argue that those elderly aging in place will be more invested in the

community and its youth, and this will be manifested by higher education spending in

locations with more long-term elderly. The results of both of these studies suggest that

more elderly aging in place are associated with increased school spending, while a higher

fraction of elderly migrants is associated with decreased school spending. There is also

some evidence that the relative age of the elderly inmigrants affects support for education

spending, however. Tosun, Williamson and Yakovlev (2005) find that counties with a

larger number of elderly between the ages of 55 and 74 moving into the county will

increase education spending, while more elderly aged 75 or older moving in will depress

it. If this effect is similar for those residents aging in place, we might expect to see

support for education erode as time passes.



This paper takes on a related but somewhat different question from the literature on

intergenerational conflict. The results from the existing literature regarding the

relationship between age distributions and school revenues and spending could be due to

the aging in place of the community, but age distributions could also be endogenous with

respect to school revenues and spending due to Tiebout (1956) sorting. We seek to map



                                              6
out the broad sweep of postwar suburbanization, identifying the areas where young

families have settled, and documenting the degree to which they have aged in place rather

than sorted on variables salient to education spending. We use data from the suburbs of

20 Northeastern and Midwestern cities during the period of postwar suburbanization to

explore how support for education changed as the Baby Boomers’ parents aged in place,

changing the age distribution of the suburbs. Of course, the difficult question is whether

changes in the demographics of a community are due to aging in place versus dynamic

Tiebout sorting.



We are able to make substantial progress toward disentangling the effects of aging in

place from the confounding effects of dynamic Tiebout sorting by making two major new

contributions to this literature. First, we make use of statistical life tables published by

the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2006) to forecast when individual

adults of given age at a certain time were most likely to die. We can therefore identify

the component of a school district's changing demographics due to aging in place, as

opposed to Tiebout sorting, by assuming that every adult at a certain point in time would

remain in the same house until they die and then would be randomly replaced by a

newcomer. When we do this exercise, we find that aging in place is much more

important than is Tiebout sorting in explaining over-time changes in a school district's

age distribution.



Our second major contribution is to try to determine the degree to which the early age

distribution (circa 1960) of the population in a given suburb is itself related to initial



                                               7
Tiebout sorting. We find that, as of 1960, there is little relationship between the age of a

school district's residents and the population's income or education level. As nobody has

previously matched Census data to school districts prior to 1970, we hand-match 1960

Census tracts to school districts so that we can link the initial attributes of suburban

communities to their later demographic changes and school finance. The result of these

two innovations is that we can make a considerably more credible claim regarding the

causal effects of aging in place per se on school district finances. When doing so, we

find that an increase in the fraction of adults aged 65 and older is negatively related to

school revenues per pupil. These results have substantial consequences for the future of

school finance in the United States, as the much larger Baby Boomer generation is now

apparently aging in place.



3. The relationship between school district age distribution and school finance

Our identification strategy requires using historical data to forecast the age distributions

that will occur as suburban school districts age over time. Because Census data at the

school district level have never been collected for years prior to 1970, it was necessary to

hand-match school district boundaries to Census tracts in the pre-1970 years. This is

only possible, however, in a subset of metropolitan areas in which the Census collected

tract information in the years prior to 1970. As some of our models require data as far

back as the 1950 Census, we therefore limit our analysis to metropolitan areas with

Census tract data in 1950. We concentrate on the American cities that were already

beginning to suburbanize in postwar America, so that we can maximize the possibility of




                                              8
following the parents of the Baby Boom generation from young parenthood through

retirement.



The great majority of these cities were in the Northeast and Midwest; indeed, 21 of the 27

cities whose suburbs were partially tracted by the Census in 1950 were in these regions.

We view suburban Census tracting as a proxy for suburbanization because the Census

Bureau aimed to divide into tracts all urbanized areas with significant population

surrounding a central city. We choose not to focus on Southern cities for several reasons.

First, the prevalence of county-level school systems in the South are not ideal for the

discussion of this topic. Second, Southern central cities made more use of suburban

annexation relative to cities in the Midwest and Northeast that were more likely ringed by

incorporated areas by 1950. Finally, the widespread de jure racial segregation of schools

in the South covers much of our study period. Among Western cities, only Los

Angeles's, Oakland's, San Diego's and Seattle's suburbs were significantly tracted in

1950, and mapping Census tracts in 1950 and 1960 to school districts in Los Angeles is

much more challenging than in the Northeast and Midwest because of major changes in

school district boundaries over time.1 In our analysis, we also exclude New York City,

because only a portion of New York's surrounding developed areas were included in the

1950 Census tracting. Therefore, our analysis focuses on the suburbs of 20 cities.

  The tracted areas adjacent to Oakland, San Diego and Seattle in 1950 are in relatively large cities
themselves, as opposed to the smallish suburbs on which we are concentrating, for the most part, in this
analysis.


                                                     9
In order to know the degree to which our results may be representative of a larger set of

school districts than those in the 20 metropolitan areas for which we have hand-matched

school district boundaries to Census tracts, we begin our analysis by estimating as best

we can the same model specifications as those reported by Harris, Evans and Schwab

(2001). Harris, Evans and Schwab carefully matched Census of Governments data from

1972, 1982 and 1992, which contains school district financial information, to the three

closest decennial Censuses of Population (1970, 1980 and 1990), at the school district

level. We are grateful to Harris, Evans and Schwab for sharing their data with us. They

estimated their model for the balanced panel of school districts with valid data in all three

rounds of data2, and excluded school districts with implausibly large or implausibly small

values of the fiscal variables that they considered.



To benchmark our analysis against the school district-level analyses in the literature, we

begin by estimating the closest equivalent that we can to Harris, Evans and Schwab's

most-preferred specification, model 2 in Table 4 (p.464). They estimate a balanced panel

of school district log total revenues per pupil, over the three rounds of data, with school

district fixed effects and state-by-year fixed effects as well as controls for the percentage

of housing units that are owner-occupied, the percentage of population that is nonwhite,

the percentage of population below the poverty line, the log of median household income,

the log of federal revenues per capita, the percentage of the over-25 population that is a

high school dropout, high school graduate, or has some college, the log of district


2The 1970 Census data were much less comprehensive at the school district level than were the 1980 and
1990 data. Harris, Evans and Schwab (2001) provide a careful delineation of exactly where they lose
observations, and we followed their description of their inclusion criteria as well as we could.


                                                  10
population, and interactions between whether the state's school finance system had been

overturned by the courts as of the date in question and dummies for the quintile of

median family income in 1970. The variables of primary interest are the share of the

population aged 65 or older and the share of the population aged 0 to 19. Harris, Evans

and Schwab weight the school districts by district enrollment, and we do the same for

consistency. Table 1 presents summary statistics for our dependent variables of interest,

our key explanatory variables and covariates from the 1970 - 1990 Censuses.



All of our analyses in this paper have the log of total per pupil revenues as the dependent

variable; our results are very comparable if we use the log of per pupil local revenues

instead. We report the results using only one dependent variable to save space. Our

replication of Harris, Evans and Schwab's (2001) findings is reported in the first column

of Table 2. We obtain very similar findings to those reported in their paper: our

coefficient on the fraction of the population aged 65 or older is slightly lower than theirs

(-0.852 as compared with -0.886) and our coefficient on the fraction of the population

aged 0 to 19 is slightly higher than their estimate (-0.985 as compared with -0.907), but

the results are fundamentally extremely similar. Because we employ the more

conservative robust standard errors, our standard errors are nearly three times as large as

theirs, but both point estimates remain very strongly statistically significant.



In addition to having a smaller sample size due to using data from just the suburbs of 20

metropolitan areas, our preferred model makes several additional refinements to the

Harris, Evans and Schwab approach. For one, we are concerned about the endogeneity of



                                              11
the time-varying district variables. Much of the energy in the paper is spent addressing

the endogeneity of the key variables -- those representing the age distribution -- but in

addition, we worry about the inclusion of covariates reflecting owner-occupancy, racial

composition, education levels, household income, etc., that are likely to be endogenous

with school district revenues and spending. In addition, we prefer a political economy

model in which we look more at the decision-making units in a school district, so we

reformulate the two age variables as the fraction of adults aged 65 or older (as opposed to

fraction of population aged 65 or older) and the fraction of households with children (as

opposed to the fraction of the population aged 0 to 19). The remaining columns of Table

2 consider what happens as we change the model specification and study sample along

these lines.



As we move from the first column (Harris, Evans and Schwab's model specification) to

the second column (the specification excluding the covariates most likely to be

endogenous), we observe that the point estimates of the age variables of interest remain

very similar -- the coefficient on the fraction of the population aged 65 or older decreases

slightly and the coefficient on the fraction of the population aged 0 to 19 increases

slightly. We therefore believe that the inclusion of the potentially endogenous covariates

does not influence the key findings of interest, and all subsequent model specifications

exclude these covariates. Moving from the second column to the third column (the

alternative measure of the age variables) yields substantively similar findings; the

coefficient estimates are smaller but the units have changed. A one standard deviation

increase in either variable is related to a similarly-sized change in the dependent variable.



                                             12
As a consequence, we conclude that our choices of definitions of the key age variables do

not influence the estimated relationships of interest in a meaningful way.



Having moved from Harris, Evans and Schwab's preferred specification to our preferred

specification (different definitions of age variables and fewer potentially endogenous

covariates), we can now see what happens when we restrict the sample size to school

districts in the suburbs of our 20 metropolitan areas -- only about one-tenth of the total

number of school districts in the balanced panel. We hand-matched school district

boundaries using the earliest maps we could find in each case to Census tract maps from

1950 and 1960, following the rule that if a Census tract was split between multiple school

districts, we assigned the tract to the school district that occupied the majority of the tract.

We were able to match school districts to one or more Census tracts in 100 percent of the

cases in which the geographical areas were covered by Census tracts in the relevant

years. In a fraction of cases (18.5 percent of all school districts), historical Census tracts

were large enough that they subsumed multiple school districts in their entirety (or at

least the vast majority of the districts). In these cases, we assigned the Census tract

populations to all of the relevant school districts, and in results available upon request, we

find that our results do not substantively vary whether or not we include or exclude the

school districts where Census tracts are too large to uniquely identify the school districts.

All told, of the 1396 suburban school districts in the 20 metropolitan areas in our study,

1252 were in the metropolitan areas in the 1970 area definitions. Among these school

districts, 1004 were in tracted suburban areas during the 1960 Census, and 818 of these

districts could be uniquely matched to 1960 Census tracts. Of these school districts, 600



                                              13
were in suburban areas tracted in the 1950 Census, and 510 districts can be uniquely

matched to Census tracts in 1950.



The fourth column of Table 2 presents the analog to the model in the third column of

Table 2, except that only the school districts in tracted suburban areas in the 1960 Census

in our metropolitan areas are included. This sample provides the foundation for our

analysis. We include only 964 of the 1004 school districts in tracted suburban areas in

our analysis because 40 of the 1004 school districts did not meet the criteria for inclusion

in Harris, Evans and Schwab's balanced panel. As can be seen in the fourth column, the

coefficients and standard errors are both proportionately larger in the more limited

sample as compared with the full sample of school districts. Therefore, there is reason to

believe that the relationship between age and school finance may be somewhat more

extreme in the sample for which we can construct our instrumental variables analysis --

though the results are still qualitatively similar across columns. Finally, because some of

our analysis involves only data from 1980 and 1990, we repeat the same specification but

limit the sample to just those observations for school districts in our data in the years

1980 and 1990. Those results, reported in the fifth column of Table 2, present similar

estimates to those seen in the fourth column.



We consider two other refinements to our model, both involving finer degrees of

geography-time-specific fixed effects. It may be that our covariates are not picking up

enough of the localized amenities that might influence both the age distribution of a

school district and the demand for school spending in that district. One possible way of



                                             14
controlling for these differences is to segment the suburbs of a given city into geographic

areas based on different compass points. There is no inherently obvious way to do this,

but given Baum-Snow's (2007) finding that the interstate highway system led to

suburbanization, we coded all school districts in a metropolitan area into a set of

segments based on the number of radiating interstate highways spread outward from the

central city, and repeat the specification from column 4 (that is, the specification using

suburban data from 1970, 1980 and 1990), but controlling for metropolitan area times

compass direction times year fixed effects. These results, reported in column 6, are very

similar to those reported in column 4.



As an alternative specification, we stratify all school districts by the percentage of adults

in 1970 with at least a high school degree -- the median level of education among adults

in 1970. When we divide each metropolitan area into quartiles based on the level of

education of the adults in the school district, and control for education-specific-

metropolitan area by year fixed effects (so that we are comparing school districts in a

metropolitan area to others in the metropolitan area with the same education levels in the

same year, and also still controlling for other observables.) These results, reported in

column 7 of Table 2, remain quite similar to those reported in column 4.



In summary, across a wide range of fixed effects model specifications, including

restricting our analysis to the school districts in the metropolitan areas with early Census

tracting, we find broadly consistent evidence that school district revenues per pupil are

inversely related to both the fraction of adults (or fraction of the total population) over



                                              15
age 65 as well as the fraction of households with children (or the fraction of the

population aged 0 to 19.) These results are consistent both with a political economy story

regarding the elderly having lower levels of support for public schooling, as well as a

congestion story in which the more children for any given tax base, the more broadly the

revenues and expenditures are spread across pupils. The key question, however, is

whether these results suffer from endogeneity bias. The fixed effects regression results

reported in Table 2 (and in the prior literature) could actually be due to reverse causation

-- perhaps older people have been Tiebout sorting into lower-spending school districts.

The elderly population of a suburb could be present because those individuals moved into

the suburbs as young adults and aged in place. Alternatively, the characteristics of a

particular suburb could lead to dynamic sorting, where households with similar

characteristics --- such as age --- would tend to move to the same areas. It will be very

important to disentangle the effects of aging in place from the confounding effects of

dynamic Tiebout sorting. The principal purpose of this paper is to propose several novel

attempts to separate the two confounding phenomena.



4. Aging in place versus dynamic Tiebout sorting

An aging in place story would indicate that young families tend to have children, settle

down in the suburbs, and stay in their homes. Therefore, the first place to start in an

investigation of the degree to which aging in place explains over-time changes in a school

district's age distribution is to present information describing the extent to which these

potential relationships are true. We begin by investigating the probability that a

household with a head of any given age would have children. To do this, we use data



                                             16
from the Integrated Public-Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) to identify the fraction of

suburban households with children, by age of the head of household, in the 1970, 1980

and 1990 Census years. As can be seen in Figure 1, the overwhelming majority of

younger families -- those with household heads younger than 45 -- who live in the

suburbs have children. This was even more the case in 1970, but even in 1990, when

fewer suburban households had children at nearly all age groups, the pattern is that young

suburban families have children at home. And in fact, the fraction of suburban families

with children at home remains robust even into the older age brackets: For example,

about 25 percent of those aged 55 to 59 (20 percent in 1990) and over 10 percent of those

aged 60 to 64 had children at home in these years.



But are the suburbs largely populated by families with children, who then settle down?

Figure 2 reports the fraction of suburban heads of households who are relative

newcomers (those who lived in their current home for five or fewer years) by age of

household head, in the 1990 Census.3 As can be seen, most young families have moved

into their current residence relatively recently, but by age 45 or so, the fraction who are

newcomers begins to plateau, and by the time the household is elderly, fewer than 20

percent of households were new to their home within the five previous years.

Importantly, however, in the younger age groups, it is apparent that suburban families

without children are more transient than are those with children at home: For age groups

younger than 50, suburban families without children are about ten percentage points more

likely to be newcomers in their homes than are suburban families with children. By age

                                                     17
50, however, the two relationships begin to converge. These results present additional

suggestive evidence that suburban residents were more likely to settle down once they

had children at home, and then after the children left home they were unlikely to leave.



This last point is particularly clear when one observes Figure 3, which presents the

distributions of length of tenure at the current residence, by age, in the suburbs of the 20

metropolitan areas in this study, as reported in the 1990 Census. Young households have

lived in the suburbs for a much shorter period of time than their older counterparts: more

than three quarters of households aged less than 30 have lived in their current home 5 or

fewer years, compared to the one third of households aged 65 and older living in their

current suburban home for more than 30 years.



In order to think about the comparison between dynamic Tiebout sorting and aging in

place in the suburbs, it is first important to understand the development of the suburb in

postwar America. We therefore begin by describing the development of the suburbs

surrounding these 20 cities during the period from 1950 through 1990. The first five

columns of Table 3 present the percentage of the total population in these metropolitan

areas who reside in the central city (or cities, in a few cases, such as Minneapolis-St.

Paul) in each of the first five postwar Census rounds. By design, all of these areas had at

least some significant suburbanization in process by the time of the 1950 Census, but in

all cases but one (Boston), the majority of the metropolitan population in areas tracted by

the Census resided in the central city as of 1950. Excluding the Boston area, where two-

thirds of the urbanized population resided outside of the central city in 1950, the fraction



                                             18
residing in tracted suburbs ranged from 11 percent outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul to 47

percent outside of Cincinnati.



Within just ten years, the fraction of the urbanized population in suburban areas rose

considerably in most of these cities, and held steady only in the case of Kalamazoo. By

1960, the fraction of the urbanized area's population residing in tracted suburbs ranged

from 24 percent in the areas surrounding Columbus to 74 percent in the areas surrounding

Boston. Minneapolis-St. Paul's tracted suburbs, which accounted for just 11 percent of

the urbanized population of the area in 1950, had 37 percent of the area residents in 1960.

Cincinnati, the city with the most relatively populous suburbs other than Boston in 1950,

experienced suburban population growth from 47 percent of metropolitan population in

1950 to 60 percent of metropolitan population in 1960. The pattern of suburbanization

continued in 1970, with suburban population ranging from 52 percent of Milwaukee's

metropolitan area to 84 percent of Hartford's metropolitan area.



After 1970, the growth of suburbanization continued, but at a slower pace, in these cities.

By 1990, suburban population ranged from 59 percent of Milwaukee's metropolitan area

to 87 percent of Hartford's metropolitan area. While the fraction of the metropolitan

population continued to grow in all 20 areas, in only three cases (Flint, Indianapolis, and

Minneapolis-St. Paul) did the proportion within the suburbs increase by more than ten

percentage points between 1970 and 1990, as compared with the period from 1950 to

1970, when the smallest change (Boston) was 14 percentage points and 15 of the 20 cities

experienced suburban population share increases of more than 25 percentage points.



                                            19
The final three columns of Table 3 describe an area-by-area breakdown of the percentage

of 1990-era metropolitan area school districts in tracted areas in the 1950, 1960 and 1970

Censuses. We look here at 1990-era school districts because our analysis follows school

district spending from the time around the 1970 Census to the time around the 1990

Census. This table echoes the previous discussion that a large fraction of postwar

suburbanization in these metropolitan areas had taken place by 1970. The final column

reflects the fact that in many of these areas, by 1970 the metropolitan area had expanded

spatially about as much as it would (though, of course, since metropolitan areas are

defined at the county level, except in New England, rural portions of counties included in

metropolitan areas continue to urbanize to this day.) In ten of the 20 metropolitan areas,

100 percent of the school districts in 1990 were included in the metropolitan area's

boundaries by 1970.4 The preceding two columns of Table 3 present the percentages of

1990 school districts that were in tracted areas in 1950 and 1960. In 1950, some present-

day metropolitan areas were already heavily tracted; 54 percent of Boston's 1990-era

school districts are in areas tracted in 1950, while 60 percent of Cleveland's 1990-era

school districts are in areas tracted in 1950. And the entire Philadelphia-Camden

metropolitan area as of 1990 was tracted in 1950. By 1960, Chicago had joined

Philadelphia-Camden as being entirely tracted, and St. Louis, Buffalo-Niagara Falls and

Pittsburgh were close behind.

 Kalamazoo, Columbus and Minneapolis-St. Paul have experienced the largest proportionate growth in
metropolitan area boundaries since 1970.


                                                 20
It is apparent from Table 3 that the suburbs in any given metropolitan area developed at

different times, and one would therefore expect that by 1970, the first year for which we

have both financial and population data, there would be considerable heterogeneity in the

age distributions across the suburbs of a metropolitan area. And, indeed, this is what

appears to be the case. Table 4 presents, by metropolitan area, both the percentage of

school districts with a median adult age 45 or older in 1970, as well as the minimum,

mean and maximum percentage of adults in the school district aged 65 or older in 1970.

The table reports these statistics for two different groups of school districts: all districts

within the 1990 metropolitan area boundaries and all districts within the 1970

metropolitan area boundaries.



One observes that there existed vast differences across metropolitan areas in the typical

age of suburban residents in 1970. Following the 1990 definition of metropolitan areas, it

is evident that while some areas had relatively old suburban residents -- 71 percent of

Pittsburgh suburbs had a median adult aged 45 or older, as did 58 percent of Bridgeport's

suburbs and 51 percent of St. Louis's suburbs -- some areas had very young suburban

residents as of 1970 -- not a single suburb of Flint had a median adult aged 45 or older,

and only 20 or 21 percent of Akron's, Dayton's and Indianapolis's suburbs had a median

adult aged 45 or above. The contrast is even stronger if one restricts the analysis to the

set of suburban school districts in the 1970 definition of metropolitan areas, where

Bridgeport, Pittsburgh and St. Louis have the same percentage of school districts with a

median adult aged 45 and over, while Flint, Kalamazoo and Minneapolis-St. Paul all had




                                               21
three or fewer percent of the suburban school districts with a median adult resident aged

45 or older.



Furthermore, within each of the 20 metropolitan areas, there existed dramatic variation in

the age distributions of suburban school districts as of 1970. No school districts had

more than 30 percent of adults aged 65 and older, and in only one metropolitan area

(Philadelphia) was there at least one school district where the median adult was 55 or

older. However, in 7 metropolitan areas there was at least one school district where at

least 25 percent of the adult population was aged 65 or older, and in 11 metropolitan

areas there was at least one school district where at least 40 percent of the adult

population was aged 55 or older.5 In every one of these 11 metropolitan areas, there

was another school district where fewer than 18 percent of the adult population was aged

55 or older. While not reported in the table, the within-metropolitan area standard

deviation in the percentage aged 65 and over ranges from 2.4 percentage points

(Bridgeport) to 6.2 percentage points (Minneapolis/St. Paul), with most metropolitan

areas having standard deviations in around 4 percentage points. In summary, by 1970,

when the majority of the Baby Boom generation was still in elementary or secondary

school, there existed considerable variation within every metropolitan area in the relative

age of the population of the school districts. If adults tend to age in place, this would

indicate that some school districts in each metropolitan area would have their median

adult be without children in school considerably sooner than would other school districts.



5
 For ease of explication, the remainder of this discussion will be based on the 1970 definition of the
metropolitan areas.


                                                     22
One question, of course, is whether individuals actually age in place. It is apparent from

Table 5 that individual suburbs that were relatively old in 1970 remained relatively old in

later years as well, a pattern consistent with aging in place of suburban residents. The

suburbs of each MSA in our sample are rank-sorted by the 1970 decile of average age.

As the 1970 deciles increase, the percentile rankings in the later years are almost

monotonically increasing as time passes. The suburbs that were relatively young in 1970

remained relatively young in 1980 and 1990, and the suburbs that were relatively old in

1970 remained relatively old in 1980 and 1990. While there has been some convergence

over time -- the youngest decile in 1970 averaged being at the 13.8th percentile in 1980

and the 20.4th percentile in 1990, while the oldest decile in 1970 averaged being at the

85th percentile in 1980 and the 76.5th percentile in 1990 -- the rank-ordering over time

remains strongly consistent. These results are consistent with a story of aging in place.

However, they are also consistent with a story of dynamic Tiebout sorting, in which

suburbs with a particular age distribution may be more likely to attract similar-aged

newcomers.



Therefore, it is necessary to forecast what the age distribution would have been were

everyone to solely age in place over time. In a world with no dynamic Tiebout sorting

based on age, each household living in a school district would remain in their home until

they die, and at that point would be replaced by a newcomer household of the average

age of all newcomers in the metropolitan area. We computed the average age of

newcomer households -- which we define as those who moved to their current house

within the past two years -- in each metropolitan area in 1980 and 1990 using IPUMS



                                             23
data; the average newcomer age ranged from 31.9 to 36.1 in 1980 and from 34.4 to 37.2

in 1990.6 We use the life tables for adults of various ages in 1970 reported by the Social

Security Administration (2005) to predict when the adults would die; for example, the life

tables indicate that 8.7 percent of adults in youngest-decile school districts in 1970 would

die by 1980, while 20.0 percent of adults in oldest-decile school districts would die by

1980. By 1990, 19.1 percent of adults in the youngest-decile school districts would have

died, according to the 1970 life tables, while 36.8 percent of adults in the oldest-decile

school districts would have died. We assume that if the last person in a household died in

1974, he or she would be replaced by a new averaged-aged newcomer household in 1974

-- we use the next Census year to ascribe the age -- at which point that household would

begin to age in place.



Table 6 presents the predicted degree to which the hierarchy of age distributions in

suburban school districts would have changed if only aging in place and replacement

with average-aged newcomers taken place (which we'll call "random replacement.")7

One observes that with aging in place there would have been some compression in the

distribution of ages across school districts in a metropolitan area. (This would happen

because older school districts are more likely to have higher death rates with replacement

by average-aged newcomers.) For instance, the typical top-decile school district in 1970

would rank at the 84th percentile in 1980 and the 75th percentile in 1990 were there to be


6In practice, the calculations change only trivially if we instead ascribe the same newcomer age to all
metropolitan areas.

7Average-aged newcomers have some probability of death prior to 1980 and 1990 as well, and those
predicted to have died are then replaced in our calculations with new average-age newcomers in the year of
death.


                                                     24
only aging in place with random replacement. The ninth decile school district in 1970

would rank at the 76.6th percentile in 1980 and the 70th percentile in 1990. As can be

seen, the typical gap between the aging-in-place predictions and the realized predictions

is very small -- only 3.5 percentiles in 1980 and 3.7 percentiles in 1990. Excluding the

two youngest deciles, where there has been even more compression than what would

have been predicted by aging in place alone and are older than what would have been

predicted (perhaps because very young adults are less settled than older adults), the

typical gap is smaller still -- only 2.7 percentiles in both 1980 and 1990. It is clear that

the realized age distributions comport very closely with the age distributions that would

have been predicted were the residents in 1970 simply aging in place over time. The

correlation between the average realized age in 1980 and the average predicted age in

1980 based on aging in place is 0.78, and the correlation between the average realized

age in 1990 and the average predicted age in 1990 based on aging in place is 0.70. This

is a very high degree of correlation, and the reality of the correlation is likely higher still

since our calculations are based on predicted deaths rather than actual deaths.

Regardless, these calculations provide strong evidence that, while dynamic sorting might

affect the over-time stability in suburban age distributions, aging in place is the major

driver.



Table 7 provides more evidence that dynamic sorting is not a major determinant of

suburban age distributions. In the first panel, Census tracts as of 1990 are rank-sorted by

the fraction of the households in residence for more than one year that are aged less than




                                               25
30.8 For each of these quartiles, the fraction of the newest households --- those moving in

one year previously or less --- in each age group are shown. If dynamic sorting is

important, then new residents should be sorting into locations where the current residents

are of the same age, so in the first panel we would expect to see much larger fractions of

those aged less than 30 as we move down the table. In fact, the increase is quite small,

rising only five percentage points from the suburbs with the fewest to the most young

residents. A similar pattern can be seen in panel B, where the fraction of newcomers

aged 65 and older rises by less than three percentage points from the first to the last row.9

Note that the fraction of the youngest newcomers also rises somewhat as we move to the

last row of the table.



5. Instrumental variables results

Given that we can strongly predict the age distribution of a school district over time using

forecasts assuming that adults age in place and are randomly replaced when they die, and

that aging in place appears to be the most important determinant of over-time changes in

the age distribution in a school district, we propose that predicted age distributions based

on the 1970 age distribution and aging in place with random replacement can be used as

instruments for the actual age distributions in 1980 and 1990. This instrumental variables

approach would rule out the changes in school district ages over time that are due to

dynamic Tiebout sorting and concentrate only on the changes over time predicted based



8These data are not observed at the school district level of aggregation, so the best that we can do is the
Census tract.

9Similar patterns can be seen in tables where tracts are rank-sorted by percentage of current residents in
different age groups. These tables are available on request from the authors.


                                                      26
on "natural" patterns. We therefore repeat the regressions from Table 2, but using the

1970 or 1960 age distributions to predict the fraction elderly and fraction of children in

the district in later years. The results of these instrumental variables regressions are

shown in Table 8. Here, we can only look at the 1980 and 1990 Census years because the

1970 Census year is used to generate the instruments for later years. For presentation

convenience, we report only the key parameter estimates in this table, but we control for

all of the same covariates as in column 5 of Table 2.



As can be seen in the first two columns of Table 8, the instruments -- predicted fraction

of adults aged 65 and up and predicted fraction of the households with children --

predicted using the 1970 age distributions10 have very strong first-stage explanatory

power. The partial R-squared is 0.47 for share of adults aged 65 and older and 0.41 for

share of households with children, and the F-statistic is 847 and 668, respectively. The

second stage results have signs consistent with those in Table 2, although the magnitudes

and standard errors are both considerably larger than before. Therefore, there is still

strong evidence that as a community ages in place, the level of school revenues per pupil

declines.



Of course, if the age distributions in 1980 and 1990 are endogenous with respect to

education revenues, the age distributions in previous years may be endogenous as well.

We suspect that while the postwar boom in suburbs was occurring during the 1950s and


10We use the share of householders in each age group with children generated from the 1980 and 1990
IPUMS data for the suburbs of the 20 metropolitan areas, and predict the number of householders in each
age group using the same methods used to predict the percentage of adults aged 65 and older.


                                                   27
early 1960s, sorting was more exogenous, and we therefore repeat the same analysis

using age distributions predicted based on the 1960 Census data that we hand-matched to

school districts. (This has the added advantage of being able to use predicted age

distributions in 1970, 1980 and 1990, as opposed to just 1980 and 1990.) Table 9

presents these instrumental variables results. As can be seen, the first stage results

remain extremely strong, and the pattern of coefficients and statistical significance in the

second stage remains consistent.



6. Tiebout sorting by age prior to 1960?

It may still be the case that the age distribution as of 1960 might reflect Tiebout sorting,

and older families that sorted into certain suburbs at the beginning of postwar

suburbanization may, for some reason, have been on a different trajectory of demands for

public schooling as they aged in place than would have younger families. Predicting age

distributions throughout the following several decades would thus be more satisfying if

the suburbs with older residents and the suburbs with younger residents in 1960 were

otherwise similar demographically. We therefore stratify school districts by their

position in the within-metropolitan area age distribution, and see whether the average

income or education levels of the adults in the school district are related to their ages.



Table 10 displays the educational attainment (percent with less than a high school degree)

and log of average family income in these suburbs, by age decile of the residents. As we

move from the youngest to the oldest suburbs, there is some variation in the values of

these variables, but they show no discernable pattern. The top two age deciles have the



                                              28
highest levels of family income, but this may be due to the natural pattern of increasing

income with age, rather than Tiebout sorting; indeed, when we regression-adjust log of

average family income for household age and metropolitan area fixed effects, we see that

there is no residual relationship between school district age and residual income. These

results suggest that school districts with older residents do not have systematically

different types of residents -- at least along the lines of income and education.



What, then, could explain why some school districts have older residents than others, as

of 1960? Our proposition is that young families settled the new housing in the postwar

suburbs, suggesting that suburbs with younger adults would also have newer housing

stock, in general. To investigate this possibility, we include in Table 10 the percentage of

homes (as of 1960) built in the 1950s and the percentage of homes (as of 1960) built

postwar. We observe that the suburbs with the youngest adults are the suburbs with the

newest housing stock. As we move from the suburbs with the youngest adults to the

oldest, the fraction of homes built in the previous decade falls dramatically: 62 percent of

homes were built in the previous decade for suburbs with the youngest residents, while

less than 22 percent were built in the previous decade in the suburbs with the oldest

residents. Similarly, the fraction of homes built postwar falls from 76 percent to 34

percent as we move from the suburbs with the youngest to the oldest residents.

Therefore, within a metropolitan area, the youngest suburban developments also tended

to be the newest. While we do not have information about why exactly one suburb

developed five or ten years before another suburb in a metropolitan area, there is

therefore strong evidence that (1) the earlier-developing suburbs had older residents as of



                                             29
1960, but (2) these suburbs with older residents do not appear to have residents with

different levels of income and education. This presents at least some evidence that the

1960 age distribution, and the nature of the housing stock as of 1960, may be exogenous

to future school district finances.



As an additional approach, we can go one step further and assume that someone of

average age purchased a house when it was built, aged in place until they died, when

another average-aged person (at the time) purchased the house and aged in place until

they died, and so on. In order to have some elapsed time between housing building and

the fiscal variables (because the fiscal variables could contemporaneously affect the

timing of new construction) we capture the age distribution of the school district's

housing stock as of the 1960 Census. This requires merging together the 1950 and 1960

Censuses, because the 1960 Census only identifies structure age as built in the 1950s,

built in the 1940s, or built before 1940, while the 1950 Census identifies housing

structures as built in the 1940s, built in the 1930s, built in the 1920s, or built before 1920.

So long as we assume that no housing present in 1950 was torn down between 1950 and

196011 we can combine these two years of Census data for the school districts tracted as

of the 1950 Census and have a full set of housing age by decade from pre-1920 through

the 1950s.12 Using these data, we can predict the age distributions in 1970, 1980 and

1990 based solely on the distribution of housing ages as of 1960.



11Our best calculations indicate that only about two percent of the 1950 housing stock in the suburbs was
torn down between 1950 and 1960, making this a reasonable assumption.

12About five percent of the suburban housing stock in our metropolitan areas present in 1960 was built
before 1920. Data from the U.S. Department of Labor (1960) on housing starts by year suggests that the
average house in this category was built in 1904, so we use that as our date for the pre-1920 housing stock

                                                    30
Having demonstrated the strong evidence that suburban dwellers tend to age in place

once settling the suburbs, we make use of this fact by instrumenting for age distributions

in 1970 - 1990 with the age of the housing stock in 1960 in our regressions. The

instrumental variables regressions shown in Table 11 are identical to those shown in

Table 8 and 9, except that here we use the age of the housing stock in 1960 to predict the

fraction of adults aged over 65 and the fraction of households with children in 1970, 1980

and 1990. As before, the first-stage F statistics on the excluded instruments are very

large with a p value of 0.000 in all cases. The signs of the coefficients in the second

stage equation are the same as before, although they are much smaller in magnitude,

more similar to the point estimates shown in Table 2. Because the standard errors are

large, the estimated effects of the fraction over age 65 and the fraction of households with

children are not statistically significant in this instrumental variables specification

(though the estimated effect of the fraction of households with children is close to

statistical significance) but we view these results as roughly consistent in theme with

those found above.



7. Community heterogeneity and the consequences of aging in place

Much of the theory on the potential consequences of aging in place for the provision of

local public schooling indicates that homophily could influence the degree to which

childless elderly citizens might continue to support schooling. We therefore continue our


in a suburb. We use housing start data to choose the most likely housing build date for the subsequent
decades as well; typically this is the midpoint of the decade, except in the 1930s, when the Depression
meant that few houses were built in the early part of the decade (so the typical house was built in 1937) and
the 1940s, when most houses were built postwar (so the typical house was built in 1947).


                                                     31
analysis by investigating whether our instrumental variables estimates of the effects of

the age distribution on the level of per pupil local revenues are influenced by the potential

racial distribution of the school district.



Because racial composition of a school district is endogenous, we measure the potential

for racial mismatch at the metropolitan area level. For each of the three years, we create

a mismatch variable measured as the share of the school-aged population that is nonwhite

divided by the share of the elderly population that is nonwhite. The mean of this variable

is 2.33 and the standard deviation is 1.02; a higher value of this variable would indicate

that the children in a metropolitan area are relatively more likely to be minorities than are

the elderly people in the metropolitan area. We repeat our instrumental variables

regression specification reported in Table 9, but this time we also interact the two

variables of interest, as well as the two instruments, with this metropolitan area-level

racial mismatch variable.



The results of this specification are reported in Table 12. As can be seen from the table,

the estimated effects of more elderly adults is strongly related to the level of racial

mismatch in the metropolitan area. At the mean level of racial mismatch, the estimated

coefficient on the share of adults aged 65 and above is -0.246. At one standard deviation

of racial mismatch above the mean, however, the corresponding estimated effect would

be -1.175. The coefficient on the interaction between the share of households with

children and the racial mismatch variable is also negative, though is only statistically

significant at the 11 percent level. Therefore, our estimates indicate that school districts



                                              32
with increasing shares of elderly adults are more likely to cut their revenues and spending

when the children are relatively nonwhite than they are when the school-aged children

are relatively white. Given the changing demographics of the United States, this finding

underscores the potential role that the increasingly large share of elderly adults in some

school districts may play.



8. Conclusion

While there exists considerable evidence regarding the degree to which the age

distribution of a community is associated with its support for public schooling, it is

notoriously difficult to ascribe causality to this relationship. The fundamental challenge

is that a negative relationship between the fraction elderly in a community and support

for public schooling may be due either to aging in place -- which is what has been

implied but untested by the prior literature -- or to dynamic Tiebout sorting in which

elderly residents who do not wish to fund schools move to communities with other

elderly residents. While both stories are consistent with this relationship, they have very

different implications for the effects of demographic change on the provision of local

public schooling.



This paper introduces a novel approach to causally linking school spending to changing

demographics of a community. We begin by forecasting how the age distribution in a

school district would change if the only factor at work were aging in place, and

demonstrate that aging in place is the leading explanation for over-time changes in school

district demographics. We further seek to predict age distributions in the future using



                                             33
data from a time when the American suburbs were, for the most part, brand new. We

show that as of 1960, suburbs populated by older residents were no different from those

populated by younger residents, in terms of income and education levels, and that the

principal determinant of the age of residents in 1960 was the age of the housing stock.

This paper presents the first evidence to our knowledge that documents the role that the

development of the suburbs in postwar America played in determining the age

distribution of school districts in 1970 and beyond. We find strong evidence that the

development dates of the suburbs and the resulting modern age distributions influence the

level of school spending in these school districts. School districts encompassing suburbs

that developed earlier and with consequently older populations tended to cut back on

school spending sooner, all else equal, once the Baby Boomer generation was out of

school, than did those with later-developing suburbs. These estimated effects are

particularly strong in the metropolitan areas where minorities comprise a relatively large

share of the school-aged population. These results have clear implications for what may

happen as the much larger Baby Boom generation ages, and suggest that the types of

state-financed targeted tax price subsidies for elderly homeowners that Reback (2009)

recommends may help to reduce inefficiencies in education provision in a graying

America. While our results are not definitive -- there could still be some remaining

endogenous sorting into the early postwar suburbs -- our analyses go a long way toward

cementing the conclusion that as a suburb ages, its support for schooling falls.



The heterogeneity in age distributions may also help to explain state interventions in

school finance at the state level. In an aging America, an increasing fraction of citizens



                                            34
of a state may seek to influence the degree to which localities can tax residents without

school-aged children. These policies may lead to further inefficiencies. While it is

beyond the scope of the present paper to explain the presence and timing of these

interventions in the context of demographic shifts, it is a question of ongoing research

concern.

Notes: These are authors' calculations based on Census tract data from the 1950 and 1960 Censuses and
school district-level Census data from the 1970, 1980 and 1990 Censuses. School district-Census tract
matches from 1950 and 1960 were conducted by the authors. School district counts are based on the 1990
Common Core of Data, and metropolitan area definitions reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. In the case
of the Buffalo, Dayton, and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, a second city (Niagara Falls, Springfield, and
Camden, respectively) was also considered a central city for the purposes of this analysis.

      Note: Figures calculated by authors. School districts were rank-ordered within metropolitan areas using data from the 1970 Census.
      Predictions without dynamic sorting assume that all householders will remain in their homes until they die, and then are replaced by
      the average-aged new suburban householder in the given metropolitan area in the 1980 or 1990 Census. We predicted death rates in
      each school district using life expectancies by age in 1970 calculated from "Life Tables for the United States Social Security Area,
      1900-2100," Social Security Administration, 2005. We measured the average age of new suburban householders in each of twenty
      metropolitan areas by calculating the average age in the metropolitan area of householders new to their homes in the suburban portions
      of the metropolitan areas within the last two years, using data from the 1980 and 1990 five percent Census microdata sample from the
      IPUMS. The correlation between average realized age in 1980 and average predicted age (based on 1970 age distribution, with
      random replacement) in 1980 is 0.78. The correlation between average realized age in 1990 and average predicted age in 1990 (based
      on 1970 age distribution, with random replacement) is 0.70.

Note: Figures calculated by authors. School districts were rank-ordered within
metropolitan areas using data from the 1960 Census, following the authors' hand-
matching of Census tracts to school districts. Log income adjusted for age and
metropolitan area is the residual of a regression of log of average family income on
average adult age and metropolitan area fixed effects.
