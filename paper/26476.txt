The Earned Income Tax Credit and Infant Health Revisited

                                           ABSTRACT

Hoynes, Miller and Simon (2015), henceforth HMS, report that the national expansion of the
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is associated with decreases in low birth weight. We question
their findings. HMS's difference-in-differences estimates are unidentified in some comparisons,
while failed placebo tests undermine others. Their effects lack a plausible mechanism as the
association between the EITC and prenatal smoking also fails placebo tests. We contend that the
waning of the crack epidemic is a possible confound, but we show that any number of policies
directed at poor women also eliminate the effect of the EITC when aggregated to the national
level. Identifying small, causal effects of a national policy at a single point in time is exceedingly
challenging.

         In an awardwinning article, Hoynes, Miller and Simon (2015, henceforth HMS) use variation in 

the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by family size pre and post the 1993 expansion to test the effect of 

an income transfer to working families on birth outcomes.  The question of whether income transfers 

can improve birth outcomes is of great importance to U.S. social policy.  First, preterm birth (< 37 weeks 

gestation) and low birth weight (< 2500 grams) are the most important predictors of infant mortality, a 

widely used index of a nation's health.  Second, there is a clear inverse gradient between adverse birth 

outcomes and socioeconomic status.  Third, the longterm effects of low birth weight on adult health 

appear significant (Almond and Currie 2011).  With expenditures of over 66 billion dollars and 27 million 

recipients in 2016, the EITC is considered a highly successful antipoverty program that uses refundable 

tax credits to augment the earnings of lowincome workers (Tax Policy Center 2019).  Given the small or 

nonexistent federal tax liability of low earners, the EITC results in a substantial income transfer.  If the 

EITC improves infant health, in addition to encouraging employment, then its potential welfare

enhancing impact would be even greater. 


         HMS follow a large literature that evaluates the EITC on primarily employment by using a 

differenceindifference (DD) design to compare the birth outcomes of single, less educated women who 

are having a first child (parity 1) with those having second (parity 2) and higher order births (parity 3+) 

[Eissa and Liebman 1996; Meyer and Rosenbaum 2000; Meyer 2002; Eissa and Hoynes 2004; Eissa and 

Nichols 2005].1 The largest increase in the EITC occurred with Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 

1993 (OBRA93).  HMS contrast the change in low birth weight from 19911993, their preperiod, to 

19941998 the post period.  They find that the change in the generosity of the EITC after 1993 lowers

  In obstetrics parity is the number of previous live births.  A woman giving birth for the first time would be parity 
zero or nulliparous.  HMS define parity as the current plus previous births.  Thus, HMS define a first birth as parity 
1, a second birth as parity 2 and higher order births as parity 3+.  We follow their definition to avoid confusion.

the incidence of low birth weight by 0.35 percentage points over a mean of 10.2 percent or a decline of 

9 grams over a mean of 3206 grams by comparing single women with children to those without.2 


         The validity of HMS's differenceindifferences (DD) design depends on isolating a period prior to 

the 1993 EITC in which both the "treated" and comparison group are unexposed to the policy.  A second 

important condition is the parallel trend assumption in which the time path of the outcome is the same 

for both the "treated" and comparison groups in the period prior to the intervention.  Neither condition 

holds when HMS compare women of parity 2 or 2+ to women of parity 1.  By contrast, the comparison 

between women of parity 2 to women of parity 3 or higher (parity 3+) provides, ostensibly, a more 

credible design.3  As can be seen in Figure 1, there is a large divergence in the available tax credit 

between women of parity 2 and parity 3+ after 1993 and barely any before.  By 1996 women of parity 

3+ were eligible for $1,283 more in tax credits in 1995 dollars than women of parity 2 (Figure 1).  HMS 

find that the EITC is associated with a decrease in low birth weight among women of parity 3+ relative to 

parity 2.  The finding, however, is only true for black women who make up approximately 20 percent of

  The paper by HMS is the first published analysis of the effect of the 1993 expansion of the EITC on infant health.   
There are a number of studies that use expansions in the state EITC that report associations with birth weight.  
However, state EITCs are largely irrelevant between 19911996.  By 1993 only 4 states had a refundable tax credit 
(Maryland, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin) while Rhode Island had a nonrefundable credit (Hotz and Scholz 
2003).  Strully, Rehkopf and Xuan (2010), Markowitz et al. (2017), Komro et al. (2019) use variation in state EITCs to 
analyze their association with birth weight.  A number of results raise questions about the robustness of the 
findings.  First, each study estimates increases in birthweight associated with the state EITC that are twice as large 
as HMS despite state tax credits of roughly onetenth to onefifth the magnitude of the federal tax credits.  
Second, despite the use of twoway fixed effects models, policy endogeneity is a concern as the states with EITCs 
tend to have more generous social welfare policies.  Yet, none of the studies control for statespecific trends or use 
an eventstudy design to test for pretrends.  Lastly, each study finds effects of state EITCs on the outcomes of first 
births, which seems implausible.  The available tax credit is between $30$60 per year, and thus any effect is more 
indicative of a failed placebo test than a credible treatment. See also studies by Bruckner, Rehkopf and Catalano 
2013; Hamad and Rehkopf (2015).  For a more detailed review of studies analyzing the state EITCs, see Appendix B.

  In fact, the level and timeseries pattern of the rate of low birth weight for women of parity 5 or higher are very 
different from those of women of parity 2 and call into question their use in the analysis.  The timeseries pattern 
of low birth weight among women of parity 3 and 4 is much closer to that of parity 2 (see Appendix  A, Figure A
1A).

EITC filers.  There is no association among whites or Hispanics.  As we show below, however, results for 

black women fail a basic placebo test (Hotz, Mullin and Scholz 2006).   


        HMS suggest that the effect of the EITC on low birth weight among black women can be 

explained, in part, by a decrease in prenatal smoking and an increase in prenatal care.  Prenatal smoking 

is the most important modifiable risk factor for low birth weight.  HMS's results, however, are too large 

and inconsistent to be credible.  They report that prenatal smoking fell by 2.41 percentage points more 

among black women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2.  This implies an income elasticity of 2.75 and a quit 

rate of over 100 percent among women induced to work by the EITC, both implausibly large.  In 

addition, HMS's smoking results fail a placebo test.  Prenatal care, on the other hand, lacks a convincing 

relationship to birth outcomes, but even if prenatal care were effective, HMS estimated increases in 

prenatal care are too small to be relevant.  


        So, what did cause the fall in the rate of low birth weight among black women of higher parity? 

We speculate that the waning of the crackcocaine epidemic in the early 1990s may explain the 

particular pattern of HMS's results.  As some evidence, we use New York City birth certificate data that 

shows large differential trends in low birth weight and prenatal drug use by race and parity from 1984

1998.  Although the fading crack epidemic is a possible explanation, the larger point is that identifying 

small effects of a national policy change on birth outcomes at a single point in time is exceedingly 

challenging.  To illustrate, we aggregate from the state to the national level the three state variables 

used by HMS to control for policies that may affect infant health.  Their inclusion at the state level has 

little explanatory power in HMS's specification, but they greatly diminish or completely eliminate the 

effect of the EITC when entered at the same level of aggregation as the EITC.

I.  The 1993 EITC Expansion: Parity 1 vs. Parity 2 and 2+ 

              Federal legislation resulted in the expansion of the EITC in 1986, 1990 and 1993.  The expansions 

in 1990 and 1993 were phased in over the subsequent three years: 19911993 and 19941996.  Up until 

1994, the available tax credit through the EITC was almost identical for families with one or more 

children (parity 2+ as specified by HMS).  As shown in Figure 1, the available tax credit for women of 

parity 3+ increased greatly relative to women of parity 2 beginning in 1994.  In that same year, women 

of parity 1 became eligible for a tax credit for the first time.  These staggered expansions make 

comparisons between women of parity 2 versus parity 1 almost impossible to identify when the study 

period is limited to effective tax years 19911998 as used by HMS.  For instance, from 1990 to 1993 the 

EITC credit increased by $401 ($222 + $179 in 1995 $) for women of parity 2 relative to parity 1 which 

exceeded the postperiod increase of $264 ($578  $314 in 1995 $) from 19941998. 4  In other words, 

the increase in the EITC for HMS's treatment group, women of parity 2, relative to their counterfactual, 

women of parity 1, is larger from 1990 to 1993 than in their HMS's post period.  To lessen the impact of 

the 1990 expansion of the EITC on their treatment group, HMS limit the preperiod to 19911993.  The 

increase over this twoyear preperiod at $179 is still 68 percent of the postEITC increase.  Yet limiting 

the preperiod to 19911993 does little to mitigate the cumulative exposure of their treatment group to 

increases in the EITC during their preperiod.  The reason is because HMS's mapping from the child's 

birth date to the year the mother is exposed to the EITC, what HMS refer to as the woman's "effective 

tax year," is an approximation at best. 5 For instance, HMS assume that women who gave birth in

   As shown in Figure 1, the EITC increases by $578 between 1994 and 1998 for women of parity 2 but the EITC 
increases by $314 for women of parity 1 over the same period.  The net increase is $264 ($578$314). 
 
5
   One reason for HMS's specific mapping from the effective tax year to the month of birth (see their HMS Table 1) 
is an effort to time the tax credit to the third trimester of pregnancy.  Given the crudeness of the data, such fine
tuning of the EITC exposure is unlikely to be accurate and is one more reason to use 19871990 as the preperiod 
during which there were no changes in the EITC.  Second, focus on the third trimester is too restrictive as it is not 
 

                                                               4 
                                                                 
January through August of 1992 were only eligible for the 1990 EITC.  But many of these women were 

likely working through much, if not all, of 1991 and therefore received the higher 1991 tax credit in 

February or March of 1992.  We agree with HMS that mapping a pregnancy to a specific EITC year is not 

precise, but it's also unnecessary.  The years 19871990 provide a superior preperiod with 19911998 as 

the more appropriate post period (see Figure 1).  Specifically, there is no nominal change in the EITC 

from 1987 to 1990 between women of parity 2 or 2+ versus parity 1.  There is a continuous relative 

increase from 1991 to 1994 of $665 in 1995 dollars for women of parity 2 versus parity 1 that remains 

nominally unchanged from 19951998.  Indeed, the $665 increase in available tax credits for women of 

parity 2 compared to parity 1 is the largest relative expansion in a 4year period between the two groups 

over the entire existence of the EITC. 


              To illustrate, we first replicate HMS's DD regression estimates comparing the rate of low birth 

weight among women of parity 2 relative to parity 1 using 199193 as the preperiod and 19941998 as 

the post period.  HMS aggregate individuallevel birth certificate data for low birth weight into 47,687 

nonzero cells for single women with no more than a high school education defined by state, year, 

parity, maternal education, race, ethnicity and age from 1981 to 1998 and estimate the following 

regression (HMS, Appendix B).

the only point in a pregnancy that could benefit from an intervention.  Neural tubal defects, which occur early in 
pregnancy, are vulnerable to smoking and drinking.  Precursors of preterm birth such as vaginal bleeding, 
preeclampsia and gestational diabetes should be diagnosed and treated whenever they arise during pregnancy.  
This explains the current emphasis on preconception health (see https://www.acog.org/ClinicalGuidanceand
Publications/CommitteeOpinions/CommitteeonGynecologicPractice/TheImportanceofPreconceptionCarein
theContinuumofWomensHealthCare).

unemployment rate that vary by year.  Treatp equals one for the parities experiencing expansion in 

available tax credits (i.e., parity 2) relative to the controls (i.e., parity 1).  HMS limit the sample to single 

mothers with high school or less of completed schooling.  We report the DD coefficient, , in the top 

panel of Table 1.  Among all women, an increase in the EITC beginning in 1994 is associated with a 0.164 

percentage point decline in the rate of low birth weight among women of parity 2 relative to parity 1 

(HMS, Table 2).  In Panel B, we use the same preperiod as HMS but we drop California, New York, Texas 

and Washington because they did not report mother's education prior to 1989.  The differences in the 

estimates between Panel A and B are modestly more supportive of HMS.  In the bottom panel of Table 

1, we show results from running the same specification but using 19871990 as the preperiod and 

19911998 as the postperiod.  The protective effect of the EITC using this preperiod is more than twice 

as large for all women (0.564), black women (0.920) and white women (0.352) than using 19911993 

as the preperiod for the same groups (Table 1, Panel c).  We estimate the same specification comparing 

women of parity 2+ to women of parity 1.  The results are qualitatively the same as parity 2 versus parity 

1 (Table 1, Panel D).   

              Estimating the effect of the EITC with a more coherent pre and postperiod appears to further 

support HMS's conclusions.  A key assumption of the DD, however, is that trends between the "treated" 

and comparison group leading up to intervention should be parallel.  As evidence, HMS estimate an 

eventstudy specification that shows leads and lags of the estimated DD.6  We replicate their 

specification (Figure 2, Panel A) but then extend the data back to 1987 (Figure 2, Panel B).  The key point 

is that the rate of low birth weight among women of parity 2 relative to parity 1 declines continuously 

from 1987 to 1998 (Figure 2, Panel B) with no obvious discontinuity after 1990 or 1993.  Large

                                                                            6 
                                                                              
differential trends in low birth weight are also evident for women of parity 2+ relative to women of 

parity 1 (Figure 2, Panels C and D).  An Ftest decisively rejects the null that coefficients on the 

interactions from 19871992 are different from zero for both parity 2 relative to parity 1 (F6,46 =7.85), 

and 2+ relative to 1 (F6,46=5.52).   


              We contend that it is not possible to isolate the effect of the 1993 EITC on the birth outcomes of 

women of parity 2 or parity 2+ relative to parity 1 between 1991 and 1998.  Two key conditions for a 

valid DD are violated.  The continuous increase in available tax credits from 1991 to 1994 for women of 

parity 2 and parity 2+ relative to parity 1 means the "treatment group" was exposed to the intervention 

in the preperiod.  This could have been rectified by using 19871990 as the preperiod and 19911998 

as the post period.  However, women of parity 1 are a poor counterfactual for women of higher parity 

over this period.  Differential trends in low birth weight between women of parity 2+ relative to women 

of parity 1 from 19871992 undermine this design.  We turn next to the comparisons between women of 

parity 3+ versus parity 2 that meet these two key conditions: similar exposure to the EITC tax credit 

between the "treated" and comparison groups in the preperiod and no differential trends in low birth 

weight leading up to the 1993 expansion.  


 
II.  The 1993 EITC Expansion: Parity 2 vs. Parity 3+ 

              Numerous studies of the EITC have used the large increases in the available tax credits to 

women of parity 3+ relative to women of parity 2 after 1993 to identify the effects of the EITC on 

employment (Figure 1).7  Between 19931996, the EITC rose by $1,861 for women of parity 3+ and by 

$578 for women of parity 2, a net difference of $1,283 in 1995 dollars.  HMS use equation (1) to

  See Meyer 2002; Eissa and Hoynes 2004; Eissa and Nichols 2005; Hotz, Mullin and Scholz 2006; Evans and 
Garthwaite 2014). 

                                                               7 
                                                                 
estimate the difference in birth outcomes between women of parity 3+ versus parity 2 between 1991

1998.  The preperiod in this design, 199193, is not confounded by differential exposure to the EITC of 

any substance, unlike the comparison for women between parity 2 and parity 1. 


              The results provide support for HMS's conclusion that the 1993 EITC expansion improved birth 

outcomes for lowincome, single women of parity 3+ relative to women of parity 2.  In Table 2, panel A, 

we replicate HMS's results for all women and then by race/ethnicity (HMS Tables 2 and 3).  Women of 

parity 3+ experience declines of 0.347 percentage points more than women of parity 2, a 3 percent 

decline given a mean rate of low birth weight of 10.2 percent.  The results for all women, however, are 

driven by birth outcomes among black women for whom rates of low birth weight fell 0.715 percentage 

points more among women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2.  Importantly, there is no association 

between the EITC and rates of low birth weight among white or Hispanic women.  The point estimate for 

white women is so close to zero that even the upper 95 percent confidence interval suggests a clinically 

inconsequential effect.  


              The large increase in the 1993 EITC for women of parity 3+ provides a natural placebo test (Hotz, 

Mullin and Scholz 2006).  There should be no differential effect of the EITC on women of parity 3 versus 

those of parity 4 or parity 4+ as they all experience the same increase in the available tax credits.  HMS 

report this test for all women in their Appendix, which we have replicated in column (1) of Table 2, 

Panels B, C, and D.  Specifically, the rate of low birth weight declines by 0.225 percentage points more 

among women of parity 3 versus those of parity 2 after the 1993 expansion in the EITC. The effect is 

slightly larger between women of parity 4 versus parity 3 (0.240) and even larger for women of parity 

4+ versus those of parity 3 (0.261).8 HMS acknowledge that failure of this placebo test suggests

   The large differential effects between women of parity 4 and 4+ versus three are all the more surprising because 
the higher parity women have to distribute the same tax credit over a larger family, which could diminish any 
protective effect of income on the most recent birth.

black women fail this test (Table 2, column 2, Panels B, C, and D).  There is no differential effect of the 

EITC on white or Hispanic women of parity 3 versus parity 4 or parity 4+, which is consistent with the 

null findings for both groups between women of parity 3 versus parity 2 (Table 2, columns 3 and 4).9   


 


III. The Etiology of Low Birth Weight and Plausible Mechanisms 

        Low birth weight (infants less than 2,500 grams) consists of infants born preterm (less than 37 

weeks gestation) and/or those who were growth restricted.  In 2015, 69 percent of all low birth weight 

births were preterm.  In an exhaustive review of the literature on preterm birth, the Institute of 

Medicine (IOM) states in the abstract, "The current methods for diagnosis and treatment of preterm 

labor are currently based on an inadequate literature, and little is known how preterm birth can be 

prevented" (Institute of Medicine 2007, p.2).10  Growth retardation, on the other hand, has a number of 

antecedents that include smoking, small stature, low weight gain, and first births with smoking being the 

most important (Kramer et al. 2000).  HMS propose two mechanisms by which the EITC might protect 

against adverse birth outcomes: prenatal care and prenatal smoking.11  We find prenatal care to be an 

implausible explanation.  As we detail in Appendix A, Section III, the association between prenatal care 

and birth outcomes from observational studies is modest at best and vulnerable to selection bias and 

differential measurement error.  Reviews of randomized trials of prenatal or augmented prenatal care 

find little or no effect on birth outcomes (Corman, Dave and Reichman, forthcoming).  Moreover, HMS's

  The failed placebo tests among black women do not reflect differential trends in low birth weight among women 
of higher parity (see the Appendix A, Section II). 
10
   See also Iams (2014) for a more recent review. 
11
   Our discussion focuses on the sample of black women as there is little consistent evidence of an association 
between the EITC and birth outcomes for either white or Hispanic women.

estimates of the effect of the EITC on prenatal care are so small as to be inconsequential; they also fail 

our placebo tests. 


              Prenatal smoking, on the other hand, is considered the most important modifiable determinant 

of low birth weight (Floyd et al. 1993; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001).  Based on 

HMS's data and specifications, the EITC lowered the prevalence of smoking by 2.41 percentage points 

among black women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2 over a mean prevalence of 19 percent.  The finding 

is implausible for several reasons.  First, the implied quit rate among newly employed women necessary 

to generate a 2.41 percentage point drop in the prenatal smoking of all pregnant women is over 100 

percent.12  Second, workplace smoking bans could not achieve such large reductions.  The best estimate 

is that workplace smoking bans reduce smoking by 5 percentage points (Evans, Farrelly and 

Montgomery 1999).  Based on the increase in employment in HMS's sample, this would reduce smoking 

by 0.35 percentage points. 13  Third, HMS's estimates assume smoking is an inferior good among low 

income, single women with an implied income elasticity of 2.75, a huge response that is also outside 

the bounds of the literature.  A metaanalysis by economists suggests that, on balance, smoking is a 

normal good (Gallet and List 2003).  Pregnant women are more likely to quit than nonpregnant women, 

but the reasons women give for quitting are the fear of adverse birth outcomes, medical advice and 


                                                            
12
    Consider 100,000 working women.  Assume 20 percent or 20,000 women are smokers.  Assume 10 percent or 
10,000 are new workers induced by the EITC based on HMS estimates of the increase in labor force participation 
among black women (HMS Appendix Table 1).  Assume 20 percent or 2,000 of the 10,000 new workers are 
smokers.  Assume all new workers quit smoking.  Thus, the total number of smokers in the population falls from 
20,000 to 18,000 and the smoking prevalence falls from 20 percent to 18 percent or 2 percentage points.  To put a 
quit rate of 100 percent into perspective, a Cochrane review of 72 randomized trials of prenatal smoking cessation 
programs reports quit rates of 6 percent among all trials that were reviewed, but only 3 percent among those with 
the strongest designs (Lumley et al. 2014) 
 
13
    Again consider a population of 100,000 black women of whom 20 percent or 20,000 smoke.  Ten thousand  
enter the workforce of whom 2000 smoke.  Based on Evans, Farrelly, Montgomery (1999), 7000 women would end 
up working at sites with workplace bans of which 1400 smoke (0.20* 7000).  Bans reduce smoking by 5 percentage 
points or by 350 (.05*7000).  As a result, smoking in the population would fall from 20,000 to 19,650 or from 20 
percent to 19.65 percent--a decline of 0.35 percentage points. 
 

                                                               10 
                                                                 
nausea (Floyd et al. 1993).  HMS suggests that cash transfers from the EITC received mostly in February 

and March, which are spent largely on durables and transportation, induce unrealistic quit rates among 

women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2.   


         Perhaps the most important reason to doubt HMS's smoking estimates for black women is that 

they fail a basic placebo test.  Recall that women of parity 3, 4 and 4+ all received the same increase in 

the EITC after 1993.  There should be, therefore, no differential decline in smoking among women of 

parity 4 or 4+ relative to parity 3.  The results in Table 3 indicate otherwise.  Prenatal smoking falls 1.23 

percentage points more among black women of parity 4 relative to parity 3 and 1.18 percentage points 

more among black women of parity 4+ relative to parity 3.  As with low birth weight, the failed placebo 

tests point to differential trends in prenatal smoking by parity. 14 


 
IV.  Alternative Explanations  

         Despite the lack of interventions to prevent preterm birth or credible changes in smoking 

associated with the EITC, trends in low birth weight reported by HMS and documented here vary 

significantly by race and parity.15  One plausible factor consistent with differential trends in low birth 

weight by race and parity is the impact of the crackcocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s.  There is 

broad consensus among social scientists that growth in crackcocaine markets expanded rapidly in poor 

urban areas between 1983 and 1990.  The spread of crack led to a dramatic upsurge in homicide that 



                                                            
14
    Despite the failed placebo tests and the lack of a convincing mechanism, HMS argue that the "preponderance of 
evidence" still favors a causal interpretation of their results (see footnote 8).  Part of that evidence is their 
expanded analysis of the three EITC expansions in 1986, 1990 and 1993.  In Appendix A, IV, we show that there is 
no association between the EITC expansions in 1986 and 1990 and even the effect of the 1993 expansion is 
eliminated when we allow quadratic trends of low birth weight by parity. 
15
    As HMS show, the EITC was not associated with changes in fertility suggesting that other determinants of 
growth retardation such as small stature and first births were also not changing differentially by race and parity. 

                                                         11

1998; Cork 1999; Blumstein, Rivara and Rosenfeld 2000; Grogger and Willis 2000; Fryer et al. 2013; 

Evans, Garthwaite and Moore 2016, 2018).  For reasons that are not well understood, the crack 

epidemic affected black women more than whites and Hispanics.  In the largest population prevalence 

study ever undertaken, the urines of 29,494 women were tested for perinatal substances at 202 

California hospitals in 1992.  The percent of women exposed to cocaine at delivery was 13 times greater 

among black, nonHispanics (7.79 percent) than white, nonHispanics (0.60 percent) and Hispanics (0.55 

percent) [Vega et al. 1993].  Prenatal exposure to crack was also concentrated among older, higher 

parity black women as demonstrated in numerous studies from urban hospitals and clinics across 

around the country. 16   In a metaanalysis of 31 studies of cocaine and birth outcomes, rates of low birth 

weight were 3 to 4 times greater and average birth weights were 492 grams less among women exposed 

relative to unexposed to cocaine prenatally (Gouin et al. 2011).  Exposure to crack was highly correlated 

with exposure to tobacco and other risk factors for adverse birth outcomes such as alcohol and sexually 

transmitted infections (STIs).  We are not arguing that the pharmacological impact of cocaine alone was 

responsible for the rise in low birth weight, but that the crack epidemic was associated with a social and 

behavioral breakdown in certain poor communities with devastating consequences to its residents. 


        There are no national data on prenatal exposure to crackcocaine let alone by race and parity.  

However, the New York City Department of Health collected information on drug use during pregnancy 

as part of its vital registration system for births.  In Appendix A, Section V we provide a descriptive 

presentation of trends in prenatal exposure to cocaine and low birth weight by race and parity that is 



                                                            
16
    Hospitalbased studies of prenatal cocaine exposure in numerous urban centers found the average age of users 
was between 25 and 29 and the average parity was 3 as computed by HMS (Zuckerman et al. 1989; Hadeed and 
Siegel 1989; McCalla et al. 1991; Phibbs, Bateman and Schwartz 1991; Handler et al. 1991; Bateman et al. 1993; 
Eyler et al. 1994; Chazotte et al. 1995; Singer et al. 2002). 

 

                                                       12 
                                                         
consistent with our conjecture that the association between the EITC and the decline in low birth weight 

among black women may be related to the crack epidemic.   

              Although the waning of the crack epidemic is a possible explanation for why only black births of 

parity 3+ are associated with the EITC, the lack of data on prenatal exposure to cocaine nationally limits 

a convincing test.  The more general point is the difficulty of identifying the effect of a national policy at 

a single point in time in what Manzi refers to a "dense causal environment" (Manzi 2012).  For instance, 

HMS's sample includes over 47,000 cells and yet, identification of the EITC derives from changes in low 

birth weight over nine years and two parity groups.  To demonstrate, we reestimate HMS's equation (1) 

and contrast the estimated effect of the EITC on low birth weight with those from a model in which we 

drop the state policy variables, the state fixed effects, and all demographic fixed effects.  This limited 

model includes only year and parity fixed effects and an interaction term.  Estimates in the first column 

of Table 4, Panel A, replicate the results from HMS's full model while those in column 2 adjust for only 

year and parity fixed effects.  The coefficients are almost identical but the model in column (1) has 86 

parameters and the one in column (2) has 12.  The same pattern persists for black women in Panel B of 

Table 4.   

              With such limited identifying variation, any number of factors during this period could confound 

the effect of the EITC.17  To illustrate, we aggregate HMS's three stateyear variables to the annual level 

and interact them with an indicator of women of parity 3+.  The three policies are the proportion of 

women who are exposed to welfare reform; the unemployment rate, and the income eligibility 

threshold for pregnant women applying for Medicaid or SCHIP as a percentage of the federal poverty 




                                                            
17
   Kleven (2019) shows convincingly that welfare reform and the macroeconomynot the 1993 EITC expansion--
were more likely the cause of the large increase in employment among less educated single women with children 
from 1993 to 2000. 
 

                                                               13 
                                                                 
level.  Each policy has a plausible link to low birth weight. 18  In column (3) we include welfare reform 

interacted with parity along with the indicator of the EITC expansion; in column (4) we drop the EITC 

interaction.  Inclusion of welfare reform lowers the coefficient on the EITC by half for all women but it 

completely eliminates the effect of the EITC among black women (Table 4, Panel B).  In column (4) we 

show that welfare reform is associated with a 0.49 percentage point decline in low birth weight for all 

women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2 and a 1.16 percentage point decline among black women.  Both 

estimates exceed the effect of the EITC.  Inclusion of the annual unemployment rate interacted with 

women of parity 3+ eliminates any association between the EITC and low birth weight and suggests that 

a one percentage increase in the annual unemployment rate increases the rate of low birth weight 

between 0.14 and 0.38 for women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2 depending on race (Table 4, columns 

5 and 6).19   Importantly, none of the three policy variables have any association with rate of low birth 

weight among black women in HMS's full model when allowed to vary by state and year.  And yet, when 

aggregated to the national level, they appear to have a robust association with low birth weight that 

varies by parity.  We are not claiming that welfare reform, unemployment, the Medicaid eligibility 

expansions or the crack epidemic have a causal association with low birth weight.  Nevertheless, when 

aggregated to the national level, the differential associations of these factors with low birth weight by 

race and parity highlight the difficulty of deriving causal estimates from a national policy at a single point 

in time.

    We obtain similar result when we include the homicide rate of black males 1524 years of age at the national 
level as a proxy for the crack epidemic (Appendix A Section V, Table A3).  Its inclusion eliminates the effect of the 
EITC completely. 

                                                               14 
                                                                 
Conclusion 

        We end by praising HMS for trying to test the effect of a plausibly exogenous increase in income  

on infant health.  The EITC represents a sizable transfer to working single women with children that may 

improve birth outcomes (Brownell et al. 2016).  In systematically reviewing their evidence, however, we 

conclude that claims of a causal association between the EITC and low birth weight cannot be drawn 

from HMS's design and data.  Specifically, we show that comparisons between women of parity 2 versus 

parity 1 are flawed because women of parity 2 were exposed to the EITC in HMS's preperiod.  Similarly, 

differential trends in low birth weight between women of parity 2+ relative to parity 1 confound their 

association.  We agree that the most credible contrast is between women of parity 3+ relative to parity 

2.  However, we find no effect for whites or Hispanics, a conclusion supported by placebo tests.  By 

contrast, the estimated protective effect of the EITC on low birth weight among black women of parity 

3+ relative to parity 2 is undermined by failed placebo tests. Moreover, this association also lacks a 

credible mechanism.  Not only are the estimated effects of the EITC on smoking among black women of 

parity 3+ relative to parity 2 too large to be plausible, but they also fail a placebo test.   Finally using 

HMS's own policy variables, we show that they have no effect on low birth weight at the state level, but 

have robust associations with the rate of low birth weight by parity when aggregated to the level of the 

EITC.  Indeed, inclusion of welfare reform and the national unemployment rate eliminate the effect of 

the EITC.   In the end, we cannot conclude that income transfers such as the EITC have no protective 

effect against low birth weight.  Our point is that efforts to identify small causal effects at the national 

level without a sharp discontinuity and plausible mechanisms are vulnerable to confounding from 

ongoing events and policies.

    ^ Estimates in Panel A are from HMS Tables 2 and 3 from a specification that pools women of all parities. 
    Estimates change only slightly if we estimate the same regressions but limit the sample to women of parity 1 
    and 2.  In Panel B we use 19911993 as the preperiod, but we drop California, New York, Texas, and 
    Washington because they did not report mother's schooling prior to 1989.  In Panels C and D we use the 
    same states as in Panel B but we use 19871990 as the preperiod.

Figures show the estimated effect of the 1993 EITC expansion on women of parity 3 or higher relative to women of parity 2.  Estimates in the full model are from 
equation (1) in the text and include all state and demographic fixed effects and the 3 state variables that vary by state and year.  The limited model drops all state and 
demographic fixed effects as well as the 3 state variables and includes only parity and year fixed effects along with the interaction of the after period and the indicator of 
parity 3 or higher.  In column (3) we add the annual proportion of women in the HMS sample exposed to welfare reform interacted with the indicator for parity 3+ to the 
full model.  We drop the state measure of welfare reform but keep stateyear variation in the other two state variables.  In column (4) we drop the parity 3+*after 
interaction.  We do the same for unemployment rate in columns (5) and (6) as well as the measure of Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility thresholds in columns (7) and 8). 
Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level following HMS.  There are 35,467 observations for all women and 10,273 observations for Black women.

AI. Trends in Low Birth Weight by Parity and Race
        A key assumption in difference-in-difference designs is that trends in those exposed to an

intervention are similar or roughly parallel to those unexposed in the periods leading up to the change.

In the three panels below we show the rate of low birth weight by race and parity for all single

unmarried women in Figure A1a, white women in Figure A1b, and Black women in Figure A1c. The

horizontal axis shows what HMS refer to as the effective tax year which defines a woman's exposure to

the EITC. What is apparent among all women and especially Black women is the disparity in the time-

series pattern of low birth weight among women of parity 5 and 6+ relative to women of parity 2, 3 and

4. This becomes important in our placebo analysis in the text. Women of parity 3 and higher all

received the same increase in the EITC after 1993. A natural placebo test is whether the EITC had a

differential impact on low birth weight between women of parity 3 and 4 as well as women of parity 4+.

A concern of including women of parity 5+ is the differential trends in low birth weight between them

and women of parity 3. Thus, in all our placebo tests we compare women of parity 4 to parity 3

separately from women of parity 4+ and 4.


        The other noticeable pattern is the curvilinear trajectory of the series with peaks among women

of parity 2, 3 and 4 around 1988 followed by steady declines. These patterns become important in the

DD analysis. They suggest that rates of low birth weight were declining well before the 1993 expansion

among Black women of parities 2, 3 and 4. Although the scale of the vertical axis makes it difficult to

discern small changes, there is no clear discontinuity in low birth weight after 1993 among women of

parity 3 and 4 relative to parity 2. Second, the curvilinear pattern becomes relevant when HMS estimate

the effect of the EITC expansions in 1986, 1990 and 1993 together. As we show in Appendix A section

IV, estimates from that analysis are sensitive to the inclusion of trend terms interacted with parity.

                                                     1
AII. Event-study plots of the placebo tests
        As noted in the text, women of parity 3, 4 and 4+ all experienced the same increase in the EITC

after 1993. Consequently, there should be no differential effect of the EITC on the rate of low birth

weight between women of parity 4 or 4+ relative to parity 3. As we show in the text, Black women fail

this placebo test. It is important, however, to insure that the failed placebo tests are not the result of

differential trends in low birth weight prior to the expansion. In Figures A2 we estimate event-study

regressions of the low birth weight among black women for HMS's study period of 1991-1998. Figures

A2a, A2b and A2c compare black women of parity 3 versus 2, parity 4 versus 3 and parity 4+ versus 3,

respectively. The pattern in each figure is the same: no differential pre-trends followed by similar

declines in low birth weight for each comparison. The graphs demonstrate that the failed placebo tests

between women of parity 4 and 4+ versus parity 3 are not the result of differential trends in low birth

weight in the pre-period. We discuss potential confounders in Sections V of the text.

AIII. Possible Mechanisms: Prenatal Care

        We find prenatal care to be an implausible explanation. First, the association between prenatal

care and birth outcomes in the public health literature is modest at best based on observational studies

(Corman, Dave and Reichman, forthcoming). The randomized studies of prenatal or augmented

prenatal care have reported almost uniformly, no association with improved infant health (Collaborative

Group on Preterm Birth Prevention 1993; Goldenberg and Rouse 1998; Goldenberg and Culhane 2007;

Alexander and Kotelchuck 2001; Klerman et al. 2001; Carroli et al. 2001; Corman Dave and Reichman,

forthcoming). The multicenter RCT of preterm prevention is a particularly germane example

(Collaborative Group on Preterm Birth Prevention 1993). The intervention targeted women at high risk

for preterm birth. The treatment group received weekly examinations beginning in weeks 20-24 until

delivery. Patients in the treatment group were also trained to recognize the signs of preterm labor. The

intervention conferred no benefit despite a level of support that far exceeded routine prenatal care. In

a more recent review of the determinants of preterm birth, the author wrote,

                Strategies to prevent preterm birth have traditionally emphasized early prenatal care as
        providing an opportunity to identify and treat prematurity-related risk factors, but this approach
        has not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Improved access to prenatal care is associated
        with lower rates of preterm birth, but the linkage is apparently related more to the high rates
        among women who receive no prenatal care than to the content of care received (Iams 2014, p.
        256)
        Even based on the questionable estimates of prenatal care effectiveness in the public health

literature, the change in prenatal care associated with the EITC is inconsequential. For instance, in Table

A1 below we replicate HMS's prenatal care results for all women of parity 3+ versus parity 2 (HMS, Table

7). HMS report that the EITC is associated with an increase of 0.652 percentage points in prenatal care

initiation before the third trimester. This is less than a one-percent increase evaluated at the mean of

89.42 percent, a change so small as to be clinically irrelevant.




                                                      4
        Lastly, trends in prenatal care vary by parity and the effect of prenatal care fails the placebo

test. As we noted in the text, women of parity 3, 4 and 4+ all receive the same increase in the EITC after

1993. There should be, therefore, no differential change in prenatal care between women of parity 4

versus 3 or parity 4+ versus 3. Again, refer to Table A1. The EITC is associated with a 0.493 percentage

point increase between all women of 4 versus parity 3 and a 0.659 percentage point increase among

black women. These changes are small and not clinically important, but they point to differential trends

in prenatal care by parity that are consistent with the differential trends in low birth weight and prenatal

smoking discussed in the text. Also of note is the lack of an association between the EITC and prenatal

care among white or Hispanic women of parity 3+ versus 2. This is consistent with the lack of an

association between the EITC and low birth weight between white and Hispanic women of parity 4

versus 3.

AIV. The EITCs of 1986, 1990 and 1993

        As noted in the text, HMS expand their analysis of the EITC and low birth weight by combining

the EITC expansions in 1986 and 1990 with that of 1993. 1 To evaluate the impact of all three

expansions, HMS again aggregate individual-level birth certificate data to cells defined by state, year,

parity, maternal education, race, ethnicity and age from 1983 to 1998 (HMS, Appendix B). They limit the

sample to single, unmarried women who gave birth. To account for the multiple expansions HMS

estimate the following two-way fixed effects specification:


                 (2)  =  +  +  +  +   +  +  + 


Ypjst is the rate of low birth by parity (p), demographic groups (j ), state (s) and year (t). X is a set of state

policies: Medicaid/SCHIP, welfare reform and the state unemployment rate. Maxcreditpt is the

maximum tax credit available to eligible filers that varies by parity and year. HMS include an additional

term (pp* T) to control for linear trends by parity. We replicate HMS's analysis in the top Panel of Table

A2 below. The coefficient for all women indicates that a $1000 increase in the maximum available credit

is associated with -0.304 percentage point decline in the rate of low birth weight. The effects for white

women are substantially smaller [-0.117, column (4)], while those for black women are much larger [-

0.518, column (7)].


        The estimates in Table A2 are also sensitive to the inclusion of trend terms by parity. Inclusion

of a linear trend term almost triples the estimated effect for black women from -0.518 to -1.357

percentage points (columns 7 and 8), whereas a quadratic trend in parity eliminates any effect of the

EITC on low birth weight (column 9). Trend terms interacted with parity may over fit the data, but as we

show in Appendix A, Figure A1, the time-series pattern in low birth weight is clearly curvilinear especially

among black women. At a minimum, the effect of the EITC expansions on low birth weight is

observationally equivalent to nonlinear trends in low birth weight by parity unrelated to the EITC.


        In the lower panel of Table A2 we re-estimate the same model but limit the sample to the

effective years 1983-1993. In this subsample there is no association between the Maxcreditpt and low

birth weight for all women and all black women. Inclusion of a linear trend in parity eliminates any

effect for white women. The lack of an association between the EITC expansions in 1986 and 1990 is not

surprising given that take-up and the magnitude of the available tax credits were substantially less in

these early expansions. The point, however, is that the estimated effect from the extended analysis is

driven by the 1993 expansion, which we have argued lacks convincing evidence of a causal effect.

AV. Crack Cocaine as a possible Confound

        In this Section of the Appendix we use birth certificate data from the New York City Department

of Health and Mental Hygiene to show trends in low birth weight, prenatal exposure to narcotics by race

and parity. From 1980 to 1987 there was an indication for prenatal exposure to narcotics as a medical

risk factor on the New York City birth certificate. Beginning in 1988, the indication was refined to

include separate codes for heroin, cocaine and marijuana. We tabulate the percent of births with an

indication of narcotic use during pregnancy from 1980-1987 and splice it with the percent of births with

an indication of cocaine and heroin from 1988 to 2000 by race and parity. 2 In Appendix Figure A3 Panel

A we show the percent of low birth weight births and the percent of births exposed prenatally to illicit

drugs. The data pertain to black women only with separate series for women of parity 2 and parity 3+.

The data demonstrate that the change in prenatal drug use rose faster among black women of parity 3+

relative to parity 2 beginning around 1985 as did the rate of low birth weight. In Panel B we mimic

HMS's event-study by showing the differential change in low birth weight and drug use normalized to

1993. We show the same two panel for white women in Appendix Figure A4. The data for white

women are noisier with a less obvious distinction in low birth weight and drug use by parity.

        Next, we overlay the differential rate of prenatal drug use between black women of parity 3+

relative to parity 2 with the NYC homicide rate of black males 15 to 24 (Appendix Figure A5). As noted in

the text (Section III) numerous social scientists have linked the rise in homicide among young black

males to growth in crack cocaine markets in urban areas. The New York City homicide rate among

young black males closely tracks the rise in prenatal exposure to cocaine as well the rate of low birth

weight among black women. To link the patterns in New York City to national data, we use plot the

 Screens for exposure to cocaine as reported on birth certificates are based on self-reports and may include a
physician's indication based on the medical chart. There is little doubt that the true prevalence is underreported
(Behnke et al. 2013).

differential rate of low birth weight of black women with a high school degree or less between women

of parity 3+ and parity 2 using national data from HMS and the national rate of homicide among black

males 15-24 years of age (Appendix Figure A6, Panel A). In Panel B we show the same figure for white

women. All series are normalized to 1993 so as to make them comparable to HMS's event study figures.

The point is twofold: First, low birth weight, drug use and homicide rates begin to rise after 1985, peak

around 1991 and decline thereafter. Second, to the extent that the rise in homicide rates reflects the

spread of crack-cocaine markets, they are consistent with the clinical literature, which reported greater

exposure among black women of higher relative to lower parity (Vega et al. 1993).

         There are no comparable data of prenatal exposure to cocaine by race and parity from other

parts of the country. However, as noted in footnote 16 of the text, we cite studies of prenatal exposure

to cocaine and birth outcomes from hospitals and clinics in Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Florida.

The unprecedented prevalence study in scale and accuracy by Vega et al. (1993) confirms that the

differential exposure to cocaine by race was not limited to New York City was evident across the entire

state of California.



Re-estimating the DDs with Homicide Rates

        In this section we use the national homicide rate among black males 15-24 as a proxy for the

spread of crack-cocaine markets in the 1980s and 1990s. We add the homicide rate interacted with the

women of parity 3+ to HMS's DD specification of low birth weight between women of parity 3+ and 2.

The results in Appendix Table A3 ( Panel A) show that there is no longer any association between 1993

EITC expansion and low birth weight among black women of parity 3+ relative to parity 2. The null

results for white and Hispanic women reported by HMS remain as such. We then estimate comparisons

between women of parity 4 and 4+ relative to parity 3. Recall that this placebo test found substantial

differences between these two groups of black women when there should have been none. As we show


                                                    12
in Panels B and C of Appendix Table A3, inclusion of the black homicide rate among young black males

interacted with parity eliminates this association as well. Put differently, inclusion of the homicide rate

interacted with parity in the DD regressions appears to eliminate the omitted variable bias suggested by

failed placebo tests reported in the Table 2 of the text. We cannot draw any causal conclusions from this

exercise. Nevertheless, the patterns we have detailed by race and parity are consistent with the

possible confounding of the EITC and low birth weight in HMS's analysis.

                                          Appendix B
         In this Appendix we provide a more detailed review of the published articles on the
effect of state EITCs on birth outcomes. The advantage of analyzing state EITCs, as opposed to
changes in the federal EITC, is the temporal and spatial variation in the availability of tax
credits. Conceptually, the timing and geographic variation of tax credit expansions should
lessen vulnerability to confounding relative to the federal EITC, which affects all states equally
at a point in time. The state EITCs, however, are approximately one-fifth to one-tenth the
magnitude of the federal EITC. Thus, their effects should similarly be less than those estimates
obtained by the federal EITC. Second, state EITCs are also vulnerable to policy endogeneity in
that the states that expanded their EITC are clearly not a random sample of states, but tend to be
more generous along an array of social policies. Third, none of the state studies exploits the
difference in available tax credits between women with 2 or more previous live births relative to
women with one. This has been a major identification strategy in studies of labor supply and
infant health with the federal EITC. Such comparisons would be a natural way to better control
for within-state trends and would also provide a convenient placebo test between women with 2
versus 3 previous live births all of whom are exposed to the same tax credit. Lastly, several
studies fail to correct the standard errors for clustering at the state level. As Bertrand, Duflo and
Mullainathan (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2004) demonstrate, canonical difference-in-
differences analyses of state policies will greatly underestimate the standard errors if not
adjusted for within-state autocorrelation.

       The authors use state changes in the EITC from 1994-2013 to assess the effect of an
income transfer on maternal health behaviors and birth outcomes. There were 80 changes in state
EITC programs during the study period that the authors categorize into 5 mutually exclusive
categories:
       1) no state EITC;
       2) states with a non-refundable EITC with payments less than 10 % of the federal EITC;
       3) states with a refundable EITC with payments less than 10 % of the federal EITC;
       4) states with a non-refundable EITC with payments 10% or more of the federal EITC;
       5) states with a refundable EITC with payments 10% or more of the federal EITC.
        The authors use the census of U.S birth certificates and limit the data to mothers with a
high school degree or less (n>30,000,000). They find that mothers in states with a non-
refundable EITC and with payments less than 10% of the federal EITC have infants 9.4 grams
heavier (p<.05) and infants that are 0.3 percentage points less likely to be low birth weight
(p<.01) than states with no EITC. The most generous states have infants 27 grams heavier and an
0.8 percentage point decrease in low birth weight relative to states with no EITC.
        There are two key features of the federal and state EITC. First, the maximum eligible
benefit varies by family size; and second, although the federal EITC is refundable, the EITC in
some states is not refundable. The distinction between a refundable and non-refundable tax credit
is significant. The federal EITC is refundable meaning if the family does not have a federal
income tax liability, then the full amount of the tax credit is transferred to family as income.
Ninety-six percent of families eligible for the federal EITC received tax refunds. Virginia, for
example has a non-refundable state EITC that pays 20 percent of the federal EITC. Although 20
percent is relatively generous, many low-income earners have minimal state income tax liability
and even if they did, they would not receive any income transfer in February or March, but
would instead pay less in state income tax.
         Variation in benefits by parity and refundability are useful for assessing the magnitude of
the effects reported by Markowitz et al. (2017). Using 2004, the midpoint of their study period,
the maximum federal benefit for a mother having her first birth was $390, $2,604 if having a
second birth and $4,300 if having a third or higher-order birth (all unadjusted for inflation).
Thus, the maximum state benefit in 2004 in states that offer refunds less than 10% of the federal
EITC would be at most $39 for first-time mothers, $260 for mothers having a second child and
$430 dollars for mothers having a third or higher order birth. Markowitz et al. find that low EITC
states with non-refundable credits increase the birth weight of infants to single moms by 11
grams. This seems large when compared with Hoynes, Miller and Simon (2015, HMS), who look
at the impact of the federal EITC, a benefit roughly 5-10 times greater, and find only a 9-gram
increase (HMS, Table 6). Similarly, Markowitz et al. find that states with refundable EITCs
greater than 10% of federal EITC, a benefit of roughly $70, increase birth weights by 14 grams
for first-time moms relative to states with no EITC (p<.01). Our concern is that trends within
the states grouped by the generosity of the EITC may be confounding their effects. For example,
consider the states with the most generous state EITCs. Women having a second or higher order
birth have infants only 3.4 grams heavier than women having a first birth. The difference, 3.4
grams, is clinically inconsequential (Markowitz et al., Table 3, column 5, Panels C and D). And
yet, the available tax credits to those of higher order births are an order of magnitude greater than
those to women having a first birth. In fact, if we compare birthweight, low birthweight and
gestational age between women having a second or higher order birth with women having a first
birth within each level of EITC generosity, we would conclude that the state EITCs had no
meaningful impact on infant health. This form of placebo test suggests confounding from other
factors.
        Policy endogeneity is another source of possible confounding. The states with the most
generous EITCs by 2013 are Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont, and Washington (Markowitz et al.
Figure 1). Except for Kansas and Nebraska, these states tend to be more liberal politically and
based on AFDC maximum benefits, to have more generous social welfare policies (Kleven
2019). One suggestion would be for the authors to add an event-study design. If policy
endogeneity is an issue, there may be improvement in infant health in the years leading up to the
state EITCs. This could explain the differences in birth outcomes across levels of state generosity
while showing little effect across parity within states of the same generosity.
        Lastly, Markowitz et al. find that state EITCs have the same effect on the birth outcomes
of both married and unmarried women. This is unexpected for two reasons. First, the federal
EITC has had no effect on the labor supply of married women (Hoynes and Eissa 2004). If labor
force participation is one of the mechanisms that improves self-esteem and possibly health, then
the lack of any labor supply effects eliminates this pathway. Second, the EITC tax credits to
families with two spouses working tend to be smaller than the credits to single women because
more married couples have income that places them on the phase-out portion of the EITC
(Hoynes and Eissa 2004).
       The paper by Komro et al. (2019 has the same set of authors as Markowitz et al. (2017)
and uses the same data and design. The focus is on the effect of state EITCs on birth outcomes
by race and ethnicity. In this shorter paper, the authors do not present results by parity within
groups of state EITC generosity. Thus, unlike with Markowitz et al. (2017) we cannot screen for
possible confounding by looking at the effect of state EITCs on birth outcomes across parity with
categories of state generosity.

     Earned Income Tax Credit." Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 29, no. 5 (September
     2015): 444­52. https://doi.org/10.1111/ppe.12211.


        Hamad and Rehkopf use a panel of women from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY) to analyze the separate effects of family income and state and federal EITC on
children born between 1986 and 2000. They find that $1000 in additional income increase birth
weight by a clinically irrelevant 3.7 grams (p<.10) but that the $1000 in EITC payments
increases birth weight by 65 grams. The authors acknowledge that income is likely endogenous
and they use the EITC payments as an instrument for household income. In the first stage they
find that the EITC increases post-tax income by $2,727 but the increase has no effect on birth
weight.
        We have several concerns with the specification and the estimation of standard errors in
the study. For instance, the comparison group is unclear. They include married and unmarried
women with family incomes of $100,000 or less. They estimate EITC eligibility based on
income and the number of children and use the estimated EITC payment as the "treatment."
Families with zero payments are presumably the comparison group. They also include the
mother's hours or work and the spouse's income if married, both of which are endogenous.
Similarly, they control for measures of depression, self-esteem and locus of control and physical
health, all of which have been used as outcomes in previous analyses of the EITC (Evans and
Garthwaite 2014,). Another concern is that sample sizes are small (n=3,938). If the number of
births are evenly distributed across the 14 years and 50 states, then there are 5.5 births per
state/year cell (3,938/700). Third, the policy intervention is at the state-year level and thus the
standard errors are likely underestimated because the true degrees of freedom for the EITC is 51
(50 states plus DC) and not the number of households. The IV results are also unexpected. The
IV coefficient is the ratio of two covariances: Cov(Y,Z)/Cov(X,Z) where Y is the outcome, Z the
instrument and X the endogenous variable. They report a statistically significant reduced form
{cov(Y,Z)] and a strong first stage {cov(X,Z), but a statistically insignificant IV. This is an odd
result and we suspect they have underestimated the standard errors in the reduced form (health
on EITC payment). This means there is likely no statistically significant effect of the EITC on
birthweight. Lastly they do not include state fixed effects, which would eliminate time-invariant
differences between states, a standard practice in analyses of the EITC (Strully, Rehkopf and
Xuan 2010; Markowitz et al. 2017). State fixed effects would be taxing on a model with
relatively few observations per state, but they could have included likely state-level confounders
such as welfare reform, the Medicaid eligibility expansions and state unemployment or they
could have used a first difference model. The point is that during their study period there were
profound changes in welfare reform, Medicaid/SCHIP and the macroeconomy. Absent these
state-level controls could lead to confounding.

        Health: State Earned Income Tax Credits and Birth Weight." American Sociological
        Review 75, no. 4 (2010): 534­62.


        The authors use the census of birth certificates from 1980 to 2002 to test whether state
EITCs affect infant health. They use two-way fixed effects models with a dummy variable that is
one if the state implemented an EITC and zero otherwise. They include women with at least one
previous life birth because the state tax credits for women with no children were non-existent
until 1993 and never large. The authors find that state EITCs increase birth weight by 16 grams
and lowers maternal smoking by 5 percent.

        We are skeptical of these results along several dimensions. First only 8.3 percent of births
to women with a high school degree or less were exposed to a state EITC from 1980-2002. The
benefits amounts are relatively small, approximately 15 percent of the federal benefits, and yet
the birth weight effects are double those reported by HMS (2015) in their analysis of the much
larger federal EITC. The authors do not exploit the magnitude of state EITC and whether it is
refundable or non-refundable. The range is substantial. Eleven of the 16 states in their sample
began with EITC that were 10 percent or less of the federal EITC. Seven of those 11 states
subsequently raised the state EITC but the authors do no exploit these increases either. They also
make no distinction between the much smaller tax credits available to women with one previous
live birth as compared to women with more two or more previous live births that were part of the
1993 federal EITC expansion. This has been a major source of identifying variation in many
studies of labor supply and health (HMS and Evans Garthwaite 2014). Similarly, they find state
EITC increase the birth weight of women with no previous live births, a group whose benefits
are so small (~$40 on average) that any association between state EITCs and the birth weight of
first births seems implausible. Lastly, they do not correct their standard errors for clustering at
the state level, which would reduce the effective degrees of freedom from over 8 million to 51 (
the number of states and DC). As an example of how much the standard errors are likely
underestimated, the authors report that the variable, State WIC participation, lowers birth weight
by a statistically significant 0.123 grams (p<.001). In other words, a 1 percentage point increase
in state WIC participation would increase birth weight by .12 grams (.0036 of mean birthweight).
We find it unlikely there is sufficient statistical power at the state level to detect an effect that is
one-tenth of one gram.

      Weight Birth among Low-Income Black Mothers in California." Biodemography &
      Social Biology 59, no. 2 (July 3, 2013): 141­56.
      https://doi.org/10.1080/19485565.2013.833802.


        The authors analyze the effect of the federal EITC expansions from 1991 to 1996 on the
rate of very low birth weight (VLBW) births among black women in California from 1989 to
1997. They use monthly data and time-series methods and find that the EITC was associated
with a 37 percent increase in the odds of a VLBW (n=108). They test the robustness of this
finding by estimating the odds of a VLBW birth with individual birth certificates from California
over the same time period. Estimates from these regressions also find that VLBW increases by
31 percent among women exposed to the EITC.

        The results are likely confounded by other factors. First, 99 percent of all VLBW births
are preterm and the etiology of preterm birth is not well known. Hundreds of clinical trials have
been unable to demonstrate interventions that can prevent preterm birth (Institute of Medicine
2007). Second, the authors provide no evidence of a mechanism. A similar time-series of
prenatal smoking would have been useful. Third, the authors can only speculate why an increase
in income would worsen infant health. Fourth, VLBW is a low prevalence outcome and we
wonder why the authors did not analyze outcomes of greater frequency that could provide
additional evidence of a negative effect. Lastly, as the authors acknowledge, with only one-state,
their estimates are vulnerable to any time-varying factors that could have affected the VLBW of
less educated, single black women during this period. The crack-cocaine epidemic is one
possibility. In the largest population prevalence study ever undertaken, 29,494 women were
tested for perinatal substances at 202 California hospitals in 1992. The percent of women
exposed to cocaine at delivery was 13 times greater among black non-Hispanics (7.79 percent)
than white, non-Hispanics (0.60 percent) and Hispanics (0.55 percent) (Vega et al. 1993).
Importantly, urine assays used to test for cocaine have at most a 72-hour window. Thus, those
who are using cocaine within three days of delivery are likely to be highly addicted to not just
cocaine, but tobacco, and may be trapped in a lifestyle that puts both mother and child at risk.

(HBPB), but not all do. Enrollment, therefore, is a choice and not exogenously assigned. Unless
the authors can explain and control for why some women choose to enroll and others do not, the
potential for selection bias is ever-present. HBPB provides $80 CA per month in the second and
third trimesters or approximately $500 CA per pregnancy. The program lowered the risk of low
birthweight by 29% and the risk of preterm birth by 24%. These are large effects that greatly
exceed even the treatment on the treated estimates in HMS despite more than double the increase
in income afforded by the federal EITC (HMS Online Appendix Table 3). Such large impacts
recorded by HBPB may be related to selection bias given participation is a choice. For instance,
low birthweight seems unaffected by confounders based on the sensitivity analysis conducted by
the authors whereas babies that are small for gestational age (SGA) "...were very sensitive to
unmeasured confounders.." (p. 5). We are not sure which confounders would affect SGA but
have no effect on LBW, given the LBW includes SGA births. We appreciate the authors'
straightforward presentation of the results, but the magnitude of the effects and the finding of
possible confounding in a setting where patients chose to participate raises important concerns.
