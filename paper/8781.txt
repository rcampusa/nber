                                             ABSTRACT


        Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a new variety of mutual fund that first became available in
1993. ETFs have grown rapidly and now hold nearly $80 billion in assets. ETFs are sometimes
described as more "tax efficient" than traditional equity mutual funds, since in recent years, some large
ETFs have made smaller distributions of realized and taxable capital gains than most mutual funds. This
paper provides an introduction to the operation of exchange traded funds. It also compares the pre-tax and
post-tax returns on the largest ETF, the SPDR trust that invests in the S&P500, with the returns on the
largest equity index fund, the Vanguard Index 500. The results suggest that between 1994 and 2000, the
before- and after-tax returns on the SPDR trust and this mutual fund were very similar. Both the after-tax
and the pre-tax returns on the fund were slightly greater than those on the ETF. These findings suggest
that ETFs offer taxable investors a method of holding broad baskets of stocks that deliver returns
comparable to those of low-cost index funds.

       Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a rapidly growing class of financial products. ETFs

are typically organized as unit trusts. They were introduced in 1993, and by the end of 2001, they

held $79 billion in assets -- 2.4 percent of the total assets in equity mutual funds. The share of

equity mutual fund assets held through ETFs doubled in 2000 and rose by nearly fifty percent in

2001. With several years of continued growth at this pace, the assets held through ETFs will

rival the amount held in equity index funds.

       Exchange traded funds are of interest to public finance researchers concerned with

taxation and portfolio behavior for two reasons. First, they represent new financial innovations

that are sometimes described as prototypes for the future evolution of the mutual fund industry.

It is therefore important to understand their tax treatment and their after-tax returns. Second,

ETFs are often promoted as being more "tax efficient" than traditional equity mutual funds. By

reducing the tax burden on investments in corporate stocks, relative to investments in such stocks

held through equity mutual funds, ETFs may therefore move closer to the consumption-tax

treatment of corporate capital income.

       In this brief paper, we compare the pre-tax and after-tax return on the largest exchange

traded fund, the SPDR trust that holds the securities in the S&P500, with the returns on the

largest equity index fund, the Vanguard Index 500 fund. This fund tracks the same index as the

SPDR trust. We extend the ETF return calculations of Elton, Gruber, Comer, and Li (2000) by

focusing on a longer sample period and by comparing ETF returns with those on index funds.

       Mutual funds are subject to specialized tax rules. In particular, they must pass through

realized capital gains to their shareholders. Dickson and Shoven (1995) and Dickson, Sialm, and

Shoven (2000) emphasize that this raises the tax burden on mutual fund investors relative to the

tax burden on a buy-and-hold portfolio of securities. When a fund manager sells appreciated
                                                  2


shares, buy-and-hold investors in an equity mutual fund may become taxable on the fund's

realized capital gains. Exchange traded funds are technically mutual funds, so they are

governed by the same tax rules, but they have used a technique known as “redemption in kind”

to substantially reduce or even eliminate their distributions of realized capital gains. This

accounts for their historical tax advantage relative to many traditional equity mutual funds.

1. The Mechanics of Exchange Traded Funds

       ETFs are traded securities. Gastineau (2001, 2002) provides a very detailed history of

both the history of ETFs, and the current operation of these products. The first ETFs were traded

on the American Stock Exchange, although ETFs are now traded on the New York Stock

Exchange as well. Each ETF share is a claim on a trust that holds a specified pool of assets. The

SPDR trust, for example, holds the stocks in the S&P500. ETF shares are created when an

authorized financial institution deposits a portfolio of securities with the trustee and receives

ETF shares in return. These ETF shares can be sold to other investors. The market for ETF

shares operates like the market for shares of a common stock. Investors can buy or sell ETF

shares at any point during the day. ETF share prices may diverge from the underlying net asset

value (NAV) of the securities held in the trust, although such divergence is restricted by the

capacity of authorized financial institutions to create and redeem ETF shares. If the ETF share

price rises too far above the NAV for the underlying assets, the creating institutions will buy the

associated securities, deposit them in the trust, and create new ETF shares. If the ETF share

price falls below the NAV of the underlying assets, institutions will purchase ETF shares and

redeem them for the underlying securities.

       ETF shares must be purchased through brokerage firms, which entails commission costs.

They can be purchased on margin and sold short. These features, as well as the opportunity to

trade ETF shares throughout the day, distinguish ETFs from shares in traditional equity mutual
                                                  3


funds. Mutual funds can only be bought or sold at their end-of-day net asset value. In many

cases they can be purchased without any commission, directly from the fund complex. Mutual

fund shares cannot be sold short or bought on margin. These differences suggest that ETFs and

mutual fund shares may be appropriate for different types of investors: ETFs for investors who

demand short-term liquidity and who buy in large lots, equity mutual funds for investors who

make many small purchases or sales and who place less value on liquidity.

       The foregoing differences notwithstanding, ETFs are similar to mutual funds in many

ways. Both have operating expenses that reduce investor returns. Most ETFs to date have been

designed to track a specified market index, so they are similar to equity index funds. Both ETFs

and index funds may experience some “tracking error” in matching the pre-tax return on the

index. ETF and mutual funds can differ in their expense ratios, their tracking error, and, because

of the bid-ask spread on the ETF, in the relationship between their purchase price and the net

asset value of the underlying index securities. On an after-tax basis, differences in capital gain

realizations between ETFs and equity index funds may also lead to differences in returns.

       Table 1 presents information on the growth of ETFs, equity index funds, and all equity

mutual funds during the last decade. The first column shows that between 1993, when ETFs

were first introduced, and 2000, the assets held by equity mutual funds rose roughly five-fold.

Over the same period, the assets of domestic index funds rose by a factor of fifteen. Index funds

represented three percent of the assets in equity mutual funds in 1993, compared with nearly nine

percent in 2000. The growth in ETFs is even more dramatic. ETFs had virtually no assets in

1993, but by year-end 2000, they accounted for 1.7 percent of equity mutual fund assets. This

share had grown to 2.3 percent by November 2001.

       ETF assets are highly concentrated. Table 2 shows that at the end of 2001, eight ETFs

had at least $1.5 billion in assets. The two largest funds, the SPDR trust (ticker symbol SPY)
                                                   4


and the NASDAQ 100 trust (ticker symbol QQQ) trust, accounted for more than $51 billion in

ETF assets, or nearly three quarters of the total. Table 2 also shows that the expense ratios

charged on the largest funds vary from nine basis points (iShares S&P500) to 28 basis points

(SPDR Technology). In general, the expense ratios on ETFs that invest in specific industries or

in indices that include non-U.S. stocks are higher than the expense ratios for ETFs that hold only

domestic securities. The expense ratios for most of the large ETFs, however, are substantially

below the expense ratios for equity mutual funds, even those for index funds. Data compiled by

the Investment Company Institute suggest that in 1998, the asset-weighted average expense ratio

for domestic equity index funds was 24 basis points (0.24 percent) per year.

2. Comparing Returns on ETFs and Index Funds

       To illustrate the differences in the before-tax and the after-tax returns on ETFs and

traditional equity mutual funds, consider a taxable investor who faces a tax rate of τd on dividend

income and τcg on realized long-term capital gains. Assume that all realized gains are long term.

For investors who do not liquidate their holdings, the pretax return (R) on both ETFs and mutual

funds consist of three components: R = d + g + u. In this expression, d denotes dividend income,

g denotes realized capital gains distributed by the ETF or the fund, and u denotes unrealized capital

gains. All three of these return components are measured as percentages of the beginning of period

value of the fund or the ETF. For the fund this would be measured using NAV, while for the ETF,

the initial value could be measured using either NAV or the market price of ETF shares.

       Table 3 presents information on the return to holding an S&P500 portfolio by holding the

SPDR exchange-traded fund and by holding the retail Vanguard Index 500 fund. The table also

shows the returns on the index itself. We consider the retail version of the Vanguard index fund,

which has higher expenses than the institutional fund for clients with large portfolios.
                                                   5


       We calculate returns on the SPDR trust in two ways. The first measures annual

undistributed capital gains as the difference between the net asset value of the SPDR trust at the

beginning and at the end of the year. The second measures undistributed capital gains as the

difference between the closing prices for the shares in the SPDR trust over the same period. The

NAV and closing price can differ for the ETF. Table 3 shows that on average, the total pretax

return for a SPDR trust investor was 16 or 17 basis points, depending on our measure of

undistributed capital gains, below the return on the Vanguard Index 500. This fund in turn had an

average return that was six basis points lower than the return on the S&P 500 Index. The return

differential between the index fund and the index is smaller than the index fund's expense ratio.

This indicates that the Vanguard Index 500 fund outperformed the index during our sample period.

The superior performance of the index fund may be due to various trading strategies with positive

average returns, such as purchasing shares in companies that are being added to the S&P 500 when

their addition is announced, rather when the addition actually takes place.

       The 22 or 23 basis point shortfall between the average return on the SPDR trust and the

return on the S&P 500 Index is explained by two primary factors. First, the expense ratio for the

SPDR exchange traded fund averaged 17 basis points over the seven-year period we consider.

Second, when an ETF receives dividend payments, they are held in a non-interest-bearing cash

account until the end of each quarter, at which point they are distributed to investors. Elton,

Gruber, Comer, and Li (2000) observe that in a rising market, like that experienced during much of

our sample period, the delay in reinvesting dividends will cause the return on the ETF to fall below

that on the market index or on index funds that reinvest dividends immediately.

       The calculations in Table 3 suggest that the average return on the SPDR trust has been

close to the average return on the S&P 500 index, and that it has been within twenty basis points of

the average pretax return on the lowest-cost retail index fund. The average ETF return would be
                                                   6


closer to the average return on all index funds, since other retail index funds have higher expense

ratios than the Vanguard Index 500. The disparity between the ETF return and the index fund

return would be larger if we considered an institutional index fund, such as Vanguard Admiral

shares, which charge an expense ratio of 12 rather than 18 basis points.

        Table 3 shows that while the average return on the SPDR trust tracks the average S&P 500

return, there are non-trivial year-to-year differences. The difference between the closing price and

the NAV on ETFs can generate differences between the ETF return calculated using closing prices

and the return on the index fund or the S&P 500 index. In 1999, for example, there was nearly a

60 basis point difference between the ETF return calculated using closing prices and that calculated

using the net asset value at the beginning and end of the year.

3. Taxes and Transactions Costs

        The current-year after-tax return for a buy-and-hold investor in either an ETF or an index

fund is Rat = (1-τd)*d + (1-τcg )*g + u. Bergstresser and Poterba (2002) note that unrealized gains

in fact face a tax burden that in present discounted value is some fraction of the current statutory

tax rate. Assuming a zero tax rate on undistributed gains probably overstates the effective after-tax

return differences between the SPDR trust and the Vanguard Index 500.

        The average capital gain distribution on the SPDR trust, as a percentage of the beginning-

of-year trust value, has been three basis points per year over the 1993-2000 period. For the

Vanguard Index 500 fund, the average capital gain distribution has been 48 basis points. For a

taxable investor facing a 20 percent marginal tax rate on realized capital gains, the after-tax return

on the index fund would be reduced, relative to that on the SPDR, by roughly nine basis points.

        Table 4 shows the before-tax and the after-tax geometric mean return on both the SPDR

and the Vanguard Index 500 fund over the 1994-2000 period. Before tax, the return on the

Vanguard Index 500 is 21.5 basis points higher than the return on the ETF. This value is different
                                                  7


from the value in Table 3, which focuses on the arithmetic mean return. For an investor facing an

income tax rate of 39.6% on dividend income, and 20% on long-term capital gain realizations, the

after-tax return on the Vanguard Index 500 is 17.2 basis points higher than that on the SPDR trust.

If the investor faces a lower marginal tax rate, 28% on ordinary income, then the return differential

is 17.9 basis points in favor of the Vanguard Index 500 fund. These modest differences suggest

that the higher tax burden associated with the greater capital gain distributions on the Index 500

fund, relative to the SPDR ETF, do not reduce the after-tax return by enough to outweigh the

pretax return advantage of the index fund. The capital gain distributions of the Vanguard Index

500 fund are very low by comparison to other equity mutual funds, and even by comparison to

other index funds. If we compared the SPDR with other index funds, the after-tax return benefits

of low capital gain distributions would be magnified.

       The calculations in Table 4 do not include all of the potential costs that an investor might

face in purchasing an exchange traded fund. Investors must pay commission charges to a broker

when they buy or sell ETFs. In addition, the bid-ask spread on ETFs raises the round-trip

transaction cost. For the 1994-2000 period, the average difference between the bid and ask prices

for the SPDR trust, as a percentage of the midpoint of the price range for each day, was 0.096

percent (9.6 basis points). This spread would essentially represent a one-time charge associated

with trading in ETFs. Commission charges should be viewed in the same way – a one-time cost

that reduces the return on the ETF investment.

       We have not tried to calculate the effect of these transaction costs on the internal rate of

return on the SPDR trust relative to that on the Vanguard Index 500. If an investor were holding

the SPDR trust for only a single year, then the return would be reduced by the average bid-ask

spread, or by another 9.6 basis points. Commission costs would further reduce the return, but the

magnitude of this effect would depend on the size of the ETF purchase. Over longer holding
                                                    8


periods, the transaction cost associated with the bid-ask spread has a more muted effect on the

internal rate of return.

4. In-Kind Redemptions and After-Tax Returns

        The SPDR trust has distributed fewer capital gains than the Vanguard Index 500 over our

sample period. The difference in capital gain realization rates between ETFs and equity mutual

funds has more generally been a key component of the marketing claim that ETFs are "tax

efficient" relative to mutual funds. The experience of the SPDR trust is not representative of all

ETFs -- many ETFs have distributed capital gains in recent years. However, the way ETF shares

are created and redeemed provides ETFs with a means to lower their capital gain realizations

relative to some traditional equity mutual funds.

        When arbitrageurs redeem ETF shares from the trust, the trustee has the option of

distributing the underlying securities that comprise the index, rather than cash, to the arbitraguer.

This is known as "redemption in kind," and it is a strategy that is available to all investment

companies operating under the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Traditional

equity mutual funds can also utilize redemption in kind, although they have historically used this

option relatively infrequently. The greater use of this strategy by the ETFs reflects in part their

greater frequency of large trades, as arbitrageurs create and redeem trust shares.

        Redemption in kind offers the trustee the opportunity to reduce the value of unrealized

capital gains held within the ETF trust. When the trustee distributes securities, he can choose to

distribute securities with substantial embedded capital gains. When an arbitrageur redeems

$100,000 of ETF shares for $100,500 of underlying stock, the capital gain for the arbitrageur is

$500. This is true even if the ETF distributes a basket of securities with a current market value

of $100,500, but a basis to the ETF of $50,000. When the ETF distributes these securities with a

basis below the market price, however, it eliminates the potential capital gains tax liability that
                                                  9


ETF investors might face if these shares were sold, thereby triggering a pass-through of realized

capital gains. Thus redemption in kind provides a way around the problem of embedded capital

gains in open-end equity mutual funds. By distributing low-basis stock, the ETF reduces the

likelihood that it will at some point need to sell low-basis stock and then distribute realized

capital gains to its investors.

        Redemption in kind is a powerful means of reducing embedded capital gains. As of

September 30, 2000, for example, the SPDR trust held net assets of $24.29 billion, capital loss

carryforwards of $0.52 billion, and unrealized capital losses of $1.06 billion. Despite the fact

that the trust had grown through a period of substantial market appreciation, it apparently had

succeeded in distributing its low-basis securities and retaining higher basis holdings.

        Redemption in kind is not the only factor leading to differences in capital gain

realizations between the SPDR trust and the Vanguard Index 500. Because the SPDR trust was

created in 1993, while the Vanguard Index 500 began trading in the 1970s, the distribution of

purchase bases for the securities in the SPDR trust is different from that in the Vanguard fund.

Such historical differences can lead to differences in realized gains and after-tax returns.

5. Further Issues

        In future work, we hope to explore many issues associated with exchange traded funds.

We hope to move beyond our analysis of the SPDR trust to consider the performance of other

exchange traded funds. In October 2001, there were 96 exchange traded funds, compared with

79 one year earlier. Many of the new funds have specific investment objectives, such as holding

stocks in a given sector or nation, and they also have substantially higher expense ratios than the

SPDR trust. The mutual funds that these ETFs compete with are also likely to have substantially

higher expenses than the Vanguard Index 500 fund.
                                                 10


       A second issue involves studying the attraction of ETFs and traditional open-end equity

mutual funds for taxable investors with assets in both a taxable and a tax-deferred account. The

low rate of taxable distributions on ETFs, and their liquidity, may make them more attractive for

equity investments outside tax-deferred accounts than for investments in IRAs or 401(k)s. The

attributes of traditional equity mutual funds may make them more attractive for retirement

account investors.

       Finally, we plan to consider how ETFs feature in the expanding mix of products offered

by the mutual fund industry. ETFs may be part of an emerging trend toward segmentation of the

mutual fund marketplace, with investors who wish to trade frequently segregated into different

products than low-turnover investors. The former group may eventually hold funds with

substantial expense ratios that cover the account management fees associated with high-turnover

investors, while the low-turnover, or high account value, investors may be able to invest through

funds with much lower costs. ETFs may attract investors who value the ability to trade

frequently, thus reducing the turnover rate for the investors who continue to invest in traditional

open end equity funds.
