                                            ABSTRACT

        This paper examines minority-white wage gaps. Neal and Johnson (1996) show that
controlling for ability measured in the teenage years eliminates young adult wage gaps for all groups
except for black males, for whom they eliminate 70% of the gap. Their study has been faulted
because minority children and their parents may have pessimistic expectations about receiving fair
rewards for their skills and so they may invest less in skill formation. If this is the case,
discrimination may still affect wages, albeit indirectly, though it would appear that any racial
differences in wages are due to differences in acquired traits.
        We find that gaps in ability across racial and ethnic groups open up at very early ages, long
before child expectations are likely to become established. These gaps widen with age and schooling
for Blacks, but not for Hispanics which indicates that poor schools and neighborhoods cannot be the
principal factors affecting the slow black test score growth rate.
         Test scores depend on schooling attained at the time of the test. Adjusting for racial and
ethnic differences in schooling attainment at the age the test is taken reduces the power of measured
ability to shrink wage gaps for blacks, but not for other minorities.
        The evidence from expectations data are mixed. Although all groups are quite optimistic
about future schooling outcomes, minority parents and children have more pessimistic expectations
about child schooling relative to white children and their parents when their children are young. At
later ages, expectations are more uniform across racial and ethnic groups. However, we also present
some evidence that expectations data are unreliable and ambiguous.
       We also document the presence of disparities in noncognitive traits across racial and ethnic
groups. These characteristics have been shown elsewhere to be important for explaining the labor
market outcomes of adults.
        This evidence points to the importance of early (preschool) family factors and environments
in explaining both cognitive and noncognitive ability differentials by ethnicity and race. Policies that
foster both types of ability are far more likely to be effective in promoting racial and ethnic equality
for most groups than are additional civil rights and affirmative action policies targeted at the
workplace.

1         Introduction

In spite of 40 years of civil rights and aﬃrmative action policy, substantial gaps remain in the

market wages of African-American males and females compared to white males and females. There

are sizable wage gaps for Hispanics as well.1 Columns I of table 1 report the mean hourly log wage

gaps for a cohort of black and Hispanic males and females. These gaps are for a cohort of young

persons age 26-28 in 1990 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979, or NLSY79. We

follow the cohort for 10 years until it reaches age 36-38 in 2000. These gaps are not adjusted for

diﬀerences in schooling, ability, or other potential sources of racial and ethnic wage diﬀerentials.

        Table 1 shows that, on average, black males earn 25% lower wages than white males in 1990.

Hispanic males earn 17.4% lower wages in the same year. Moreover, the gaps widen for males as

the cohort ages. The results for women reveal smaller gaps for blacks and virtually no gap at all

for Hispanic women.2 The gaps for women show no clear trend with age. Altonji and Blank (1999)

report similar patterns using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

        These gaps are consistent with the claims of pervasive labor market discrimination against

many minorities, namely, that minority workers with the same ability and training as white workers

receive lower wages. However, there is another equally congruous explanation. Minorities may

bring less skill and ability to the market. Although there may be discrimination or disparity in

the development of these valuable skills, the skills may be rewarded equally across all demographic

groups in the labor market.

    1
     The literature on African-American economic progress over the 20th century is surveyed in Heckman and Todd
(2001).
   2
     However, the magnitude (but not the direction) of the female gaps is less reliable, at least for black women. Neal
(2003) shows that racial wage gaps for black women are underestimated by these types of regressions since they do
not control for selective labor force participation. This same line of reasoning is likely to hold for Hispanic women.




                                                          1
       These two interpretations of market wage gaps have profoundly diﬀerent policy implications. If

persons of identical skill are treated diﬀerently on the basis of race or ethnicity, a more vigorous

enforcement of civil rights and aﬃrmative action in the marketplace may be warranted. If the gaps

are due to unmeasured abilities and skills that people bring to the labor market, then a redirection

of policy towards fostering skills should be emphasized as opposed to a policy of ferreting out

discrimination in the workplace.

       An important paper by Derek Neal and William Johnson (1996) sheds light on the relative

empirical importance of market discrimination and skill disparity in accounting for wage gaps by

race. Controlling for a measure of scholastic ability measured in the middle teenage years, they

substantially reduce but do not fully eliminate wage gaps for black males in 1990-1991. They

more than eliminate the gaps for black females. Columns II of tables 1 show our version of the

Neal-Johnson study,3 expanded to cover additional years. For black males, controlling for an early

measure of ability cuts the wage gap in 1990 by 76 percent. For Hispanic males, controlling for

ability essentially eliminates it. For women the results are even more striking. Wage gaps are

actually reversed, and controlling for ability leads to higher wages for minority females.

       Following Neal and Johnson, these adjustments do not control for racial and economic diﬀerences

in schooling, occupational choice, or work experience. Neal and Johnson argue that racial and ethnic

diﬀerences in these factors may reflect responses to labor market discrimination and should not be

controlled for in estimating the full eﬀect of race on wages since this may spuriously reduce estimated

wage gaps by introducing a proxy for discrimination into the control variables. They further argue

   3
    We use a sample very similar to the one used in their study. It includes individuals born only in 1962-1964.
This exclusion is designed to alleviate the eﬀects of diﬀerential schooling at the test date on test performance and
to ensure that the AF QT test is taken before the individuals enter the labor market (i.e., so that it is a premarket
factor).




                                                         2
that ability measured in the teenage years is a “premarket” factor, meaning that it is not aﬀected by

expectations or actual experiences of discrimination in the labor market. We consider this claim and

argue that there is considerable arbitrariness in proclaiming what is or is not a “premarket” factor,

and such determinations matter greatly for the size of the adjusted wage gaps. When adjustments

for schooling attainment at the date of the test are made, the adjusted wage gaps rise.

       Gaps in measured ability by ethnicity and race are indeed substantial. In figures 1A and 1B

we have plotted the ability distribution as measured by age-corrected AFQT4 for men and women,

respectively. These diﬀerences are not small. As noted by Herrnstein and Murray (1994), the ability

gaps are a major factor in accounting for a variety of racial and ethnic disparities in socioeconomic

outcomes. For example, Cameron and Heckman (2001) show that controlling for ability, blacks and

Hispanics are more likely to enter college than are whites at a time when wage premia for education

are rising considerably.5

       The evidence in columns II of table 1 suggests that the major source of minority-majority

diﬀerences in wages is the disparity in characteristics that minorities bring to the market rather

than discrimination in the workplace. At first glance, the evidence in the table suggests that there

is no racial or ethnic disparity in market payments for comparable levels of skill for all but black

males.

       Though the facts displayed in table 1 and figures 1A-B are provocative, they are controversial

   4
     Age-corrected AFQT is the standardized residual from the regression of the AFQT score on age at the time of the
test dummy variables. AFQT is a subset of 4 out of 10 ASVAB tests used by the military for enlistment screening
and job assignment. It is the summed score from the word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, mathematics
knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning ASVAB tests.
   5
     Urzua (2003) shows that this eﬀect arises from greater minority enrollment in two-year colleges. Controlling for
ability, whites are more likely to attend and graduate from four year colleges. Using the Current Population Survey,
Black and Sufi (2002) find that equating the family background of blacks and whites eliminates the black-white gap
in schooling only at the bottom of the family background distribution. Furthermore, the gaps are eliminated in the
1980s, but not in the 1990s.



                                                         3
for a number of reasons. The major points of contention are as follows.


  1. The gaps in ability evident in figures 1A-B may stem from lowered academic eﬀort in an-

     ticipation of future discrimination in the labor market. If skills are not rewarded fairly, the

     incentive to acquire them is diminished for those subject to prejudicial treatment. Discrim-

     ination in the labor market might not only sap the incentives of children and young adults

     to acquire skills and abilities, but it may also influence the eﬀorts they exert in raising their

     own oﬀspring. This means that measured ability may not be a true premarket factor. Neal

     and Johnson (1996) mention this qualification in their original paper and their critics have

     subsequently reiterated it.


  2. The gaps in ability may also be a consequence of adverse environments, and thus the appro-

     priate policy for eliminating ability gaps is not apparent from table 1. Should policies focus

     on early ages through enriched Head Start programs or on improving schooling quality and

     reducing school dropout and repetition rates that plague minority children at later ages?


     This paper provides answers to these questions. We show that:


(a) The evidence from data on parents’ and children’s expectations tells a mixed story. If the

     rewards to schooling are lower for minorities, the return to schooling is lower and minority

     expectations of schooling attainment should be lower. Minority child and parent expectations

     measured when the children are 16 and 17 about the children’s schooling prospects are as

     optimistic as white expectations, although actual schooling outcomes of whites and minorities

     are dramatically diﬀerent. Diﬀerential expectations at these ages cannot explain the gaps in

     ability evident in figures 1A and 1B.


                                                 4
     For children ages 14 and below, parent and child expectations about schooling are much

     lower for blacks than for whites, though only slightly lower for Hispanics than for whites. All

     groups are still rather optimistic in light of actual subsequent schooling attendance. At these

     ages, diﬀerences in expectations across groups may lead to diﬀerential investments in skill

     formation. Still, though lower expectations may be a consequence of perceived labor market

     discrimination, they may also reflect child and parental perception of the lower endowments

     possessed by minorities.

     The fact that reported expectations are so inaccurate casts some doubt about the usefulness of

     expectations elicited by questionnaires for testing the actual expectations governing behavior.

     This is compounded by ambiguity of the source of the relatively pessimistic expectations.


(b) Ability gaps open up early, often by age 1 or 2, and as a result minorities enter school with

     substantially lower measured ability than whites. The black-white ability gap widens as the

     children get older and obtain more schooling, but the contribution of formal education to the

     widening of the gap is small when compared to the size of the initial gap. There is a much

     smaller widening of the Hispanic-white gap.


     This evidence implies that school-based policies are unlikely to have substantial eﬀects on

     eliminating minority ability gaps. Factors that operate early in the life cycle of the child

     are likely to have the greatest impact on ability. Although ability gaps between blacks and

     whites widen with schooling, the eﬀect of formal schooling on ability is much smaller for

     blacks than for whites, and about the same for Hispanics and whites. The early emergence

     of ability gaps indicates that child expectations can play only a limited role in accounting for

     ability gaps since very young children are unlikely to have formed expectations about labor

                                                 5
     market discrimination or to take decisions based on those expectations. However, parental

     expectations of future discrimination may still play a role.


      The early emergence of measured ability diﬀerentials also casts doubt on the empirical impor-

     tance of the “stereotype threat” (see Steele and Aronson, 1998) as a major factor contributing

     to black-white test score diﬀerentials. The literature on this topic finds that black college stu-

     dents at selective colleges perform worse on tests when they are told that the outcomes will

     be used in some way to measure black-white ability diﬀerences, i.e., that the test may be

     used to confirm stereotypes about black-white ability diﬀerentials. However, the children in

     our data are tested at a young age and are unlikely to be aware of stereotypes about minority

     inferiority or be aﬀected by the stereotype threat which has only been established for students

     at elite college. In addition, large gaps in tests are also evident for Hispanics, a group for

     whom the stereotype threat has not been documented.


(c) We find that diﬀerences in levels of schooling at the date the test is taken play a sizable role

     in accounting for ability diﬀerentials. Adjusting for the schooling attainment of minorities at

     the time that they take the test provides a potential qualification to the Neal and Johnson

     finding. Part of the ability gap demonstrated by Neal and Johnson is due to diﬀerential

     schooling attainment. An extra year of schooling has a greater impact on test scores for

     whites and Hispanics than for blacks. Adjusting the test score for schooling disparity at the

     date of the test raises the estimated wage gap and leaves more room for an interpretation of

     labor market discrimination.


     This finding does not necessarily overturn the conclusion of the Neal-Johnson analysis. At

     issue is the source of the gap in schooling attainment at the date of the test. Our analysis

                                                  6
     reveals that the amount of the wage gap that is explained by discrepancies in scholastic ability

     depends on the age and grade completed at the date of measurement of ability. Tests adjusted

     for schooling explain less of the black-white wage gap compared to the unadjusted tests. The

     Neal-Johnson “pre-market” factors are a composite of ability and schooling, and are likely to

     reflect both the life cycle experiences and the expectations of the child. To the extent that they

     reflect expectations of discrimination as embodied in schooling that aﬀects test scores, test

     scores are contaminated by market discrimination and are not truly premarket factors. An

     open question is how much of the gap in schooling is due to expectations about discrimination.

     For black males premarket factors account for half of the black-white wage gap for males. We

     argue that our adjustment is overly conservative because much of the gap in schooling and

     ability opens up at an early age, before expectations of labor market discrimination can be a

     plausible explanation. The adjustments for the eﬀect of schooling on the test score have much

     weaker eﬀects for other demographic groups.


(d) A focus on cognitive skill gaps, while traditional (see, e.g., Jencks and Phillips, 1998), misses

     important non-cognitive components of social and economic success. We show that non-

     cognitive (i.e., behavioral) gaps also open up early. Previous work shows that they play

     an important role in accounting for market wages. Policies that focus solely on improving

     cognitive skills miss an important and promising determinant of socioeconomic success and

     disparity that can be aﬀected by policy (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003).


   Section 2 presents evidence on the evolution of test score gaps over the lifecycle of the child.

Section 3 presents our evidence on how adjusting for schooling at the date of the test aﬀects the

Neal-Johnson analysis, and how schooling aﬀects test scores diﬀerentially for minorities. Section 4


                                                  7
discusses data on expectations. Section 5 presents evidence on noncognitive skills that parallels the

analysis of Section 2. Section 6 concludes.




2    Minority-White Diﬀerences in Early Test Scores and Early

     Environments

The evidence presented in Section 1 suggests that a large fraction of the minority-white disparity

in labor market outcomes that is frequently attributed to discrimination may be due instead to

minority-white disparities in skill endowments. These skill endowments may be innate or acquired

during the lifetime of an individual. In this section we summarize evidence from the literature and

present original empirical work that demonstrates that minority-white cognitive skill gaps emerge

early and persist through childhood and the adolescent years.

    Jencks and Phillips (1998) and Duncan and Brooks-Gunn (1997), among others, document

that the black-white test score gap is large for 3 and 4 year old children. Using the Children

of the NLSY79 (CNLSY) survey, a variety of studies show that even after controlling for many

variables like individual, family and neighborhood characteristics, the black-white test score gap

is still sizable. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS), Fryer and Levitt (2002)

eliminate the black-white test score gap in math and reading for children at the time they are

entering kindergarten, although not in subsequent years. However, the raw test score gaps at

ages 3 and 4 are much smaller in ECLS than in CNLSY and other data sets that have been

used to study this issue. These studies also document that there are large black-white diﬀerences

in family environments. Ferguson (2002a) summarizes this literature and presents evidence that



                                                 8
black children in the ECLS come from much poorer and less educated families than white children,

and they are also more likely to grow up in single parent households. Studies summarized in

Ferguson (2002b) find that the achievement gap is high even for blacks and whites attending high

quality suburban schools.6 The common finding across these studies is that the black-white gap

in test scores is large and that it persists even after one controls for family background variables.

Children of diﬀerent racial and ethnic groups grow up in strikingly diﬀerent environments. Even

after accounting for these environmental factors in a correlational sense, test score gaps tend to

persist. Furthermore, they tend to widen with age and schooling: black children show lower ability

growth with schooling or age than white children.

       In this paper we present some evidence from CNLSY.7 We have also examined the ECLS and

the Children of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CPSID) and found similar patterns. We

broaden previous analyses to include Hispanic-white diﬀerentials. Figures 2A-B shows the average

percentile PIAT Math8 scores for males and females in diﬀerent age groups by race. Racial and

ethnic gaps are found as early as ages 5 and 6 (the earliest ages at which we can measure math

scores in CNLSY data).9 On average, black 5- and 6-year old boys are almost 18 percentile points

below white 5- and 6-year old boys (i.e., if the average white is at the 50th percentile of the test

score distribution, the average black is at the 32nd percentile of this distribution). The gap is a bit

smaller—16 percent—but still substantial for Hispanics. The finding is similar for black and Hispanic

women who exhibit gaps of about 14 percent relative to whites. These findings are duplicated for

   6
      This is commonly referred to as the “Shaker Heights study,” although it analyzed many other similar
neighborhoods.
    7
      For a description of CNLSY and NLSY79 see BLS (2001).
    8
      The PIAT Math is the abbreviation for Peabody Individual Achievement Test in Mathematics. This test measures
the child’s attainment in mathematics as taught in mainstream education. It consists of 84 multiple choice questions
of increasing diﬃculty, beginning with recognizing numerals and progressing to geometry and trigonometry.
    9
      Instead of using raw scores or standardized scores we choose to use ranks, or percentiles, since test score scales
have no intrinsic meaning. Our results are not sensitive to this procedure.


                                                           9
many other test scores and in other data sets, and are not altered if we use median test scores

instead of means. Furthermore, as shown in figures 3A-B, even when we use a test taken at earlier

ages, racial gaps in test scores can be found at ages 1 and 2, though not always for women.10 In

general, we find that the test score gaps emerge early and persist through adulthood.

       For simplicity, we will focus on means and medians in this paper. However, figures 1A-B and

4A-B illustrate that there is considerable overlap in the distribution of test scores across groups in

recent generations. Many black and Hispanic children at ages 5 and 6 score higher on a math test

score than the average white child. Statements that we make about medians or means do not apply

to all persons in the distributions.

       Figures 2A-B also shows that the black-white percentile PIAT Math score gap widens with age.

By ages 13 to 14, the average black is ranked more than 22 percentiles below the average white.

In fact, it is well documented that these gaps persist until adulthood and beyond. At 13 to 14

Hispanic boys are still almost 16 points below the average white. For black and Hispanic girls, the

gap widens to 21% and 16%, respectively.

       In summary, when blacks and Hispanics enter the labor market, on average, they have a much

poorer set of skills than whites. Thus it is not surprising that their average labor market outcomes

are so much worse. Furthermore, these skill gaps emerge very early in the life-cycle, persist, and if

anything, widen for some groups. Initial conditions (i.e., early test scores) are very important as

skill begets skill.

       Even after controlling for numerous environmental and family background factors, the racial

and ethnic test score gaps remain for many of these tests at ages 3 and 4, and for virtually all the

  10
    Parts of the Body Test attempts to measure the young child’s receptive vocabulary knowledge of orally presented
words as a means of estimating intellectual development. The interviewer names each of ten body parts and asks
the child to point to that part of the body.


                                                        10
tests at later ages. Figures 5A-B show that, even after adjusting for measures of family background,

such as family long-term or “permanent” income and mother’s education, the mother’s cognitive

ability (as measured by age-corrected AFQT), and a measure of home environment called the home

score,11 the black-white gap in percentile PIAT Math scores at ages 5-6 is almost 8%, and at ages

13-14 is close to 11% for boys. Hispanic-white diﬀerentials are reduced more by such adjustments,

falling to 7% at ages 5-6 and to 4% at ages 13-14 for boys. For other tests, diﬀerentials frequently

become positive or statistically insignificant. For girls, the gaps in PIAT Math are reduced to about

5% at ages 5-6 by the same adjustment, though the Hispanic gap falls to 4% while the black gap

rises to 6% by age 13-14. Appendix tables 1A-1B report that even after controlling for diﬀerent

measures of home environments and child stimulation, the black-white test score gap persists even

though it drops considerably.12 Measured home and family environments play an important role in

the formation of these skills, although they are not the whole story.13 For females, both raw and

adjusted test score gaps are smaller than for males, but the overall story is the same.14

    The evidence for Hispanics tells a diﬀerent story.15 Early test scores for blacks and Hispanics

are similar, although Hispanics often perform slightly better. Figure 2A shows that for the PIAT

   11
      The home score is the primary measure of the quality of a child’s home environment included in CNLSY. It
is composed of various measures of age-specific cognitive and emotional stimulation based on dichotomized and
summed responses from the mother’s self-report and interviewer observation. Some items included in the home
score are number of books, magazines, toys and musical recordings, how often mother reads to child, frequency of
family activities (eating, outings), methods of discipline and parenting, learning at home, television watching habits
and parental expectations for the child (chores, time use), home cleanliness and safety and types of mother-child
interactions.
   12
      Results for other tests and other samples can be found in http://lily.src.uchicago.edu/~dvmaster/Stanford.html.
Even though for some test scores early black-white test score gaps can be eliminated once we control for a large
number of characteristics, it is harder to eliminate them at later ages. In the analysis presented here the most
important variable in reducing the test score gap is mother’s cognitive ability, as measured by the AFQT.
   13
      However the Home Score includes variables such as the number of books, which are clearly choice variables and
likely to cause problems in this regression. The variables with the largest eﬀect on the minority-white test score gap
are maternal AFQT and raw home score.

      We already saw that wage gaps are completely eliminated for Hispanics when we control for AFQT, while they
persist for blacks.

Math score the Hispanic-black gap is about 2 percentile points.16 This is much smaller than either

the black-white or the Hispanic-white gap. For the PIAT Math test, the black-white gap widens

dramatically, especially at later ages, but the Hispanic-white gap does not change substantially

with age. For other tests, even when there is some widening of the Hispanic-white gap with age,

it tends to be smaller than the widening in the black-white gap in test scores. In particular, when

we look at the AFQT scores displayed in figures 1A-B, and which are measured using individuals

at ages 16-23, Hispanics clearly have higher scores than blacks. In contrast, figures 4A-B show a

strong similarity between the math scores of blacks and Hispanics at ages 5 and 6, although there

are other tests where, even at these early ages, Hispanics perform significantly better than blacks.

When we control for the eﬀects of home and family environments on test scores, the Hispanic-white

test score gap either decreases or is constant over time while the black-white test score tends to

widen with age.

       Racial ability gaps open up very early. Home and family environments at early ages, and even

the mother’s behavior during pregnancy, are likely to play crucial roles in the child’s development,

and black children grow up in significantly more disadvantaged environments than white children.

Figure 6 shows the distributions of long-term or “permanent” family income for blacks, whites and

Hispanics. Minority children are much more likely to grow up in low income families than are white

children. Figure 7 shows the distribution of maternal education across race and ethnic groups.

Even though the overlap in the distributions is large, white children have more educated mothers

than do minority children. The distribution of maternal AFQT scores, shown in figure 8, is again

very diﬀerent for minority and white children. Maternal AFQT is a major predictor of children’s

  16
    The test score is measured in percentile rank The black-white gap is slightly below 18 while the Hispanic-white
gap is slightly below 16. This means that the black-Hispanic gap should be around 2.

test scores.17 Figure 9 document that white mothers are much more likely to read to their children

at young ages than are minority mothers, and we obtain similar results at young ages.18 Using

this reading variable and other variables in CNLSY such as number of books, magazines, toys

and musical recordings, family activities (eating, outings), methods of discipline and parenting,

learning at home, TV watching habits, parental expectations for the child (chores, time use), and

home cleanliness and safety, we can construct an index of cognitive and emotional stimulation—the

home score. Figure 10 shows that this index is always higher for whites than for minorities.19

Figure 11 shows that blacks are the most likely to grow up in broken homes. Hispanics are less

likely than blacks to grow up in a broken home, although they are much more likely to do so

than are whites. The research surveyed in Carneiro and Heckman (2003) suggests that enhanced

cognitive stimulation at early ages is likely to produce some achievement test gains in children from

disadvantaged environments, although long lasting eﬀects of such interventions on IQ are not found.

       The fact that racial and ethnic test score gaps open up early casts doubt on the empirical

importance of the stereotype threat. It is now fashionable in some circles to attribute gaps in black

test scores to racial consciousness on the part of black test takers stemming from the way test scores

are used in public discourse to describe minorities. Stereotype threats could not have been important

when blacks took the first IQ tests at the beginning of the twentieth century which documented

the racial diﬀerentials that gave rise to the stereotype. Yet racial IQ gaps are comparable across

time.20 Young children, like the ones studied in this paper, are unlikely to have the heightened racial

     Murray (1999) reviews the evidence on the evolution of the black-white IQ gap. In the 1920s—a time when such
tests were much more unrealiable and black educational attainment much lower—the mean black-white diﬀerence
was 0.86 standard deviations. The largest black-white diﬀerence appears in the 1960s, with a mean black-white
diﬀerence of 1.28 standard deviations. The diﬀerence ranges from a low of 0.82 standard deviations in the 1930s to

in college students at a few elite universities. Moreover, sizable gaps are found for young Hispanic

males—a group for which the “stereotype” threat remains to be investigated.




3     The Diﬀerential Eﬀect of Schooling on Test Scores

The previous section shows that cognitive test scores are correlated with home and family environ-

ments. We referenced research that suggests that test score gaps increase with age and schooling,

and presented fresh evidence on this issue. The research of Hansen, Heckman and Mullen (2003)

shows that the AFQT test scores used by Neal and Johnson are aﬀected by schooling attainment

of individuals at the time they take the test. Therefore, one reason for the divergence of black and

white test scores over time may be diﬀerential schooling attainments. Figure 12 shows the schooling

completed at the test date for the six demographic groups used in the Neal and Johnson sample.

Blacks have slightly less completed schooling at test date than whites, but substantially more than

Hispanics. There are substantial schooling deficits for minorities.

    Table 2 presents the eﬀect of schooling at test date on AFQT scores for individuals in diﬀerent

demographic groups in the NLSY, using a version of the nonparametric method developed in Hansen,

Heckman and Mullen (2003). Their method isolates the causal eﬀect of schooling attained at the test

date on test scores controlling for unobserved factors that lead to selective diﬀerences in schooling

attainment. This table shows clearly that the eﬀect of schooling on test scores is much higher for

whites and Hispanics than it is for blacks over most ranges of schooling. As a result, even though

Hispanics have fewer years of completed schooling at the time they take the AFQT test than blacks

1.12 standard deviations in the 1970s. However, none of the samples prior to 1960 are nationally representative, and
the samples were often chosen so as to eﬀectively bias the black mean upward.

                                                        14
(see figure 12), on average Hispanics score better on the AFQT than do blacks.

      There are diﬀerent explanations for these facts. Carneiro and Heckman (2003) suggest that

one important feature of the learning process may be complementarity between endowment human

capital and learning.21 Higher levels of human capital raise the productivity of learning.22 If

minorities and whites start school with very diﬀerent initial conditions (as documented in the

previous section), their learning paths can diverge dramatically over time. Another explanation

may be that blacks and non-blacks learn at diﬀerent rates because blacks attend lower quality

schools than whites.

      Currie and Thomas (2000) show that test score gains of participants in the Head Start program

tend to fade completely for blacks but not for whites. Their paper suggests that one reason may

be that blacks attend worse schools than whites, and therefore blacks are not able to maintain

initial test score gains. Both early advantages and disadvantages as well as school quality are

likely to be important factors in the human capital accumulation process. Therefore, diﬀerential

initial conditions and diﬀerential school quality may also be important determinants of the adult

black-white skill gap.

      In light of the greater growth in test scores of Hispanics that are parallel to those of whites,

these explanations are not completely compelling. Hispanics start from similar initial disadvantages

in family environments and face school and neighborhood environments similar to those faced by

blacks.23 They also have early levels of test scores similar to those found in the black population.

      What are the consequences of correcting for diﬀerent levels of schooling at the test date? To

answer this question, we reanalyze Neal and Johnson’s 1996 study using AFQT scores corrected for

the race- or ethnicity-specific eﬀect of schooling while equalizing the years of schooling attained at

the date of the test across all racial/ethnic groups. The results of this adjustment are given in table

3. This adjustment is equivalent to replacing each individual’s AFQT score by the score we would

measure if he or she would have stopped his or her formal education after eighth grade. (However,

the score is itself already aﬀected by attendance in kindergarten, eight further years of schooling,

and any school quality diﬀerentials in those years.) In other words, we use “eighth grade” AFQT

scores for everyone. Since the eﬀect of schooling on test scores is higher for whites than for blacks,

and whites have more schooling than blacks at the date of the test, this adjustment reduces the

test scores of whites much more. Although the black-white male wage gap is still cut in half when

we use this new measure of skill, the eﬀect of AFQT on reducing the wage gap is weaker than in

the original Neal and Johnson (1996) study. The adjustment has little eﬀect on the Hispanic-white

wage gap but a wage gap for black women emerges when using the schooling adusted measure.

   This finding does not necessarily invalidate the Neal-Johnson study. It shows that schooling

can partially reduce the ability gap. It raises the larger question of what a “pre-market” factor

is. Neal and Johnson do not condition on schooling in explaining black-white wage gaps, arguing

that schooling is aﬀected by expectations of adverse market opportunities facing minorities and

conditioning on such a contaminated variable would spuriously reduce the estimated wage gap. We

present direct evidence on this claim below.

   Their line of argument is not entirely coherent. If expectations of discrimination aﬀect schooling,

the very logic of their “pre-market” argument suggests that they should control for the impact of

schooling on test scores when using test scores to properly account for premarket factors. As we

have seen, when this is done, the wage gap (conditional on ability adjusted by schooling) widens

substantially for blacks. There is still little evidence of discrimination for Hispanic females, but the

                                                  16
evidence for Hispanic males comes close to demonstrating discrimination.

       Implicitly, Neal and Johnson assume that schooling at the date of the test is not aﬀected by

expectations of discrimination in the market while later schooling is. This distinction is arbitrary.

A deeper investigation of the expectation formation process and feedback is required. One practical

conclusion with important implications for the interpretation of the evidence is that the magnitude

of the wage gap one can eliminate by performing a Neal-Johnson analysis may depend on the age

at which the test is measured. The earlier the test is measured, the smaller the test score gap, and

the larger the fraction of the wage gap that is unexplained by the residual. Figures 13A-D show

how adjusting measured ability for schooling at the test at diﬀerent levels aﬀects the adjusted wage

gap for black males. For example, the log wage gap corresponding to grade of AFQT correction

equal to 11 is the log wage gap we obtain when use “eleventh grade” test scores. The later the

grade to which we adjust the test score, the lower the estimated gap because the greater the gap in

measured ability.

       Finally we show that adjusting for expectations-contaminated completed schooling does not

operate in the fashion conjectured by Neal and Johnson. Table 4 shows that when we adjust wage

diﬀerences for completed schooling as well as schooling-adjusted AFQT, wage gaps widen. This runs

contrary to the simple intuition that schooling embodies expectations of market discrimination, so

that conditioning on it will eliminate wage gaps.24

       Ours is a worst-case analysis for the Neal-Johnson study. If we assign all racial and ethnic

schooling diﬀerences to expectations of discrimination in the labor market, their results for blacks are

  24
    The simple intuition, however, can easily be shown to be wrong so the evidence in these tables is not decisive on
the presence of discrimination in the labor market. The basic idea is that if both schooling and the test score are
correlated with an unmeasured discrimination component in the error term, the bias for the race dummy may be
either positive or negative depending on the strength of the correlation among the contaminated variables and their
correlation with the error term.


                                                         17
less sharp. Yet the evidence presented in Section 2 about the early emergence of ability diﬀerentials

is reinforced by the early emergence of diﬀerential grade repetition gaps by minorities (documented

by Cameron and Heckman, 2001). Most of the schooling gap at the date of the test emerges in the

early years, which child expectations are unlikely to be operative. Of course, one can always argue

that these early schooling and ability gaps are due to parental expectations of poor labor markets

for minority children. We examine data on parental expectations next.




4     The Role of Expectations

The argument that minorities perform worse on tests because they expect to be less well rewarded

in the labor market than whites for the same test score or schooling level is implausible because

expectations of labor market rewards are unlikely to aﬀect the behavior of children as early as

ages 3 or 4 when test score gaps are substantial. The argument that minorities invest less in skills

because both minority children and minority parents have low expectations about their performance

in school and in the labor market has mixed empirical backing.

    Data on expectations are hard to find, and when they are available they are diﬃcult to interpret.

For example, in the NLSY97, black 17- and 18-year old report that the probability of dying next

year is 22% while for whites it is 16%. Both numbers are absurdly high. Minorities usually report

higher expectations than whites of committing a crime, being incarcerated and being dead next

year, and these adverse expectations may reduce their investment in human capital. Expectations

reported by parents and children for the child adolescent years for a variety of outcomes are given

in Table 5. Some estimates are plausible, while many others are not.

    Schooling expectations measured in the late teenage years are very similar for minorities and


                                                 18
whites. They are slightly lower for Hispanics. Table 6A reports the mean expected probability

of being enrolled in school next year, for black, white and Hispanic 17- to 18-year old males.

Among those individuals enrolled in 1997, on average whites expect to be enrolled next year with

95.7% probability. Blacks expect that they will be enrolled next year with a 93.6% probability.

Hispanics expect to be enrolled with a 91.5% probability. If expectations about the labor market

were adverse for minorities, they should translate into adverse expectations for the child’s education.

Yet these data do not reveal this. Moreover, all groups substantially overestimate actual enrollment

probabilities. The diﬀerence in expectations between blacks and whites is very small, and is less

than half the diﬀerence in actual (realized) enrollment probabilities (81.9% for whites versus 76.4%

for blacks). The gap is wider for Hispanics. Table 6B reports parental schooling expectations for

white, black and Hispanic males for the same individuals used to present the numbers in Table 6A. It

shows that, conditional on being enrolled in 1997 (the year the expectation question is asked), black

parents expect their sons to be enrolled next year with a 90.9% probability, while for whites this

expectation is 95.4%. For Hispanics this number is lower (88.5%). Parents overestimate enrollment

probabilities for their sons, but black parents have lower expectations than white parents. For

females the racial and ethnic diﬀerences in parental expectations are smaller than those for males.25

      For expectations measured at earlier ages the story is dramatically diﬀerent. Figures 14A-B show

that, for the CNLSY, both black and Hispanic children and their parents have more pessimistic

expectations about schooling than white children, and more pessimistic expectations may lead to

lower investments in skills, less eﬀort in schooling and lower ability. These patterns are also found

in the CPSID and ECLS.26 It is curious that for CNLSY teenagers expectations seem to converge

at later ages (see figure 14C).

    If the more pessimistic expectations of minorities are a result of market discrimination, then lower

investments in children that translate into lower levels of ability and skill at later ages are a result

of market discrimination. Ability would not be a premarket factor. However, lower expectations

for minorities may not be a result of discrimination but just a rational response to the fact that

minorities do not do as well in school as whites. This may be due to environmental factors unrelated

to expectations of discrimination in the labor market. Whether this phenomenon itself is a result

of discrimination is an open question. Expectation formation models are very complex and often

lead to multiple equilibria, and therefore they are diﬃcult to test empirically.

    Expectations are likely to play a very important role in the skill investment behavior of both

parents and children. Nevertheless, they are hard to measure, and data on them are often unreliable

or diﬃcult to interpret. Across demographic groups, schooling expectations are in general unrealis-

tically optimistic although the degree of optimism varies by age. This is true at diﬀerent ages, and

whether one measures expectations of parents or of their children. Since minorities perform much

more poorly than whites in terms of their schooling outcomes, relative expectations (expectation

minus actual probability of the event) tend to be much higher for minorities than for whites.




5     The Evidence on Non-Cognitive Skills

Controlling for scholastic ability in accounting for minority-majority wage gaps captures only part

of the endowment diﬀerences between groups but receives most of the emphasis in the literature on

black-white gaps (see Jencks and Phillips, 1998). An emerging body of evidence, summarized in

Bowles, Gintis and Osborne (2001) and Carneiro and Heckman (2003), documents that noncognitive


                                                  20
skills—motivation, self control, time preference, social skills—are important in explaining socioeco-

nomic success and diﬀerentials in socioeconomic success.

       Some of the best evidence for the importance of noncognitive skills in the labor market is from

the GED (General Education Development) program. This program examines high school dropouts

to certify that they are equivalent to high school graduates. In its own terms, the GED program

is successful. Heckman and Rubinstein (2001) show that GED recipients and ordinary high school

graduates who do not go on to college have the same distribution of AFQT scores (the same test

that is graphed in figure 1). They are psychometrically equated. Yet GED recipients earn the wages

of high school dropouts with the same number of years of completed schooling. They are more likely

to quit their jobs, engage in fighting or petty crime, or to be discharged from the military, than

are high school graduates who do not go on to college or other high school dropouts (see Heckman

and Rubinstein, 2001). Intelligence alone is not suﬃcient for socioeconomic success. Minority-white

gaps in noncognitive skills open up early and widen over the lifecycle.

       The CNLSY has lifecycle measures of noncognitive skills. Mothers are asked age specific ques-

tions about the anti-social behavior of their children such as aggressiveness or violent behavior,

cheating or lying, disobedience, peer conflicts and social withdrawal. The answers to these ques-

tions are grouped in diﬀerent indices.27 Figures 15A-B shows that there are important racial and

ethnic gaps in anti-social behavior index that emerge in early childhood. By ages 5 and 6, the

average black is roughly 10 percentile points above the average white in the distribution of this

  27
    The children’s mothers were asked 28 age-specific questions about frequency, range and type of specific behavior
problems that children age four and over may have exhibited in the previous three months. Factor analysis was used
to determine six clusters of questions. The responses for each cluster were then dichotomized and summed. The
Antisocial Behavior index we use in this paper consists of measures of cheating and telling lies, bullying and cruelty
to others, not feeling sorry for misbehaving, breaking things deliberately (if age is less than 12), disobedience at
school (if age is grater than 5), and trouble getting along with teachers (if age is greater than 5).




                                                         21
score (the higher the score, the worse the behavior).28 The results shown in Figures 16A-B— where

we adjust the gaps by permanent family income, mother’s education and age-corrected AFQT and

home score—also show large reductions.29

       In Section 2 we documented that minority and white children face sharp diﬀerences in family

and home environments while growing up. The evidence presented in this section shows that these

early environmental diﬀerences can account (in a correlational sense) for most of the minority-white

gap in noncognitive skills, as measured in CNLSY.

       Carneiro and Heckman (2003) document that noncognitive skills are more malleable than cogni-

tive skills. In their paper they report that noncognitive skill gaps can be eliminated by equalization

of family and home environments, while cognitive skill gaps cannot, even though they can be sharply

reduced. The largest eﬀects of interventions in childhood and adolescence are on noncognitive skills.

Improvements in these skills produce better labor market outcomes, less engagement in criminal

activities and other risky behavior. This is an avenue for policy that warrants much greater atten-

tion.




6        Summary and Conclusion

This paper discusses the sources of wage gaps between minorities and whites. For all minorities but

black males, adjusting for the ability that minorities bring to the market eliminates wage gaps. The

major source of economic disparity by race and ethnicity in U.S. labor markets is in endowments,

not in payments to endowments.

  28
     In http://lily.src.uchicago.edu, we show that these diﬀerences are statistically strong. Once we control for family
and home environments, gaps in most behavioral indices disappear.
  29
     See Appendix Tables 2A-2B for the eﬀect of adjusting for other environmental characteristics on the anti-social
behavior score.


                                                          22
   This evidence suggests that strengthened civil rights and aﬃrmative action policies targeted at

the labor market are unlikely to have much eﬀect on racial and ethnic wage gaps, except possibly for

those specifically targeted toward black males. Policies that foster endowments have much greater

promise. On the other hand, this paper does not provide any empirical evidence on whether or not

the existing edifice of civil rights and aﬃrmative action legislation should be abolished. All of our

evidence on wages is for an environment where aﬃrmative action laws and regulations are in place.

   Minority deficits in cognitive and noncognitive skills emerge early and widen. Unequal school-

ing, neighborhoods and peers may account for this diﬀerential growth in skills, but the main story

in the data is not about growth rates but rather about the size of early deficits. Hispanic children

start with cognitive and noncognitive deficits similar to those of black children. They also grow up

in similar disadvantaged environments, and are likely to attend schools of similar quality. Hispanics

have substantially less schooling than blacks. Nevertheless, the ability growth by years of schooling

is much higher for Hispanics than blacks. By the time they reach adulthood, Hispanics have signif-

icantly higher test scores than blacks. Conditional on test scores, there is no Hispanic-white wage

gap. Our analysis of the Hispanic data illuminates the traditional study of black-white diﬀerences

and casts doubt on many conventional explanations of these diﬀerences since they do not apply to

Hispanics who also suﬀer from many of the same disadvantages. The failure of the Hispanic-white

gap to widen with schooling or age casts doubt on poor schools and bad neighborhoods as the

reasons for the slow growth rate in black test scores, since Hispanics experience the same kinds of

poor schools and bad neighborhoods experienced by blacks. Deficits in noncognitive skills can be

explained (in a statistical sense) by adverse early environments; deficits in cognitive skills are less

easily eliminated by the same factors.

   Neal and Johnson (1996) were the first to document that endowments acquired before people

                                                  23
enter the market explain most of the minority-majority wage gap. They use an ability test taken

in the teenage years as a measure of endowment unaﬀected by discrimination. In this paper,

we note that the distinction between “premarket” factors unaﬀected by expectations of market

discrimination and “market” factors so aﬀected is an arbitrary one. Occupational choice is likely

aﬀected by discrimination. The proper treatment of schooling is less clear-cut. Neal and Johnson

purposely omit schooling in adjusting for racial and ethnic wage gaps, arguing that schooling choices

are potentially contaminated by expectations of labor market discrimination. Yet they do not

adjust their measure of ability by the schooling attained at the date of the test, which would be the

appropriate correction if their argument were correct. The literature establishes that their measure

of ability is aﬀected by this measure of schooling.

   Adjusting wage gaps by completed schooling and the adjusted test widens wage gaps for all

groups, but has especially strong eﬀects for blacks. At issue is how much of the diﬀerence in

schooling at the date of the test is due to expectations of labor market discrimination and how much

is due to adverse early environments. While this paper does not settle this question definitively, test

score gaps emerge early and are more plausibly linked to adverse early environments. The lion’s

share of the ability gaps at the date of the test emerge very early, before children can have clear

expectations about their labor market prospects.

   The emergence of test score gaps in young children casts serious doubt on the importance of

“stereotype threats” in accounting for poorer black test scores. It is implausible that young minority

test takers have the social consciousness assumed in the stereotype literature.

   Moreover, gaps in test scores of the magnitude found in recent studies were found in the earliest

tests before the results of testing were disseminated. Eﬀective social policy designed to eliminate

racial and ethnic inequality for most minorities should focus on eliminating skill gaps, not on

                                                  24
discrimination in the workplace of the early Twenty-First Century. Interventions targeted at adults

are much less eﬀective and do not compensate for early deficits. Early interventions aimed at young

children hold much greater promise than strengthened legal activism in the workplace.30

Age-corrected AFQT is the standardized residual from the regression of the AFQT score on age at the time of the test dummy variables. AFQT is a subset of 4 out of 10 ASVAB tests used
by the military for enlistment screening and job assignment. It is the summed score from the word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, mathematics knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning
ASVAB tests. All wages are in 1993 dollars. The coefficients on the AFQT variables represent the effect of a one standard deviation increase in the score on the log hourly wage. Since the
wage is measured in log points, the gaps for blacks and hispanics correspond approximately to percentage point differences relative to the white mean; that is, the black-white gap of -.25 in
1990 corresponds to 25% lower wages for blacks in that year.

  Adjusted by permanent family income, mother’s education and age−corrected AFQT, and home score.
  Adjusted indicates that we equalized the family background characteristics across all race groups by setting them at
  the mean to purge the effect of family environment disparities. Permanent income is constructed by taking the average
  of annual family income discounted to child’s age 0 using a 10% discount rate. Age−corrected AFQT is the standardized
  residual from the regression of the AFQT score on age at the time of the test dummy variables. Home score is an
  index of quality of the child’s home environment.

          Age−corrected AFQT is the standardized residual from the regression of the AFQT score on age at the
          time of the test dummy variables. AFQT is a subset of 4 out of 10 ASVAB tests used by the military
          for enlistment screening and job assignment. It is the summed score from the word knowledge, paragraph
          comprehension, mathematics knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning ASVAB tests.

schooling completed during lifetime. AFQT is a subset of 4 out of 10 ASVAB tests used by the military for enlistment screening and job assignment. It is the
summed score from the word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, mathematics knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning ASVAB tests. All wages are in 1993
dollars.

               Note: We have omitted the results for the "16 or More" category because the low number of minorities in that cell make the
               correction of the test scores to that schooling level much less reliable than the correction to the other schooling levels. The
               "unadjusted" line refers to the black-white log wage gap we observe if we do not control for AFQT scores (column I in table 1).
               Therefore it is a horizontal line since it does not depend on the grade to which we are correcting the test score. The "adjusted"
               line refers to the black-white log wage gap we observe after we adjust for the AFQT scores corrected to different grades.

Note: We have omitted the results for the "16 or More" category because the low number of minorities in that cell make the correction
of the test scores to that schooling level much less reliable than the correction to the other schooling levels. The "unadjusted" line
refers to the Hispanic-white log wage gap we observe if we do not control for AFQT scores (column I in table 1). Therefore it is a
horizontal line since it does not depend on the grade to which we are correcting the test score. The "adjusted" line refers to the
Hispanic-white log wage gap we observe after we adjust for the AFQT scores corrected to different grades.

Schooling-corrected AFQT is the standardized residual from the regression of the AFQT score on age at the time of the test dummy variables and final level of schooling completed during lifetime. AFQT is a
subset of 4 out of 10 ASVAB tests used by the military for enlistment screening and job assignment. It is the summed score from the word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, mathematics knowledge, and
arithmetic reasoning ASVAB tests. All wages are in 1993 dollars. HGC is the highest observed level of schooling completed during the individual's lifetime.

  Adjusted by permanent family income, mother’s education and age−corrected AFQT, and home score.
  Adjusted indicates that we equalized the family background characteristics across all race groups by setting them at
  the mean to purge the effect of family environment disparities. Permanent income is constructed by taking the average
  of annual family income discounted to child’s age 0 using a 10% discount rate. Age−corrected AFQT is the standardized
  residual from the regression of the raw AFQT score on age at the time of the test dummy variables. Home score is an
  index of quality of the child’s home environment.

  Adjusted by permanent family income, mother’s education and age−corrected AFQT, and home score.
  Adjusted indicates that we equalized the family background characteristics across all race groups by setting them at
  the mean to purge the effect of family environment disparities. Permanent income is constructed by taking the average
  of annual family income discounted to child’s age 0 using a 10% discount rate. Age−corrected AFQT is the standardized
  residual from the regression of the raw AFQT score on age at the time of the test dummy variables. Home score is an
  index of quality of the child’s home environment.
