  LABOR MARKET DISTORTIONS AND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES


                                   ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to provide a typology of different
labor market configurations and investigate how two major
structural adjustment policies, namely a trade liberalization
reform and the relaxation of capital controls, affect the level of

aggregate employment and the rate of unemployment. We consider a
number of models starting from the traditional Australian approach.

We then analyze a multiple sectors intertemporal setting and a
model with uncertainty and search. We identify situations under
which structural adjustment results in unemployment.

I. Introduction

     Most "official" plans to deal with the debt crisis contemplate

significant economic reforms in the developing countries. In particular, the

Baker plan, the Brady plan, and the programs sponsored by the International

Monetary Fund and the World Bank include as one of their key components

significant reforms aimed at opening up these economies to the rest of the

world. In fact, it is not an exaggeration to say that at this time a reform

of their trade regime is one of the most important policy prescriptions being

considered by the authorities of the developing nations.1

     A number of observers have noted that in spite of clear theoretical

arguments and of the insistence with which trade liberalization is pushed by

the multilateral agencies, many countries vehemently resist it. How can we

explain this? If trade reform is as desirable as economists have argued, why

do we see so few sustained efforts at opening up the developing countries?

There is no doubt that trade liberalization entails adjustment costs, which

often take the form of increased aggregate unemployment. The question though

is: Why do these costs induce so much resistence? particularly in light of

the expectation of future social benefits. Why does the road to protection-

ism, which also entails an adjustment process, appear so much smoother?

     Surprisingly, most of the policy literature on structural reform and

liberalization of the external sector has tended to sidestep the question of

unemployment.2 Moreover, in those studies that take the simple Heckscher-


        recent study by Thomas (1989) shows that the great majority of World
Bank Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) have had a trade liberalization
component as a condition for releasing funds.

     2There are, however, a few exceptions. Krueger (1983), for instance,
discusses the empirical relation between trade orientation and employment in
the long run. The World Bank study directed by Michaely, Choksi and
Papageorgiou (1986) deals with the employment effects of trade reforms,
                                     2




Ohlin model as a benchmark the issue is completely nonexisting. In fact,

according to the simplest textbook approach, in a small developing economy

with capital intensive imports, fully mobile factors of production and

flexible prices, the reduction of import tariffs will have no effect on

total employment even in the short run. In this setup the only labor market

effects of trade liberalization will be a reallocation of labor out of the

importables sector and an increase in the real wage rate.3 In reality,

however, there exist a number of reasons why these textbook condition will

not hold, and why tariff reforms can result in a decline of employment in

the short run. In fact, existing historical evidence suggests that in many

cases trade liberalization reforms have been associated with short-run

increases in unemployment (Edwards 1990).

     The Ricardo-Viner model with real wage rigidity provides the simplest

framework for illustrating the possible short run employment consequences of

a tariff reform. In this model capital is, in the short-run, fixed to its

sector of origin; only slowly through time (and possibly via investment) can

capital be reallocated. Contrary to the more traditional textbook case with

full flexibility of prices and resource movements, in this more realistic

setting a tariff reduction can result in a decrease of the eauilibrium real

wsge rate required to maintain full employment. However, if for some reason

the economy's labor market is distorted -- due to a government imposed

minimum wage, or to the existence of indexation clauses -   - there   will be

downward inflexibility of real wages, and the required reduction in the wage


while Edwards (1990) discusses the unemployment ramifications of a cross
section of liberalization attempts.

     3This result, of course, is what is predicted by the Stolper-Samuelson
theorem under the (plsusible) assumption that imports are relatively capital
intensive.
rate will not take place. As a result of this rigidity, some fraction of

the labor force will become unemployed.

     This paper is motivated by the crucial role that labor markets behavior

may play in determining the success of liberalization policies and provides

a theoretical survey on the ways labor markets can react to structural

adjustment reforms. More specifically, we provide a typology of different

labor market configurations and investigate how two main liberalization

policies - -   a   reduction of import tariffs and the relaxation of capital

controls -   - will   affect the level of aggregate employment and the rate of

unemployment. Our analysis is based on the exploration of the employment

implications of several models proposed in the literature.4 We start with a

brief discussion of the standard Australian or dependent economy model with

flexible wages and prices, pointing out its deficiencies (Section II). -This

model provides a benchmark case that is then used to discuss different

extensions. In Section III we incorporate labor market distortions in the

form of wage rigidities to the discussion. Here we make a distinction

between economy-wide and sector-specific wage rigidity. The analysis in

this section assumes that capital is sector-specific. In that regard, this

discussion should be interpreted as referring to short-run situations.

Section IV incorporates en intertemporal dimension and deals with both the

employment effects of relaxing capital controls and the employment implica-

tions of anticipated trade liberalization reforms. In Section V we relax

the standard trade theory assumption of a fixed labor supply, and consider a

model with upward-sloping labor supply and queuing. In this section we pay



     4We survey and summarize a number of existing models including some we
have used in our previous work such as Edwards (1988, 1990) and Cox-Edwards
(1986).

closer attention to the initial labor market conditions of a typical

protected economy. We assume that along with trade protection the economy

 is characterized by labor unions or some other institutionalized form of

labor protection.5 Thus, ironically, the factor of production that is sup-

posed to gain from freer trade is actually gaining from trade restrictions.

Needless to say, it is not the entire labor force that benefits from

protectionism but only the more organized sectors. It is perhaps within

this setting that the resistance to trade liberalization can be better

understood. Finally, Section VI contains the concluding remarks.


XI. Tariff Liberalization and      Labor   Market Adlustiient in the Standard
     Australian Model

     In this section we discuss the way in which a tariff liberalization

reform affects the labor market in the standard Australian model with

flexible prices and no market distortions.6 In the following sections we

will use these results as a benchmark to be compared with those obtained

from alternative specifications of the labor market.

     Consider the case of a small country that produces and consumes three

goods --   importables   (M), exportables (X), and nontradables (N).7


     5Labor unions have a stronger negotiating power and sometimes even
monopsony power in a closed economy.

     6This model has a long tradition in international trade theory. See
the discussion of it in Mussa (1974) and Dornbusch (1974, 1980). Edwards
(1988) provides a diagrammatical discussion of this standard model.

     7The distinction between two types of tradable goods (X and M) and
a nontradable good (N) is analytically convenient, and is at the very core
of modern open economy macroeconomics. In practice, however, it is not easy
to determine which goods are actually tradables and which are nontradables.
Indeed, statistics for the vast majority of countries do not make such a
distinction. Although this practical difficulty does not invalidate the
usefulness of the dependent economy model, it does imply that analysts and
policymakers should be particularly careful (and creative) when using this
model. At the simplest level it can be argued that (at least) a large
                                       5




Households consume all three goods and maximize a utility function subject

to a constraint which states that the value of expenditure does not exceed

income. There are a large number of identical producers and perfect

competition prevails in the goods markets. Firms are assumed to maximize

profits subject to existing technology and to the available factors of pro.

duction: labor, capital and natural resources.8 In addition to consumers

and producers, there is a government that imposes a tariff on imports.

Following traditional trade theory it is assumed that the revenue from the

tariff is handed back to consumers in a lump-sum fashion.9 There are no

other taxes and no government spending on goods or services. Finally, we

use the price of exportables as the numeraire.

       Denoting the revenue function by R, the expenditure function by E,

the price of nontradables relative to exportables by q, and that of

importables relative to exportables by p. the equilibrium in this simple

economy can be represented by the following set of equations (where a
                                            10
subindex refers to a partial derivative):


                 R(1p,q;L,KG) +   (E-R)     —   E(l,p,q,U),                 (1)



percentage of the services sector of an economy is constituted by nontrad-
ables. It is important to note, however, that the importance of this non-
tradable sector will vary across countries. For instance, some authors have
argued that, strictly speaking, in the case of Uruguay there are no nontrad-
ables: at least for Argentinian consumers all Uruguayan goods are tradable.

     8Alternatively, we can assume that there are two factors only - -
capital and labor - - and that capital is sector specific in the short-run.
In fact this formulation is much simpler than the one used in this section.
On three-factor models of international trade see Learner (1987).

       9For a model where the government uses tariff proceeds to finance its
own   consumption, see Edwards (l989a).

     10For a detailed exposition of traditional trade theory using duality
see Dixit and Norman (1980).

    where L, K, and C are labor, capital and natural resources, respective-

    ly. r is the specific import tariff, (E-R) are imports, and U is

    total utility. Equation (1) is the budget constraint and establishes that

    total income - -   stemming from factors' income and government transfers - -
    has to equal expenditure. Equation (2) is the nontradables equilibrium

    condition, while equation (3) establishes the relation between the domestic

    price of importables and the import tariff r.

         As in most traditional trade models we assume that factors supplies --

    and in particular the supply of labor -- are inelastic.11 The initial labor

    market equilibrium is illustrated in Figure 1, where the horizontal axis

    measures total labor available in the economy and the vertical axis depicts

    the wage rate in terms of exportables. Schedule L, denotes the demand for

    labor by the tradable gooda sector and is equal to the horizontal sum of the

    demand for labor by the exportables sector, (schedule Lx) and the demand

    for labor by the importables sector. Demand for labor by the nontradable

    goods sector is shown by schedule LN. The initial equilibrium is charac-

    terized by full employment and a wage rate equal to w0. At this position

    OTLA labor is used in the production of exportables, LALS labor is

    employed in the production of importables, and ONLB labor is used in the

-
    production   of nontradables. In what follows we will assume that in the

    short-run only labor cart aove across sectors, although in the long-run, all

    three factors are assumed to be mobile. However, since our main interest is



         11We relax this assumption in Section V where we analyze queuing
    models. See also Edwards (1990).

on the short run consequences of structural reform, most of our discussion

will focus on the Ricardo-Viner case with factor specificity.

      Consider now a tariff liberalization reform that reduces the import

tariff and, thus, causes a reduction in the domestic price of importables. In

this simple general equilibrium framework this reform will affect a number of

variables including relative prices. With regard to employment, the tariff

reduction will provoke changes in the allocation of labor across sectors.

     In order to track down the full effect of the reform on the labor market

it is first necessary to determine the effect of the reduction in tariffs on

the price of nontradable goods. Only then we will be able to know the

direction of the shift of schedule LN in Figure 1. From the manipulation of

equations (l)-(3) it is easy to show that the direction in which the price of

nontradables will change is going to depend on the assumptions made regarding

substitutability in demand and on the magnitude of the income effect.

Assuming that the three goods are gross substitutes in consumption and that

the income effect does not exceed the substitution effect, it can be shown

that as a result of the tariff reform the price of nontradables will fl

relative   to that of exportables: that is dq/dr >

     The labor market adjustment process under these assumptions is

illustrated in Figure 2. The reduction in the tariffs will result in a

lower domestic price of importables, generating a downward shift of the

curve (with the L curve constant). The new 14 curve will intersect the

L curve at R. However, since as pointed out above the reduction in the

world price of importables will also result in a decline in the price of

reforms and terms of trade disturbances on the equilibrium real exchange

nontradables (relative to exports), this is not the final equilibrium. As a

consequence of the decline of q, L will shift downward (by less than the

shift in L.r) and the final short-run equilibrium will be achieved at S

with a lower wage rate w1. In this new equilibrium, production of export-

ables has increased --   with   labor used by this sector increasing by LALQ.

The production of nontradables may either increase or decrease, and

production of importables will fall. In the case depicted in Figure 2,

labor has moved out of the importables sector and into the exportables and

nontradables sectors.

    What has happened to factor rewards in the short run? Wages have

declined in terms of exportables (from w0 to w1 in Figure 2). Wages

have also declined in terms of nontradables because the vertical distance

between the      and L, curves is smaller than the reduction in w from

w0 to w1. Wages, however, have increased relative to importables because

the domestic price of these goods has fallen by more than the decline in

wages. In the exportables sector, the real return to the sector specific

factors has increased. However, the real return to these fixed factors in

the importables and nontradables sectors could either increase or decrease.13

     In summary, in the standard Ricardo-Viner model with wage flexibility,

the short-run effects on production, prices, and factor rewards of a tariff

liberalization reform will be as follows: (1) production of exporcables

will increase; (2) production of importables will decrease; (3) produc-

tion of nontradables may increase or decrease; (4) prices of nontradables

will decrease; (5) wages will increase in terms of importables and



     13Formally, the real return on the sector specific factors allocated to
the importables sector will decrease in terms of importables and could either
increase or decrease in terms of the other two goods. See Edwards (1988).
                                     9




decrease in terms of exportables and nontradables; (6) the real return to

the sector specific factors allocated to the exportables sector will

increase relative to all goods; (7) the real return to factors specific to

the importables sector will decrease relative to importables but could

increase or decrease relative to the other goods; and (8) the real return

to factors specific to the nontradables sector will increase relative to

nontradable goods but could either increase or decrease relative to the

other two goods.

     Until now we have assumed that the main difference between the short-

and long-run effects of a trade liberalization is that in the short-run

capital and natural resources are locked into its sector of origin. As time

passes, however, capital will (slowly) move between sectors. To simplify

the exposition, let us assume that the movement of capital does not require

the use of resources. However, the analysis could be modified by introduc-

ing a "moving industry", which uses labor and a specific factor, as in Mussa

(1978). The transition period will be characterized by factors moving

between sectors, until the new long-run equilibrium (that is, post trade

liberalization) capital-labor ratios and production levels are attained.

     The analysis of the long run equilibrium when the three factors are

mobile can be rather complicated. The reason, of course, is that with three

factors the concept of factor intensities becomes somewhat ambiguous.

However, as Learner (1987) has shown, if we assume that a particular sector

is more intensive in a factor relative to both of the other factors, then

the Stolper-Samuelson theorem will still hold.14 In terms of our

discussion, if we assume that the importables sector is the least labor


         formal and detailed discussion of the long run case is given in
Edwards (1990).
                                     10



intensive sector, relative to both capital and natural resources, then we

can conclude that in the long-run real wages will increase, as occurred in

the two-factors case analyzed in Edwards (1988).

     Although the dependent economy framework presented here provides a

useful starting point for analyzing the way in which a trade reform affects

the labor market, it has a number of shortcomings. Among these, perhaps the

most important one is the assumption of factor price flexibility. In fact,

in many developing nations there exist some kind of (real) wage rigidity. A

second shortcoming of this model is that it ignores all intertemporal

considerations. In that regard, within this framework it is not possible to

analyze issues related to restrictions to capital movements, or to the way

in which the level of employment reacts to anticipated changes in tariffs.

A third limitation of this standard formulation is that it assumes, within

the tradition of trade theory, that the labor supply is completely inelas-

tic. Finally, the assumption of no-search activities on behalf of workers

is also quite stringent and unrealistic. In the following sections we

present several models that attempt to overcome (some of) these limitations.

11.1 Sector Soecific Human Caoital

     So far we have referred to labor as a homogeneous factor. However, for

the type of question we are studying, allowing for differences in general

human capital would not change the results qualitatively. In fact, we could

easily incorporate differences in general human capital by introducing the

distinction between units of labor and number of workers. That is, some

workers would have embodied more units of labor than others. However, if we

assume the existence of sector-specific or industry-specific human capital

(Ci (1962)) our conclusions would be affected because in that case labor

mobility would be costly.
                                        11




     One   of   the consequences of a trade liberalization reform is that it

wipes Out entire industries, destroying the value of industry-specific human

capital. This loss of productive factors, in different degrees, has to be

considered as part of the adjustment costs of trade liberalization. In

practice, this cost translates into a type of unemployment that reflects

differences between the market value of a given worker's human capital and

the same worker's perception of what that value is, based on his or her

recent experience and expectations. This type of phenomenon will affect

more seriously the more experienced groups of the labor force.

     Moreover, the change in relative prices brought about by a trade

liberalization not only changes the market value of sector-specific human

capital, but also affects the geographical allocation of labor demand.

Mobility costs associated to labor reallocation across areas can thus become

an additional barrier to full employment immediately after a trade reform

takes place. In fact, the labor economics literature has given attention to

this type of adjustment barrier in an effort to explain wage differentials

and unemployment across geographical areas or sectors of economic activity

(see, for example, Topel (1986)). These ideas, although not yet applied to

the question of trade reform, can be very useful in an empirical analysis of

trade liberalization experiences.


III. Wage Rialdities and Labor Market Adlustaent

     The discussion in Section II has followed the traditional Australian

model of international trade, which assumes that all factor prices, includ-

ing wages, are perfectly flexible. However, as said before, this is a

simplifying assumption that does not correspond to reality in many develop-

ing countries where minimum wage laws or other types of rigidities affect
                                     12




the whole economy or some parts of it.15 In the past ten years or so, a

number of international trade models that assume some type of factor price

rigidity have been developed (see Brecher 1974; Bruce and Purvis 1984).

These models have been useful and have added considerable realism to the

analysis, but moat of them have concentrated on the case in which the econ-

omy produces only two goods, and have not addressed specifically the way in

which trade liberalization reforms will affect aggregate employment. This

section extends these results to the three-goods model used in the previous

section and discusses the effects of tariff liberalization under both

economy-wide and sector-specific wage rigidities stemming from exogenously

imposed minimum wages. Again, the analysis concentrates mainly on the

short-run case in which capital and natural resources are locked into their

sector of origin. Although the discussion emphasizes the case of minimum

wages, the analysis is also useful for understanding the effects on employ-

ment of other mechanisms widely applied in developing countries, such as

wage indexation arrangements, and disequilibrium real wages set by powerful

labor unions.


111.1 Economy-Wide Wase Rizidities

     Consider first the case of an economy-wide minimum wage. In order to

facilitate the diagrammatical exposition, this minimum wage is assumed to be

expressed in terms of our numeraire (exportables))6 The incorporation of

an economy-wide minimum wage into the analysis requires that we modify the

model given by equations (1)-(3) above. Specifically, we now need to define


     15For a review of practices used in different countries to determine
minimum wages, see Starr (1981).

     16The results presented below are fairly sensitive to this assumption.
Edwards (1990) discusses in detail how using different price indexes to set
the minimum wage will affect the results from the model.
                                        13



a "restricted" revenue function that considers the existence of wage rigidi-

ties and initial unemployment such as:17


                 (W,p,q;V) — max ((S+qS+pS)WL)                              (4)
                               S,L

where W is the minimum wage; L is employment; S1, i — X,M,N,           refers

to output of exportables, importables, and nontradables, respectively; and

V refers to the vector of non-labor (flexible-price) factors of production.

This restricted revenue function can be conveniently written in the

following way:

                 R —   R(1,p,q,L(1,p,q,W))                                   (5)


where L( ) is an emDlovment function (see Neary (1985)).

     In this case the nontradable market equilibrium condition also has to

incorporate in an explicit way the existence of wage rigidity and of initial

unemployment. This is done by computing the supply of nontradables as the

derivative of the restricted revenue function relative to the price of

nontradables q:

                 R —E                                                        (6)
                  q      q

     The nature of the initial labor market equilibrium is now captured by

sectors (LT) is equal to the horizontal sum of the demand for labor by the

exportables sector (Lx)        and the demand for labor by the importables sector

sector is now determined by the minimum       wage and is equal to ONL.

     Figure   4 shows that when labor is the only mobile factor, and there is

a minimum wage in real terms (expressed in terms of the exportables) a

tariff reduction will result in an increase in the extent of unemployment

which is then given by U',. As shown in the previous section, the reason

for this is the decline in the (real) wage that a trade liberalization will

require in order to maintain the pre-reform level of employment. If, due to

institutional factors, this reduction cannot take place, the adjustment will

occur via quantities and total employment will be reduced. The extent of

the change in employment will in turn depend on: (1) the magnitude of the

tariff reduction;       (2) the amount by which the price of nontradables goes

down; and (3) the employment elasticities in the different sectors.

     Formally, the effect of a tariff change on total employment is given by

the expression:

                    —
                           + Lq()                                             (7)


where L and Lq are the derivatives of the employment function with

respect to the domestic price of importables and the relative price of non-

tradables respectively, and where (dq/d) is the "real exchange rate

effect" of the tariff change. Within our Ricardo-Viner framework with

initial unemployment both L and Lq are positive, indicating that

increases in domestic prices will result in higher employment.19 On the

other hand, as discussed in Section II, under the most plausible set of


     18Notice, however, that if the minimum wage is fixed in terms of the
importable good, the tariff reform will not generate any unemployment. This
is because in order for the wage rate to remain constant in terms of M, it
will have to decline in terms of the exportable (see Edwards (1990)).

     L9As seen below, in the case of full factor mobility it is rather
difficult to sign these derivatives.
                                      15




assumptions (dq/dr) will be positive, indicating that a tariff increase

(liberalization) will result in a real exchange rate appreciation (deprecia-

tion). Consequently, equation (7) as a whole has a positive sign, implying

that with rigid (real) wages and factor specificity a trade liberalization

reform will result in unemployment.

     What will happen in the long-run? In this case all factors will move

across sectors and the interpretation of terms L and Lq in equation (7)

is more complicated and will be related to the direction of the Rybczynski

effects. Formally:

                     -R
               L
                     LL
                     -R
               L —
                     RLL


where RLL is the slope of the marginal product of labor schedule and is

negative. RPL and RqL on the other hand, are Rybczynski terms that

capture what will happen to output of M and N (R          and Rq respective-
ly) if there is an increase in the labor force. Their sign is undetermined

a priori and depend on relative factor intensities, which are difficult to

determine in our 3x3 model. However, as Learner (1987) has shown, if

nontradables is the most labor intensive sector -   - both   with respect to

capital and with respect to natural resources -   - RqL   will be positive.

This means that RpL can be either positive or negative. A necessary (al-

though not sufficient) condition for it to be positive is that importables

is the second most labor intensive sector. If we assume that R            is also
                                                                     pL
positive, then we will obtain the result in which a tariff liberalization

reduces employment. If, however, importables is the least labor intensive

sector (as measured with respect to both of the other factors) RL will be
                                         16




negative and we can obtain the more standard result where, starting from an

initial condition of unemployment, a trade liberalization reform will

increase total employment in the economy.

111.2 Sector Soecific Waae Rate Riaiditv

     In most countries wage rigidity is not generalized, but rather affects

a subgroup of sectors in the economy. In this subsection we will briefly

use our diagrammatic apparatus to analyze two cases where the above-equilib-

rium wage affects only one sector in the economy.20

Case 1:   Sector-Specific Ware Riziditv With No Unemoloyment

     This configuration of the labor market has recently been used by Burda

and Sachs (1987) to analyze the structure of unemployment in Germany. It is

assumed that one sector, say nontradables, is subject to an above-equilib-

rium wage rate, and that the wage rate in the rest of the economy --      the   so-

called uncovered Sector -   - takes   the level required to assure full employ-

ment in the economy as a whole. The initial conditions under these

assumptions are summarized in Figure 5, where           is the minimum wage in

the protected sector (the nontradables sector) and WT is the wage rate in

the uncovered (tradables) sector.        Employment in tradables is equal to the

distance OTA, while employment in nontradables is equal to ONA.

     Under these conditions, and assuming that capital and natural resources

are sector-specific, a trade liberalization reform will result in an

increase in the wage gap between the protected and the uncovered sectors, in

a reduction in employment in nontradables and importables and in an increase

in employment and output in exportables (see Figure 6).



     20The formal analysis of a sector-specific wage rate rigidity is
somewhat complicated. See the discussion in Edwards (1990).

     The main limitation of this approach is, indeed, that it is

characterized by a non-equilibrium wage rate differential (WNWT) that can

only be maintained if there are severe barriers to entry to the protected

sector. Only in this way it can be reconciled having a major distortion in

the labor market, in the form of intersectoral wage differentials, and no

unemployment. An elegant way of solving this problem is by introducing, as

we do below, a Harris-Todaro type of mechanism to generate an equilibrium

wage rate differential.

Case 2:   Sector-Specific Minimum Waees With tinemolovment

     Consider now the case where there is a binding minimum wage in the

inmortables sector only. In order to analyze this case, the diagrams used

previously must be somewhat modified. Figure 7 is similar to Figure 5,

except that in Figure 7, total labor used in the importables sector is

measured from the right-hand side origin °M• The wage rate WM is the

minimum wage in the importables sector (say, manufacturing); I is employ-

ment in this sector. Curve qq is a rectangular hyperbola known as the

Harris-Todaro locus, along which the following equation is satisfied:


               W   W       LM
                         w
                 N X1+1J M'                                                  (9)



where U is the equilibrium level of employment. 21     In the absence of a

minimum wage, equilibrium is attained at point Z. With a minimum wage,

however, the intersection of (L+L) with qq at point S gives the wage

rate in the uncovered (no minimum wage) sectors, employment in each Sector,



            is based on Harris and Todaro (1970) and Harberger (1971). For
the use of this framework in the context of a two-sector economy, see
Corden and Findlay (1975) and Neary (1981). The discussion that follows
draws from Edwards (1988).

and total unemployment. The distance ORLX    is   total employment in the

exportables sector; the distance     l+LN) is employment in nontradables;

the distance (L.4-L.N)LM is the initial equilibrium level of unemployment;

and the distance OMLL, is employment in the covered sector.22

     The short-run (with capital immobile across sectors) effects of a

reduction in the world price of importables are illustrated in Figure 8. As

a result of the decline in the world price of importables, demand for labor

in that sector shifts downward. At the given minimum wage, WM, total

demand for labor in the importables sector will decline. The new demand for

labor in the importables sector (not drawn) will intersect           at A. A
new rectangular hyperbola q'q' passes through this point and labor

demanded by the importables sector is now reduced to

     What will happen to wages and employment in the uncovered sectors, and to

unemployment? Under the assumption that the price of nontradables remains

constant, curve (Lx+L.N) remains at its original location, and point B,

given by the intersection of q'q' and (1.fL),        is   the new equilibrium.

This position is characterized by a lower wage and higher employment in the

uncovered sectors. As discussed above, however, the reduction of tariffs will

affect the price of nontradables and (Lx+L) will not remain constant.

Under the assumptions discussed before, the lower tariffs will generate a

reduction in the price of nontradables, which is, however, smaller than the

decline in the price of importables. As a result, in the final short-run

equilibrium, (Lx+LN) will shift downward to (L.x+LN)' (not drawn). The

intersection of (L+LN)' and the q'q' rectangular hyperbola at point C


     22There is an important difference between this type    of minimum wage
model in which total availability of labor to the economy    is given and
models with an upward sloping aggregate supply of labor.     On this last type
of model, see A. Cox-Edwards (1986), and Section V of this   paper.
                                     19



is the final equilibrium when capital is locked in its sector of origin.

     Under the given assumptions, the post-tariff reduction equilibrium is

characterized by the following: (1) lower employment in the sector covered

by the minimum wage (importables); (2) lower wages in the uncovered

sectors, expressed in terms of exportables; (3) either higher or lower

equilibrium unemployment;   (4) either lower or higher employment in

nontrsdables; and (5) higher employment and production in exportables.23

     Not surprisingly, a tariff liberalization in the case of partial minimum

wage coverage generates a different outcome than that obtained in the case of

an economy-wide minimum wage. First, under partial coverage, there is an

increase in production and employment in exportables. Second, employment in

nontradables may also increase. Also, in the short-run, the reduction in

tariffs can result in a decline in the equilibrium level of unemployment in

the case of partial minimum wage coverage, whereas greater unemployment always

results after such a policy in the case of an economy-wide minimum wage. This

illustrates an important finding: in the presence of labor market distor-

tions, trade liberalization policies usually considered to be beneficial may

generate nontrivial (short-run) unemployment problems.

     What will happen in the long-run in the presence of this type of

sector-specific minimum wage? In the short-run, after the domestic price of

importables has gone down, the real return to (sector-specific) capital will

be different across sectors. The reduction in tariffs reduces the return to

capital in the importables (manufacturing) sector and increases it in the

exportables and nontradables sectors. Of course, this situation with

     23                                                   -
       In this setting, unemployment is given by U —
                                                     LM(WM/WNl). Because
    declines and W /W    goes up, it is not possible totnow a orion which
way U will go. Tile hnal direction will depend on the elasticities of
demand for labor in each sector.
                                         20



different real returns to capital cannot continue in the long run. As time

goes by, capital will be reallocated, moving out of importables and into the

other sectors. In terms of Figure 8, this means that LM will shift

further downward - -   and   with it the rectangular hyperbola qq -   - while
demand for labor in the uncovered sectors will shift upward. Moreover,

these curves will shift in such a way that the final Outcome will be char-

acterized by a higher equilibrium wage in the absence of wage rigidities.

     The final long-run equilibrium will have to satisfy two conditions:

the return to capital will be equalized across sectors and the labor market

will be in equilibrium, in the sense that         —    —                    As

capital is reallocated, employment in the importables sector declines and

employment in the exportables and nontradables sectors increases in relation

to the short-run levels depicted in Figure 8. It is not possible, however,

to know a Driori whether wages in the uncovered sectors (nontradables and

exportables) will be higher or lower in the long-run than their initial

levels. This will depend on the elasticities of substitution and on the

relation between the slopes of the LM qq, and (Lx+LN) curves.


IV. The Liberalization of the CaDital Account. Anticiopted Tariffs and
     EmDlovIIent

     The preceding     framework has ignored intertemporal decisions and, thus,

is unable to handle some important questions related to issues such as the

employment effects of relaxing capital controls, or the employment consequ-

ences of an anticipated change in tariffs. The purpose of this section is

to extend the dependent economy model to an intertemporal setting and to

investigate how the presence of more than one period modifies the results

from the static model analyzed before.


V.1 The Intertemooral Deendent Economy Model

     The simplest way to incorporate intertemporal aspects is by considering

the existence of two periods -.         the present (period 1) and the future (period
2). If we now want to look at capital account liberalization we must assume

that initially there are capital controls that are reflected in a different-

ial between the domestic real interest rate (r) and the foreign real

interest rate (r*). As before, it is assumed that there are a large number

of producers and (identical) consumers, and that perfect competition

prevails. The labor market is distorted by a minimum wage i,           which we
first assume is in effect in both periods.

      In this 2-period model consumers maximize utility subject to their

intertemporal budget constraint, whereas firms maximize profits subject to

the existing constant returns to scale technology, availability of factors

of production, and the predetermined minimum wage. Assuming that the

utility function is time separable, with each subutility function homothetic

and identical, the representative consumer problem can be stated as follows:


               max V(u(cN,cX,cM); U(CN,CX,CM)),

subject to:

                           +        +
               c +   pcM       qc       6(Cx+PCM+QCN)   Wealth,                   (10)


where now the lower case letters refer to first period variables and the upper

case letters refer to second period variables. The price of exportables has



     24The discussion that follows focuses on the role of intertemooral
substitution in consumption. Some macroeconomic models that became popular
in the l970s also emphasized intertemporal substitution in the supply of
labor. However, recent empirical work by Altonji (1982) and Mankiw et al.
(1985) have shown that the type of effect is not empirically relevant.

been taken to be the numeraire, (e.g., p —               — 1).     V ia the intertemporal

welfare function; u and U are periods 1 and 2 subutility functions

assumed, as pointed out, to be homothetic and identical.
                                                                           cM cN (CXCM
and CN) are consumption of X,M and N in period one (two). q and Q,

and p and P are the prices of nontradables and importables relative to

exportables faced by consumers in periods 1 and 2, and are inclusive of the

tariff on H. £ is the domestic discount factor equal to (1+r). Since

there is a tax on foreign borrowing, the domestic real interest rate r is

higher than the world interest rate. The differences between these two rates

is given by the tax (a) on capital movements: r —                r* + a.
      Wealth is the discounted sum of consumer's income in both periods.

Income, in turn, is given by: (1) income from labor services; (2) income

from the renting of capital stock, and of natural resources that consumers

own   to   domestic firma; and (3) income obtained from government transfers.

These, in turn, correspond to the government's revenue from tariffs, and

from taxes on capital flows in each period. The solution to the consumers

optimizing problem is conveniently summarized by the following intertemporal

expenditure function:

                  E —   E(ir(l,p,q),   £*fl(l,p,Q),V).                             (11)

where w and       II   are exact price indexes for periods 1 and 2. Under the

assumptions of homotheticicy and separability these price indexes correspond

to unit expenditure functions (Svensson and Razin, 1983; Edwarda and van

Wijnbergen, 1986). Given our assumption of a time separable utility

function, total expenditure in periods 1 and 2 are always substitutes.

      As before the producers maximization problem can be summarized with the

aid of restricted revenue functions, which give us the maximum revenue that
                                                  23




firms can obtain after making all the optimal decisions in terms of hiring and

production given the distortion in the labor market (see Neary 1985). Denoting

r and R as periods I and 2 restricted revenue functions, we have:

                r —      r(l,p,q,1(l,p,q,i))                                           (12)

and

                R —    R(l,P,Q,L(l,P,Q,))                                              (13)


where 1( )    and    L( )          are   employment functions in periods 1 and 2

      The complete model is then given by the following set of equations (where

subindexes refer to partial derivatives with respect to that variable):

      Equation (14) is the intertemporal budget constraint and says that the

present value of income (the left hand side) has to equal the present value

of expenditure (the right hand side). TRANS               is   the present value of govern-

ment transfers to the public and is given by equation (15). Here bCA is

the present value of the tax on foreign borrowing, where b is the present
                                       24



value of the tax per unit borrowed and is equal to (6*.5), and CA is the

current account in period 2, which is defined in equation (17) as period 2

income minus expenditure. This means that, since in this model there is no

investment, the current account is equal to savings in each period. Final-

ly,         and 62M2 in equation (15) are revenues from import tariffs;

      is the tariff rate in period i, and      are imports in i and are

defined in equation (21) as the excess demand for importables in each

period. Equations (18) and (19) state that the nontradables goods market

has to clear in each period --         and     are quantities produced of
                                  rq
these goods, while E      and EQ are the quantities demanded.

       An important characteristic of this model is that there is initial

unemployment. In fact, we can think of Figure 3 in Section III as capturing

the initial conditions prevailing in the labor market in each period.

Notice that, as presented above, the model assumes that the minimum wage

(w) is expressed in terms of the numeraire and is in effect in both

periods. Of course, this need not be the case, and we can easily handle the

case where there is a minimum wage in one period only.

       In the rest of this section we will illustrate the functioning of this

model for the case of two liberalization policies: (1) the relaxation of

capital controls and, (2) an anticipated tariff liberalization. In order

to facilitate the discussion, in each case we will make some simplifying

assumptions that will allow us to focus on the problem at hand.


IV.2 Caoital Account Liberalization and Employment

       The model presented in equations (14) through (21) is very general and

can be used to analyze how a number of structural adjustment policies will

affect welfare, output and employment. In order to organize the discussion

in this subsection we will focus on the employment effects of reducing
                                        25




 capital controls under a set of simplifying assumptions.25 In particular
                                                                               we
 will assume that:

 (1) the minimum wage is in effect during period 1 only;26

 (2) there are no import tariffs in either period.

Thus, under these simplifying assumptions the only distortions in the economy

under analysis are a minimum wage in period 1 and a tax on foreign
                                                                      borrowing.
       A reduction in the extent of capital controls implies that the domestic

discount factor & increases, moving closer to its international level 6*.

As a result of this the consumption rate of interest Sfl/,r will increase

making current consumption relatively more attractive than future consump-

tion. Thus, households will substitute expenditure into the present. Since

some of this increase in expenditure in period 1 will fall on nontradables

there will be an incipient excess demand for N which will result in an

increase in the price of N in that period (q). This means, then, that

period 1 real exchange rate will experience an equilibrium appreciation as

a result of the liberalization of the capital account (Edwards, 198gb).

This, in turn, will shift the demand for labor in the N sector upward,

generating an increase in emolpvment in oeriod 1. This effect will be

reinforced by the positive welfare effect of reducing the existing

distortion on foreign borrowing.

       In a Ricardo-Viner framework with sector specific capital and natural

resources this is the final effect of a capital account reform. However, if

we assume that capital and natural resources can move across sectors we will


      25The liberalization of capital controls has played an important role
in   recent reform programs, as those of the Southern Cone of Latin America
and Korea.
      26
       This assumption is also made by Svensson (1984) in a different
context.
                                           26




have additional indirect effects that will shift further the labor demand

schedules. The direction and magnitude of these induced shifts will depend

on the sign of the Rybczynski effects. If we assume that the nontradable

sector (N) is the most labor intensive of all sectors and that the

importable sector (M) is the least labor intensive, the final effect of a

capital account reform will be an increase in period 1 employment (see

Edwards 1989b, for a formal expression). This labor market adjustment is

captured in Figure 9 where the shift of LN to L is the result of the

(impact) real exchange rate effect of a higher 6, and the shift of             to

    and of L.r to           are the consequences of the reallocation of the

cooperative factors.

     A very interesting consequence of this analysis is that under our

assumptions the optimal government policy would be to impose a rnfl subsidy

on foreign borrowing. The reason for this result is that, under these

coti4itions, a small subsidy on external borrowing results in higher consump-

 tion, and thus employment, in period 1. Since initially employment in this

 period was "too low", the small subsidy will tend to correct this

 distortion. The magnitude of this subsidy will be given by:

                              r £ (—i)   + 5*R L (—s)
                b*—            lqdb             LQdb                          (22)

 where r2 and          are the marginal product of labor in periods 1 and 2.

     and LQ are the derivatives of each period employment function with

 respect to that period's relative price of nontradables and, as before, are
                                                                    -

that capture what will happen to output of N (rq and RQ) when there is

an increase in labor supply. Under our assumptions of labor intensities

they are positive. Finally (dq/db) and (dQ/db) are the "real exchange"

rate effects of the capital account liberalization and measure the resction

of the equilibrium relative prices of N to a lowering of the tax on

foreign borrowing and are positive (Edwsrds l989b).

IV.3 Anticinated Tariff Reform and Emolovment

       The model developed in this section can be used for analyzing how the

expectations or anticipations of a tariff reform -              - that   is a reduction in

--    will   affect employment in an economy with initial unemployment. As in the

case of capital accOunt liberalization the main channel through which these

anticipations will generate an effect will be the intertemporal substitution

of expenditure and its effects on the real exchange rate. To the extent that

an anticipated tariff reform results in a postponement of current expenditure

we will observe, in the Ricardo-Viner case, a reduction in the price of

 nontradables in the current period, q,                and a decline in employment.

        Formally, under Ricardo-Viner assumptions of sector-specific capital

 and natural resources, the aggregate employment effects of an anticipated

 tariff reform are given by:


                    period 1:         —   .2    (3_)                                    (23)
                                dr2            q dr2


                                dL    —                dQ
                    period 2:                    + LQ(5)                                (24)
                                dr                     dr


        These expressions capture several important results. First, as can be

 seen from equation (23), a future (anticipated) tariff reform will affect
                                      31



      A crucial difference between the current model and that discussed in

 Section II is that in this case we will have an equilibrium level of
                                                                         queuing
 unemployment. In equilibrium, the eected wage in the protected segment,

 for those who choose to queue, will be equal to the alternative wage in the

 free segment. Figure 11 shows the presence of both types of
                                                               unemployment.
     The presence of wage "protection" results in a very elastic labor

supply to the "protected" sector (M) and a less elastic labor supply to

the rest of the labor market. As a result, the general trend will be for

quasi-voluntary unemployment to fall when labor demand increases in the M

sector and for the free sector wage to increase when labor demand increases

in the N and X sectors.

     In what follows we develop a formal model for analyzing the way in

which tariff liberalization will affect unemployment and wages in our

framework with upward sloping supply and queuing. We define
                                                               L, Lx and
    as the general equilibrium demand functions for labor in the

nontradables, exportables and importables sectors. The aggregate supply of

labor to the economy Ls is a function of (real) wages, and can in fact be

expressed as depending on the wage rate in manufacturing. We call fi      the
proportion of the total labor supply employed in sector M at
                                                                   WM:

                 —
                                                                            (26)
                     Ls(WM)


     The fraction (1-fl) of individuals with supply price lower or equal to

WM have three alternatives:   (a)   to become part of the total supply of

labor to the nonprotected sectors. We assume, however, that in spite of

having jobs in the unprotected sector, this group can still apply to jobs in

sector M and has a probability p of being chosen; (b) spend the

present period queuing, so that the probability of getting a job in sector
                                             32




M increases to -yp (p>l);        (c) become voluntarily unemployed with respect

to sectors N and X and involuntarily unemployed with respect to H.

       Assuming risk neutrality and no unemployment compensation, the present

value of the first two slternatives for the marginal worker has to be the

same. There will thus be an equilibrium queuing unemployment level for each

possible value of WM. To simplify the notation, we present here the case

in which all jobs turn over each period. Thus che vslue of (a) is

                   the value of (b) is YPWM         and the equilibrium condition
(lp)WN +    PWM;

becomes:

                                                                                (27)
                   (l-P)Wf —   p(-l)W
                                                                                (28)
with               p—            v e
                                  +7U +L1,


 where        is the number of workers employed in the nontrsdsbles sector, Lx

 is the number of workers employed in the exportables sector,         qv is the

 level of quasi-voluntary unemployment, e is the level of equilibrium queu-

 ing unemployment, and L, is the number of workers employed in the import-

 sbles sector. Using the expression ue — Ud/LS(WM)           for the rate of equilib-

 rium unemployment, and combining expressions (26), (27) and (28), we find:


                   ue_fl -

                                  (iJ

                                                                                    (29)


 as well as the effective supply of labor to the nonprotected sectors of the

 labor market that is equal to:


                   L(Wf) -     (lfl)Ls(Wf)
                                              -
                                                  {- - {i4J]Lw                      (30)
                                     28



employment in the first period, when the reform has not taken place yet.

This effect takes place exclusively through the change in period 1 real

exchange rate which is induced by the future tariff reform. Edwards (l989b)

has shown that under plausible assumptions a future tariff liberalization

will result in a real exchange depreciation: that is, dq/dir2 > o.2 Under

Ricardo-Viner assumptions 1q is positive and, thus, dl/dr2 in equation

(23) is also positive.28 This means, then, that a future tariff reform will

result in a decline in today's aggregate employment.

     Second, according to equation (24), there will be two channels through

which an anticipated tariff reform will affect period 2 aggregate employ-

ment. The first one, captured by the term         is the direct effect which,

under Ricardo-Vjner assumptions, will be positive. The second channel is

given by the term LQ(dQ/d?2) and operates via changes in the equilibrium

real exchange rate in period 2. Under the most plausible assumptions a

tariff reform will result in a real exchange rate depreciation in the period

when the reform actually takes place; that is (dQ/dr2) > 0. Given that

under Ricardo-Viner assumptions LQ is also positive, expression (24) will

be unambiguously positive. This indicates that, if capital and natural

resources are sector-specific, an anticipated tariff reform will result in

an increase in unemployment in periods 1 and 2.

     If instead of a Ricardo-Viner setting we assume that capital and natural

resources can move freely across sectors, the interpretation of equations (23)


     27The conditions required for this result are that all goods are
substitutes in consumption and that the income effects do not offset the
substitution effect.

     28Remember that 2    is the derivative of the employment function with
respect to the price                   In a Ricardo-Viner setting the only
effect of a change in q is a parallel shift in the L. schedule.
                                    29




and (24) will be different. As said before, the signs of 2q snd LQ will

then depend on the Rybczinski terms and, thus, on relative factor intensities.


V. Trade Restrictioms. Labor Market Protection and Elastic Labor SUDDIY

     One of the shortcomings of the dependent economy model discussed in the

previous sections is that it assumes an inelastic labor supply. The purpose

of this section is to relax this assumption and to introduce a different type

of involuntary unemployment. Another simplification of the model previously

discussed is the lack of connection between the level of the minimum wage and

the trade orientation of the economy. In this section we assume that there is

some form of institutional wage protection (unions, government, or other) that

becomes stronger in an economy that is more closed to the rest of the world.29

Thus, the minimum wage that prevails for the importables sector tends to be

relatively higher when there are high trade restrictions. In order to main-

tain our presentation at a simple level, we greatly simplify other aspects of

the problem, concentrating on a one period partial equilibrium representation.

This, however, proves sufficient for our purposes.

     Consider, once again, a three-goods economy with exportables (X),

importables (M) and nontradables (N). Contrary to Section II we now assume

that there is a minimum wage that affects only one sector. More specifically,

we assume that the importablea sector (N)    is subject to a minimum wage and

 that wages are market determined in the nontradablea (N) and exportables (X)

 sectors. In order to simplify the exposition we consider only two factors:

 capital and labor. While capital is fixed in its sector of origin in the

 short-run, it is perfectly mobile in the long-run.



      29Monopaony power will tend to increase in the same way as monopoly
 power under trade protection.
                                         30




        We relax the assumption that labor supply is inelastic by considering

the existence of a distribution of labor supply prices, and by assuming that

labor force participation is determined by the market wage. Since wages in

the M sector are higher than in the rest of the economy, labor supply to

that sector exceeds demand. We assume for simplicity that firms in the M

sector select the workers they employ randomly (i.e. ,   in   a way that is

uncorrelated with labor supply prices) from the pool of applicants. As a

result, there will be some potential workers that would be willing to take a

"protected" job but are unwilling to settle for a lower wage in the N or X

sectors. This situation is described in Figure 10, where schedule L rep-

resents a labor supply derived from a linear distribution of supply wages.

At the minimum wage (WM), employment in M is equal to             < LS(WM). By
assumption, employment in M is a random sample of LS(WM), which in turn

implies that the labor supply to the rest of the labor market (Li) is a

fraction (lL/Ls(WM)) of the original supply Ls. The interaction

between labor demand in X and N, denoted by (L+1) in Figure 10, and

the "residual" labor supply to those sectors will determine the free segment

wage Wf —    WN_WX
                     and the level of employment in X(Lx) and

Individuals with supply price above Wf and below WM are voluntarily

unemployed with respect to X and N and involuntarily unemployed with

respect to N. We refer to this group as quasi-voluntary  unemoloyed (Uqv ).
                                        ___________________________

  With   a linear distribution of supply prices, the amount of quasi•voluntary

unemployment is given by:

  V.1 keductjon in ImDort Tariffs

         A reduction in import tariffs implies a decrease   in the domestic price
 of M falls relative to X. Additionally,
                                                as discussed in Section II, the
 reduction of the import tariffs will have an effect on the relative price of

 nontradables: if nontradables are substituted with
                                                          ileportables and export-
 ables in consumption, the reduction of the tariff will result in a decline

 in the price of nontradables30

        Assuming, at least for the short-run, that the protected
                                                                    wage
 remains constant, we expect no change in labor force

pointed out above, a tariff liberalization will result in

                                            is accompanied by a large amount
of foreign aid or foreign credit capable of
                                             inducing a large income effect,
the impact of the relative price of nontradables
                                                  may be positive.

affect unemployment and wages in the unprotected sector. Imposing the

equilibrium condition in the free market sectors (X and N), we can find

how the changes in the demand for labor in the protected sector will affect

unemployment and the freely determined wage rate:

 sectors of the labor market, and                         is the elasticity of labor demand to

 the free sectors.

        The wage reduction in the non-protected or free sectors (X and N)

 induces an increase in labor use in those sectors, but at the same time more

                                                                                     the
 potential workers become quasi-voluntary unemployed. Therefore,

 immediate effect of trade liberalization is a loss of employment in the                        N

 sector; the sector we associate with more "attractive" or                    "better paid"

 jobs. This will increase the level of quasi voluntary snd queuing unemploy-

 ment and will exert downward pressure on the level of wages as                    workers seek

 employment in the free segment.

        The above discussion assumes that the protected wage segments are

 maintained after the trade liberalization. This is not a fully plausible

  assumption. In the long run we could indeed expect that trade                     liberaliza-

  tion would weaken the capability of governments to grant protection to

  certain sectors of the labor market, and that wages would come down in line

with labor market conditions.32

     What will happen if WM is reduced? First,                     will increase not only

through the numerator (depending on 17M) but also through the denominator

because aggregate labor force participation will fall with              WM. The
magnitude of this fall will depend on C, the elasticity of labor Supply to

the market. At the same time, the equilibrium level of queuing unemployment

will be affected by changes in $                 and WM. This, in turn, will affect

labor supply to the non-protected sector and Wf.

     From (29) we have:



                                                                                       (33)
               dWM        ÔWM             ôWr,     3Wf ÔWM

where:


                                      CWf M
                          LWM+LfWf — + (C-7)

Combining these expressions we obtain:

               dWM       Wf y-l WfJ                      WM

                                                                                      (34')


                                             (—)




     32Notice that here we are assuming that the minimum wage affects the
importable sector and, thus, that its level will be affected by changes in
the tariff. However, as John Knight pointed out to us at the conference,
this does not need to be the case for every country. Indeed, it is possible
that in some countries the exportables sector has a protected labor market.
This, of course, would change our result.
                                              36



    For the particular case where                  —   0   and      —   - we have   that a

change in WM will affect e in the following way:


                     —
                          _ [{.+ 4[))]                                                       (35)


Notice that this expression states that a reduction in WM will generate

two offsetting effects on queuing unemployment. On the one hand, with the

reduction in WM the gains from queuing decrease, but at the same time the

probability of getting a job in the N sector rises. The higher is C,

the more important is the second (positive) effect. In fact, if

                         (7l)WM                d e
                                      then
                      (yl)WM+Wf                dWM


We can then state:

                  e >0 if C—O
                      1                                                                      (36)
                  M'-<O         if C>l

and for 0 < C < 1         the effect of W on queuing unemployment will depend

on how close WM and Wf are at the initial level of WM. That is, the

 expression due/dWM will be positive for a very inelastic labor supply and

will be negative for an elastic labor supply.

      In short, the more time we allow for the adjustment of the labor market

 (the more elastic is labor supply) ,          the     larger will be the reduction in

 induced by a downward adjustment of the protected sector wage rate WM. At

 the same time, the level of quasi-voluntary unemployment will fall as the

 difference between WM and Wf shortens:


                                     (I - )   - WM         M        —a— -
                          —                                    C)                   >0
                                                                                    —         (37)
                              WMWJ                                  1-fl    WM W

                                          37




       Summarizing, a reduction of tariffs that induce a reduction of

 employment in the protected sector (importables) will result
                                                                  in higher
 quasi-voluntary unemployment, lower free aector wages and
                                                               higher free sector
 employment in the short run. In the long run, we assume that the strength

 of the wage protection weakens and
                                         WM falls. With the reduction of WM
 labor force participation falls, the labor market
                                                       tightens, quasi-voluntary
 unemployment falls and queuing unemployment ultimately falls     as the differ-
 ence between free sector wages and protected
                                                 wages disappears. To complete
 the previous analysis the effect of trade liberalization
                                                             on labor demand in
 the free segment would have to be included. In this
                                                         caae, however, the
 final result will depend on the factor intensities,    on the income elasticity

 of demand for nontradables, and on the size of the income effect generated

by the reduction in employment in the importables sector.

     In general it is not possible to determine
                                                    analytically if the average
level of wages falls or riaea with the trade liberalization
                                                                effort. This
will depend on how distorted the labor market
                                                  was initially and how we
weight the wage contribution of different groups.


VI. pjicludina Remarks

     The purpose of this paper has been to provide
                                                       an analytical survey of a
number of international trade models that can deal with the employment

consequences of trade reforms. Within the most basic trade framework         --   the
Heckscher-Ohlin model -   -a   trade liberalization does not generate any em-

ployment problems in a developing nation where
                                                  exports are labor intenaive.
In fact this will be the caae independently of whether
                                                          wages are flexible or
rigid. We started our discussion with an evaluation of the atandard

dependent economy model. However, contrary to traditional treatments we
                                    38




considered the case where there are three factors of production. This

extension introduced some non-trivial problems since in that case it is not

possible to determine unequivocally factor intensities. In this setting        and

assuming wage flexibility, we showed that the short-run effects on produc-

tion, prices, and factor rewards of a tariff liberalization    reform will be


as follows:   (1) production of exportables will increase;     (2) production

of importables will decrease; (3) production of nontradables may increase

or decrease; (4) prices of nontradables will decrease;        (5) wages will

increase in terms of importables and decrease in terms of exportables and

nontradables; (6)    the real return to the sector-specific factors allocated

to the exportables sector will increase relative to all goods; (7)       the

real return to factors specific to the importables sector will decrease

 relative to importables but could increase or decrease relative to other

 goods; and (8)   the real return to factor-specific nontradables sector will

 increase relative to nontradable goods but could either increase or decrease

 relative to the other two goods. In the long run factor rewards are

 equalized across sectors and under the assumption that the importables

 sector is the least labor intensive sector, real wages will increase.

      The same model indicates that trade liberalization results in

 unemployment if wages do not adjust downward. If the wage rigidity is

 limited to the importables sector only, there will be equilibrium unemploy-

 ment initially and a trade liberalization will tend to increase the gap

 between wages in the importables and the other sectors, the labor force in

 this case will tend to be reallocated between nontradables and exportables.

 The effect of trade liberalization on total unemployment is not clear

 because there are two forces that affect the equilibrium level of unemploy-

  ment in opposite directions. On the one hand the probability of finding a
                                      39




 "high wage" job is reduced by the reduction in labor demand in M, but, on

 the other hand, the wage in the rest of the labor market falls, reducing the

opportunity cost of unemployment.

     The effect of capital account liberalization on the labor market was

studied using an intertemporal framework. Under the assumption that the

economy is distorted by controls to capital mobility and a minimum wage, we

find that the removal of capital controls tends to increase employment in

nontradables through a positive expenditure effect. In a similar framework

we also showed that an anticipated tariff reform can generate a negative

effect on the level of employment.

     In the last section we paid closer attention to the starting conditions

of a typical protected economy. We modified the assumption of a given

minimum wage and assumed that the degree of wage distortion in the import-

ables sector was directly related to the degree of trade protection. In

this case, one of the implications of trade reform is the consequent

reduction of the predetermined wage in the importables sector to a level

compatible with market conditions. At the same time, we relax the assump-

tion of a fixed labor supply and thus allow labor force participation to be

a function of wages. We define labor force participation as determined by

all those workers willing to take a job in the high wage sector. In this

context we define quasi-voluntary unemployment as that which is involuntary

with respect to the importables sector, and voluntary with respect to the

rest of the labor market. Under these assumptions, the immediate effect of

a trade liberalization is a decline in the level of employment in the

importables sector, which will increase the level of quasi-voluntary unem-

ployment and will tend to reduce wages in the rest of the economy as some

workers seek employment there. In the long run we expect that trade
                                      40



liberalization would weaken the capability of governments to grant

protection to unions or certain sectors of the labor market, and that wages

would come down in line with labor market conditions. The structure of the

labor market will then change and the difference between protected wages and

free sector wages will tend to disappear, eliminating the distinction

between the two types of unemployment described in the text.

     In this framework it is clear that wages in the importables sector

fall, although it is not clear how aggregate average wages behave. However,

it is perhaps in this setting that the opposition to trade liberalization

can be better understood. Labor, which is the factor of production that is

supposed to gain from freer trade is negatively affected in the short run

and the long term gains are hard to perceive when compared to the initially

distorted situation of the economy.
