                                           ABSTRACT

We study the effects of local partisanship in a model of electoral competition. Voters care about
policy, but they also care about the identity of the party in power. These party preferences vary
from person to person, but they are also correlated within each state. As a result, most states are
biassed toward one party or the other (in popular parlance, most states are either ‘red’ or ‘blue’).
We show that, under a large portion of the parameter space, electoral competition leads to
maximization of welfare with an extra weight on citizens of the ‘swing state:’ the one that is not
biassed toward either party. The theory applies to all areas of policy, but since import tariffs are
well-measured they allow a clean test. We show empirically that the US tariff structure is
systematically biassed toward industries located in swing states, after controlling for other
factors. Our best estimate is that the US political process treats a voter living in a non-swing state
as being worth 77% as much as a voter in a swing state. This represents a policy bias orders of
magnitude greater than the bias found in studies of protection for sale.

1     Introduction

Among the industries in the United States disadvantaged by the North American

Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Mexico and Canada, the Florida

tomato industry has a prominent place. Following implementation of the agreement

in the mid-1990’s, cheap winter tomatoes flooded in from Mexico that compared quite

favorably with Florida winter tomatoes in quality. The industry petitioned to the

Clinton administration for relief; the president made the tomato issue a high priority

and dispatched one of his top lieutenants to negotiate a special side agreement with

Mexico. The agreement was reached in October 1996 and required Mexican tomatoes

sold in the US to be subject to a price floor (explained to the public as a protection to

consumers against ‘price instability’) (Lukas, 1998).

    A natural question is why the US government should have placed such a high

priority on one small industry in one state. It may help to understand this if we

recall that a presidential election was scheduled for November 1996, and Florida had

been appearing to be one of the most fiercely contested states. As one political reporter

summarized the point, the question was “how much the tomato issue could a↵ect swing

votes in Florida, which has gone Republican in recent years but which now seems in

play, with Mr. Clinton slightly ahead of Mr. Dole in the polls.” (Sanger, 1996). The

political logic is summarized more bluntly elsewhere in the same report: “‘The math

was pretty simple,’ another official said. ‘Florida has 25 electoral votes, and Mexico

doesn’t.”’

    This is a case in which trade policy was invoked to protect an industry apparently

because it was concentrated in a state that was expected to have a very small margin

of victory for whichever party would win it in the upcoming presidential election, so

                                           2
       that a small change in policy might be the deciding factor in which party would win

       it. The logic of protection in this case has nothing to do with appealing to a median

       voter or responding to lobbyists or influence peddling. An electoral system such as the

       American system seems to be set up in such a way as to create strong incentives for

       this type of calculation, and indeed other examples can be found, such as steel tari↵s

       appealing to the states of West Virginia and Pennsylvania, in which the calculus is

       similar.

          To analyze these e↵ects formally, this paper studies the e↵ects of local partisanship

       in a model of electoral competition for congressional seats or electoral-college votes, as

       in a US-style presidential election. That is, voters care about policy, but they also care

       about the identity of the party in power. These party preferences vary from person

       to person, but they are also correlated within each state. As a result, most states are

       biassed toward one party or the other (in popular parlance, most states are either ‘red’

       or ‘blue’). Extensive evidence confirms that US states vary widely and persistently

       in their partisan leanings, in ways that seem to be driven by factors other than pure

       economic interest. Glaeser and Ward (2006), for example, report that in data from

       the Pew Research Center in the 2004 Presidential election the correlation between the

       Republican George W. Bush winning a state and the fraction of the state who agree

       that “AIDS might be God’s punishment for immoral sexual behavior” is 70%, and

       this is correlated with a wide range of other cultural views having nothing to do with

       economic policy but which are strongly correlated with partisan voting behavior.1

          In the simple version of our model we show that, under a large portion of the
   1
    Ansolabehere et al (2006), however, argue that the cultural element in state voting patterns is often
overstated. In addition, they document that the red-blue divide across states has been quite stable for
several decades.




                                                   3
       parameter space, electoral competition leads to maximization of the welfare of citizens

       of the ‘swing state:’ the one that is not biassed toward either party.2 We can call

       this the case of an ‘extreme’ swing-state bias; in this equilibrium, politicians disregard

       the e↵ect of policy on anyone who does not live in a swing state. In a version with

       some added uncertainty, there is a bias toward the swing state in policy making, but it

       becomes extreme in the sense that policy ignores non-swing-state welfare only in the

       limit as uncertainty becomes small. Thus, the model with uncertainty can rationalize

       a ‘partial’ swing-state bias.

          A central goal of this paper is an empirical test for the swing-state bias, together

       with the more formidable task of measuring the size of the bias. The theory applies

       to any area of policy-making, and would predict a swing-state bias in tax and subsidy

       policy, infrastructure spending, the location of military bases, and so on.3 We focus

       on import tari↵s as a first case study because they are well-measured in a consistent

       way across industries and so allow for a clean test. We use a parametrized model to

       estimate the bias empirically, and find that US tari↵s are set as if voters living outside

       of swing states count 77% as much as voters in swing states. One can interpret this as a

       measure of the degree of distortion created by the majoritarian electoral system,4 and

       it implies a degree of bias that is orders of magnitude greater than the bias implied

       by empirical estimates of protection-for-sale models. We are not aware of previous

       attempts to quantify the normative bias created by swing-state e↵ects. Tentatively,
   2
     In the basic model we assume for simplicity that there is only one swing state.
   3
     Another potential example is environmental policy. The US government recently announced a plan
to expand o↵shore oil drilling dramatically. The move was unpopular in coastal states, and requests by
governors of those states for an exemption were rebu↵ed – except for Florida, which happens to be the
quintessential swing state (Hiroko Tabuchi, “Trump Administration Drops Florida From O↵shore Drilling
Plan,” New York Times, January 8, 2018).

     See McLaren (2016, Section 3.1), Persson and Tabellini (2002, Ch. 8), and Grossman and Helpman
(2005) for analysis of the di↵erences between majoritarian and proportional-representation systems for policy
outcomes.


                                                     4
       the results suggest that such e↵ects are far more important for understanding trade

       policy than lobbying.

          The e↵ects of electoral competition on trade policy can be analyzed from several

       di↵erent angles (see McLaren (2016), sections 3.1 and 3.2, for a survey). Early ap-

       proaches were based on the median-voter theorem, which was adapted to trade policy

       by Mayer (1984) in a two-good Heckscher-Ohlin model. It was tested empirically by

       Dutt and Mitra (2002) and by Dhingra (2014), both of which show international evi-

       dence consistent with the broad comparative-statics predictions. However, the model

       is essentially vacuous outside of a two-good model since there is generically no equilib-

       rium if the policy space has more than one dimension (Plott, 1967).5 Indeed, defining

       a median voter is typically impossible when multiple goods compete for protection and

       voters have di↵erent preferences regarding them, so this strain of empirical work has

       focussed on predicting the overall level of protection, rather than its structure. No

       study has attempted to argue that aggressive protection of the US sugar industry from

       imports has resulted because the median US voter is a sugar planter.

          A more promising approach is explored in Lindbeck and Weibull (1993), which in-

       corporates partisanship as well as policy preferences into voters’ behavior and shows

       that in an equilibrium in which politicians can commit to policy the least partisan vot-

       ers, ‘swing’ voters, tend to get the most weight. This framework, from which we draw

       heavily, was further developed by Dixit and Londregan (1996), with a more general

       model of electoral competition that incorporates income inequality and di↵erences in

       the ability of a party to channel income to a given group (so that each party has a

       natural constituency), in addition to partisanship. Swing-voter e↵ects emerge as one of
   5
    Note that the last section of Mayer (1984) attempts to generalize the model to many goods, but does so
by imposing the fiction that each election is a referendum on a single good’s tari↵.


                                                    5
a number of influences on policy. The authors show evidence that US garment workers

tend to live in swing states, which could be the reason for their favorable treatment in

trade policy.

   These approaches all assume a unitary national election, but national elections with

a state-by-state majoritarian structure are di↵erent in important ways. Brams and

Davis (1974) study the allocation of campaign resources across states in an electoral-

college game, arguing that large states receive disproportionately large allocations in

equilibrium; and Colantoni, Levesque, and Ordeshook (1975), who argue that this em-

pirical finding disappears when ‘competitiveness’ of the state is included (essentially

the closeness of the state to ‘swing state’ status), and that in addition more compet-

itive states receive more campaign resources. Although both papers are based on a

theoretical model, neither of these solves for Nash equilibrium campaign strategies.

   Strömberg (2008) fully characterizes Nash equilibrium in a model of campaign com-

petition with probabilistic voting and partisan bias that varies by state. To make the

model tractable, he uses a law of large numbers that applies when the number of states

is sufficiently large. In equilibrium, campaign resources allocated by each party in state

s are proportional to Qs , which is the derivative of the probability that party A wins

the election with respect to the average state-s voter’s preference for party A. This is

a value that Strömberg (2008) estimates from election data, and can be interpreted as

the likelihood that state s (i) is a swing state, and (ii) is pivotal (meaning that a change

in the outcome for state s will change the outcome of the national election). Strömberg

(2008) shows that Qs is highly correlated with observed campaign resources.

   The Strömberg (2008) model is close to the issues that are our focus, but our interest

is on the influence of swing-state e↵ects on policy, rather than campaign strategy, and


                                             6
       on quantifying the implied welfare bias against citizens living outside of swing states.

       Persson and Tabellini (2002, Ch. 8) study a stylized model of electoral competition with

       two states with opposite partisan bias plus a swing state, and show that the swing state

       enjoys a bias in the design of fiscal policy. Conybeare (1984) looks for swing e↵ects on

       tari↵s in Australia and McGillivray (1997) in Canada and the US, with mixed results.

       Wright (1974) argues that swing states during the Great Depression tended to receive

       more New-Deal spending, while Wallis (1998) argues that the finding may be due to a

       special Nevada e↵ect (since Nevada was a swing state that received disproportionate

       spending, but that may be due to the fact that it also had a powerful Senator).6

          Most importantly, Muûls and Petropoulou (2013) study a model of trade policy

       and swing-state e↵ects that is complementary to ours in several respects. They have

       a simple policy space (‘protection’ or ‘free trade’) and thus cannot discuss optimal

       policy as we do. They have a rich conception of how electoral competition works, in

       which politicians cannot commit to policy, but incumbent office holders choose policy

       to signal their underlying preferences to voters; by contrast, we have a blunt model of

       commitment to policy as in the standard median-voter model. The crisp swing-state

       theorem that emerges in our model is not present in theirs; their main result is that the

       more protectionist voters there are in the states with the lowest partisan bias, the more

       likely a government is to provide trade protection even if the government’s preferences

       are for free trade. In short, our model is much simpler and provides a crisper theorem,

       while their model is richer and more realistic in its portrayal of political dynamics.

       More importantly, our empirical approach allows us to estimate the strength of the
   6
     Slightly farther from the topic of the present paper, Hauk (2011) finds that industries concentrated in
smaller states tend to receive higher tari↵s, and Fredriksson et al. (2011) find that industries in majority-
controlled Congressional districts tend to have higher tari↵s. Both studies derive their hypotheses from
legislative bargaining under the influence of lobbying rather than electoral competition, though.

swing-state bias as a structural parameter.

    We draw on all of this work, and we bring the theory to data by adapting a version

of the general-equilibrium set-up of Grossman and Helpman (1994), which has been

used for empirical work by Goldberg and Maggi (1999), Gawande and Bandyopadhyay

(2000) and many others.

    The next section presents the formal model in detail, and the following sections

analyze its equilibrium. The benchmark swing-state theorem is derived in Section 5,

and its robustness to variations in the model (including uncertainty and the partial

swing-state bias) is discussed in Section 7. Empirical analysis is o↵ered in Section 8.


2     The Model

Consider the following small-open-economy model. There are a continuum of citizens,

each of whom has a type indexed by s, where s 2 [0, 1]. These citizens will all be

a↵ected by the government’s choice of policy. This is represented by a vector t 2 Rn

for some n; for example, t could be a net tari↵ vector, and n the number of tradable

goods. The citizen’s type summarizes all of the information about how policy will a↵ect

that citizen economically; for example, it may summarize the factor ownership or the

sector-specific human capital of the citizen, and thus what the e↵ect of policy choices

will be on that citizen’s real income. For now, we will not specify these economic

details, and simply write the citizen’s indirect utility by U (s, t). Assume that U is

bounded and is di↵erentiable with respect to t.

    There are M states in which people may live. Each one elects a representative to

the congress. The states di↵er in their economic characteristics, as summarized by the

state-specific density hi (s) for the economic types of the citizens living in state i. In



                                            8
       each state, the candidate with the most votes wins, with ties decided by a coin flip.

          There are two national parties, A and B, and each fields two candidates in each

       state. After the election, the party with the largest number of seats controls the

       legislature, and thus has the right to introduce a bill regarding policy – specifically, a

       proposed value for t. (If the seats are evenly divided, control is determined by a coin

       flip.) If a majority of members vote in favor of the bill, it becomes law; otherwise, the

       default policy t0 remains in e↵ect.

          As in Lindbeck and Weibull (1993), elections are characterized both by credible

       commitment by candidates and by idiosyncratic party preferences on the part of voters.

       There are two candidates for office in each state, each representing one of the two

       parties. Each party commits publicly before the election to its policy, which entails

       committing to a value for t that the party will propose and pass if it captures control

       of congress. The two parties move simultaneously in choosing policy. Each voter in

       equilibrium then understands what the realized policy will be if either party wins, and

       on the basis of that can calculate the utility that the voter would receive if either

       party was to win control of congress. The voter then votes for the local candidate

       of the party that o↵ers that voter the highest expected utility. This expected utility

       is determined both by the voter’s expected real income and by the voter’s inherent

       preference µ 2 ( 1, 1) for party A. For any voter j in state i, the value of µ is equal

       to µi + v j . The value µi is a fixed e↵ect common to all citizens of state i, while the

       value v j is an idiosyncratic e↵ect with mean zero whose distribution function F and

       density f are common to all citizens in all states. Thus, a state i with µi > 0 has

       a partisan bias in favor of party A;7 a state with µi < 0 is biassed in favor of party
   7
    Alternatively, the partisan bias could be assumed to be a preference for one party’s local candidate over
the other party’s, without changing much of substance in the model.


                                                     9
B; and a state with µi = 0 is neutral. These µi values are the form taken by local

partisanship in the model, and can be interpreted as capturing the cultural di↵erences

quantified by Glaeser and Ward (2006).

     Without loss of generality, we can number the states in order of decreasing µi .

          e A the number of states biassed toward party A, and by m
Denote by m                                                       e B the number

of states biassed toward party B. We will assume that exactly one state, numbered

e A + 1, has µi = 0, and we will call this the ‘swing’ state. To save on notation, let i⇤
m

       e A + 1 from now on.
denote m

     The uniform case will be of special interest in what follows:
                                   8
                                   <          0 if v < a
                       funif (v) =     1/(2a) if v 2 [ a, a]; and
                                   :
                                               0 if v > a

for some a > 0.

     We assume that each voter votes sincerely. What this means in this case is that if

party A o↵ers a policy tA and party B o↵ers tB , then voter j in state i will vote for A

if

                                       U (s, tA ) + µ > U (s, tB )


and will vote for B otherwise. For each citizen type, s, the probability that a randomly

selected citizen in state i will vote for party A is equal to:


                      ✓(tA , tB , i, s) ⌘ 1    F (U (s, tB )    U (s, tA )   µi ).       (1)


     Of course, this also gives the fraction of s-type voters in i that will vote for party

A, and party A’s total votes in the state are given by:

                                        Z
                  ✓(tA , tB , i) ⌘ 1        F (U (s, tB )   U (s, tA )   µi )hi (s)ds.   (2)




                                                   10
   For each state i, we define economic welfare as a result of any policy t:

                                            Z
                               W (t, i) =       U (s, t)hi (s)ds.


Note that this excludes partisan preference, although that is part of preferences. We

will denote as ‘full welfare’ W (t, i)+ µi in the event that party A wins, and W (t, i)

otherwise.

   The following observation on the nature of voting in the uniform case will be useful

later.


Lemma 1. In the uniform case, if 0 < ✓(tA , tB , i, s) < 1 for all s, then party A’s

candidate wins in state i if and only if tA o↵ers state i higher full welfare than tB does.




   This follows immediately by performing the integral in (2), using the uniform den-

sity. Since with the uniform density



                                          x+a
                               F (x) =        8x 2 [ a, a],
                                           2a

   equation (2) reduces to


                                    R
                   A   B       1        (U (s, tB )   U (s, tA ))hi (s)ds   µi
                ✓(t , t , i) =                                                   ,
                               2                         2a
                                                       R
which is a vote share less than one half if and only if (U (s, tB ) U (s, tA ))hi (s)ds µi =

W (tB , i) W (tA , i) µi > 0. This simple result is due to the fact that with the uniform

distribution for partisan preferences, the probability that a given voter switches her

vote from A to B in response to a change in B’s policy is proportional to the change

in her utility that would result from the policy change.

3     Political payo↵s

Each party’s payo↵ is given by the function G(m), where m is the number of seats the

party wins. The function G is strictly increasing, so that parties care not only about

victory, but about the margin of victory. However, we do allow for the possibility that

the parties care primarily about winning power. In particular, we specify the function

as follows:

                                 G(m) = g(m) + (m)

where g(m) is strictly increasing and (weakly) concave with g(0) = 0, and:
                                  8
                                  <      0 if m < M/2;
                           (m) =      1/2 if m = M/2; and                             (3)
                                  :
                                         1 if m > M/2

is a dummy variable for control of the congress. Thus,    reflects concern about control,

while g reflects concern about the margin of victory. It is possible that each party

cares primarily about control of the legislature with the margin of victory only a minor

concern, in which case g(M )    g(0) will be small.

    In what follows, the seats held by the two parties resulting from the election are

denoted by mA and mB respectively.

    Note that even in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, the outcome can be random

because of tied elections in some states. This complicates evaluation of the parties’

payo↵s somewhat. The following lemma is helpful in doing this, and in analyzing Nash

equilibrium.


Lemma 2. The utility-possibilities frontier for the two parties is bounded above by a

frontier made by randomizing over only adjacent values of mA . Precisely:

    For any choice of probability distribution over tA and tB (including degenerate

ones), consider the payo↵ point (E[G(mA )|tA , tB ], E[G(mB )|tA , tB ]), where the expec-

                                           12
       tation is calculated with respect to the probability distribution over mA and mB induced

       by the distribution over the tA and tB together with any tie-breaking. This payo↵ point

       must lie on or below the frontier:


       {(↵G(x)+(1 ↵)G(x+1), ↵G(M x)+(1 ↵)G(M x 1))|↵ 2 [0, 1], x = 0, 1, ..., M 1}.

                                                                                                    (4)

       This frontier is concave (strictly so if g is strictly concave).


           This is illustrated in Figure 1, which illustrates a case in which M = 6. Each dot in

       the figure shows the payo↵ for the two parties for a given division of the seats between

       them. Point a, for example, represents the outcome when Party A has all 6 seats, point

       b the outcome when Party A has 4 seats and Party B has 2, point c the outcome when

       each party has 3 seats, and point d when Party B has all 6 seats. The straight lines

       connecting adjacent points show payo↵ combinations made from randomizing between

       them. In the event that each party cares primarily about winning a majority of seats

       and only to a small degree about the margin of victory the dots will be clustered close

       to (0, 1) and (1, 0), with point c isolated very close to ( 12 , 12 ).8


       4      Pure-strategy Nash equilibria

       A Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is a pair of policies tA and tB such that given tA ,

       tB maximizes E[G(mB )|tA , tB ], and given tB , tA maximizes E[G(mA )|tA , tB ]. We will

       see here that such equilibria feature some strong properties. Note that because both

       parties’ payo↵s are discontinuous in the policy choices, we cannot assume that either

       party will choose its policy to satisfy a first-order condition (and in fact, as we will see,

       the payo↵ function is typically discontinuous at the equilibrium point). This means
   8
    The role of the concavity in the lemma is subtle. It ensures that the frontier derived is the true utility-
possibilities frontier, since neither party can achieve a higher payo↵ by randomizing.


                                                       13
that the techniques used to analyze equilibrium in Lindbeck and Weibull (1993) and

Dixit and Londregan (1996) cannot be applied, so we need an alternate route, which

we describe as follows.

   The first point to note is that in any equilibrium in pure strategies, either party

has the option of mimicking the other (by correctly anticipating what the other will

do; of course, the two parties move simultaneously). For example, party A can always

choose to set tA equal to tB . In that case, A will win all of the A-biassed states, B

will win the B-biassed states, and the swing state will be be tied. Therefore, by this

strategy party A can assure itself a payo↵ of:


                            e A ⌘ 1 [G(m
                            G          e A ) + G(m
                                                 e A + 1)],
                                  2

and thus must achieve at least as high a payo↵ in any pure-strategy equilibrium. By a

parallel argument, party B must achieve a payo↵ of at least


           e B ⌘ 1 [G(m
           G          e B ) + G(m
                                           1
                                e B + 1)] = [G(M     eA
                                                     m        1) + G(M   e A )]
                                                                         m
                 2                         2

in any pure-strategy equilibrium.

                          e A and G
   We can call the values G       e B the two parties’ ‘natural payo↵s.’ It can be seen

that they are not merely lower bounds for the pure-strategy payo↵s, but upper bounds

as well.


Proposition 3. In any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, the two parties achieve exactly

their ‘natural’ payo↵s.


                                                                  e A and party B’s
Proof. We have already seen that party A’s payo↵ must be at least G

                       e B . Note that this payo↵ pair lies on the payo↵ frontier (4)
payo↵ must be at least G

                                                                            e B , then
derived in Lemma 2. That means that if party B receives a payo↵ of at least G


                                          14
                                        e A . Similarly, if party A receives a payo↵ of
party A must receive a payo↵ of at most G

         e A , then party B must receive a payo↵ of at most G
at least G                                                  e B . Thus, the two parties’

payo↵s are exactly their ‘natural’ payo↵s.


5     The Swing-State Theorem.

We can now derive the main result concerning the role of the swing state in the policy

outcome of electoral competition. The result emerges in a particularly simple way in

the special case of the uniform distribution, so we start with that.


Proposition 4. If f is uniform, then in any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, tA and

tB must be local maxima for swing-state welfare.


    Put slightly di↵erently, in any pure-strategy equilibrium, both tA and tB must

locally maximize W (t, i⇤ ) with respect to t. The proof is very simple. Suppose that

there is a pure-strategy equilibrium in which party A commits to a policy vector tA

that is not a local welfare maximizer for the swing state, and party B commits to some

policy tB . We have already observed that in this, as in any pure-strategy equilibrium,

each party receives its natural payo↵. Now observe that party A has the option of

choosing policy vector tA , mimicking party A’s strategy. If it does that, it will again

receive its natural payo↵, winning all of its home states and winning the swing state

with 50% probability. But since tA is not a local welfare maximizer for the swing state,

party B can also deviate from tA slightly in a direction that improves the swing state’s

welfare, winning the swing state with certainty, without changing the outcome of the

election in any other state. (Note that when tA is close to tB 0 < ✓(tA , tB , i⇤ , s) < 18s,

so Lemma 1 will apply.) Therefore, with this deviation, party B has strictly increased

its payo↵. We conclude that the original policies (tA , tB ) were not an equilibrium.

                                             15
That is sufficient to prove the result.

    Naturally, this yields a stronger result in the event that state i⇤ welfare has only

one local maximum, such as when it is quasiconcave in t.

Corollary 5. If f is uniform and W (i⇤ , t) has only one local maximum with respect to

t, then any pure-strategy equilibrium maximizes swing-state welfare; or in other words,

tA = tB = argmax{t} W (i⇤ , t).

    The result and its proof are slightly more complicated if we relax the assumption

of a uniform distribution:

Proposition 6. In any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, both parties choose policies

that satisfy the first-order condition for maximizing swing-state welfare. Precisely, in

any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium:


                                               Wt (tA , i⇤ ) = 0,


where the subscript indicates a partial derivative.

                    tA and e
Proof. Suppose that e      tB are a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with Wt (e
                                                                            tB , m⇤ ) 6=

0. We know that E[G(mA )|e
                         tA , e      e A = E[G(mA )|e
                              tB ] = G              tB , e
                                                         tB ].

    Now, party A’s share of the swing-state vote for any policy vector t that it might

choose, ✓(t, e
             tB , i⇤ ), is given by:
                                              Z
                                                                              ⇤
                          tB , i⇤ ) ⌘ 1
                     ✓(t, e                                tB )
                                                  F (U (s, e        U (s, t))hi (s)ds,


which has derivative:
                                        Z
                                                                                  ⇤
                          tB , i⇤ ) =
                   ✓t (t, e                          tB )
                                            f (U (s, e      U (s, t))Ut (s, t)hi (s)ds.


If t is set equal to e
                     tB , the swing-state vote is split:


                                                    tB , i⇤ ) = 1/2
                                               tB , e
                                             ✓(e

                                                      16
and the derivative of the vote share is proportional to the derivative of swing-state

welfare:

                                    Z
                                                          ⇤
             ✓t (e    tB , i⇤ ) =
                 tB , e                                                     tB , m⇤ ) 6= 0.
                                                    tB )hi (s)ds = f (0)Wt (e
                                        f (0)Ut (s, e


But this non-zero derivative implies that we can find a sequence of policies tk , k =

1, 2, ..., converging to e
                         tB , with


                                               tB , tk , i⇤ ) > 1/2
                                             ✓(e


                                                                   e A states that lean
for all k. But then for high enough k, party A will win all of the m

toward A, and also win the swing state for sure. Therefore, the party’s payo↵ will be

                     e A , and the proposed policy pair (e
strictly higher than G                                   tA , e
                                                              tB ) cannot be an equilibrium.

This contradiction establishes that equilibrium requires that Wt (e
                                                                  tB , i⇤ ) = 0. Parallel

logic shows that we must also have Wt (e
                                       tA , i⇤ ) = 0.


   The idea of the proof is straightforward. If party B is expected to choose a policy

that violates the first-order condition for swing-state welfare, then party A can always

mimic B’s choice, then sweeten the policy slightly for swing-state voters and thus win

the swing state, strictly improving its payo↵. The proposition o↵ers a natural corollary,

as follows. First, if a function on Rn attains a maximum at some value t⇤ and at no

other point on Rn is the first-order condition for maximization of the function satisfied,

then we will say that the function is regular. The following is immediate:


Corollary 7. If W (t, i⇤ ) is regular with respect to t, then the only possible pure-strategy

Nash equilibrium has tA = tB = t⇤ , where t⇤ maximizes W (t, i⇤ ).


   Comment. The best-known analogue to this result in the literature is the equilib-

rium condition in Strömberg (2008). This result di↵ers from that one in a number

                                                      17
of ways. First, unlike Strömberg, we assume that both parties care not only about

winning but about the margin of victory. Even if the parties’ interest in the margin is

very small, this has a large e↵ect on the equilibrium, because parties in our model cater

to the swing state even if they know it will not be pivotal. Indeed, if m̃A > m̃B + 1, in

a pure-strategy equilibrium party A will win the election for sure, so the swing state

will not be pivotal; but both parties cater to swing-state voters because A wants to

win by a large margin and B wants to lose by a small margin. Further, nothing in our

result depends on the existence of a large number of states; the proposition works with

any value for M .


6 Conditions for Existence of the Swing-State
Equilibrium

Corollary 7 tells us that when the objective function is regular we need to concern

ourselves with only one possible candidate for a pure-strategy equilibrium, namely, the

maximization of the swing-state welfare by both parties. Thus, under those conditions,

existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium is easy to check: From a situation in which

both parties are maximizing swing-state welfare, ask whether or not, say, party A can

deviate to pick up enough B-leaning states to compensate for the certain loss of the

swing state as well as the loss of any A-leaning states that it may thereby incur. If

such a profitable deviation is possible, then only mixed-strategy equilibria occur.

   One property is immediate: If local partisan preferences are strong enough, then

the pure-strategy equilibrium exists.

                                                                ⇤
Proposition 8. Suppose that µi = ↵k i for i = 1, ..., n, with k i = 0 and k i fixed. Then

if ↵ is sufficiently large, the swing-state optimum will be an equilibrium.



                                           18
   Simply, if partisan preferences are strong enough to dominate each voter’s prefer-

ences aside from those of the swing state, then there is no possible profitable deviation

from the swing optimum. However, a simple example can show that the swing-state

optimum becomes an equilibrium far before that extreme point has been reached.

   Figure 2 shows a simple three-state example. Maintain the assumption that the

idiosyncratic partisan shocks ⌫ are uniformly distributed so that Lemma 1 applies. The

figure plots state-1 economic welfare on the horizontal axis and state-2 economic welfare

on the vertical axis, and shows the economic welfare-possibilities surface between states

1 and 2, or in other words, the maximum value of W (t, 2) with respect to choice of

t subject to the constraint that W (t, 1)     w̄ for each feasible value of w̄. The axes

have been centered on the utility pair obtained by states 1 and 2 when t is chosen to

maximize state-3 economic welfare. Suppose that µ1 =           µ2 =    > 0, and µ3 = 0,

so that state 3 is the swing state. The origin of the two axes is then the swing-state

optimum.

   From the figure we can see readily whether or not a swing-state equilibrium exists.

If either party can deviate from the swing-state optimum, which in this figure is the

origin, and obtain the votes of the other party’s home state without losing its own home

state, then the swing-state optimum is not an equilibrium and there is no equilibrium

in pure strategies. In the case of Figure 2, we see that Party A would be able to choose

a policy vector that would generate utilities at point C, which state-2 voters would

prefer to the swing-state optimum by more than . Consequently, all state-2 voters

would vote for party A. However, since the loss in utility for a state-2 voter is less than

 , state-1 voters also will vote for party A. By deviating to point C, Party A loses the

swing state but now wins the two non-swing states with certainty. Consequently it is


                                            19
better o↵, and the swing-state optimum is not an equilibrium.

   By contrast, Figure 3 illustrates a case in which the pure-strategy equilibrium does

exist. Starting from the swing-state optimum, it is not possible for party A to deviate

in such a way as to steal state 2 from party B (which would require a movement upward

by a distance of at least ) that does not also cause it to lose state 1 (since it must

move leftward by a distance greater than ). Grabbing state 2 would require choosing

a point no lower in the figure than point D, but that is already too far to the left to

retain state 1. Similarly, it is not possible for party B to steal state 1 profitably. Thus,

the swing-state optimum is an equilibrium.

   This logic can be summarized as follows: In Figure 2, if the welfare-possibilities

frontier for states 1 and 2 crosses either (i) the horizontal line ab or the vertical axis

above it; or (ii) the vertical line cd or the horizontal axis to the right of it, then there

is no equilibrium in pure strategies. Otherwise, the swing-state optimum is the unique

equilibrium in pure strategies.

   Note the factors that contribute to the existence of the swing-state equilibrium.

   (i) The larger is , the more likely it is that the swing-state equilibrium will exist.

Any increase in     will slide ab up and cd to the right, eventually ensuring that they

do not intersect the state 1 and 2 welfare frontier. In the extreme case, of course, if

  is large enough, the square regions of length        in figures 2 and 3 will eclipse the

welfare-possibiities frontier and no state will ever vote against its partisan preference.

   (ii) Sufficient economic similarity of states promotes the swing-state equilibrium.

Note that if we allow the states to become very similar in economic terms, so that the

three W (t, i) functions (for i = 1, 2, and 3) converge to each other, then the curve in

Figure 2 shrinks to a point. For a given value of , this guarantees that the swing-


                                            20
state optimum will be an equilibrium, because there will be no point like C on the

party-A-party-B Pareto curve above the second-quadrant               box (or to the right of the

fourth-quadrant       box). This point can be summarized in the following Proposition.


Proposition 9. Assume that all states have the same number of citizens. For a set of

densities hi (s, 0) of economic types across states i = 1, . . . M , consider:

                                                          X hj (s; 0)
                          hi (s; ) = (1    )hi (s; 0) +                                     (5)
                                                                 M    1
                                                          j6=i


for        0. Then there exists a value ¯ such that if      > ¯ , the swing-state equilibrium

exists.


      In this formulation, the densities hi (s, ) are the densities that result if, starting

with the densities hi (s, 0), we pluck a fraction    of citizens from each state and spread

a representative sample of them in equal numbers to all other states. In the limit as

  approaches unity, the states all become economically identical, and the di↵erence

between the welfare experienced by state i if its own welfare-maximizing policy is

applied compared to any other state’s welfare-maximizing policy will be well below .

      This may be of use in understanding historical trends, as it is fairly well documented

that regions in the United States have been becoming more similar economically over

time (Peltzman (1985), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992)), while at the same time geo-

graphic di↵erences in partisan preferences have remained stable (Ansolabehere et al,

2006). Perhaps this may help explain the transformation of the US political regime

from one in which the Democratic party appealed to the South with open-trade policies

and the Republican party appealed to the North with protectionism, to the modern

regime in which the policies pursued by the two major parties are much more similar,

and both parties compete very intensely in national elections for voters in the swing

                                             21
states.


7     Some generalizations.

The main model above is obviously quite special in a number of ways. Here we show

that the same sort of logic survives some natural relaxations in the assumptions.


7.1       Replicating the economy.

Raising the number of states without changing the distribution of attributes of states

does not make the swing-state equilibrium more or less likely. The swing-state equi-

librium does not have anything to do with the number of states per se. This can be

seen by a replication experiment. If party A can defect from the swing-state optimum

profitably, for example, simply doubling the number of states by replicating each one

clearly will not change that fact. Similarly, if it cannot profitably deviate, replicating

will not change that fact either.


7.2       More than one swing state.

If we allow for multiple swing states, the basic logic is maintained, but we need to

allow for the likelihood that the di↵erent swing states will have di↵erent economic

interests. As a result, the general point is that it must not be possible to deviate from

the equilibrium policy in a way that will attract the voters of one swing state without

losing the voters of another swing state.


Proposition 10. If there are multiple swing states, then in any pure-strategy Nash

equilibrium:

                                    Wt (tp , i) = p Wt (tp , j)                      (6)


for p = A, B, for some numbers p and for any swing states i and j.


                                                22
7.3 No exact swing state, and probabilistic elections: A
partial swing-state bias.

If µ̄i 6= 0 for each state i but there is one state for which µ̄i is close to zero, the basic

logic of the model applies provided we add a small amount of noise to the model. Let us

modify the model in the following way. Suppose that for each state µ̄i = µ̂i + ⌘ i , where

µ̂i is a constant known to all, µ̂ ⌘ {µ̂i }M            i
                                           i=1 , while ⌘ is a random shock whose value is


known to neither party until after the votes have been counted, but the distribution of

⌘ i is common knowledge. Further, suppose that the ⌘ i are i.i.d, and the distribution

of ⌘ i is given by the density ⇢(⌘ i ; ), where ⇢(⌘; ) ! 0 as            ! 1 for ⌘ 6= 0 and

⇢(0; ) ! 1 as       ! 1. Larger values of           imply a distribution for ⌘ i with the mass

more concentrated around zero and a variance that shrinks to zero in the limit as

becomes large.

   This puts the model into the tradition of probabilistic voting models such as Persson

and Tabellini (2002) or Strömberg (2008), for example. With this framework, any tari↵

pair (tA , tB ) will result in a probability ⇡ j (tA , tB ; µ̂j , ) that party A will win state j.

If we focus on the case in which g(m) from (3) is linear, then the payo↵ for party

A will be GA (tA , tB ; µ̂, ) ⌘ E[G(m)|(tA , tB ; µ̂, )] = g(m̄A (tA , tB ; µ̂, )) + prob(mA >

M/2|(tA , tB ; µ̂, )), where m̄A (tA , tB ; µ̂, )) is the expected number of seats captured

by party A and the probabilities are computed from the underlying ⇡ j probabilities.

Party B’s payo↵ function, GB (tA , tB ; µ̂, ), is constructed analogously (and is equal to

g(M ) + 1     GA (tA , tB ; µ̂, )). (We assume that M is odd here just to eliminate the

nuisance of ties, without changing anything of substance.)

   It is straightforward to show the following proposition.


Proposition 11. With g(·) linear and M an odd number, fix µ̂i 6= 0 for i 6= i⇤ and


                                               23
                                        ⇤            ⇤
consider a sequence of values µ̂ik such that µ̂ik ! 0 as k ! 1. Suppose in addition that

 k   ! 1 as k ! 1, that GA (·, ·; µ̂k ,      k)   is strictly quasi-concave in its first argument,

and GB (·, ·; µ̂k ,   k)    in its second argument, for all k; that t must be chosen from a

compact space T ⇢ <n , that W (·, ·) is regular with respect to t as defined in Section 5

and continuously di↵erentiable; and that Wt (t, i) is uniformly bounded for all i. Then

if for each k there is a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies (tA    B
                                                               k , tk ) for the model with

µ̂i = µ̂ik and                  then we must have tA    ⇤     B    ⇤                 ⇤
                  =        k,                      k ! t and tk ! t as k ! 1, where t is

the optimal value of the policy vector for state i⇤ .


     This means that if there is a state that is approximately swing, and politicians

can form a good estimate of election outcomes given policy choices but the estimate

is subject to error, then there will be a swing-state bias in tari↵ choices but it may be

less extreme than in the benchmark model. Tari↵s will maximize a weighted welfare

function that may put some weight on non-swing-state welfare, but for large k it will

be smaller than the weight on swing-state welfare. This contrast with the benchmark

model will be explored in the empirical analysis.


7.4      The filibuster.

If the model is interpreted as a representation of the US Senate, an issue that arises is

the filibuster. This is a maneuver by which a minority can prevent a bill from being

passed by preventing an end to debate and a move to the final vote, because the vote

to end debate needs 60 votes out of 100 to pass. As a result, if a determined minority

of 40% of the members wish to prevent a bill from passing, it can do so.

     This raises the possibility that the threshold for control of the Senate is 60 seats,

rather than the 50 that we have been assuming. In practice, the e↵ect of the fili-



                                                   24
      buster has not been as stark as this, for a number of reasons. For most of its history,

      the filibuster has been fairly rarely used, invoked only to block a bill toward which

      the minority had a very deep objection. In addition, many bills have been passed

      by a majority with less than a 60-seat majority, by cobbling together a coalition of

      opposition-party members in agreement with the bill in question or at least willing to

      do some log-rolling. Further, even having a 60-seat majority does not guarantee that

      one’s party does not have some members willing to buck the party leadership and join

      a filibuster at times.

         However, to see how the model functions when a filibuster is allowed for, let us

      make the simplest, starkest assumption, and specify that M = 100 and that no party

      controls the Senate unless it has at least 60 votes. In other words, any split that is

      more even than 60-40 is treated as a tie. That changes the payo↵ function (3) to:

                                       8
                                       <      0 if m  40;
                                (m) =   1/2 if 40 < m < 60; and                             (7)
                                      :
                                              1 if m 60.
         In this case, the payo↵ frontier for the two parties can fail to be concave,9 in which

      case the method of proof used for the non-filibuster case cannot apply. However, there

      are sufficient conditions that guarantee concavity. First, a linear g function:


      Proposition 12. If g is linear, then the payo↵ frontier for the two parties resulting

      from the payo↵ function (7) is concave.


         The proof is simple: It is easy to verify that if g is linear, transferring one Senate

      seat from Party A to Party B will raise B’s payo↵ and lower A’s payo↵ by the same

      amount. Therefore, the payo↵ frontier will have a slope of    1 between any two points,
  9
    Each of the portions, namely with mA  40, 40 < mA < 60, and mA        60 will be concave, but the
assembled frontier with the three stitched together need not be.


                                                 25
and thus be weakly concave.

   An additional sufficient condition arises from noting that the slope of the frontier

between the points (mA , mB ) = (59, 41) and (mA , mB ) = (60, 40) can be written:



                      G(59)    G(60)           4g(60) 12
                                       =
                      G(41)    G(40)           4g(41) + 12
                                                      ⇣       ⌘
                                               4g(41) 4g(60)
                                                        4g(41) +
                                                                        1

                                       =                            1       .
                                                         4g(41) +   2
                                       ⇣            ⌘
                                           4g(60)
This slope is a weighted average of        4g(41)       and unity. If the weight on the former

term is large enough (in other words, if 4g(41) is large enough relative to 12 ), then this
                      ⇣        ⌘     ⇣        ⌘
slope will be between 4g(61)
                        4g(40)   and   4g(59)
                                       4g(42) . In this case, the payo↵ frontier becomes

steeper every time a seat is transferred from Party A to Party B, and the payo↵ frontier

is once again concave. This provides the following sufficient condition:


Proposition 13. Let g(m) = Kg ⇤ (m) for g ⇤ increasing and concave and K > 0. Then

there exists a value K̄ such that if K > K̄, the payo↵ frontier is concave.


   In other words, if the margin of victory is sufficiently important in the motivations

of the two parties the payo↵ function is concave.

   If either of these sufficient conditions is satisfied, then the concavity of the payo↵

function means that all of the analysis and in particular all versions of the swing-state

theorem that hold in the basic model continue to hold in the case of the filibuster.

   Summary. The simple model of electoral competition we have presented has a stark

prediction in the case of perfect information: In a pure-strategy equilibrium, policy will

exhibit an extreme swing-state bias; it will maximize the welfare of the swing state (or

the joint welfare of the swing states) without any regard to the well being of voters

living in other states. This pure strategy equilibrium exists in a broad swath of the

                                              26
       parameter space. When some noise is added to the model, the e↵ect is softened, and a

       partial swing-state bias is possible, which becomes extreme in the limit as the amount

       of uncertainty becomes small.


       8      Bringing the model to the data.

       We wish to look at trade policy to test for swing-state e↵ects as predicted by the

       model, but we need to make some additional assumptions about the nature of the

       economy in order to be able to do so. One approach is to simplify the economy along

       the lines employed by Grossman and Helpman (1994), which allows us to analyze the

       equilibrium using partial-equilibrium techniques. This has disadvantages, in that for

       example the e↵ect of trade policy on wages and employment is omitted by construction,

       a consideration which is central to trade policy politics in practice. But it is simple

       and transparent and allows us to focus in a clean way on the di↵erences in industrial

       composition across states, and so as a first pass this is the approach that we take.

           Assume that all consumers have the same utility function, c0 +⌃i=1,...n U i (ci ), where

       ci is consumption of good i, U i is increasing and concave, and c0 is consumption of the

       numeraire good 0. Each good is produced with labor and an industry-specific fixed

       factor that is in fixed and exogenous quantity in each state, with the exception that

       good 0 is produced using labor alone with a constant unit marginal product of labor.

       Each state’s labor supply is fixed – labor cannot move from state to state.


           Let the sum of indirect utility in state s be given by v(p, Is ), where p is the vector

       of domestic prices across all goods and Is is state-wide income. The world price vector

       is p⇤ , which we take as given, and the vector of tari↵s is p        p⇤ .10 Suppose that the
10
     For a given import-competing industry i, if pi > pi⇤ there is a positive import tari↵, while if pi < pi⇤



                                                     27
      government maximizes weighted welfare, where the weight on state-s welfare is As ,

      with As = 1 if s is a swing state and As =             if s is not a swing state. The objective

      function is:

                                    ⌃s As [v (p, Rs (p) + ↵s T R(p, p⇤ ))] ,                       (8)


      where Rs (p) is the state-s revenue function, T R(p, p⇤ ) is national tari↵ revenue, ↵s is

      the state-s share of tari↵ revenue, and the summation is over all states.


      8.1      Derivation a regression equation.


      We now show how this set-up yields an estimating equation. Taking the derivative of

      (8) with respect to pi and setting equal to zero yields:

                                       h                                i
                                  ⌃s As Q̃is     C̃si + ↵s T Ri (p, p⇤ ) = 0,                      (9)


      where Q̃is and C̃si are the quantities of consumption and production of good i in state

      s respectively, and T Ri (p, p⇤ ) is the derivative of tari↵ revenue with respect to pi .

      (Throughout, tildes will refer to physical quantities, and the corresponding variables

      without tildes will represent values.)


          Since tari↵ revenue is given by


                                          T R(p, p⇤ ) = (p     p⇤ )M̃ ,                           (10)


      where M̃ is the vector of net imports in quantity units, the derivative of tari↵ revenue
there is a negative import tari↵, or an import subsidy. For a given export industry, those two cases represent
an export subsidy and an export tax respectively.

       Now, multiplying through by pi , we can express the condition in terms of values of

       production and consumption of good i in state s, Qis and Csi , respectively, as well as

       the value of national imports, M i :

           Finally, since in this model everyone consumes the same quantity of each non-

       numeraire good (assuming away corner solutions), we can write



                                                 Csi = ⇢s Qi + M i ,                                                      (13)

   Finally, we reach an estimating equation as follows:

                                                  1 + ⌧i

where S is the set of states that are classified as swing states.

   This is a regression equation, without intercept, where each observation is an indus-

try i. The only parameter to be estimated is . The rest is data. A value of                                         = 0 is

consistent with the extreme swing-state bias of the benchmark model, while 0 <                                        <1

indicates a partial swing-state bias consistent with the probabilistic model. A value

  = 1 would indicate no bias at all, and                     > 1 would indicate a bias against the swing

states.

   To understand this equation better, we can rewrite it by defining the marginal

benefit to the swing states of an increase in the tari↵ on i, M BiSS , as:
               ✓                    ◆       ✓        ◆                       ✓        ◆✓            ◆

where QiSS = ⌃s2S Qis is swing-state industry-i production and ↵SS ⌘ ⌃s2S ↵s and

⇢SS ⌘ ⌃s2S ⇢s are the aggregate swing-state share of government spending and pop-

ulation respectively. Here we have divided through by the value of industry i output

to scale the expression. The first term can be called the ‘direct redistribution term;’
                                                                   QiSS
if the swing-state share of industry-i output (                     Qi

population (⇢SS ), then an increase in the tari↵ on i redistributes real income to swing-

state residents by raising swing-state producer surplus more than it lowers swing-state

consumer surplus. The next two terms have to do with tari↵ revenue, and so are pro-

                                                   .   The first of these terms can be called the ‘fiscal

redistribution term,’ and represents the possibility that the swing-state share of gov-

                                                             30
ernment spending (↵SS ) exceeds the swing-state share of population (⇢SS ), so that an

increase in the tari↵ on i will provide an indirect redistribution to swing states through

expenditure. This may not be important in practice, but it has been important at

times in the past, as for example in the early US economy, when low-population west-

ern states supported tari↵s because they received vastly disproportionate shares of the

revenues for infrastructure development (Irwin (2008)). The last term is the portion

of the marginal distortion cost of the tari↵ that is borne by swing-state residents. The

aggregate marginal distortion is proportional both to the size of the tari↵ and to the

elasticity of import demand, and swing-state residents’ share of this is equal to their

share of tari↵ revenue, or ↵SS .

   We can define M BiN SS analogously as the marginal benefit to non-swing state

residents, by taking the sums over s 2
                                     / S, and this gives the first-order condition as:



                                         M BiSS =           · M BiN SS .                        (15)

The M BiSS and M BiN SS terms can be computed from data. If we find that on the

whole the marginal benefit for swing states is much smaller than for non-swing states,

implying that tari↵s are closer to the swing-state optimum than the non-swing-state

optimum, then that implies a small value of                  and a correspondingly large bias towards

swing states.


8.2     A special case.

Of course, the benchmark model with no uncertainty predicts that M BiSS ⌘ 0. In this

case, the tari↵s will satisfy:

will tend to receive positive protection, and tari↵s all around will tend to be higher,

the stronger is fiscal redistribution toward swing states (that is, ↵SS      ⇢SS ). These

e↵ects will be tempered by high import elasticities (|⌘ i |), but will be accentuated if

the swing-state population (⇢SS ) is small, because in that case swing-state residents

do not much care about the distortion cost of tari↵s.

    To anticipate the empirical method, we will see how far we can go in explaining

the pattern of tari↵s with (16), which holds if     = 0. We will argue that this special

case does not fit the data well. The main e↵ort will then be to use (14) as a regression

equation to estimate .


9     Data.

Here we describe the construction and data sources of the variables used to estimate

the model. Our empirical strategy will be described in the following section.


9.1     Swing-state indicators.

States can be classified as swing-states or non-swing states in a variety of ways. Our

main approach is to classify a state as swing if the outcome in its relevant election is

sufficiently close, but this criterion can produce a range of di↵erent classifications, for

two reasons. First, note that a swing state can be defined in principle for any election,

and so there are di↵erent swing-state designations for each election for the Senate,

House of Representatives, and the Presidency. Since we do not have employment figures

by House district, we limit our attention to Senate and Presidential swingness. Second,

we need to choose a cuto↵ for swing status. Since the ideal would be the narrowest

criterion possible that allows enough variation in the variable to allow estimation, in


                                            32
       our preferred specification we define a state as a swing state in a given election if the

       vote di↵erence between the two major parties is less than 5 percentage points. We

       also check robustness with a 10 percentage point criterion. In addition, we try an

       alternative criterion, which we can call the ‘switching’ criterion, in which the winning

       party in a state election changed at least once over a given period.

           What is most important for politicians’ incentives is the anticipated closeness of

       a state in an upcoming election. In our simplest baseline model, that is known with

       certainty since the µ̄i parameters are known with certainty. Of course, this is an

       approximation at best; politicians poll and use informal information-gathering and

       experience to judge what the swing states are going to be in any given election, and at

       times this assessment will be in error. One can think of the election results as revealing

       the ex ante expected swing status of each state up to this forecast error, and hence

       a noisy judgment of the swing states that really matters to us. One way of reducing

       some of the noisiness is to define swing states based on the average absolute value of

       the vote margin over a decade. This is what we have done, resulting in a group of

       swing states on average over the 1980’s and also over the 1990’s, using both the 5 and

       10 percent thresholds.

           Voting data come from the website of the Office of the Clerk of the House of Rep-

       resentatives.12 Table 1, Panel A lists the swing states after each presidential election

       as well as the “averaged” swing states over the 1990s. Table 1, Panel B lists the swing

       states after each senate election every 2 years as well as the “averaged” swing states

       over the 1990s. In each case the last column shows the list of swing states based on the

       ‘switching’ criterion over the 1990’s where available. Note that the list of swing states
12
     See http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/



                                                      33
varies considerably by criterion. For example, Arizona is a swing state in the 1990’s

much more often in presidential elections than in senate elections. Relaxing the crite-

rion from 5% to 10% in any given election tends roughly to double the number of swing

states. Note from Panel A that, averaging over the 1990’s, there are no swing states

using the 5% criterion, and in Panel A the swing-state ‘switching’ criterion is omitted

because there are very few presidential switching states between 1992 and 1996. For

these reasons, our empirical work will use mainly the 5% and 10% presidential, 10%

senate, and senate switching criteria, focussing on the former as a benchmark.

   Looking over Table 1, most of the classifications are as one would expect, but there

are also surprises. Some of these are due to the distinction between presidential and

senatorial elections. Following the events of November 2000, we tend to think of Florida

as the quintessential swing state, and it does appear in the list several times, but in the

Senate elections it is more often not a swing state. For example, in 1992 Democratic

Senator Bob Graham won re-election with 65% of the vote. On the other hand, some

readers will be surprised to see Texas in Panel A as a presidential swing state, given

its status as a quintessential Red State. This is likely due to special circumstances

during 1992 and 1996, when Texas businessman Ross Perot ran an unusually successful

independent campaign, winning 22% and 7% of the Texas vote in those two years

respectively, and holding the Republican victory margin in the Texas presidential ballot

to under 5%. By contrast, in 2000, Republican (and Texan) George W. Bush won Texas

by a 21% margin. But Texas is not in the swing-state lists at all for the Senate races.

Another example is California, which as the quintessential Blue State does not show up

in Panel A, but does show up in Panel B because it had some close Senate races. We

allow in our empirical work for both types of swingness to matter, remembering that


                                            34
      what matters is not which states are perceived as swing now, but which were perceived

      as swing in the mid-1990’s when US tari↵s were re-written.


      9.2      Trade barriers.

      We use both U.S. Most-Favored Nation (MFN) tari↵s and U.S. tari↵s on goods im-

      ported from Mexico as trade barriers for the estimation.

          Many empirical studies of trade policy have used non-tari↵ barriers (NTB’s) in-

      stead of tari↵s, on the ground that MFN tari↵s are established through international

      negotiation and thus cannot reflect domestic political pressures in the way indicated

      by simple political-economy models. In particular, both the pioneering papers of Gold-

      berg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) used the 1983 NTB

      coverage ratio of an industry – the fraction of products within the industry that were

      subject to any NTB in 1983 – as the measure of trade policy. That is not helpful for

      our purposes. We wish to exploit the first-order condition (14), which (as summarized

      in (15)) is derived from the marginal benefit of a tari↵ increase to either swing-state or

      non-swing-state residents. But there is no way to interpret this equation in terms of

      the marginal benefit of increasing an industry’s NTB coverage ratio.13 (See Gawande

      and Krishna (2003) for discussion of the appropriateness of NTB coverage ratios more

      broadly.)

          Further, current interpretation of the multilateral process suggests that negotiations

      have the e↵ect of neutralizing terms-of-trade externalities across countries, allowing

      each national government to choose a politically optimal tari↵ structure subject to the

      constraint given by the trading partners’ overall terms of trade (see Bagwell and Staiger
  13
     Note, for example, that an important part of the first-order condition is the e↵ect of a tari↵ change on
tari↵ revenue, but most NTB’s do not generate revenue. The revenue e↵ects are empirically important, as
noted later in Footnote 20.


                                                     35
       (1999)). This allows much scope for domestic politics to a↵ect the structure of tari↵s,

       even if the overall level of tari↵s is constrained by negotiation. Indeed, Fredriksson et

       al (2011) show that the inter-industry pattern of US MFN tari↵s is highly correlated

       with domestic political pressures in a way consistent with models of unilateral tari↵

       setting.

          For these reasons, we use the MFN tari↵s. Now, care must be used in the use

       of tari↵s because they are set by Congress, and tari↵ bills are passed infrequently.

       Consequently, MFN tari↵s show a great deal of inertia. In any given year, MFN tari↵s

       most likely reflect political calculations made when the bill was passed, which many

       have been many years ago.14 Our focus is the MFN tari↵s as of 1996, because that

       is the first election year after the Uruguay Round reset US trade policy.15 We wish

       to examine the e↵ect of political conditions at the time at which tari↵s are set, and

       so we use data on political and economic conditions over the 1990’s together with the

       1996 tari↵s. The relevance of Presidential elections is clear, since the executive branch

       sets the agenda by negotiating the agreement through the US Trade Representative,

       appointed by the President, but we allow for Congressional pressure by looking at

       swingness in both Senate elections and the Presidential election.

          In addition to MFN tari↵s, we use US tari↵s on imports from Mexico in the years

       leading up to NAFTA, which were, at the margin, subject to unilateral discretion by

       the US government. Before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

       came into force in 1994, the U.S. imposed tari↵s on imports from Mexico that were on
  14
     A striking example of this tari↵ inertia is Fredriksson, Matschke, and Minier (2011), who measure the
bias in tari↵ setting in favor of the majority party in Congress. The results for 1993 show a positive bias,
but the results for 1997 show a negative bias, as if tari↵s punish the constituents of the party in power. The
explanation is that the tari↵s have barely changed at all between the two years, but in the intervening years
party control of the House had switched.
  15
     Tari↵s were reset by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809, signed
into law by President Clinton on December 8, 1994.


                                                     36
       average below MFN tari↵s because many goods were duty free due to the Generalized

       System of Preferences (GSP). 16 Because eligibility for duty-free access under the GSP

       is subject to importing-country discretion, there is potentially more scope for political

       influence over tari↵s on Mexican imports than on MFN tari↵s. Both the MFN tari↵s

       and the Mexico-specific tari↵s are collected by John Romalis and described in Feenstra,

       Romalis, and Schott (2002).

          Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations of the Mexico-specific tari↵s from

       1989 to 1999 based on the Harmonized System 8-digit code. They started decreasing

       before NAFTA, with a small drop from 1990 to 1991 and a large drop from 1993 to

       1994. To allow for the possibility that 1993 tari↵s were a↵ected by expectations of the

       NAFTA agreement which was then being completed, we employ both tari↵s in 1993

       and averaged tari↵s from 1991 to 1993 as the pre-NAFTA Mexico-specific tari↵s.


       9.3     Other variables

       We use aggregate income in industry i in state s to proxy for the value of output of

       income, of the US Census, for all workers employed in i and residing in s. This variable

       is taken from the IPUMS public-use micro-samples from the U.S. Census (Ruggles et.

       al., 2010). Because of this, we are limited to the Census’ industry categories. Therefore,

           The Census has a number of advantages over a potential alternative, the County

       Business Patterns (CBP), for our purposes. For example, if a worker commutes to

       work across a state line, his/her earnings will be reported in the county where the

       workplace is located for the CBP, but will be listed in the state where the worker lives

       for the Census. But as a voter, where the worker lives is what matters. These e↵ects

       may be very important quantitatively; many of the Labor-Market Areas constructed

       in Tolbert and Sizer (1996), for example, cross state lines, implying large numbers of

       workers who commute to jobs in a state other than their state of residence. In addition,

       the CBP data report only payroll income; an owner-operated firm will have profits that

       are not part of the payroll, but should be part of the income variable reported in the

       Census. An additional problem is the large number of industry-state observations for

       which the CBP suppresses number of workers and all payroll information because of

       confidentiality constraints.

           The state share of national population is calculated by dividing state s’s population

       by total population, which can be found on the website of Federal Reserve Bank of

       Saint Louis, sourced to the Population Estimates Branch of the U.S. Bureau of the

       Census.18 The state share of tari↵ revenue is approximated by the central government

       spending share of state s. The government spending information is also from the U.S.

       Census.

       (2009).

10      Empirical Analysis.

Our empirical strategy is as follows. If the simplest version of the story as laid out in

the model of Sections 2 to 6 is correct, then (16) will predict tari↵s, and we can explain

tari↵s with the disproportionate production e↵ect and the fiscal bias e↵ect, scaled by

imports and import elasticities. We first examine how well these terms predict tari↵s,

and how well the optimal tari↵ as predicted by (16) fits the observed pattern of tari↵s

across industries. We will argue that these two components do have explanatory power,

providing evidence of a swing-state e↵ect, but that the optimal tari↵s as given by (16)

predict observed tari↵s poorly, in a way that suggests that the bias toward swing

states is not as extreme as predicted in the simplest model. We accordingly use (14)

to estimate the value of the partial bias, , as in the probabilistic model.


10.1     The redistribution and distortion terms separately.

First, consider the benchmark model with no uncertainty and          = 0, so that (16) ap-

plies. Apart from the ↵SS factor in the denominator which is common to all industries,

the equilibrium tari↵ in industry i is an increasing function of the disproportionate pro-

duction of industry-i output in swing states:

As a first exploration, we ask to what extent these terms are correlated with variation

in tari↵s across industries. The results are summarized in Table 3.

   To illustrate how these are related to tari↵s in the data, consider the case of the 5%

Presidential swing criterion. The disproportionate production term varies widely. To

take the example of the presidential 5% swing criterion, the term varies from     20% for

“Photographic equipment and supplies” and         13% for “Drugs” to 35% for “Carpets

and Rugs” and 61% for “Tobacco manufactures”. The median value is 0.0% and the

standard deviation is 12%. The first column of Table 3 lists the simple correlation of the

tari↵s by industry with the disproportionate production term for di↵erent swing-state

criteria, first for the 5% and 10% presidential criteria (first eight rows), then for the

10% senate criterion (next four) and ‘switching’ criterion (last four). For each criterion,

the four rows show respectively results for the 1996 MFN tari↵s; 1990’s tari↵s averaged;

the 1993 pre-NAFTA tari↵s on Mexico; and the tari↵s on Mexico averaged over 1991-3.

Clearly, across the board, the disproportionate-production term is positively correlated

with the industry tari↵. The correlation ranges from 6.5% to 25%, with a median of

18%.

   The second column of Table 3 shows the same calculation for the fiscal bias term

(18). The value of ↵SS    ⇢SS is about 3.4%, implying that swing states tend to receive

somewhat more federal spending than their share of population, so the fiscal-bias term

is higher for industries with higher levels of import penetration. The values range from

essentially zero for “Newspaper publishing and printing” and “Coal mining” to 16% for

“Radio, TV, and communication equipment” and 20% for “Footwear, except rubber

and plastic.” The median value is 3% and the standard deviation is 4% (much smaller

than the standard deviation of disproportionate production). Here, the correlation


                                            40
       with tari↵s ranges from 22% to 26%, with a median of 25%.
                                                                                      ⇣        ⌘
                                                                                          Mi
          The third column shows the correlation of tari↵s with the distortion term       Qi
                                                                                                   |⌘ i |.

       Other things equal, (16) implies that a higher value for the distortion term should be

       associated with a lower tari↵. The correlations are all small but are a mix of positive

       and negative, ranging from     4% to 1%.

          These simple correlations do show a prima facie, if suggestive, case for a swing-state

       bias. Industry tari↵s tend to be higher in industries whose output is disproportion-

       ately concentrated in swing states and industries with a greater potential to generate

       redistributable revenue (which goes disproportionately to swing states), and lower in

       industries with greater distortionary e↵ects.


       10.2      The optimal tari↵ with an extreme swing-state bias.

       We now put these terms together to form the optimal tari↵ under the assumption of

       an extreme swing-state bias, as in the benchmark model. We compute the right-hand

       side of (16) for each tari↵ and swing-state criterion as described above, and list these

       correlations in the fourth column of Table 3. If the model fit exactly, the correlation

       would be 100%. We see a mix of positive and negative correlations, with none above

       11% and most of them quite small. Evidently the extreme-bias model is a very poor

       predictor of overall tari↵s.

          To see why this occurs, take the example of 1996 MFN tari↵s with the 5% pres-

       idential criterion for the 1990’s. If we call the values on the right-hand side of (16)

       the ‘predicted’ tari↵19 under the case of extreme swing-state bias, then plotting the

       predicted tari↵ against the actual tari↵ produces Figure 4. The ‘predicted’ tari↵s vary
  19
   The quotation marks are warranted because the right-hand side of (16) is largely made up of variables
whose values are themselves a↵ected by the tari↵, such as M i .




                                                  41
from     168% for “Printing, publishing, and allied industries, except newspapers” and

 114% for “Newspaper publishing and printing” to 180% for “Coal mining” and 184%

for “Tires and inner tubes.” These figures clearly vary over an enormous range, al-

though all but those four industries lie within   43% and 55%. This variation is driven

largely by the di↵erences in the disproportionate-production term. For Tires, this term

takes a value of 17%, meaning that swing states’ share of national tire production ex-

ceeds their share of national population by 17 percentage points, a figure driven partly

by swing-state Ohio with 17% of national tire production and only 4% of national

population. For Coal Mining the figure is 11%, driven partly by Kentucky (a swing

state in presidential elections in the 1990’s), with 18% of national coal production and

only 1% of the national population. For Printing, the disproportionate production is

 4%, and for Newspapers       1%. Production in these industries is disproportionately

located in the blue states of New York, California, Illinois, and Massachusetts.

   If the government’s sole aim was to raise swing-state welfare, it would use these

four industries as a very efficient lever to transfer wealth aggressively to those states

from the rest of the country, using a high positive tari↵ on the first two and a high

negative tari↵ on the latter two. The fact that it does not do so is a strong piece of

evidence against the hypothesis that     = 0. Indeed, the observed tari↵s on these four

industries do not exceed 3.5% (and of course there are no negative tari↵s at all in the

data).

   If those four industries are removed from the data, the fit of equation (16) improves,

with a stronger positive correlation, as shown in Figure 5, but the basic point remains.

Actual tari↵s have a much narrower range than the predicted tari↵s, and appear to

respond positively to swing-state incentives but much more weakly than predicted by


                                           42
(16). The hypothesis of an extreme bias is not consistent with the observed structure

of tari↵s. We move now to estimating how much of a bias actually is consistent with

the data.


10.3        Estimating a partial swing-state bias.

We wish to estimate the weight,      , that is placed by the political process on voters

in non-swing states. We do this in two ways, both using the first-order condition (15)

(or equivalently, (14)). First, we use (14) as a regression equation, and then we use

it to compute the implied value of     in each industry individually. Each of these two

methods can generate many di↵erent estimates based on which criterion for swing state

is used. Rather than pick our favorite estimate and present that to the reader, we will

show a range of estimates, which in some cases conflict with each other, and then

summarize the main story that emerges.

   To use (14) as a regression equation, we treat each industry in each year as an ob-

servation. The regressand is the marginal benefit of an increase in the tari↵ on industry

i to the swing states, and the sole regressor is minus one times the marginal benefit of

the tari↵ increase to the non-swing states. The coefficient is then the estimated value

of . Note that it is important that there be no intercept, because that would violate

the first-order condition that comes from the theory. The implied error subsumes all

factors that di↵er across industries that are not in the model but that might a↵ect

tari↵ formation, such as di↵erences in enforceability of tari↵s, and measurement error.

10.4 MFN tari↵s and preferential tari↵s on Mexican im-
ports.

The regression results are given in Tables 4 through 8. Each of these tables is based

on one swing-state criterion. Tables 4, 5, 7, and 8 are based on the 5% and 10% pres-

idential, 10% senate and switching criteria respectively. In each table, the first four

columns show the estimates of     from (14) as a regression equation, using respectively

the 1996 MFN tari↵s; tari↵s averaged over the 1990’s; the pre-NAFTA tari↵s on Mex-

ico; and the tari↵s on Mexico averaged over 1991-3. As a robustness exercise, Table 6

allows for the value of   to vary by year, and uses the year-by-year varying swing-state

indicators from Table 1. Coefficients significantly di↵erent from zero are marked by

asterisks, while those significantly di↵erent from 1 (indicating a swing-state bias) are

marked with a dagger.

   All estimates lie strictly between 0 and 1, with both     = 0 and    = 1 rejected. The

estimates vary from 0.196 (for the 5% senate criterion for 1998 in Table 6) and 0.782

(for the 1993 pre-NAFTA tari↵s with the ‘switching’ criterion in Table 8). Since any

estimate below    = 1 implies a swing-state bias, clearly, the estimates imply a strong

bias. At the same time, since the estimates are all significantly di↵erent from zero,

the extreme bias of the benchmark model with no uncertainty is also rejected. The

estimated swing-state bias tends to be somewhat weaker for the pre-NAFTA tari↵s on

Mexico and for the less strict swing-state criteria (10% instead of 5%). No obvious

time trend is revealed by the year-by-year estimates in Table 6.

   Now, a major concern is measurement error, particularly with regard to the elastici-

ties of import demand, which are difficult to estimate. If all terms of (14) are measured

with an iid error, then the estimator for        will tend to be biassed toward zero. For



                                            44
this reason, it is conceivable that we would find a spurious swing-state bias that is

really simply the result of classical errors-in-variables attenuation. If we had available

variables that are highly correlated with the right-hand-side of (14) but uncorrelated

with the measurement error, we could use them as instrumental variables, but such

variables are difficult to come by in this context. Another way of dealing with this

is to use what we will call a ‘reverse regression.’ We divide both sides of (14) by

and make the right-hand side, with the non-swing-state variables, into the regressand,

while the left-hand side with the swing-state variables takes the role of the regressor.

Under this approach, the regression coefficient is interpreted as       1,   and a swing-state

bias is indicated by a value of the coefficient in excess of 1. Since the classical errors-in-

variables bias will also bias this coefficient toward zero, if the reverse regression yields

estimates that exceed unity, we can take this as strong evidence in favor of a swing-

state bias. The results of this reverse regression are reported in the last four columns

of Tables 4 through 8, which have the same format as the first four columns, and also

use daggers to indicate a significant di↵erence from unity. A value slightly below unity

is found for the 1996 MFN tari↵s with the 10% senate criterion in Table 7, and three

values fall below unity in the senate criterion in the last two columns of Table 6, but

all other point estimates are above 1.

   The various estimates from the regression approach are summarized in Figure 6.

Each point in the scatter plot is a pair of estimates for      from the first two panels of

Tables 4 through 8, where the horizontal axis measures the ‘regular regression’ estimate

from the first four columns of the table and the vertical axis measures the ‘reversed

regression’ estimate from the last four columns (that is, the vertical component of

each point is the reciprocal of the corresponding regression coefficient in the reversed


                                             45
       regression). The 45 line is drawn as a dotted line, and the horizontal line is at the value

         = 1. The fact that every point is above the 45 line is evidence that measurement

       error is indeed a problem. Note that only four estimates are in excess of                = 1.

       If one assumes that in each case the true value must lie between the basic estimate

       and the reverse-regression estimate, then in each case but those four the true value is

       indicated as within the unit interval, and in those four cases the midpoint between the

       two estimates is well within the unit interval. The median of all of these estimates is

         = 0.76.

          Stepping away from the regression approach, the second approach to measuring

       the bias is a straightforward industry-by-industry calculation. In any industry i where
                                                         M BiSS
       M BiSS and M BiN SS are of opposite signs,        M BiN SS
                                                                    is the value of   implied by op-

       timization. These implied values of        of course vary from one industry to the next

       – which would be the case even if the model held exactly, given the likely presence

       of measurement error – so we present both a mean and a median to summarize the

       results. This is detailed in Table 9. Because of outliers the mean values are erratic,

       but the median is always strictly between zero and unity, with a median value of 0.784.

          To summarize, although it is possible to find formulations of the problem for which

       the estimate of     exceeds unity, the overwhelming tendency is for it to lie strictly

       between 0 and 1. This provides evidence in favor of a swing-state bias in trade policy, of

       the moderate sort predicted by the probabilistic voting model rather than the extreme

       sort predicted by the benchmark model.20
  20
     Since tari↵ revenue is an unimportant source of funds in modern central government financing, it is
natural to ask whether these results are driven at all by the portions of M BiSS that capture revenue e↵ects
(the last two terms, multiplied by M i ) or are driven purely by the disproportionate-production e↵ect (the
first term). It turns out that the revenue terms really do matter. If we repeat the empirical procedures
omitting the revenue terms, the estimates are more erratic, with numerous estimates of in excess of 1. As
much as tari↵ revenues make up an insignificant fraction of government finances, at the margin tari↵ revenue
does seem to be relevant in determining the level of each individual tari↵. This is consistent with Matschke


                                                    46
      10.5      Summary of Empirical Results.

      Simple correlations show strong circumstantial evidence of a swing-state bias in trade

      policy. Both MFN and pre-NAFTA discretionary Mexico tari↵s are higher for indus-

      tries disproportionately located in swing states and for industries with higher import

      penetration (which is consistent with a swing-state bias, given that those industries

      have a greater potential for generating tari↵ revenue, and swing states tend to receive

      more than their share of federal revenues). At the same time, industries with a higher

      potential for distortion due to very elastic import demand tend to have lower tari↵s.

      All of this is consistent with a model such as our benchmark in which policy makers

      ignore non-swing-state welfare; however, a closer examination of the pattern of tari↵s

      indicates that, in order to be produced by that model, tari↵s would need to be much

      more aggressively used than they are.

          Consequently, we estimated a model in which tari↵s are chosen to maximize a social

      welfare function that puts some weight, , on non-swing-state welfare, as is suggested

      by a version of the swing-state model with probabilistic election outcomes, and we

      estimate what the weight is by making use of the first-order condition for the optimal

      tari↵ vector. Using a wide range of swing-state criteria and estimation methods, we

      find that the value for     most consistent with the data is typically strictly between

      zero and unity. For our two broad approaches, we arrive at median values of 0.76, and

      0.78 respectively, so we may well adopt 0.77 as a rule of thumb benchmark estimate.

          It may be of interest to compare this exercise with estimates of the social welfare

      weight in the protection-for-sale literature. In Grossman and Helpman (1994)’s no-

      tation, the equilibrium tari↵s maximize an objective function that is the sum of (i)

(2008), who finds that revenue considerations have explanatory power for the pattern of US tari↵s.



                                                   47
       welfare of the interest groups buying protection, and (ii) total social welfare multiplied

       by a weight equal to a > 0. A strong bias toward the interest groups would be indicated

       by a value of a close to zero, while as a ! 1 the equilibrium policy converges to social

       welfare maximization, hence free trade. Estimates of a have tended to find very large

       values, often above 100 and even above 3,000 (see Gawande and Krishna (2003), who

       point out that the high values are ‘troubling’ especially in face of how little interest

       groups pay for the protection they receive). For example, Goldberg and Maggi (1999)

       find estimates equivalent to approximately a = 50 to a = 70.21 We can compare those

       results directly with ours as follows. In our notation, the equilibrium tari↵ maximizes

       the sum of (i) swing-state welfare with (ii) non-swing-state welfare multiplied by            .

       That can be equivalently written as swing-state welfare times (1            ) plus total social

       welfare times . Maximizing this is equivalent to maximizing swing-state welfare plus

       total social welfare times   (1   ).   Therefore, our   (1   )   corresponds to the Grossman-

       Helpman a. Given a benchmark estimate of                = 0.77, this then takes a value of

       0.77/0.23 = 3.5, as compared with estimates of a in the triple digits. Therefore, our

       estimates provide a picture of swing-state bias that is orders of magnitude greater than

       the interest-group bias implied by empirical protection-for-sale models. One interpre-

       tation is that the swing-state model is more useful than a protection-for-sale model in

       understanding departures of US trade policy from free trade.


       11      Conclusion.

       We have studied a model of electoral competition in which national election victory

       depends on winning a majority of states or electoral votes, and where states di↵er in
  21
    In their notation, is the weight on welfare for groups outside of organized lobbies, and groups in a
lobby receive a weight of 1. Their estimates range from = 0.981 to 0.986.

       uncertainty and one ‘swing state,’ which has no partisan bias at all, the only equilibrium

       in pure strategies is one in which both parties commit to the policy that maximizes

       welfare in the swing state, ignoring the welfare of all other states. This can be called

       an ‘extreme swing-state bias.’ This equilibrium exists if the partisan bias of the other

       states is strong enough or if the economic interests of the various states are not too

       di↵erent. A richer version of the model with uncertainty added allows for a partial

       swing-state bias, converging to the equilibrium with the extreme bias in the limit as

       the uncertainty becomes vanishingly small.

           Looking at data on US trade policy, both MFN tari↵s and preferential tari↵s on

       imports from Mexico for the 1990’s, we find evidence that US trade policy exhibits a

       strong bias in favor of citizens who live in swing states. We reject the extreme swing-

       state bias, but our estimates imply a welfare weight for citizens living outside of swing

       states equal to about 77% of that for swing-state residents. This implies a bias orders

       of magnitude greater than the bias estimated in numerous studies based on lobbying

       models, suggesting that electoral pressures such as studied here may be a much larger

       driver of trade policy than lobbying.

           Finally, this all may have implications for proposals to reform or abolish the electoral

       college, which has become an increasingly frequent topic of debate in the US following

       a presidential election in 2000 and another in 2016 in which the candidate with the

       most votes lost the election.22 Moving to a system in which the national vote total

       determines the winner of the election (or equivalently, a system in which electoral

       votes for each state are awarded in proportion to the share of the state’s vote) would

       move the system much closer to the basic Lindbeck and Weibull (1993) model. This in

       general creates its own policy bias, if the distribution of partisan preferences is di↵erent

       for voters with di↵erent economic interests, but it is possible that the policy outcome

       would be very di↵erent from the current swing-state-favoring outcome.23 An analysis

       of the outcome from that change lies beyond the scope of this paper, but identifying

       the bias of the current system ought to be a useful first step.24

       Proof of Lemma 2.


       Proof. The only part of the statement that requires proof is that the Pareto frontier

       is concave, which requires checking because of the jump in G(m) at m = M/2. We

       treat the case where M is even; the odd case is a trivial extension. For mA + 1 < M/2

       (corresponding to the lower-right side of Figure 1), the slope of the frontier, or the

       change in party-A welfare per unit change in party-B welfare when we transfer one

       seat from B to A, is given by:



                             G(mA + 1)         G(mA )             4g(mA + 1)
                                                        =                    ,
                          G(M mA 1)            G(M mA )           4g(M mA )

       where 4g(m) = g(m)          g(m    1). This slope is negative and greater than unity in

       absolute value, and declines in magnitude as mA rises, due to the concavity of g. The

     Consider the following stark example. There are two partisan states, A and B, and one swing state, C.
States A and B have the same economic structure and so the same tari↵ preferences. State C has a di↵erent
economic structure. States A and B have equal and opposition partisan preferences: Partisan preferences
for each economic type in A are distributed uniformly between        and 0, and in B between 0 and , where
  > 0. In C, partisan preferences are distributed uniformly between           and . In the present model, if
there is an equilibrium in pure strategies, the swing-state welfare-maximizing tari↵ will be implemented,
which will be the tari↵ vector that maximizes C welfare. But if the electoral college is eliminated, partisan
preferences will have, for each economic type, mean zero and the same distribution, and so the Lindbeck
and Weibull (1993) equilibrium will maximize national social welfare.

     Note that even with the electoral college abolished, the bias revealed in the Senate would remain.

This is ( 1) times a weighted average of 4g(M/2+1)   > 1 and unity, and so by the

concavity of g it is smaller in magnitude than any of the slopes with mA + 1 < M/2.

Thus, the slope of the frontier declines in magnitude from mA = 0 to mA = M/2, and

by similar logic it is straightforward that the slope continues to decrease to the point

at which mA = M . Thus, the frontier is concave.


    Proof of Proposition 11.


Proof. The first part of the proof follows the proof of Lindbeck and Weibull (1993),

Proposition 1. If we define G̃Pk ⌘ GP (t⇤ , t⇤ ; µ̂k ,   k)   as the ‘natural payo↵s’ for P = A, B,

then it is easy to see that for any k, in any pure-strategy equilibrium, the payo↵s will be

the natural payo↵s. Since each party always has the option of choosing the other party’s

policy vector, each party must receive at least its natural payo↵ in equilibrium; but

since the payo↵s have a constant sum, this also ensures that each party will receive no

more than its natural payo↵. Now, suppose that for some k there is an equilibrium, say

(tA    B          A     B                      A A B
  k , tk ), with tk 6= tk . This implies that G (tk , tk ; µ̂k ,    k)   = GA (tA    B
                                                                                k , tk ; µ̂k ,   k)   = G̃A
                                                                                                          k.

But then by quasi-concavity, any choice for tA that is a weighted average of tA      B
                                                                              k and tk

must give party A a strictly higher payo↵. This is a contradiction, so only symmetric

equilibria are possible, say (tA    B
                               k , tk ) = (tk , tk ).

    Now, suppose that there is a value ✏ > 0 such that |tk                t⇤ | > ✏8k. If we adopt the

notation that ⇡1i (tA , tB ; µ̂i , ) refers to the gradient of the ⇡ i function with respect to

                                                 51
the tA vector and ⇡2i the gradient with respect to the tB vector, then ⇡1i (tk , tk ; µ̂i , ) =

⇢( µ̂i ;   k )Wt (tk , i).   This takes a limit of 0 as k ! 1 for i 6= i⇤ , because ⇢( µ̂i ;   k)   !0
                                           ⇤                              ⇤         ⇤
(since µ̂i 6= 0). But since ⇢( µ̂ik ;          k)   ! 1 as k ! 1, ⇡1i (tk , tk ; µ̂i ,   k)   does not

converge to 0. (If it did, then we could find a subsequence of tk that converges to

a policy vector t̂ with |t̂          t⇤ | > ✏ and Wt (t̂, i⇤ ) = 0. But this would contradict the

regularity of W (t, i⇤ ).) As a result, eventually the first-order condition will fail for both

parties, contradicting the assumption that this was an equilibrium.

     state bias, as shown in equation (16). Each row reports the results of a sample using di↵erent trade barriers and swing-state
     criteria. Data, apart from tari↵s, are averaged over the 1990s. The last column shows the correlation between the right-hand
     side of (16) (the ‘predicted’ tari↵ with an extreme swing-state bias) and the left-hand side, the actual tari↵.

     Note: This table presents the estimates of from regression (15) using: MFN tari↵s in 1996; MFN tari↵s averaged over the
     1990s; tari↵s on imports from Mexico in 1993; and tari↵s on imports from Mexico averaged over 1991-1993. The swing-state
     criterion is the ‘switching’ criterion, and the other variables in (14) are averaged over the 1990’s. Columns (1)-(4) present the
     basic regressions and Columns (5)-(8) present the reversed regressions. The notations ***, **, * indicate the significance of
     regression coefficients at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, while †††, ††, † indicate the significance of rejection of the Wald test on the
     hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to 1 at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level.
