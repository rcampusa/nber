The Real Exchange Rate, Mercantilism and the Learning by Doing Externality

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the degree to which the learning by doing externality [LBD] calls for an undervalued
exchange rate, a policy suggested by recent empirical studies which concluded that mildly undervalued
real exchange rate may enhance growth. We obtain mixed results. For an economy where LBD externality
operates in the traded sector, real exchange rate undervaluation may be used in order to internalize
this externality, if the LBD calls for subsidizing employment in the traded sector. Yet, we also find
that these results are not robust to changes in the nature of the LBD externality. If the LBD externality
is embodied in aggregate investment, the optimal policy calls for subsidizing the cost of capital in
the traded sector, and there is no room for undervalued exchange rate policy. In addition, a deliberate
undervaluation by means of hoarding reserves may backfire if the needed sterilization would increase
the cost of investment in the traded sector.

       The remarkable takeoff in the hoarding of international reserves by developing
countries has been the focus of growing attention and controversies. A casual inspection
of the International reserves/GDP ratio trends depicted in Figure 1, and the pattern of
hoarding reserves by China in Figure 2, reveals that the hoarding trend from 2001 has
been driven mostly by China. Chinese international reserves were stable in the aftermath
of the East Asian 1997-8 crisis, but took off at an accelerated speed after 2001, more than
quadrupled in five years [2001-2006], reaching by now about 1500 billion dollar. Within
this time frame, Chinese international reserves/GDP almost tripled from a relatively high
initial level of 15%. Noting the decline in the growth rate of China in the late 1990s,
followed by a substantially higher growth rate in the 2000s, some observers attribute the
accelerated hoarding of reserves after 2001 to an export led growth policy supported by
mercantilist hoarding of reserves. According to this view, hoarding reserves encourages
exports by mitigating or preventing the real exchange rate appreciation that would have
occurred under a fully flexible exchange rate system. Indeed, hoarding international
reserves has been advocated by Dooley et al. (2004) as a key ingredient of the export-led
growth strategy of China. Yet, Aizenman and Lee (2006) noted that such a policy may
also reflect competitive hoarding among emerging markets, attempting to preserve their
market share in the US and other OECD countries. Modeling this situation in a version
of Johnson’s tariff game suggests that a country with the lowest cost of sterilization
(arguably China), may be the winner of such a game, resulting with “beggar thy
neighbor” outcome. The losers on such a game [arguably Korea, Japan, etc.] would keep
hoarding reserves to minimize their losses, and will invest directly in China to mitigate
their competitive losses. These results are consistent with Figure 3, indicating the
acceleration of FDI from Japan and Korea to China from 2001, coinciding with the
takeoff of Chinese hoarding of international reserves.
       Econometric support for the negative effects of overvaluation on growth have
been found by Dollar (1992), Razin and Collins (1999) and others. More recently,
Aguirre and Calderón (2005) found that RER misalignments hinder growth but the effect
is non-linear: growth declines are larger, the larger the size of the misalignments.
Although large undervaluations hurt growth, small to moderate undervaluations enhance
growth. [See also Johnson and others (2007).] Overviewing this literature, Prasad et al.
                                                      3

(2007) point out that overvaluation is frequently the outcome of real factors, like
demographic aspects determining the supply of labor, the domestic supply of capital and
the inflow of foreign capital, fiscal policy, etc.
          A drawback of the above literature is that it presumed that export led growth
strategy requires a policy of undervalued exchange rate, without explaining the potential
market failure that is addressed by undervaluation or the hoarding of international
reserves. This issue is of obvious relevance for understanding East Asia – Aizenman and
Lee (2006) pointed out that mercantilist hoarding of reserves is a relatively new
phenomenon in East Asia, and that, during the fast growth phases, Japan (prior to 1992)
and Korea (prior to 1997) refrained from an aggressive hoarding of reserves. Instead,
Japan and Korea frequently encouraged export-led growth by subsidizing selectively the
cost of capital in outward oriented activities, at a cost of reducing the quality of banks’
balance sheet. Consequently, there may be various ways of achieving the objective of
export-led growth, and one needs to understand the conditions underpinning the desire to
subsidize export led growth in order to better understand the policy choices confronting
East Asian countries. While the presumption of Dooley et al. (2005) has been that
hoarding international reserves by China is a win-win strategy, our approach is more
agnostic, viewing it as the outcome of non cooperative interaction among countries,
where some may be adversely affected.
          The purpose of the present paper is to model the circumstances that would lead to
the export led growth drive, and to study the challenges associated with implementing
such a policy. We model an economy populated by agents consuming non traded and
traded goods. The non traded is the “traditional” good, produced only by labor, whereas
the traded, dubbed manufacturing, is produced by labor and capital, also being subject to
the learning by doing [dubbed LBD] externality. Specifically, the productivity of the
atomistic firm in the traded sector is determined by the “stock” of experience gained from
past aggregate production of the traded good.1 We focus on the implications of the LBD

externality on the conduct of policies, and the robustness of the results to the nature of the
LBD externality.


1.      Basic Model:
We consider a real model, where the periodic utility is


                U t = ( C Nt ) ( C Xt )
                                γ          1−γ
        (1)

where CN and C X are the consumption of the non traded and the traded goods at time t.

The subjective discount factor is β. The traded sector, dubbed manufacturing, is
produced by a large number of competitive firms, q, and is subject to the learning by
doing externality. Aggregate manufacturing output is


                X t = q ( At Lr , x ,t )   (K )
                                       α                1−α
        (2)                                      r ,t         ;


where index r refers to the reprehensive firm in manufacturing, employing Lr , x ,t , K r ,t

labor and capital at time t, respectively. To simplify exposition, we assume that capital is
subject to full depreciation within a period, and that the traded good invested at time t
provides the stock of capital stock at time t+1. The non traded good is the tradition
sector, produced using a Ricardian technology Ln.t = L − qLr , x.t , where the aggregate

supply of labor is L .
        The productivity index A is affected by learning by doing: today’s aggregate
production increases future productivity by the experience and the know-how learned
today. We assume that this effect is subject to depreciation overtime. Specifically, we
assume that A increases with the lagged aggregate discounted output:


                            ε
        (3)     At = φΩt ;             Ωt = c + X t −1 + δ X t − 2 + ...;   ε ≥ 0,
and 0 < δ ≤ 1 is the depreciation rate of the LBD stock, Ωt . The number of firms, q, is

large enough such that the learning by doing is external to each firm.
                                                                         5

       The main effects of the LBD externality are illustrated clearly in a two period
example (t = 1, 2), where the stock of capital in period 1 is given by history, and

                                                                A2 = (1 + X 1 ) . Consider the planner’s problem for
                                                                                 ε
productivity is normalized to A1 = 1;

the case where the investment is self financed, i.e. where we assume first a balanced
current account. Since the consumption and the production are identical for both traded
and nontraded goods ( C Xt = X t and CNt = N t ), the planner’s problem is:


                                               ⎡( L − qLr , x ,1 )γ {q ( Lr , x ,1 )α ( K r ,1 )1−α − qK r ,2 }1−γ +        ⎤

                                                                                                                               .

  LBD externality and optimal employment and investment, a two period example


The LBD externality increases the total marginal product of labor, increasing thereby the
optimal first period employment. The resultant higher second period productivity
increases the optimal capital. As the second period is the end of the planning horizon, the
LBD externality is not impacting the second period employment patterns. This is an
artifact of the two-period horizon, and will be shown not to hold if one extends the
model’s horizon.
          Despite its effects on the level of employment and production, however, the LBD
externality has no direct effect on the socially optimal level of trade surplus. Trade
imbalance, or foreign lending and borrowing, can be introduced by variable Ft which
denotes the stock of net foreign assets at the beginning (end) of period t (t-1).
                                 Ft +1 = (1 + r * ) Ft + ( X t − C Xt ) + PNt ( N t − CNt ) − I t

where I t is the investment. In the two-period case, the net foreign assets at the end of
period 2 would be optimally zero, and we assume the initial net foreign assets (at the
beginning of period 1) to be zero. We can then write consumer’s problem as follows.

        We can see that the LBD externality has no effect of increasing trade surplus. The
first-order condition is:
                                                U1
                                     1 + r∗ =                   .
                                                     ⎛ U2 ⎞
                                                     ⎜ 1+ β ⎟
                                                     ⎝      ⎠
This is the condition that is familiar from the standard intertemporal model of current
account, according to which an economy borrows or lends to equate the intertemporal
rate of substitution to the international rate of interest.
        The strength of LBD externality thus has no direct effect on the level of trade
surplus or deficit, and has an indirect effect by changing the incentive for intertemporal
trade. The effect can be in the direction that a strong LBD externality would increase the
incentive to borrow in the earlier period before the LBD externality has not materialized
in the form of a high productivity. A strong LBD externality implies that, ceteris paribus,
the output in later periods are higher because of a higher productivity. The economy in
the initial periods is therefore looking forward to later periods of higher output, and thus
would like to borrow to fund a higher consumption.
        In the rest of the paper, we flash out the policy implications of the LBD
externality on the basis of the balanced-trade assumption. We have seen that a strong
LBD externality does not sway one way or the other, the trade surplus in the early phase
of economic growth. This implication is broadly consistent with the growth experience of
Japan and Korea, neither of which had particularly large current account or trade
surpluses during their early years of economic growth (except in years of macroeconomic
crises). In both countries, massive reserve accumulation had come around in later stages
of growth, following crisis-driven economic slowdown [Aizenman and Lee (2006)].

To explore the implication of the LBD externality on the real exchange rate, we write the
consumer’s FOCs as:

         (8a)       pn ,1 = MPLx ,1[1 +         ] = MPLx ,1[1 + αε 2 ] .
                                           dX 1                   Ω2

         (8b)      1 + β = MPK2 .

         (8c)       pn ,2 = MPLx ,2 .


The FOC condition for the socially optimal first period employment equates the value of
the marginal produce of labor in the non traded sector [= the real exchange rate] with the
value of the social marginal product of labor in the traded sector [the RHS of (8a)]. The
employment under a competitive equilibrium corresponds to a similar FOC, where the
learning by doing externality is ignored (corresponding to ε = 0). Hence, optimality calls
for subsidizing employment in the traded sector, and is consistent with an undervalued
real exchange rate. The subsidy internalizes LBD externality, and applies as long as the
learning by doing is external to the firm.
         In a short digression, note that if there were uncertainty about the degree to which
the authorities would adopt the policies called by the LBD externalities, the early
investors would enjoy a windfall gains following the adaptation of these policies. This
follows from the observation that gross rent per unit of capital in the first period increases
with the labor/capital ratio [note that (1 − α )( K1 )1−α ( Lr ,1, x )α / K r ,1 = (1 − α )( Lr ,1, x / K r ,1 )α ].

Hence, a policy that would reduce the cost of labor in period one would increase the rent
of installed capital -- the prospect of adopting the policy that would internalize the
                                                                  9

externality in period 1 has the effect of increasing the rent to the capital invested in period
zero, K1 . Our discussion can be extended to the case where capital depreciates overtime.
In these circumstances, anticipation of the gains associated with adopting future polices
that would internalize the LBD externality may induce potentially large inflows of FDI at
early stages of the development process, even if the present fundamentals are mixed.
       The above example provides a strong case for real exchange undervaluation. Yet,
this result hinges on the nature of the LBD externality. To gain further insight, we review
now several extensions dealing with the planning horizon and the nature of the LBD
externality.
       We first extend the model to a three period horizon, focusing on the planner’s
problem in period one, setting the investment determining the stock of capital in period
two, and the optimal first period employment:

       The firm’s FOC is a special case of (10’), where ε = 0. Hence, optimality calls for
subsidizing both employment and investment in the traded sector, at a rate that increases
with the LBD externality. Note that extending the planning horizon implies that, with the
exception of the terminal employment and capital levels, the LBD externality increases
the social marginal product of both labor and capital due to the impact of the present
output on future productivity.
       Our discussion can be extended to the case of infinite horizon, where the problem
is:
                       MAX

                t = 0,1, 2...


Similar FOC applies: the social marginal product of each input is inclusive of the NPV of
the marginal impact of firms MP on future productivity:


                                              ∞

Note that the LBD externality calls for subsidizing the inputs used in the production of
manufacturing, at a rate that increases with the externality, as is reflected by ε. The
magnitude of the subsidy to labor and capital differs due to timing issues, as the capital
used at time t was invested at t – 1, whereas labor used in time t is hired in the spot
market. The gap between the optimal subsidy to labor and capital depend negatively on
the LBD deprecation rate, δ, and the discount factor, β. In the limiting case, where
β → 0 & δ → 0 , the two subsidies rates are identical.
                                                        11

           In assessing these results, one should keep in mind the dependence of the optimal
policy on the nature of the LBD externality. Suppose that the externality is embodied in
the capital, as has been modeled frequently by the endogenous growth literature that
followed Romer (1986).2 This would be the case when knowledge creation is a side
product of investment, as is when productivity at time t increases with aggregate capital.
In terms of our model, the LBD stock at time t would be:


                                                 q              q
                                     Ωt = c + ∑ K i ,t + δ ∑ K i ,t −1 + ...;
                             ε
           (13) At = φΩt ;                                                       ε ≥0,
                                                i =1           i =1




where i, 1 ≤ i ≤ q is the index of firms. In these circumstances, optimal policy calls for
subsidizing only the cost of capital, and that real exchange rate undervaluation would not
deal with this type of LBD externality.3 In contrast, if the LBD externality is embodied
                                                         q             q
in the aggregate employment [i.e., Ωt = c + ∑ Lx ,i ,t + δ ∑ Lx ,i ,t −1 + ... ], optimal policy calls
                                                        i =1          i =1

for real exchange rate undervaluation instead of subsidizing capital. The endogenous
growth literature frequently assumed that the LBD externality is embodied in aggregate
investment, apparently due to the more convenient modeling associated with it. Yet,
there is no clear empirical evidence that provides support the “aggregate investment”
externality instead of an “aggregate production” or “aggregate employment” externalities.
           We add now rudimentary monetary considerations. Suppose that we start with a
configuration of a fixed exchange rate, where the nominal exchange rate is pegged to 1,
and the law of one price under which the foreign currency price of the traded good is
normalized at 1. We assume that individuals choose to hold domestic currency so as to
economize on the transactions costs of exchange associated with producing the GDP,
leading to a demand for money

Let the initial supply of money M ts be set to accommodate a given path of production
and expenditure, assuring zero balance of payment.
           Suppose that a shock induces monetary expansion of (1 − s ) Ft , where Ft is the
original shock [reflecting inflow of capital, favorable trade shock; etc.], and s is the
coefficient of sterilization. Hence, the new short run equilibrium at time t is:


           (15)      M ts + (1 − s ) Ft = k[ pn ,t N t + X t ] .

Maintaining the assumption of price and wage flexibility, we infer that4

                       dpn ,t / pn ,t          M ts         p N + Xt

                      ds ( Ft / M ts )        kpn ,t N t        pn ,t N t


A monetary disturbance Ft induces the real appreciation at a rate that depends inversely
on the openness of the economy, as measured by the GDP share of the traded sector.
Similarly, sterilization mitigates the real appreciation at a rate that depends inversely on
the openness of the economy. This in turn suggests that keeping the real exchange rate at
a level that internalizes the LBD externality calls for the sterilization of financial inflows.
           The sterilization has to be of a real variety, which can keep the real exchange rate
at the optimal level and maintain the nominal exchange rate at its peg (assumed to equal 1
in equation (14)). The combination of BOP inflows and offsetting stabilizations can result
in the pattern that was or has been observed in several emerging markets. In an effort to
sterilize the effect of large BOP inflows—via current or financial account—the

    Note that the envelope theorem implies that d [ pn ,t N t + X t ] / dLx ,t = 0 , hence we ignore second order
GDP effects associated with employment changes induced by the real appreciation.

government accumulates large external assets in the form of international reserves. While
this sterilization by pumping out BOP inflows continues, the real exchange rate can be
maintained at a level that stimulates production and consequent improvement in
productivity via the LBD channel.


3.     Discussion
       Our analysis suggests circumstances under which policies promoting sectors
characterized by the LBD externality may be desirable. Yet, the details of these policies
hinge on the exact nature of this externality, and the quality of the governance which
ultimately determines the efficacy of policy intervention. It would be too simplistic to
view the successful growth of China as stemming from any deliberate undervalued
exchange rate by means of large reserves hoardings. First, similar success stories in East
Asia have happened without active hoarding policies. Second, depending on the nature
of the LBD externality, it may call for subsidizing the cost of capital, subsidizing the cost
of labor, or both. Real exchange rate undervaluation would be the suggested policy only
if the LBD externality calls for subsidizing employment in the traded sector, and if this
end can’t be accomplished by more effective means. After all, hoarding international
reserves is a policy that impacts the stance of monetary policy and the domestic interest
rates. Such a policy may backfire if the needed sterilization would lead to markedly
higher interest rate, reducing thereby capital accumulation in the traded sector. The
adverse financing effects of hoarding reserves are more likely to be larger in countries
characterized with shallow financial system, low saving rates, and more costly
sterilization; conditions that on balance apply to LATAM. Finally, the adaptation of
similar hoarding policies by countries competing in the same third market may lead to
competitive hoarding, dissipating the competitive gains of most involved countries [see
Aizenman and Lee (2006)]. Yet, hoarding reserves may be an effective short-
intermediate run policy dealing with balance of payment effects of shocks whose
permanency is not known, like TOT improvements and capital inflows [see Aizenman
and Riera-Crichton (2006)].
