       The paper uses a small analytical
                                           two—region (the United States and
  the Rest of the Industrial
                               World) model, to analyze three issues
                                                                        Concerning
  international economic interdependence
                                           and macroeconomic
                                                               policy coordination
  that have been raised in
                             connection with the September 1985 World Economic
 Outlook published by the IMF.
                                  They are: (1) What should be the monetary
 and/or fiscal response in the Rest of the Industrial
                                                      World to a tightening
 of U.S. fiscal Policy and
                           what should be the U.S.
                                                   monetary response?
 (2) What Should be the
                        monetary and/or fiscal response in the United States
 and in the Rest of the
                        Industri World to a "Collapse of the U.S. dollar?"
 The paper highlights the
                          importance of determining the causes of such
 a "hard landing" for the U.S. dollar, as the appropriate
                                                           policy responses
are very sensitive to this; (3) What should be the
                                                    macroeconomic policy
response in the Industrial World
                                   to a disappointing real
                                                            growth performance?
Again the correct identification
                                 of the reason(s) for the disappointment
is shown to be crucial.

     The final Section
                       discusses and qualifies the activist policy
conclusions derived from the formal analysis.

        clearly reflects this
                                Institution's concern
                                                          with international
                                                                               economic

       I take up three                                                          paper

                                                 were the subject of
       both in the Fund and                                            widespread discussion,
                              outside it during
                                                     the period
       of the WEO. They are:                                      leading up to the

           (2) What should

         All three issues
                             are clearly of more than academic

  and transparent to permit           a   simple algebraic and diagrammatic analysis

  are such, however, that a first pass at this problem "in two dimensions"

  is justified.

           Section 11.1 outlines the simple
                                                     two—country Dornbusch—style model
  with a floating exchange
                                   rate, perfect capital mobility, rational exchange
  rate expectations and gradual price
                                                   adjustment. The long—run or steady—
  state comparative statics are reviewed in Section 11.2 while Section 11.3

  characterizes the nature of the dynamic             adjustment     process. Possible
 responses to a tightening of U.S. fiscal policy are reviewed in Section

 III. In Section IV possible
                                          responses to a collapse of the U.S. dollar
 are considered and Section V deals with              the     policy implications of a
 slowdown in world economic
                                      activity. Qualifications and conclusions are
 found in Section VI.

                             II.          An Analytical Approach
 11.1.      The model

            Consider the simple two-country or two—region version of the

Dornbusch [1976] open macroeconomic model                 with a   freely floating exchange
rate and perfect capital mobility
                                               given in equations (1)—(12) below.
Except for some inconsequential
                                            differences, this model is the one used
by Miller [1982]. (See also Buiter [1985a] for another application.)

All variables other than interest rates are in natural logarithms.

      All coefficients are
                                 non—negative. Country 1 will be referred to as
the USA and country 2 as the Rest of the World (ROW).

Constant), increased capacity
                                  output in either country raises the long—
run stock of real money balances in both countries.

      First   among the policy issues to be considered now is the proper

 response in the ROW to a unilateral U.S. fiscal contraction.


           III. Responses to a tightening of U.S. fiscal policy

 111.1. U.S.  fiscal tightening without fiscal or monetary response
         in the ROW and without monetary response in the U.S.A

      A fiscal tightening in the U.S.A. without any fiscal response in the

 ROW is, in the notation of this paper, a reduction in the average fiscal

 impulse (fe) and a reduction in the difference between the two countries'

 fiscal impulses fd which is twice as large as the reduction in a. From

equations 16(a—e) it is clear that the long—run consequences of this

unilateral fiscal contraction will he the following:

      (1) an improvement in the U.S.A's competitiveness Cc   increases);
     (2) a lowering of the real interest rate in the U.S.A. and in the

          rest of the world;

     (3) an increase in the world real money stock because nominal

          as well as real interest rates are lower in the U.S. and in the

          R.O.W.

     In Figure 2a we see that for c and 1d, the full long—run adjustment

from E1 to E2 occurs instantaneously. Relative US—ROW real money balances

are unaffected by the U.S. fiscal tightening. The required long—run

depreciation in the real exchange rate can therefore be brought about

iediately by a jump or step depreciation in the nominal exchange rate
of the United States.
                                      — 14 —



      In   the new long—run equilibrium the global stock of real money

 balances viii be larger since lover nominal interest rates raise velocity.

 Given nominal money growth rates in the U.S. and the ROW and without any

 discrete changes in the levels of the nominal money stocks, the process

 of increasing real balances requires that the rate of inflation be held

 below the given rates of growth of the nominal money stocks. There will

 therefore be a temporary global recession: ya declines. The global

 recession affects the U.S. and the R.O.W. equally: y4 is zero throughout

 the adjustment process. U.S. output declines because of the fiscal

 tightening but the decline is mitigated somewhat as competitiveness

 improves. The ROW suffers from its loss of competitiveness, which mirrors

the improvement In the U.S. competitiveness. The recession is therefore

concentrated in the non—traded goods sector of the U.S. and the traded

goods sector of the ROW. Nominal and real interest rates and inflation

rates in the U.S. and the ROW are affected equally by the U.S. fiscal

contraction: id, r'1 and      are zero throughtout. Both nominal and

real interest rates decline globally (and in each country). As in the

familiar   closed economy IS—Il.!, augmented Phillips curve model, the decline
in nominal and real interest rates mitigates the contraction of aggregate
demand but does not undo it completely.
                                         There is "crowding out" (in our

policy experiment a reversal of crowding out) but less than 100 percent.

Note that because inflation declines during the recession, real interest
                                     — 15   —


  rates   come down by less than nominal interest rates. Figure 3   suarizeg
  the response to the unexpected announcement at time t0 of an imediately

 implemented permanent tightening of U.S. fiscal policy. 1/

 111.2 Monetary policy stabilizes the nominal exchange rate

          One of the scenarios considered in the WEO consists of a tightening

 of U.S. fiscal policy, unaccommodating U.S. monetary policy, unchanged

 fiscal policy in the ROW and monetary policy in the ROW geared to interest

 rate coupling. Given perfect international capital mobility, interest rate

 coupling amounts to having a fixed nominal exchange rate. Under a fixed

 exchange rate regime, a fiscal contraction in the U.S. will, with perfect

 capital mobility, lead to a stock—shift outf low of capital from the U.S.,

 a stock—shift loss U.S. foreign exchange reserves and a corresponding

 contraction in the U.S. money stock. The ROW experiences the counterpart

stock—shift inflow of capital, stock—shift gain in foreign exchange

reserves and expansion of its mbney stock. It is therefore arbitrary

whether one assigns the stabilization of the exchange rate to the monetary

policy of the ROW or to the U.S. Under a fixed exchange rate regime

(which is expected to be permanent) there is effectively a single global

world money market or world UI schedule. Individual countries can choose

their own rates of domestic credit expansion and thus collectively

determine the growth of the world money stock. The distribution of this

world money stock across countries is determined by the individual countries'

 money demand functions, with reserve flows making up the difference

 betweerr      changes     in domestic money demand and domestic credit expansion.

         The formal analysis of the fixed exchange rate regime is very

simple. Let the global stock of gold and foreign exchange reserves be

constant and, for notational simplicity, equal to zero. The global money

stock is therefore the sum of the two countries' stocks of domestic

credit. Let m be the logarithm of the global nominal money stock, Dj the

logarithm of country i's stock of domestic credit and V the share of U.S.

domestic credit is total domestic credit.

(18a) m VD1 + (l—v)D2                               O<v<l.

Setting the logarithm of the fixed nominal exchange rate equal to zero,

we define the global price level, p, as follows:

(18b)     p      Vp1   +   (l—v)p2

The global money demand shock n                is   similarly defined as:

(18c)     ii   — vr1 + (l—v)n2

and global income as

(18d) y          vy1 + (1—     v)y2
            is the proportional rate of growth of country i's domestic

credit. (Under a freely fi:ating exchange rate regime,                        in1.) The

augmentation term in the Phillips curve is taken to be the policy—determined

ij   rather    than the endogenously determined inj.             No fixed exchange rate

regime is viable unless inflation rates converge. I therefore impose
     —     — i. This        still permits short—term divergence of inflation

rates. Also define j             ij   —

       Note that average global real
                                     liquidity under the fixed exchange
  rate regime (1/2 £ given in equation (24)) behaves identically to
                                                                            average
  global real liquidity under the
                                       freely floating, exchange rate regime (1a
 given in equation 14(b)). 1/ The same holds for average world output.

  (Compare equation (27) with y8 from equation (15b)). It is also checked

 very easily that the long—run, steady state
                                                    effects of fiscal policy (or
 other real shocks) are the same under fixed and floating rates.

      When therefore we compare the
                                          consequences of a tightening of U.S.
 fiscal policy under a floating exchange rate with that under a fixed

 exchange rate, holding global monetary policy constant in the sense that

 the growth rates of domestic credit (and therefore the growth
                                                               rate of the
 global stock of nominal, money)
                                     are the same in the two regimes, the
 recession in the U.S. following the fiscal
                                                   contraction will be smaller
under a floating exchange rate while in the ROW the recession will be

deeper with a floating rate.

     The global loss of output is the same under the two exchange rate

regimes, but   while   under a floating rate the recesions in the U.S. and
the ROW are identical in
                               magnitude (although in the U.S. the non—traded
goods sector will, be hit while in the ROW it will be the traded goods

sector), under a fixed rate tie U.S. will
                                               always experience a deeper
recession. It is even possi1je that under a fixed rate the ROW would

experience a net boost to output.

        Several points can be made about the fixed exchange rate system.

First, stability requires that K1+K2 > 0                and that K1—K2 > 0. This is
equivalent to requiring that K1 > 0              and     > 0. However, K2 could be

either positive or negative. With a fixed exchange rate, fiscal contrac-

tion in the United States will therefore definitely lower U.S. real output

(from (25) —i- —       K11      > 0) but it may    either     raise or lower real output
                af1

in the ROW (2 — —K2A1).               If K2 < 0, the depressing effect on the

ROW's   export sector of a decline in U.S.              demand outweighs the beneficial


effect of lower worldwide interest rates (t >

ROW experiences a slump.           If the   crowding in" effect is stronger than

the direct demand effect, (K2 > 0)           then      the ROW expands while the U.S.

contracts. Even if        output    in both countries declines, the decline will

be   steeper    in the United States.

      It   is easily    checked that, if the U.S. and ROW are of similar size,

total   world    output always contracts, even in the case where output in the

ROW is stimulated by lower interest rates:

     The short—run behavior of the real exchange rate is quite different

under the two regimes. As shown in Figure 3, under a floating exchange

rate U.S. competitiveness, which is a non—predetermined variable in this

case, sharply improves on impact to its new equilibrium level. This

jump—depreciation of c reflects a jump—depreciation of e, the nominal

exchange rate. While this clearly represents a hard landing for the U.S.

dollar, it represents a imich softer landing for the U.S. real economy

than the alternative scenario where the nominal exchange rate is kept

constant throughout. In the latter case U.S. competitiveness improves

gradually after the U.S. fiscal contraction and converges asymptotically

to the same level achieved immediately with a freely floating exchange

rate. The improvement in competitiveness is due to the U.S. rate of cost

inflation falling below that in the ROW because of the relatively deeper

recession in the U.S.

111.3 Policies that achieve an improvement in U.S.
       competitiveness witout a contraction of world demand

       In this subsection I take as given the fiscal tightening in the

United States as well as :he achievement of a lasting improvement in U.S.

external competitiveness. A floating exchange rate is again assumed.

A ROW fiscal expansion to match the U.S. fiscal contraction

     In the formal setting    our little model, the transition to improved

U.S. competitiveness can be achieved instantaneously and without any

contraction of effective demand at home or abroad by having the U.S.

fiscal contraction matched by a corresponding ROW fiscal expansion.. In

  ter of the dynamics of equations (l4a,b) and (15a,b) and the steady—
  state conditions of equations (16a—e), this "package" consists of a

  reduction in fd with f unchanged.    Figure 4 shows the instantaneous
 adjustment process.

      There is no change in real or nominal interest rates as the effects

 on the global capital market of the two opposing fiscal impulses cancel

 each other out. For a given U.S. fiscal
                                               contraction, the improvement in
 U.S. competitiveness is now doubled (in
                                           our linear model) because of the
 fiscal expansion in the Row. World aggregate demand is unchanged and so

 is aggregate demand for each individual
                                           country's output.
      There are several qualifications to be made before this painless

 adjustment package is recornmended for use in the real world. First,

while total output stays constant in each country, there is a shift

 towards the production of tradeables in the U.S. and towards the production

of noritradeables in the ROW. Steelworkers
                                                make poor hairdressers and
conversely. The problems sociated with changing the sectoral composition

of production, employment ad investment are ignored in our simple model.

     Second, the selection of dosage and timing for the ROW fiscal

expansion is made to look 1rnpler than it is in practice because of the

assumption of known, idenIcal structures.       While this in no way weakens
the case for a flexible policy
                                 response in principle, it makes the
practical task of selecting the right mix, dose and timing a much more

complicated matter than our iimple model may suggest.
                                                                                       I
                                       — 22 —




      Third,   a fi8cal expansion in the ROW may be opposed for structural or

allocative reasons. Increased public spending may be undesirable because

of its political irreversibility and because, at full employment, the

benefits from the spending are judged to be less than its cost. Lower

taxes or higher transfer payments may be undesirable because of possible

efficiency losses, undesirable incentive effects or for distributional

reasons.

      Fourth, fiscal expansions (other than balanced—budget fiscal expan-

sions) entail larger deficits and, in time, a larger public debt. If the

real interest rate exceeds the growth rate of the real tax base, explosive

debt—deficit spirals are possible unless the primary (non—interest) deficit

is planned (and believed) to become a surplus in due course. If there is

no reputation for fiscal rectitude, temporary (increases in) deficits

will be extrapolated int.o the future. Fear of possible future monetization

of deficits u-ill raise long nominal interest rates. Increased uncertainty

about the future course of inflation may add a further risk premium to

the   required rate of return on   nominal government   debt.     In extreme

circumstances,   fear of partial or complete debt     repudiation or of special

capital    levies and surcharges may   build   a risk premium   into the rate of

return   on all public debt (See Blanchard, Buiter and Dornbusch        [1984]   and

Buiter    [l985b]). A good reputation for underlying fiscal rectitude would,

however, avoid the potential crowding out resulting from such confidence

effects. It might therefore help if such a program were supervised by or

at least coordinated through an organization such as the I whose

reputation f or fiscal restraint is second to none.

        Finally,    it may be judged that the global level of effective demand

 jg    currently   excessive, and that a net reduction in global demand is in

 order, as well as a realignment of U.S.        competitiveness. A unilateral
 U.S. fiscal contraction might in that case be the right policy. The

 point would seem to be mainly of academic interest, as in the opinion

 of most observers     there remains a margin    of Keynesian slack in the world

 economy.

 A U.S. fiscal contraction matched by effective demand—
 maintaining expansionary monetary policy changes
        Calls for a change in the U.S. macroeconomic policy mix, from tight

money and loose fiscal policy to looser money and tighter fiscal policy

have been heard from all corners of the profession in recent years.

There are two kinds of monetary policy changes that could be used in the

present model: changes in level of the nominal money stock and changes

in the proportional growth rate of the nominal money stock.

Money jumps"

       It is clear from inspection of the steady state conditions (16a, e)

and the equations of motion (14a, b) and (15a, b) that there is one and

only set of discrete (discontinuous) changes in the levels of the nominal

money stocks in both countries that will permit an instantaneous transition

at full employment (in both countries) to the new real long run equilibrium

associated with the unilateral reduction in the U.S. fiscal impulse dis-

cussed in Section 111.1. If df1 < 0 is the size of the U.S. fiscal

contraction, these nominal money jumps in both countries are given by

(28)     dm1 — dm2 —   —
                            df1
                                       — 24 —



       At   the predetermined price level, this nominal money jump provides

  ju8t tfie right increase in real money balances demanded as a result of

  the lower nominal (and real) world interest rate associated with the

  lower global fiscal impulse. There is no need to force the price level

  path below the nominal money stock
                                       path through a policy of demand
 deflation and unemployment. The steady state increase in real money

 balances which in a new—classical model
                                            with a non—predetermined, flex—
 ible price level would be brought about by a discrete downward jump in

 the price level path, is achieved in the Keynesian
                                                      ,   predetermined price
 level model by a stock—shift
                                open market purchase in each country which
 increases the nominal
                         money stocks by the required amounts, It is the
 stickiness of real money balances which makes a recession inevitable when

 there is any exogenous shock or policy change which raises the long—run

demand for money balances. This stickiness of the real money stock

reflects both the stickiness of domestic
                                            costs (assumed to be a policy—
and exogenous shock—invariant
                                structural property of private market
behavior), and the stickiness of
                                   monetary policy. If the level of the
nominal money stock is a choice
                                  variable at any given instant, policy
flexibility can make up for and compensate for domestic cost inflexibility.

     The great advantage of the kind of once—and—for—all nominal money

stock jumps considered here is that they don't result in any change in

the rate of inflation, short
                               run or long run. They do cause the long—run
level of the path of prices to be higher than it would otherwise have
                                      — 25 —



been, but since welfare costs are associated with the rate of inflation
rather than with the level of prices, 1/ this is no cause for concern.

The   major problem   with money jump policies is their effect on inflationary

expectations. The obvious analytical distinction between a discontinuous

discrete change in the level of the money stock path and a (finite)

change in the instantaneous rate of change of that path may not be as

obvious in practice, especially when the money stock path is sampled at

discrete time intervals: a once—and—f or—all upward level change at a

point in time in the middle of an observation interval t0 may look much

like an increase in the rate of growth between t0 and t0 + 1. If such

an apparent increase in the growth rate gets extrapolated into the

future, serious instability may result. Governments or central banks

with a reputation for monetary rectitude will be able to engineer once—

off money jumps without adverse effects on inflationary expectations.

Governments or central banks with a reputation for monetary laxness will

be prisoners of the markets' lack of confidence and may have to live with

the adverse effects on inflation expectations of any observed increase

in the money stock.

      Note that if the monetary authorities had nominal income targets

rather than monetary targets, there should be no credibility problems

associated with a once—off increase in the nominal money stock. Nominal

                                         — 26 —



  income targets are velocity—corrected monetary targets.
                                                                 They have

  desirable operating characteristics whenever exogenous shocks or policy

  changes necessitate a change in velocity.

  Changes in money growth rates

        The other monetary policy action (in both countries) that can achieve

  the transition to an improved level of U.S. competitiveness without any

 output or employment cost is an equal permanent increase in the rate of

 growth of the nominal money stock in each country. It can again be

 checked from the steady—state conditions (16a) —      (16e)   and from the

 equations of motion (14a, b) and (15a, b) that the following permanent

 increase in m1 and m2 will    achieve   an instantaneous transition at full

 employment (in both countrog) to the new real long—run equilibrium

 associated with the unilatral reduction in the U.S. fiscal impulse

 discussed in Section 111.1.

This monetary policy respcne would, by raising the rate of inflation in

both countries, prevent the global real interest rate decline result1g

from the U.S. fiscal contraction from
                                           being translated into a decline in
nominal interest rates. With nominal interest rates unchanged, there s

no increase in the demand for real money balances and consequently no

need for a recession to depress the
                                         general price level path below the

nominal money stock path. The policy has one obvious undesirable fea:re:

a recession is prevented at the cost of having a permanently higher

                    IV. Respon to a Collapse of the
                                                           U.S. Dollar
            A second question addressed   by eic policy makers and analysts is t}
       proper response (in the U.S. ndin the
                                             Row) to a sudden large fall        in
       the value of a key
                            currency, taken to be the U.S. dollar for
                                                                         concrete-
       ness in this paper. To determine
                                          the nature of the
                                                              appropriate policy
      responses, we first must determine what
                                                the causes of the sudden depre-
      ciation of the currency
                               are. There are two broad classes of possible
      causes: (a) the bursting of
                                   a speculative bubble that had caused the
      dollar to be overvalued in
                                  relation to the "fundamentals."
                                                                    (b) an actual
      or perceived change in the
                                 fundamentals driving the exchange rate. The
      latter category can be subdivided into a number of
                                                          cases. (1) a port-
     folio shift against the dollar reflecting,
                                                  say, greater uncertainty about
     the future prospects for
                               U.S. inflation. In the simple model of this
     paper, this can be represented
                                     by a reduction in U.S. liquidity
                                                                       preference:
     a fall in n1; (2) an increase in the
                                            real risk premium on foreign—oe
     U.S. assets. This could reflect fear of future increases
                                                               in taxation
     of U.S. interest income
                             and, conceivably, a greater perceived risk of
     repudiation or default. In the model this can be represented
                                                                   by an
     increase in t2—11: the real risk premium is like a net
                                                            tax on U.S. interest
    income; (3) an unexpected
                               increase in the level of the
                                                            U.S. money stock
    or in the rate of U.S.
                            monetary growth; (4) an unexpected tightening of
    the U.S. fiscal Stance.

         All four events should be thought of in relative terms,
                                                                 e.g., the
    portfolio shift against the dollar reflects an increase
                                                            in uncertainty
    about u.s. inflation relative
                                  to uncertainty about inflation in the rest

      the world. Similarly, it is looser U.S. monetary policy relative to

 monetary policy elsewhere or tighter U.S. fiscal policy relative to
                                                                             I
 fiscal policy elsewhere that puts downward pressure on the dollar.

       An important issue in determining the appropriate policy response

to a sudden drop of the dollar in response to a change in private sector

perceptions concerning the likely future course of the fundamentals, is

whether the national authorities and the international coordinating agency

share these new perceptions. A different approach will in general be

called for if the authorities believe they have information superior to

that used by private agents in forming expectations, but there is no way

of sharing this information with private market participants or of con—

vincirig them of its relevance. In what follows, no superior public sector

information is assumed.

1.     A bursting bubble

       It is well—known that the solution of rational expectations models

with forward—looking, non—predetermined state variables (such as the

nominal and the real exchange rate in our model) may be characterized by

a bubble; that is, the behavior of the endogenous variables may be

influenced by variables that matter only because, somehow, private agents

believe that they matter. These bubble processes, which affect expec-

tations in a self—validating nanner, may be functions of the fundamental

variables (i.e. those variabl,s that enter into the structure of the

model other than merely by being part of the information set used to form
I                                        — 29 —



     expectations)    or of completely extraneous or spurious variables of the

     "sunspdt" variety (Blanchard (79); Azariadis [1981], Obstfeld and Rogoff

     [1983]). In Figure 5, it is assumed that all "fundamentalg have con-

     stant values, now and in the future, that the steady state equili-

     brium corresponding to these constant values for the fundamentals is E0

     and that the associated convergent saddle path is S0S0. Suppose, without

     loss of generality, that the predetermined variable is at its steady—state

     value £.   The non—predetermined variable, c, however, is on a bubble

     path EE which overvalues it relative to the path warranted by the fun-

     damentals (S0S0). Its value at to, the time the bubble bursts is

    The bursting of the bubble moves c instantaneously to its fundamental

    value c*. In a rational world, there must be uncertainty about the

    direction of the discrete jump in the exchange rate at to. The instan-

    taneous discrete upward jump in c and e would, if it were anticipated

    with certainty, promise an infinite rate of return to shorting the dollar

    the instant before to. There could however be a set of beliefs which at

    to, attaches some probability I1, to a return to the fundamental value

    (c c*_c0) and some probability 1 —      "   to a further discrete

    downward jump in c to c1 which puts the exchange rate on a bubble path

    even further removed from its fundamental value. Provided 1I0(c* —

  thing   to do for policymakers when a bubble bursts is to sit back and

 enjoy the sight. While we don't have a well—developed theory of the

 welfare economics of speculative bubbles in a world with uncertainty,

 limited and asymmetrically distributed (insider/outsider) information,

 there is a strong presumption that they are costly and harmful as well as

 unsustainable. It may be that the fundamental valuation to which the

      exchange rate returns when the bubble
                                              bursts, itself represents an
      unattractive equilibrium because the
                                             fundamentals (especially current and
   anticipated future policy) are in a mess. That, however, is an
                                                                   argument
   for doing something about the fundamentals, when the exchange rate
                                                                      once
  again reflects those fundamentals,
                                      which would have been desirable even
  if there had been no bubble
                              and no sudden drop in the exchange value of
  the dollar.

          In reality, the ending of a speculative bubble is likely to be

  associated both with major
                             redistribution9 of wealth and with short—term
  disruption of financial markets,
                                   commerce and production because of bank-
  ruptcies and insolvencies. Morze of
                                         these adjustment costs are included
 in our formal model. I would
                                   be surprised, nevertheless, if it could be
 shown that it is better to
                           er a bubble with a slow puncture than with a
 quick burst. A hard landing
                                the dollar under these circumstances does
 not preclude a soft landing f:
                                     the world economy. No policy response in
 the U.S. or in the ROW seems cessary.

short—run lower nominal and real interest rates and because of the
improvement in competitiveness. Average world economic activity also

rises (ya increases) because of the short—run downward pressure on

nominal and real interest rates. Activity levels in the ROW are,

however, depressed, as the loss of competitiveness outweighs the effect

of lower interest rates. If the initial equilibrium was deemed satis-

factory, the obvious policy response to the fall in liquidity preference

is a matching once—off reduction in the level of the U.S. nominal money

stock. This woud leave all real and nominal variables (other than ti)

unchanged.

     If the shift out of U.S. ney represents stock—shift currency

substitution and has as its counterpart a matching stock—shift increase

in foreign money demand r2, the change in competitiveness will be twice

as large. Average real world activity (ya, ia, a and ra) are unchanged

in the short run and in the long run. The behavior of c and td is like

that illustrated in the top diagram of Figure 6, but with a Bhift up and

to the left of the saddlepath that is twice as large. The U.S. experiences

a transitional boom that is matched by a transitional slump in the ROW.

The obvious way to neutralize this once—off currency substitution and

stabilize the exchange rate is to contract the U.S. money stock by —n

and expand the ROW money stock by 2• Such monetary policy changes in

addition may well have favorable effects (not formally modelled here) on

the relative changes in inflation uncertainty that may have prompted the

money demand shifts in the first place.

 experiences
             an itmnediate jump—depreciation of the nominal and real
 exchange rate from E0 to E01.
      Note that the real exchange
                                      rate overshoots its long run equilibrju
 value. After the initial jump there is a gradual depreciation of
                                                                  the

a net real depreciatjon relative
                                 to the initial one. The U.S. economy
experiences a transitory boom which lowers its real stock of
                                                                  money bal-
ances. The     ROW   goes through a transitory slump which raises its real
money balances.

     One possible policy
                             response that exactly neutralizes this increase
in the U.S. foreign investment
                                   risk premium is an equal increase
                                                                 in 11— 12,
the excess of the U.S. tax rate on interest income accruing from
                                                                 abroad
over the ROW's tax rate on interest
                                        income accruing from the United States.
This would restore the initial
                                   equilibrium immediately. Alternatively, a

 in the risk premium and a reduction in the U.S. nominal money stock by

 the same magnitude, would instantaneously achieve the same long—run change

 in the real equilibrium shown in Figure 7, without any transitional U.S.

 inflation and ROW contraction. A permanent increase in the U.S. 's rate

 of monetary growth and an equal reduction in the ROW's rate of monetary

 growth with din1 — din2   dmd — —d(risk
                                         premium) would, in Figure 7, move

 the economy immediately from E0 to E01, which would now be the new long—run

equilibrium.

Policy—induced exchange rate collapses

      The response of the exchange rate to changes in fiscal and monetary

policy in the United States and ROW has already been discussed in Sec-

tion III. The only point worth repeating here is that a Thard landing"

for the U.S. dollar need not represent a hard landing for the U.S. economy

or for the ROW. If the initial situation is one characterized by current

and anticipated future lax U.S. fiscal policy and tight U.S. monetary

policy, these fundamentals are likely to be reflected in a strong (an

'overvalued") U.S. real exchange rate. The first—best cooperative, coordi-

nated global policy package to change this unfavorable equilibrium (fiscal

contraction in the U.S., once—off monety stock increases in the U.S. and

the ROW to meet the resulting fall in velocity) is accompanied by a dollar

"collapse." It may seem paradoxical that the restoration of confidence

in the ability of the U.S. to get and keep its budget under control,

 would be accompanied by a fall in the U.S. dollar, but such a view

 reflects the mistaken identification of the exchange rate as an

 index of national economic macho.


       V. Policy Responses to a Slowdown in Global Economic Activity

     The first question that needs to be answered before one can deter-

mine the appropriate U.S. and ROW policy responses to a global economic

 slowdown concerns the cause(s) of this slowdown. A distinction imst be

made between a slowdown resulting from an adverse supply—side shock

 (modeled   in our simple model by a temporary or permanent fall in y     or
Y2) and a demand—induced slowdown. Amont the latter we can again dis-
tinguish adverse money demand shocks (increases in T1 and n2) and reduc-
tions in private U.S. or ROW demand for goods and services (which can be
represented   as reductions in f1 or f2).

Adverse supply—side developments

     Permanent reductions in productive capacity in the U.S. and the ROW

raise the long—run real interest rate everywhere and thus bring demand

down in line with supply. Nominal interest rates will also rise if money

growth rates are unaffected and, both through real income and interest

rate effects, the demand for real money balances in both regions will

decline in the long run.     If productive capacity is affected equally   in

both countries        —
                          y2 — ) there is no long—run change in 1d or     on c.

In this case, as shown in Figure 8, the world economy undergoes a bout of

excess demand and inflation in excess of the rate of    monetary growth
                                         — 36 —



   (affecting both regions equally) which in the long run lowers the
                                                                     long—
   run stcck of money balances.
                                 In the very short run, output (which is

   demand—detefled) actually rises because higher inflation
                                                            reduces the
   real interest rate (nominal
                                  interest rates rise less than one—for—one
  with the rate of inflation
                                because the LM curve is not vertical).

         The policy response that
                                prevents the emergence of excess demand and
  inflationary pressures during the transition to the lower levels
                                                                   of
  capacity Output, involves a contraction of demand which
                                                          can be achieved
  either by fiscal or
                      monetary means (or by a combination of
                                                                 the two). If
 no long—run change in competitiveness is desired,
                                                   any fiscal contraction
 should be equal in the
                        two countries. Probably the simplest coordinated
 policy action that achieves the
                                 new long—run equilibrju at E1 in Figure 8

 immediately, is a reduction in
                                    m1 and in m2 equal to (k +

      If the Common
                      capac1t decline at t0 is expected
                                                          to be temporary and
 to be reversed at
                     t1, there is still no action in a_id

 diagram in Figure   8). The   world economy experiences a bout of excess
demand   betweent0 and t1 (moving from E01 to E02) and a bout of excess
 supply after t1 (between
                           E03 and Eo). The same reduction in
                                                               m1 and in

where it will stay until
                           t. At t1 both nominal money stocks should be
increased again by the
                        sane percentage by which they were reduced at
in order to achieve a painless and instantaneous
                                                  restoration of full
equilibrj at E1.

     An adverse permanent supply shock in the United States alone, say,

would cause a long—run worsening of the U.S. competitiveness (required to

choke off global demand for U.S. output), some increase in global real

and nominal interest rates (but less than with a coon decline in capacity

output), a decline in U.S. real money balances and a smaller decline in

ROW real money balances. On impact, there is likely to be a step appreci-

ation of the dollar. After that the real exchange rate continues to appre-

ciate gradually towards its new long—run equilibrium. Real interest

rates in the United States will be below those in the ROW during the

transition. A reduction in the U.S. nominal money stock by an amount


     (k +


and an increase in the ROW nominal money stock by

     —
            I
will permit an instantaneous transition to the new real long—run equili-

brium with lower values of c, 1d, and 1a, avoiding the transitory infla-

tion in the United States and the transitory contraction in the ROW that

would otherwise occur.

A demand—induced slowdown in economic activity

    When the cause of a disappointing level of economic activity is a

decline in some component of private demand, appropriately designed

demand management can minimize the damage and, in the present model, can

be used to avoid it altogether. Increases in private liquidity preference
                                         — 38 —



   (n1 and n2) can be met with
                                  corresponding once—off increases in the
   levels of the nominal
                            money stocks——rn1 and m2. A downward shift in the
   private consumption functions or a collapse of animal spirits
                                                                 can be
  offset directly by corresponding fiscal stimuli fj and
                                                          f2. If the balanced
  budget multiplier theorem
                            retains some validity, these fiscal stimuli can
  be provided without
                      increasing the deficit. Supply—side
                                                            consequences
  from the tax increase
                        or transfer payments cuts involved in a balanced—
  budget expansion should of course be taken into account (the
                                                                   behavioral
  links, ignored in this paper, between fj
                                              and   yj).
      Note   that it is never
                                necessary, in response to any shock, to engineer
 a permanent change in
                          monetary growth rates. Once—off changes in the
 levels of the nominal
                          money stocks (or temporary changes in
                                                                  money growth
 rates) are sufficient.



                                 VI. Conclusion
      This paper presents
                           a rather old—fashioned study of demand management
 in an open, interdepender-
                             economic system. Three contingencies discussed
 in the September 1985
                       WorL Economic Outlook
                                               were analyzed using an
 eclectic, short—run Keynee
                             n, long—run classical, two—country model.
The main conclusion is tha n active
                                       monetary and/or fiscal response in
both countries or regions s in general required
                                                   to minimize the costs
associated with the adjustment
                                process resulting from a variety of demand—side
or Supply—side shocks. One
                                exception to this rule is the case of a currency
collapse resulting from the bursting of an exchange market
                                                           speculative bubble.
   A unilateral U.S. fiscal contradition
                                           will cause a temporary slowdown of
  world economic activity as well as a sudden drop in the nominal and

  real value of the dollar. Merely
                                      preventing the nominal exchange
  rate from changing does not reduce the magnitude of the global recession

  or alter the long—run real adjustment that takes place, but it would

  redistribute the unchanged global unemployment and excess capacity

  burden towards the United States
                                     and away from the ROW. A no—response
  policy would be consistent with the
                                        achievement of improved U.S.

  competitiveness at full employment if the initial situation were

 characterized not only by a U.S. fiscal-monetary policy mix that

 is biased towards fiscal
                           expansion and monetary tightness, resulting
 in a poor U.S. international
                              competitive position, but also by global
 excess demand. An expansionary fiscal
                                           move in the ROW or a combined

 expansionary monetary policy move in both the United States and the
 ROW or a combined expansionary
                                  monetary policy move in both the United
States and the ROW could achieve
                                    tbe desired traverse to a better
level of U.S. competitveness without
                                        a global slump. These monetary
stimuli need not be permanent increases in the rate of
                                                       money growth.
Once—off credible open market
                                purchases raising the levels of the
nominal money stocks suffice.

     The stabilizing policy response to a sudden drop in the value of the

dollar depends crucially on the reason(s) for this drop. The
                                                             bursting of a
speculative bubble has no Obvious monetary or fiscal policy implication.

Downward pressure on the value of
                                    the dollar resulting from a once-off
fall in U.S. liquidity preference
                                    calls for a matching once-off reduction
in the U.S. nominal money stock. Direct currency substitution
                                                                 away from

    the dollar calls for
                         open market sales in the United States
                                                                and open
   market purchases in the ROW.
                                    The consequences of the emergence of a real
   risk premium on the
                         return from foreign investment in the United States
   can be neutralized by a matching increase in the difference
                                                                    between the
   U.S. tax rate on interest
                               income from the ROW and the ROW's tax rate on
   Interest income from the United States. Alternatively,
                                                               one might accept
   the depreciai of the nominal and real U.S.
                                              exchange rates but avoid
   the transitional u.s. inflation and ROW contraction
                                                           by expanding the
  money stock in the ROW and
                                reducing it in the United States.
       The stabilizing
                         policy response to a Slowdown
                                                          in global economic
  activity depends on whether
                                 this slowdown reflects
                                                          a deterioration of the
  supply side or deficient
                             aggreagte demand. To avoid
                                                            the stagflatjo that
  would othejse result from a global adverse
                                                    supply shock, demandreducing
 measures are called for in
                               both countries. If the supply shock is
 temporary, the restrictive
                               measures can be reversed
                                                          when capacity output
 recovers, thus maintaining
                               caDacity output. The
                                                       stabilizing response to a fall
 in private demand
                     for goods md services is a fiscal
                                                           stimulus. The contrac_
 tionary effects of an increase in liquidity
                                                 preference can be avoided
                                                                              by
an accomodating
                  (non_inflationary) increase in the level of the
                                                                  money stock.
     The fiscal stimuli discussed in this
                                          paper are to be interpreted as
"discretionary" changes over and above the automatic
                                                          changes in tax

     To provide truly satisfactory answers to the questions raised in the

WEO tM model of this paper would have to be extended in a number of

directions. The WEO approaches the macroeconomic issues of the indus-

trialized world in a three—region setting: the United States; Europe;

and Japan plus Canada. The complexity entailed in going to three regions

virtually obliges one to use numerical rather than analytical methods.

The model of this paper ignores all stock—flow asset dynamics, those

coming from the government budget identities, those coming from the

current account of the balance of payments, and those resulting from real

capital accumulation. 1/ Again, their incorporation requires the use of

numerical methods. Finally, it would be extremely desirable to allow

explicitly for uncertainty. Adding some linear stochastic processes with

known coefficients to the deterministic model is feasible but does not

constitute much of an advance. Anything more complicated, even linear

models with stochastic coefficients, let alone non—linear stochastic

models, means that we enter the mathematical or computational stratosphere.

The modelling language we would like to use just does not exist yet.

     The logic of the model used in this paper, and indeed of any model

that permits persistent disequilibrium or non—Walrasian equilibrium is

that monetary and fiscal policy instruments can be used actively to

stabilize output, employment, and the price level in response to a whole

  must be made for the
                         technical, political or institutional

  of an active stabilization
                               policy.
       The technical
                     impossibility of stabilization policy has been argued
  on two grounds. There is the
                                                            argument that
  in properly specified
                        macroeconomic models, only unperceived or unantici-
 pated monetary policy can affect the deviations of
                                                    actual real variables
 from their "natural"
                      or full tnformtjon values.
                                                   Fiscal policy Obviously
 has allocative effects
                        both in the short run and
                                                  in the long run, but it
 too cannot systematically
                           affect the deviation of real output and employ-
 ment from their capacity, fu.L].
                                employment, or natural levels. If debt
 neutrality prevails, the sub±tutjon
                                       of lump—gum taxes for current
 borrowing has no real effects
                               in the short run or in the
                                                          long run. These
 policy ineffectiveness proposjjons for a while engaged
                                                         the interest of a
sign1fica part of the
                          macroeconomics profession but are now generally
viewed as theoretical
                       curlosa without empirical relevance.
     The second technical
                           argunt against the active use of stabilization
policy is much older (it
                          goes back at least to Milton
                                                       Friedman's work in
the fifties and sixties) but more relevant.
                                                  It is a generaljza0   of

   against active     countercyclical use of monetary
                                                        policy.   Clearly, the
   length cf   the   lag between the policy
                                              response and its impact   on the
   variable(s) of interest (the
                                   "Outside" lag) is irrelevant per se. It
   is uncertainty about the
                               coefficients in the model, about
                                                             the order of
  the lags and indeed about the total specification
                                                    of the appropriate
  model of the economy, that
                             forces one to qualify the

                                 the manipulation of models such as the
  one in this paper. The
                             length of the "inside lag,"
                                                            the lag between the
  identification of the need
                                to respond and the moment the policy handle
  can finally be cranked, puts further constraints
                                                        on our ability to sta-
  bilize the economy
                        through active demand management.
                                                             Estimates   of the
  inside lag" for U.S. fiscal
                                  policy range from a few years to infinity.
      It should be
                       recognized that uncertainty about
                                                           the way in which the
 economy works not only renders the
                                       consequences of policy activism harder
 to predict. It also
                      increases uncertainty about the sequences of
 refraining from policy activism and sticking to
                                                 preannounced, unconditional
 (non—contingent or open—loop) rules. It seems
                                                highly unlikely that a
cautioug, safety—fjt policy of hedging one's bets in the face
                                                              of great
uncertainty would ever involve the
                                      economic equivalent of locking the
Steering wheel and closing one's
                                    eyes.
     The political or institutional case against
                                                 active demand management
in part relies on alleged observed asymetrje
                                               or irreversibilities in
monetary and fiscal policy design.

  macroecononjc    policy rules for the world economic community, to argue for
  their.adoptlon   with any chance   of even partial   success and to monitor
  compliance and performance. !/

      The global macroeconomic policy recommendations of the current WEO

 can be summarized as:     (1.) adherence to unconditional medium—term
                                                                         monetary
 growth targets; (2) continued downward pressure on structural fiscal

 deficits; and (3) limited counter—cyclical responsiveness of actual

 deficits reflecting the partial operation of the automatic fiscal stabi-

 lizers. Such a policy package will
                                         not prevent a global recession if and
 when the United States tightens its
                                        budgetary stance. It is not even
 sufficient to prevent the slowdown that appears to be underway already.

The risks associated with this
                                  strategy are very high. Even in the
current state of the arts it is not impossible to design a more flexible

and superior set of policy recoiendatjons. Not for the first (or the

last) time, caution demands if not
                                       action, then certainly being prepared
for action should the need arise.




  !/ The human and material resources devoted to the Study and manage-
ment of the world economy as a whole at the IMP (i.e., to "surveillance
with teeth") are currently very limited, both absolutely and relative to
the resources devoted to individual country stabilization programs.
