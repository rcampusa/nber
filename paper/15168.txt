                                             ABSTRACT

Past research on the health workforce can be structured into three perspectives – “health workforce
planning” (1960 through 1970s); “the health worker as economic actor” (1980s through 1990s); and
“the health worker as necessary resource” (1990s through 2000s). During the first phase, shortages
of health workers in developed countries triggered the development of four approaches to project future
health worker requirements. We discuss each approach and show that modified versions are experiencing
a resurgence in current studies estimating health worker requirements to meet population health goals,
such as the United Nations’ health-related Millennium Development Goals. A perceived “cost explosion”
in many health systems shifted the focus to the study of the effect of health workers’ behavior on health
system efficiency during the second phase. We review the literature on one example topic: health
worker licensure. In the last phase, regional health worker shortages in developing countries and local
shortages in developed countries led to research on international health worker migration and programs
to increase the supply of health workers in underserved areas. Based on our review of existing studies,
we suggest areas for future research on the health workforce, including the transfer of existing approaches
from developed to developing countries.

I. Introduction

“People deliver health” (Joint Learning Initiative, 2004). The health workforce, i.e., the
people who are “primarily engaged in action with the primary intent of enhancing health”
(WHO, 2006b), diagnose illnesses, heal, care for people, monitor health outcomes, support
treatment adherence, provide medical information and prevent diseases. The importance of
health workers as decision makers and service providers in health systems is obvious. It is
matched by their impact on health spending. WHO estimates that across countries worldwide
about 50% of total public and private health expenditure (including capital costs) is spent on
health worker wages, salaries and allowances (Hernandez, Dräger, Evans, Tan-Torres Edejer,
& Dal Poz, 2006).1 In addition, health workers are indirectly responsible for a large
proportion of recurrent spending on health care through drug prescription, hospital
admissions and other resource use in providing diagnostic, therapeutic and palliative services.

In the following, we review the health economics and health systems literature on the health
workforce. We organize the review according to three perspectives on health workers, which
correspond roughly to chronological phases of academic publication: health workforce
planning (1960s and 1970s), the health worker as economic actor (1980s and 1990s), and the
health worker as necessary resource (1990s and 2000s).

A major research focus of studies on the health care workforce in the 1960s and 1970s was
on models to predict future health staffing needs. This research was triggered by shortages of
specific types of health workers in developed countries and by reports from socialist
countries that health manpower planning can aid health policy makers in ensuring an
adequate supply of health workers. Planning models developed in this phase continue to be
applied today both in developed and developing countries.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the research focus shifted to the study of health workers’ effect on
allocative and technical efficiency in health systems. Research in this phase was motivated
by the perception of rising health expenditures in developed countries and the belief that
health workers do not always act in their patients’ best interest. Many of the important

  Hernandez and colleagues identified data from 29 countries in Europe, 7 countries in the Americas, 4 countries
in the Western Pacific region, 2 countries in Africa, and 1 country in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is thus
possible that the true average across all countries worldwide substantially differs from this estimate. Saltman
and Von Otter estimated that 65% to 80% of recurrent health expenditure is spent on health worker
remuneration (Saltman & Von Otter, 1995); for Africa, Huddart and Picazo estimated this proportion to lie
between 50% and 70% (Huddart & Picazo, 2003).

                                                       3
research topics in this phase are covered in other chapters of the handbook, including agency
(chapter 26), provider payment and incentives (chapter 27), competition among providers
(chapter 29), performance and productivity (chapters 30 and 31), and medical decision-
making (chapter 33). In this chapter, we review the literature on one research theme in this
phase that is not discussed in detail elsewhere in this book (health worker licensure).

Starting in the 1990s and continuing in this decade, health workers became increasingly
viewed as a resource that is necessary to achieve population health goals. In many
geographical areas, health policies could not be implemented because health workers were
lacking. In developed countries, essential health care could not be delivered in rural and
remote areas because the human resources for such delivery were not available. In
developing countries, it became apparent that population health goals – such as the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to “reduce child mortality”, “improve maternal
health”, and “combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases” (United Nations, 2009) could
not be attained unless the sizes of many national health workforces were dramatically
increased. As major themes in this phase, we review the research on programs to increase the
supply of health workers to underserved areas in developed countries and studies measuring
and analyzing international health worker migration.

Table 1 provides an overview of the three perspectives on health workers. In separate
subchapters below, we describe the health policy backgrounds that gave rise to each of the
perspectives and then review relevant literature. The three perspectives are of course highly
stylized; the backgrounds are reductionist descriptions of much richer policy contexts; and
the periods overlap. However, the perspectives serve useful purposes in this subchapter in
framing past research, structuring our exposition, and laying out a research agenda on the
health workforce for coming years.

II.    First phase: Health workforce planning

II.1 Background

Three historical backgrounds gave rise to health workforce planning studies in the 1960s and
1970s. First, in the two decades many developed and developing countries experienced
shortages of health workers, such as nurses (Aurousseau, 1971; Baaij, 1961; Boval, 1966;
Bureau, 1960; Charokopou, 1966; "[Finland has a nursing shortage]," 1973; Hale, 1964;
Hanada, 1968; Harer, 1965; Nevo, 1972; "The nursing shortage," 1967; Petursdottir, 1970;
Salling, 1978; Shambaugh, 1965; Sorensen, 1974; Stokes, 1970; "[Suggestion for alleviation
of nursing shortage in Tokyo]," 1971; Voval, 1966; Wallace, 1964), midwives (Aoki, 1968;
Burslem, 1979; Hirosawa, 1968; Keto, 1971; Munch, 1973; Valvanne, 1971), physicians in
general (Coffey, 1961; Cohen, 1968; Engel, 1964; Estes, 1968; Flynn, 1973; A. L. Frank,
1971; Gerber, 1967; Ginzberg, 1966; Guerra, 1965; Kadaner, 1965; "The medical manpower
shortage," 1971; Nevanlinna, 1966; O'Flanagan, 1972; Portes, 1966; Sriratanaban, 1974;
"Village, household distribution of contraceptives helps Asian nations overcome doctor
shortage," 1976; "WHO assistance to meet critical shortage of health personnel training for
doctors, nurses and health workers," 1966), certain types of physicians (C. P. Cooper, 1973;
Ganguli, 1977; Hargreaves, 1969; Jarvis, 1977; Keen & Thambiran, 1971; Knesper, 1978;
Pardes, 1979; Sandison, 1979; "Shortage of anaesthetists," 1977; "Shortage of radiologists,"
1966; Wyatt & Cross, 1966), dentists (G. A. Holmes, 1967; Holzinger, 1966; Maleh, 1966;
Mehta, 1968; Rogers, 1972; Tateishi, Takeuchi, Tanabe, Yasuu, & Sakakibara, 1971),
paramedical personnel (Jaffurs, 1972; Smith, 1968), pharmacists (Kuyvenhoven, 1960;
Ogunyemi, 1971), physical therapists (LaViolette, 1979; Millward, 1961), or laboratory
technicians (Oakley, 1964; Trinkler, 1966). These shortages demonstrated the insufficiency
of existing systems to ensure adequate health worker supplies and led to the conclusion that
“[h]ealth manpower is not a commodity whose production can be left to the imperfect
functioning of laissez-faire market mechanisms” (Hall & Mejia, 1978).

Second, reports from socialist countries, such as the USSR, asserted that health manpower
planning could produce valid projections of future health workforce requirements, aiding
policy makers in designing workforce policies to ensure sufficient supplies of health workers
(Daniels, 1974; Popov, 1971). Third, WHO identified a number of technical difficulties that
policy makers would inevitably face in ensuring adequate future supplies of health workers
both in developing and developed countries (Hall & Mejia, 1978).

                                              6
“Manpower requires the longest preparatory period of all the health resources and cannot be
improvised. It is also subject to a certain inherent inertia, in that the rigidity of the health and
education systems and the attitudes of health workers do not make for easy mobility or
conduce to improving geographical and occupational distribution. Nor can manpower be
stored or discarded. If it is to be available at the proper time, it has to be planned for in
advance in the right amount and type – no more and no less than is needed. Because they are
subject to obsolescence, manpower abilities and skills also need to be maintained by means
of permanent supervision and continuing education.”

WHO advocated health workforce planning as a method of ensuring a sufficient supply of
health workers despite these difficulties. Initially, WHO had defined health workforce
planning as “the process of estimating the number of persons and the kind of knowledge,
skills, and attitudes they need to achieve predetermined health targets and ultimately health
status objectives” (Hornby, Mejia, Ray, & Simeonov, 1976). The organization envisioned
that health workforce planners would calculate future health worker requirements through
mathematical modeling, using detailed data on population projections, disease burdens,
health services, and capacities of health care facilities and education institutions. The
planners would prepare several health workforce scenarios and present them to policy
makers, who, in turn, would select the best option for implementation. However, WHO soon
came to realize that health policy-making did not follow this rational model.

“What are the lessons to be learned from experience with manpower planning? Such
planning is now more concerned with the actual decision-making process and implementation
of decisions than with manipulation of numbers in forecasting demand and supply …
Planning efforts are unlikely to be effective if due account is not take of the social, economic,
and – most important – the political milieu in which they take place” (Hornby et al., 1976).

“[M]anpower studies or reports of commissions, however, sophisticated, do not necessarily
lead to the development, much less to the implementation of a plan, or to an integrated
process of health manpower development unless the necessary social, economic, and political
conditions and a definite national political will are present” (Hall & Mejia, 1978).

“In a word, the health manpower planning process came to be recognized in WHO, as it was
in countries, as being more political and social than mathematical” (Fülöp & Roemer, 1982).




                                                 7
The 1978 WHO report Health Manpower Planning: Principles, Methods, Issues (Hall &
Mejia, 1978) thus broadened the objectives of planning to include implementation plans and
communication strategies and emphasized the importance of the “political dimension”,
“leadership readiness for and commitment to change”, “enabling legislation for planning and
subsequent plan implementation”, and “administrative capacity and willingness to implement
the plan” (Hall & Mejia, 1978).


II.2 Literature

While the focus of health workforce planning thus moved away from mathematical modeling
towards management and policy-making, the initial emphasis on estimation led to the
development of the four main approaches – still used today2 – to plan national or regional
health workforce requirements: the need, demand, service targets, and population ratio
approach (see Table 2 for an overview). The approaches differ in their scientific stance,
which, in turn, determines the type of information that is taken into account in the planning
effort. The need approach takes a normative stance. Experts use epidemiological
information to estimate the future occurrence of disease cases in a population. The number
and types of health workers necessary to provide the services to adequately treat all disease
cases are then calculated, using information on the amount of health worker time required to
provide certain services. In contrast, the demand approach takes a positive stance. Future
demand for health services is predicted from current demand by assuming that the
relationships between demand and its determinants (such as population size and income) will
remain unchanged while the level of the determinants changes. Predicted health service
demand is then translated into human resource requirements.

The service targets approach usually takes a normative stance but, unlike the need approach,
allows for constraints to the provision of health care in calculating future service
requirements. Such constraints include health care capacity and technology on the supply
side and ability and willingness to pay for health care on the demand side. Finally, the
population ratio approach can either take a normative or a positive stance. Future health
worker requirements are predicted using population growth predictions and health worker-to-
population ratios derived from studies or deliberations among policy makers.

2
 These approaches are defined well in the 1978 WHO book on health manpower planning by Hall and Mejia
(Hall & Mejia, 1978). More recent reviews used similar categorizations of planning approaches (Dreesch,
Dolea, Dal Poz, Goubarev, Adams, Aregawi et al., 2005; Markham & Birch, 1997; Murphy, 2002; O'Brien-
Pallas, Baumann, Donner, Murphy, Lochhaas-Gerlach, & Luba, 2001).

                                                    8
The need, demand, and service targets approach require the calculation of health services
requirements as a step preceding the estimation of health worker requirements. Since the
need and the service targets approach are normative, they are likely to stimulate the study of
health worker productivity, such as analyses of the types and combinations of health workers
that can produce desired numbers of health services most efficiently. In contrast, the demand
approach does not motivate the study of health worker productivity, because it takes current
modes of health services delivery as given, and the population ratio approach does not require
a translation of health services into health human resources requirements and thus adds little
information to the study of health worker productivity.

The difference between projected health worker requirements and the current supply of health
workers is likely to be largest if the need approach is used for projection because – unlike the
other approaches – the need approach neither takes account of a country’s current level of
health care provision nor considers a country’s capacity to deliver health care. As a result, in
many developing countries the needed number of health workers substantially exceeds the
current supply of health workers (Joint Learning Initiative, 2004; WHO, 2006b). In contrast,
in developed countries the needed health worker numbers may be significantly lower than the
number of currently available workers, either because health service demand exceeds need or
a country has produced more health workers than necessary to satisfy either need or demand
(R. A. Cooper, 2004; R. A. Cooper, Getzen, & Laud, 2003).3

Both the need and the service targets approach require that health policy makers can
effectively control the health care sector in order to ensure that the health workers in a
country do indeed provide the services that have been determined to be needed and do not
provide unneeded services demanded by consumers. In contrast, as Hall and Mejia write,
studies following the demand approach “have the greatest applicability in countries … in
which the government plays a relatively passive role in relation to health sector development
and hence is more concerned with anticipating than shaping the future” (Hall & Mejia, 1978).




3
 Two general observations explain why health worker need and status quo are likely to differ in opposite
directions in developing and developed countries. First, health care need decreases with income (Deaton, 2003;
Riley, 2001). Second, the supply and utilization of health workers increases with income (R. A. Cooper et al.,
2003).

  First approach to estimating health workforce requirements: need

  A good example of an analysis following the need approach to estimating health workforce
  requirements is a 1972 study by Schönfeld, Heston and Falk calculating the numbers of
  physicians required for primary medical care in the United States (US) (Schönfeld, Heston, &
  Falk, 1972). Schönfeld and colleagues used data from the National Center for Health
  Statistics to predict the annual numbers of cases of different diseases requiring attention by
  two categories of primary care physicians (pediatricians and internists). They then calculated
  4
      Sources: (Dreesch et al., 2005; Hall & Mejia, 1978; Murphy, 2002).

                                                           10
the total number of pediatrician and internist hours needed to adequately treat all disease
cases using treatment norms based on health worker opinion.

“For this specific study, the basic clinical data for number of services and time per unit of
service have been accumulated from 617 interviews with physicians, expressing the
judgments of 24 pediatricians and 55 internists regarding what should be done to provide
good care in each of 80 diseases occurring in children and 170 diseases of adults” (Schönfeld
et al., 1972).

Finally, in order to estimate health worker need, the authors divided the total pediatrician
hours required in one year by the average number of hours a pediatrician works per year
(2,227 in the period 1965 to 1967) and the total internist hours by the average number of
hours an internist works per year (2,198). The study concluded that 133 primary care
physicians were needed per 100,000 persons, while only about half that number were
available at the time (Schönfeld et al., 1972).

Other applications of the need to approach to estimating health worker requirements in the
US include the Lee-Jones report of 1933 (Lee & Jones, 1933) and the “adjusted needs-based
model” developed by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee
(GMENAC) of 1980 (Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee
(GMENAC), 1980). In the period 1960-1980, the need approach to estimating health worker
requirements was further applied in the USSR (Minstriy of Health, 1967), in Latin America
(Center for Development Studies (CENDES), 1965), and in Sri Lanka (Hall & Mejia, 1978).
A recent example of a study following the need approach is an analysis by Birch and
colleagues who estimated the need for registered nurses in the Atlantic Region of Canada
(Birch, Kephart, Tomblin-Murphy, O'Brien-Pallas, Alder, & MacKenzie, 2007).

The need approach is appealing to health workers because it is clearly rooted in the sciences
of epidemiology and medicine and its underlying ethic of health care is often embraced by
the health care professions (Bodenheimer & Grumbach, 2002; Cookson & Dolan, 2000) –
health care should be provided according to need and independently of other characteristics
of individual patients . However, the approach has been criticized on conceptual and
practical grounds. Conceptually, as Klarman (1969) points out, “[w]hether need is a
desirable standard hinges on society’s willingness to accord an absolute priority to health
services, regardless of cost” (Klarman, 1969). Some modifications of the need approach take
this criticism into account. In some studies, only those diseases whose treatments met certain

                                                  11
cost-benefit criteria were taken into account in planning (Hall & Mejia, 1978). Practically,
the morbidity data for need projection may not be available in many countries or may be
measured with considerable uncertainty. In addition, the need approach may not be robust
across geographical areas, practice settings, or time periods. For instance, Schönfeld, Heston,
and Falk cautioned against generalization of their study findings because

“the interviewed physicians of this study are mainly in solo or limited partnership practice in
one geographical area (New Haven, Connecticut), and their opinions apply to only one point
in time – the present. It may therefore be necessary to have these current views and the
derivative standards of what constitutes good care reviewed by physicians in other parts of
the country and in other types of practices” (Schönfeld et al., 1972).

The results from the GMENAC study could not be replicated in a later study when treatment
norms were developed through analysis of visit records in three large health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) or by a Delphi panel of pediatricians belonging to the three HMOS
instead of by the national panel of pediatricians used in the original study (Weiner,
Steinwachs, Shapiro, Coltin, Ershoff, & Connor, 1987). The analyses of visit records
obtained from the HMOs Maxicare, Med Centers Health Plan, and Harvard Community
Health Plan yielded estimated numbers of pediatricians that were 59%, 84%, and 92% of the
GMENAC estimate, respectively. The Delphi panel of pediatricians from these three HMOs
yielded estimated numbers that were 39%, 48%, and 33% of the GMENAC estimate,
respectively.

Moreover, even if data and methods allowed valid estimation of health worker requirements
according to health need and a country had sufficient resources and the political will to
provide all the required health workers, it would be unlikely that health care would be
provided exactly according to policy plans. Patients may not demand needed health services
and may demand unneeded ones; health workers may not supply needed services and may
supply unneeded ones (Murphy, 2002). Finally, since the treatment norms used in the need
approach are based on current medical practice, the approach may inhibit innovation in the
delivery of health care. In many cases, current medical practice may be replaced by
alternative means of delivery, e.g., by substituting one type of health worker with another or
by increasing the use of medical information technology.

In sum, the need approach may only be feasible in situations where detailed data on disease
prevalence and incidence are available, the health sector can draw on adequate resources to

                                               12
fund needed health workers, and the strength of sectoral control is such that it can be assured
that most utilized health care is needed. In such settings, health policy makers should
undertake careful sensitivity analyses of health worker requirements in order to assess how
much estimates will change if expert opinion or health care technology changes.


Second approach to estimating health workforce requirements: demand

An example of an analysis following the demand approach is a 1975 study by Hall, Reinke
and Lawrence on health workforce requirements in Chile (Hall, Reinke, & Lawrence, 1975).
The researchers first estimated in regression analyses the effects of geographical location,
income, sex, age, insurance coverage, and education on three measures of health care demand
(doctor visits, dentist visits, hospital nights). They then used predictions of the independent
variables to estimate future demand for health services (10 years and 20 years after 1968, the
year for which the equations were estimated). Finally, they converted predicted demand into
health worker requirements, using estimates of productivity and staffing patterns of hospitals
and facilities providing ambulatory and dental care, which were based on field observation
and expert opinion (Hall, 1971).

Other health manpower studies employing a demand approach include Baker and Pearlman’s
1967 study on Taiwan (Baker & Perlman, 1967), Fein’s 1967 study on the US (Fein, 1967),
and Hall’s 1969 study on Peru (Hall, 1969). Recent examples are a study predicting the
demand for accident and emergency services in the UK (Chambers & Johnson, 1986) and a
2008 WHO study projecting the global demand for physicians (Scheffler, Liu, Kinfu, & Dal
Poz, 2008).

Whether the predictive nature of the demand approach is an advantage or a disadvantage will
depend on the intended use of the estimated health worker requirements. In situations in
which policy makers intend to merely adjust the status quo of health services delivery to
changes in a few factors that are outside their control (such as population size and
composition, economic growth, or migration) demand studies may provide sufficient
information about future health worker requirements. Demand studies may also provide
baseline estimates for further normative analyses in countries where the government intends
to significantly change the pattern of health care utilization.

While demand studies could thus inform health policy in many circumstances, they are often
not feasible because the data necessary to estimate demand functions are lacking (Dreesch et

                                                13
al., 2005). In addition, demand-based studies may not yield reliable estimates of future health
worker requirements. First, they commonly do not take into account (as, for example, the
studies mentioned above) that demand and supply are simultaneously determined. Estimates
of health worker requirements that do not account for the interaction between demand and
supply in the health care market are thus likely to be biased. Research on health worker
requirements following the demand approach may benefit from increased use economic
models of health care demand (Benham, 1971; M. S. Feldstein, 1967, 1971). Second,
demand-based studies usually assume that the relationships between demand and its
determinants will remain unchanged in the future, an assumption that is likely to be violated
in many situations. Third, they assume that projections of the development of the
determinants of health care demand are reasonably accurate. This assumption may not hold
true; for instance, per-capita income may not rise to predicted levels because of an
unexpected economic crisis. Fourth, they may wrongly assume generalizability of findings
from the particular setting of one study to other settings. For instance, one of the
determinants commonly taken into account in demand-based studies is income. However,
estimates of the income elasticity of health care demand in microeconomic studies (which are
often used for demand-based forecasting (Hall & Mejia, 1978; Klarman, 1969, 1973)) vary
widely, even if they cover similar geographic areas and time periods, suggesting that these
estimates are quite uncertain (see, for instance, (R. Anderson & Benham, 1970; Fein, 1967; P.
J. Feldstein, 1964; Gorham, 1967; Newhouse & Phelps, 1976; Rosett & Huang, 1973; Silver,
1970; Stigler, 1956)). In sum, studies of health worker requirements following the demand
approach can be useful in certain situations. In many other situations, however, they may not
provide the information required to plan and implement future health policies, may provide
the required information only with considerable uncertainty, or may not be feasible to
conduct at all.


Third approach to estimating health workforce requirements: service targets

Hall and Mejia (Hall & Mejia, 1978) describe an example of a study deriving health worker
requirements from service targets. Colombian health planners first identified “priority
services” for a population of nine million people lacking access to basic health care, based on
“morbidity surveys carried out earlier, the accumulated experience of pilot simplified
medicine programmes, statistics on service utilization, referral rates, and international
experience”. The planners then calculated the numbers of different types of health workers


                                               14
(health promoters and nurse auxiliaries working in communities and physicians and support
staff working at health posts and in hospitals), using “normative techniques”. Many of the
more recent examples of estimations of health worker requirements follow a service target
approach. For instance, Kurowski, Wyss, Abdulla and Mills (Kurowski & Mills, 2006;
Kurowski, Wyss, Abdulla, & Mills, 2007) estimated the numbers of health workers required
to deliver 33 “priority interventions” identified by the Commission on Macroeconomics and
Health as important to achieving the MDGs (Commission on Macroeconomics and Health,
2001; Working Group 5 of the Commission on Macroecnomics and Health, 2002). Based on
WHO guidelines, the researchers broke the interventions down into tasks requiring different
levels of health worker skill. Next, they measured the time needed to complete the different
tasks through structured interviews with randomly selected health workers in Tanzania.
Then, they estimated through a time and motion study (Robbins, Bergman, Stagg, & Coulter,
2003) the proportion of health worker time spent providing health care (staff productivity)
and the proportion of productive staff time spent providing the selected priority interventions
(service productivity). Finally, the researchers estimated the numbers of nurses, midwives,
physicians, and technicians necessary to provide the “priority interventions” in Tanzania
under three productivity scenarios (assuming that staff and service productivity remained
unchanged, deteriorated, or improved). Dreesch and colleagues (Dreesch et al., 2005)
proposed a similar method to estimate the health workforce required to achieve the MDGs.
First, they selected priority interventions, taking into account “incidence and prevalence of
health problems, demographic characteristics of the population, and (internationally) the
targets set forth by the MDGs, or (at country level) targets identified in health sector strategic
plans”. Next, they identified in functional job analysis (F. I. Moore, 1999) the tasks required
to deliver the interventions. Then, they estimated the time required to complete the tasks
based on observation (Hurst, 2002) or expert opinion. Finally, they considered whether
required times per task could be reduced by improving productivity through task
reorganization.

As these examples demonstrate, the main differences between the two normative planning
approaches (the service targets and the need approach) are in the scope of health care
considered and in the constraints taken into account. The service targets approach decides on
priority interventions, taking into account health care need but also (explicitly or implicitly)
existing constraints to meeting that need; in contrast, the need approach starts by identifying
health care need and assumes that all need can be met. The former approach will thus yield

                                                15
more realistic human resources requirements than the latter. The service targets approach has
the further advantages that it explicitly disaggregates need into different components, is easy
to communicate, can be easily combined with other planning approaches, and facilitates the
study of health worker productivity (Hall & Mejia, 1978). Moreover, unlike the need and the
demand approach, the service targets approach does not depend on detailed local data to yield
useful estimates of health workforce requirements.

On the other hand, just like the needs approach, the service targets approach has the
disadvantage that it assumes that consumers demand and health workers provide precisely
those services that the planners have used to derive health worker requirements. In most
settings, however, the overlap between the health services consumed and those planned will
be imperfect. The health services approach will be most useful in countries where the
government can exert substantial control over health services and is willing to use this power
to maximize delivery of planned services and minimize delivery of unplanned ones.


Fourth approach to estimating health workforce requirements: population ratio

Health worker-to-population ratios have been frequently used in planning manpower
requirements. For instance, following a WHO recommendation Thailand aimed at achieving
a physician-to-population ratio of 1:5000 in the period 1972-1976 (Chunharas, 1998).
Bahrain tried to attain a physician-to-population ratio of 1:650 in the period 1998-2005
(Ahmed, Fateha, & Benjamin, 2000). In the 1993 World Development Report, the World
Bank stated that “[t]he public health and minimum essential clinical interventions require
about 0.1 physician per 1,000 population and between 2 and 4 graduate nurses per physician”
(World Bank, 1993); and in the 2006 World Health Report, WHO identified a “needs-based
sufficiency” threshold of 2.5 health workers per 1,000 population (WHO, 2006b):

“To achieve a global assessment of shortfall, the Joint Learning Initiative (JLI), a network of
global health leaders, launched by the Rockefeller Foundation, suggested that, on average,
countries with fewer than 2.5 health care professionals (counting only doctors, nurses and
midwives) per 1,000 population failed to achieve an 80% coverage rate for deliveries by
skilled birth attendants or for measles immunization.”

“This method of defining a shortage, whether global or by country, is driven partly by the
decision to set the minimum desired level of coverage at 80% and partly by the empirical
identification of health worker density associated with that level of coverage. Using a similar

                                               16
“threshold” method and updated information on the size of the health workforce obtained for
this report, the JLI analysis has been repeated for skilled birth attendants .. . A remarkably
similar threshold is found at 2.28 health care professionals per 1000 population, ranging from
2.02 to 2.54 allowing for uncertainty. The 57 countries that fall below this threshold and
which fail to attain the 80% coverage level are defined as having a critical shortage.”

The popularity of the population ratio approach to health workforce planning stems from the
ease and flexibility of its use. The data to estimate current health worker-to-population ratios
are available in most countries worldwide for some time periods, and ratio objectives are easy
to communicate to policy makers and planners. On the other hand, the approach suffers from
many limitations.        First, population ratios are necessarily averages across geographical
regions, subregions of which may have ratios that differ widely from the averages. For
instance, Bennet, Hall, Lutwana and Rado in a study in 1965 found an overall physician-to-
population ratio of 1:18,500 in Kenya, Uganda, and the then Tanganyika. This average,
however, could be decomposed into an average ratio of 1:4,400 for urban areas and an
average ratio of 1:31,000 for rural areas where more than 90% of the population lived
(Bennett, Hall, Lutwana, & Rado, 1965). Figure 1 shows the quotients of urban nurse-to-
population ratios divided by the rural nurse-to-population ratios for country-years for which
these data were available in the WHO Global Atlas of the Health Workforce (WHO, 2009);
Figure 2 shows the urban-to-rural quotients for physicians based on the same data source.5
The two figures show large differences between health worker population ratios in urban and
rural areas in most countries for which data were available, suggesting that for many planning
purposes pooled rural-urban averages will not be sufficiently disaggregated.6

Second, unlike the other three health worker planning approaches, the population ratio
approach does not require an intermediary step of estimating health services in order to
calculate the health worker numbers. It is thus the approach that will be least likely to lead to
a focus on health worker productivity in planning future worker requirements. Third, the

5
 The graphs show the ratios for all country-years for which data were available in the WHO Global Atlas of the
Health Workforce with one exception. We do not show the urban-to-rural ratio for physicians for Bhutan 2004.
Because the ratio is quite large (599), the differences between the other ratios in the graphs would have been
difficult to discern, had we included it in the display.
6
 Note that while the WHO Global Atlas is the most reliable dataset on health worker population ratios available
(Anand & Bärnighausen, 2004), it cannot be ruled out that the differences health worker population ratios
between urban and rural areas shown in the two figures can be partially explained by differences in data sources
and data definitions (such as definitions of physicians and nurses or rural and urban areas) (WHO, 2009).
However, it is unlikely that improved adjustment for these differences would alter the conclusion that rural-to-
urban health worker population ratios vary widely across countries.

                                                      17
approach does not explain which factors drive health worker requirements, except for
changes in crude population size. Thus, the population ratio approach to health workforce
planning is mainly useful for international comparison and as a first indicator of a country’s
overall health human resources situation (Bossert, Bärnighausen, Bowser, Mitchell, & Gedik,
2007), rather than as the main planning tool to estimate health worker requirements.

III. Second phase: The health worker as economic actor

III.1 Background

Starting in the 1970s and continuing in the 1980s and 1990s, policy makers in developed
countries became increasingly worried about rising health expenditures (Altman & Levitt,
2002; Boccuti & Moon, 2003; R.G. Evans, Barer, & Hertzman, 1991; Gray, 1998). The
average annual growth rate of health care expenditure in real terms for 18 countries belonging
to the OECD was 3.0% in the period 1980-1990 and 3.3% in the period 1990-2001(Huber &
Orosz, 2003).7 Health care expenditures throughout the developed world rose in terms of
both per-capita spending on health (Huber, 1999; Huber & Orosz, 2003; Martin, Whittle, &
Levit, 2001; Schieber, Poullier, & Greenwald, 1993, 1994) and the proportion of per-capita
gross domestic product (Huber, 1999; Huber & Orosz, 2003; Schieber et al., 1993, 1994).8


At the same time, the apparent health worker shortage of the past period gave way to a
perceived oversupply (O. Adams, 1989; Budetti, 1981; Bui, 1986; Charatan, 1996; Ellwood
& Ellwein, 1981; Ginzberg, 1983; Grayson, 1978; "HEW advisers eye physician
'oversupply'," 1980; Hosokawa & Roberts, 1982; Macleish, 1985; Menken, 1981; Menken &
Sheps, 1984; "Most medical staffs have an oversupply of specialists, but don't plan to take
action to correct this," 1995; Placone & Wallace, 1982; Riska, 1995; Sabiston, 1984; Salmon
& Culbertson, 1985; Schroeder, 1984; Selby, 1981; Tierney, Waters, & Williams, 1980;
Whitcomb, 1995; M. S. White & Culbertson, 1981; R. I. White, 1992; Yager, 1987).9 The
focus of research on health workers thus shifted from planning for future supplies to
investigating the extent to which health workers contribute to increases in health expenditures


7
 In this study, health care spending was adjusted for inflation using the gross domestic product deflator (Huber
& Orosz, 2003).
8
  While most macroeconomic studies of the income elasticity of health care expenditure estimated values greater
than unity (Gerdtham & Jonsson, 1991; Gerdtham, Sogaard, Anderson, & Jonsson, 1992; Hitiris, 1997; Hitiris
& Posnett, 1992; Milne & Molana, 1991; Newhouse, 1977), the estimates vary substantially and some studies
find income elasticities smaller than unity (Parkin, McGuire, & Yule, 1987; Selvanathan & Selvanathan, 1993).
Reasons for the divergent results include difference in datasets, econometric models, and approaches to
adjusting for purchasing power in studies with cross-country data (Okunade & Suraratdecha, 2000).
9
 Claims of health worker shortages or oversupplies imply that quantity standards for health workers have been
set. Such quantity standards are difficult to determine and usually quite uncertain (Ginzberg, 1983), as
described in the preceding subchapter on health worker planning, making it difficult to validate claims of
shortages or oversupplies. For the argument in this background section, however, it is unimportant whether
such claims are valid. We merely need to show that policy makers and researchers perceived an oversupply of
health workers where previously they had perceived a shortage.

                                                       20
and whether changes in the administration of health workers can help contain costs (Carrin &
Hanvoravongchai, 2003; Mehrotra, Dudley, & Luft, 2003; Stone, 1997). Health workers
came to be seen as profit-maximizing economic actors individually and as rent-seeking
professional groups collectively. Much of the research in this phase was motivated by the
belief that health workers do not always act in their patients’ best interest, exploiting market
failures in health care for their own gain and reducing social welfare in the process. In health
economics research, this belief was exemplified by the intensive study of supplier-induced
demand, defined by McGuire in the Handbook of Health Economics (McGuire, 2000) as
follows:


“Supplier induced demand exists when the physician influences a patient’s demand for care
against the physician’s interpretation of the best interest of the patient.”


In commentaries in health policy journals, the belief was expressed more blatantly. “Is the
health workforce a barrier to cost containment?” asks Montoya in The American Journal of
Managed Care (Montoya, 2000) and as Aaron writes in Health Affairs (Aaron, 2002)


“Hospital wings echoed with unoccupied beds. Doctors’ garages were filled with Mercedes
Benzes. And employers were reeling under rising health care premium costs.”


While the view of health workers as profit-maximizing economic actors was narrow
(neglecting, for instance, the influence of such factors as altruism and professional ethics in
guiding the actions of nurses and doctors (Le Grand, 1997)),10 the rigorous application of
microeconomic theory to health worker behavior was fruitful, leading to important insights
on a range of topics, such as competition among providers, health worker licensure,
information asymmetry and health worker agency (Blomqvist, 1991), health worker
performance and productivity (Cutler & Berndt, 2001), provider payment and incentives
(Sloan & Kasper, 2008), and medical decision making. As described in the introduction
section, other chapters in this handbook are devoted to many of these topics (chapters 26, 27,
29, 30, 31, and 33). In the literature review in this subchapter, we thus cover only one topic,
health worker licensure, which is not discussed in detail elsewhere in this book.

10
  Many recent economic models of health worker behavior take a more differentiated view of factors explaining
health worker behavior (Encinosa, Gaynor, & Rebitzer, 2007; R. G. Frank & Zeckhauser, 2007; Olbrich, 2008;
Schneider & Ulrich, 2008).

                                                     21
III.2 Health worker licensure

Health worker licensure, i.e., the authorization of health workers to practice their profession,
has existed since the medieval period (Garcia-Ballester, McVaugh, & Rubio-Vela, 1989;
Loewy, 1989).11 Over time it has become increasingly structured and standardized (Rowe &
Garcia-Barbero, 2005). Today, licensure of health workers has been introduced into national
or subnational legislation in many countries worldwide (see, for instance, (Gaumer, 1984;
Graddy, 1991a; Muzondo & Pazderka, 1980; Rowe & Garcia-Barbero, 2005; The Licentiate
Committee of the Medical Council of Hong Kong, 2008; WHO, 2006a)). In order to obtain a
health worker license, candidates must have completed formal training in a recognized health
care education institution and must usually meet further requirements such as completion of
practical training (e.g., an internship), passage of licensure examinations, proof of absence of
a criminal record, and swearing of a professional oath (such as the Hippocratic oath or the
oath of Geneva). Licensing may be exercised by the Ministry of Health or by independent
professional bodies, such as a chamber, order, college or council (Rowe & Garcia-Barbero,
2005). Clearly specified conditions (for instance, malpractice or substance use) can lead to
revocation of a health worker license.


Theories of licensure

There are two families of theories to explain the existence and specific patterns of legislation,
including health worker licensure (T. G. Moore, 1961; Noether, 1986; Paul, 1984; Posner,
1974). According to “public interest” theories policy makers supply regulation in response to
the demand of the public for the correction of a market failure. According to “interest group”
theories, on the other hand, policy makers supply regulation in response to the demands of
interest groups trying to increase the incomes of their members (Peltzman, 1976; Stigler,
1971). The two families of theories offer different explanations for the existence of health
worker licensure and lead to different predictions regarding licensure effects.




11
  Licensure has to be distinguished from two other types of state regulation of professions, certification and
registration (Gaumer, 1984). Certification restricts the use of a particular occupational title to individuals
meeting specified requirements, but does not bar individuals who do not meet the requirements from practice in
the occupation. Registration simply requires that certain information on a health worker (such as name, address,
and place of occupational training) is recorded by a state agency.


                                                      22
   a. “Public interest” theories

A common version of the “public interest” explanation for the existence of licensure is “the
belief that the public interest will be best served if the poorly trained, incompetent, and
unethical people are kept from practicing”, because such exclusions will increase the average
quality of health services (Gaumer, 1984). This version is not motivated by an economic
model of behavior. Arrow (Arrow, 1963) developed a “public interest” theory of licensure,
which rests on the assumption that health workers know their own abilities – and the more
capable health workers have higher-paying alternative opportunities for employment.
Because patients cannot easily judge the quality of individual health workers, the price of a
health service does not differ by health worker and reflects the average quality of the service
in the market – i.e., a setup analogous to the one in Akerlof’s classic analysis of “The market
for ‘lemons’” (Akerlof, 1970).

Health workers with above-average ability withdraw from this market because their
alternative employment opportunities provide them with higher incomes. The withdrawal
lowers the average quality of health workers and the prices of health services fall, causing
those among the remaining workers whose abilities exceed the new average ability to exit the
market. This process repeats itself until only the least capable health workers are left to
supply health services. In this analysis, the market fails because of informational asymmetry
between health workers and consumers of health services. Searching out information to
overcome this asymmetry may be more expensive for the individual consumer than the
expected gain in welfare (Leland, 1979). Consumers may find it costly to obtain information
on health worker quality because most people consume the services of a particular health
worker only rarely and the outcome of health care may not be observable for a long time after
service delivery and may depend on factors other than health worker quality (Henderson,
McQuire, & Mooney, 1987). In this situation, licensure may serve as a less expensive means
of reducing the informational asymmetry between health worker and consumer by screening
out those workers who do not meet defined minimum quality standards – in Arrow’s words
“[t]he general uncertainty about the prospects of medical treatment is socially handled by
rigid entry requirements” (Arrow, 1963).

However, if the only purpose of licensure is to reduce information asymmetry between health
workers and consumers, certification – which, unlike licensure, does not exclude anyone
from practicing as a health worker – should serve that purpose at least equally well without

                                                23
reducing consumer choice. While licensure excludes low-quality health workers from
professional practice, certification informs consumers about the relative quality of health
workers. Several authors have thus argued that the selection of health worker licensure over
certification is evidence that health worker interests dominate the public interest in the
regulation of health care (Friedman, 1962; Leffler, 1978; Leland, 1979; T. G. Moore, 1961).
Against this argument, Svorny (Svorny, 1987) holds that licensure is more effective than
certification in ensuring that health workers provide high-quality care because, unlike loss of
licensure, loss of certification does not prevent health workers from practicing altogether. A
health worker who loses certification (which she may regain) may have to reduce the prices
of her services, but will still be able to earn an income providing health care. In contrast, a
health worker who loses her license permanently forfeits the entire premium stream derived
from the investment in career-specific training.12 Compared to loss of certification,
revocation of licensure should lead to a larger loss of expected net present value (of the future
returns on health care education) and thus serve as a stronger incentive against providing low-
quality health care than certification.


     b. “Interest group” theories

“Interest group” explanations for the existence of health worker licensure originate in the
belief that licensure has been introduced in response to the demands of interest groups aiming
to ensure through licensure that incumbent health workers earn economic rents (Friedman,
1962; Kessel, 1958, 1970; Rayack, 1967). Peltzman (Peltzman, 1976) developed a formal
model of the influence of interest groups on regulation (such as licensure legislation), based
on a study by Stigler (Stigler, 1971). According to the model, self-interested legislators
maximize the expected number of votes in their favor

                                                  ·                 · ,

where     is the number of potential voters belonging to the interest group that is set to benefit
from the regulation,       is the average probability that a member of the interest group will vote
for the legislator,     is the total number of potential voters, and           is the average probability
that a member of the group which incurs a loss due to the legislation (every non- ) votes
against the legislator (Peltzman, 1976). In this model, the probability of a supportive vote


12
  Investment in career-specific training includes tuition, living expenses during schooling, and the opportunity
cost of time attaining a health care education.

                                                       24
from the beneficiary group ( ) is a function of the net benefit per interest group member
which, in turn, is a function the total dollar amount transferred to the beneficiary group ( ),
the total amount of dollars spent by the group to mitigate opposition ( ), and the cost of
organizing the beneficiary group to support the legislator and to mitigate opposition (                       )


                                                                    .


The legislator chooses the size of the group she will benefit ( ), and offers the group                  in
return for . The probability of opposition , on the other hand, increases with the rate at
which the income of a member of             is taxed in order to pay for        and decreases with


                                                                .


Note that, assuming diminishing returns to the per-capita net benefit, the legislator who
maximizes        will benefit both      and             to some extent. Peltzman’s model further
predicts that the cost of interest group organization                   and “imperfect information about
both the gains and losses of regulatory decisions” restrict the size of the group benefiting
from the regulation. Furthermore, “the costs of using the political process” limit the size of
the gains of the beneficiary group (Peltzman, 1976).13 Based on the “interest group” theories
of regulation, we would expect health worker groups to be successful in increasing their rents
through regulation, because – in comparison to many other occupational groups – they are
small, well-informed, and well-organized in professional organizations (Friedman, 1962;
Kessel, 1970; Peltzman, 1989; Stigler, 1971).


Literature on health worker licensure

Three categories of health worker licensure studies can be distinguished. The first category
examined whether health care markets are competitive or monopolistic. In this literature,
monopolistic market structures are taken as evidence that licensure has benefited health

13
  Using a setup similar to Peltzman’s, Becker (Becker, 1983) developed another version of an “interest group”
theory of regulation in order to investigate the effect of deadweight loss on the size of the gain that the
beneficiary group can achieve through the regulatory process. The deadweight loss is the difference between
the gains of the beneficiary group and the losses of the public due to regulation. Becker’s model predicted that
deadweight loss is a constraint on the gains of the beneficiary group. Because deadweight loss increased at an
increasing rate as regulation moves output away from the efficient level, the beneficiary group would need to
exert increasing marginal pressure in order to overcome opposition to the regulation. The model further
predicted that deadweight loss motivates a search for greater efficiency in regulatory redistribution because
neither the beneficiary nor the loser group opposes changes that eliminate some deadweight loss.

                                                       25
workers and hurt consumers. The second category of licensure studies analyzed the effects of
changes in licensure regulation on health worker incomes or on the quantity, price, or quality
of health services. Studies in this category infer from relationships between these outcomes
and the stringency of licensure requirements whether “interest group” or “public interest”
explanations of licensure hold true. The third category of studies investigated whether the
political power of health worker interest groups is a determinant of licensure legislation. A
positive relationship between interest group power and licensure legislation is taken as
evidence that the interests of health workers have dominated those of consumers in
influencing licensure legislation. Below, we describe the analytical approaches that have
been employed in each of the three categories. For each approach, we review the findings of
studies and critically discuss the evidence on reasons for the existence of health worker
licensure.


   a. First category of licensure studies: market structure

One approach to determining the level of competitiveness in the health care market has been
to estimate the return to health worker education and to compare it to the returns to education
in other occupations. Studies employing this approach generally found significant positive
returns to medical education. However, depending on the time period of observation, the
particular physician specialties, the comparison occupations, and the estimation technique,
the estimated returns to education varied widely (Burstein & Cromwell, 1985; Friedman &
Kuznet, 1945; Leffler, 1978; Leffler & Lindsay, 1980; Lindsay, 1973; Marder & Willke,
1991; Maurizi, 1975; Weeks, Wallace, Wallace, & Welch, 1994; Wilkinson, 1966).
Moreover, a number of estimation problems were identified in these studies. First, the results
were sensitive to the choice of discount rate and there is no consensus as to which discount
rate to use to estimate returns to medical education (Leffler, 1978). Second, the studies
commonly failed to take into account progressive taxation (Leffler, 1978) and the cost of
malpractice insurance. Third, many of the earlier studies of return to medical education did
not control for differences in hours worked across occupations (Lindsay, 1973). Where
physicians earn more but work longer hours than comparison occupations, adjustment for
hours worked reduces cross-occupation differences in rates of return. Newer studies took this
criticism into account. Burstein and Cromwell (1985) found hours-adjusted internal rates of
return (IRR) to education for all physicians of about 12 percent in 1980 (Burstein &
Cromwell, 1985); Marder and Willke estimate hours adjusted IRRs to vary across specialty


                                              26
between about 2 percent for Pediatrics to 58 percent for Pathology (Marder & Willke, 1991);
and Weeks and colleagues calculated hours adjusted IRRs of about 16 percent for primary
care physicians and 21 percent for specialist physicians, while the comparison occupations
received similar or higher returns on their education (dentists: 21 percent; attorneys: 25
percent; business people: 29 percent) (Weeks et al., 1994). Thus, studies since 1985 that
calculated hours-adjusted IRR suggest that for many medical specialties the stringent
licensure requirements did not led to excessive returns.

Another approach to assess whether health care markets are competitive or monopolistic has
been to investigate the relationship between physician density per population and the price of
physician services. A positive association between density and price was interpreted as
evidence of a monopolistic market (Newhouse, 1970) or as evidence that physicians induce
demand for their services (Cromwell & Mitchell, 1986; R. G. Evans, Parish, & Sully, 1973;
Fuchs, 1978; Tussing & Wojtowycz, 1986). However, as Sloan and Feldman (Sloan &
Feldman, 1978) and Newhouse (Newhouse, 1978) pointed out, the inability to control for
differences in quality of physician services in these studies rendered their results of little
explanatory value.

“Recall that analysis of a competitive market assumes a fixed and homogeneous product. But
physicians in areas with greater concentration of physicians spend more time with their
patients and patients in such areas spend less time waiting for their physicians. More time
with the physicians and less waiting time are both desirable characteristics that lead to more
physician time per visit. In a competitive market, visits using more physician time would be
more expensive. As a result, even if the market were competitive, there could be a positive
relationship between the physician/population ratio and the price of a (non-homogeneous)
physician visit” (Newhouse, 1978).

A third approach has been to estimate an index of market power based on comparison of
marginal revenue to marginal cost in the health services industry (Bresnahan, 1982; Panzar &
Rosse, 1987). Wong (Wong, 1996) did not find evidence that the marginal revenue exceeds
marginal costs in the market for physician services in the US, while Seldon, Jung and
Cavazos (Seldon, Jung, & Cavazos, 1998) observed that the price for physician services was
maintained above marginal costs. The results regarding physician market power from studies
following this approach are thus inconclusive.



                                                27
In sum, the studies in this category do not provide decisive evidence for monopolistic
structures in health care markets. Moreover, none of the studies took consumer benefits into
account. It is possible that consumers are better off in a less competitive market than in a
more competitive one.14 For instance, licensure legislation may restrict entry of health
workers into the market and at the same time improve the quality of health care. If the
outward shift in demand caused by the latter effect exceeds the inward shift in supply caused
by the former, consumer welfare will increase. Even if the studies in this category had
provided strong evidence for monopolistic structures in health care markets, this evidence
would have been insufficient to rule out the possibility that such structures were serving the
public interest.

Second category of licensure studies: licensure effects

A second category of licensure studies has investigated the effects of changes in licensure
legislation on outcomes in order to establish whether “public interest” or “interest group”
explanations of licensure hold true. Outcomes considered in this category of studies included
health worker incomes and the price, quality and quantity of health services. A number of
studies found that health workers’ incomes (G. M. Anderson, Halcoussis, & Lowenberg,
2000; Friedman & Kuznet, 1945; Leffler, 1978; Muzondo & Pazderka, 1980; W. D. White,
1978) or the price of health services and products (Benham & Benham, 1975; Shepard, 1978)
increasd when licensure regulations became stricter. The studies inferred from the results
that licensure benefited health workers and not consumers. Yet, these studies suffer from the
same fundamental weakness that studies investigating the level of competitiveness in the
health services market suffer from: Their results do not rule out that the quality-improving
effect of licensure legislation has shifted health services demand to such an extent that
aggregate consumption and consumer welfare increase despite the supply-restricting effect of
the legislation (Svorny, 1987). Hence the results cannot be used to determine whether
licensure legislation benefited the public. Two other approaches in this category of studies
are better suited for this purpose.




14
  Conversely, lack of evidence of monopolistic structures does not imply that licensure was established to
protect the public. As Svorny (1987) points out, “there must have been a one-time gain to practicing physicians
when restrictions on practice of medicine were imposed. As in other protected markets, entry may dissipate any
rents over time.”


                                                      28
First, it is theoretically possible to exclude the possibility that health worker licensure
benefited consumers through analysis the quality of health services.15 If health services
quality did not improve in response to licensure regulation, it could be ruled out that the
legislation benefited the consumers. (In contrast, if health services quality did improve in
response to licensure legislation, additional information would be necessary in order to
determine whether the legislation increased consumer welfare, because the quality
improvement may or may not have been sufficient in size to compensate for a reduction in
consumer welfare due to supply-restricting effects of licensure.)

Three studies investigated the effect of licensure on health service quality. Carroll and
Gaston (Carroll & Gaston, 1981) found that some licensure requirements for dentists in the
US led to a reduction in the quality of dental services; Feldman and Begun (Feldman &
Begun, 1985) found that licensure legislation in the US increased the quality of optometric
services; and Haas-Wilson (Haas-Wilson, 1986) did not find any significant effect on
optometric service quality of four state restrictions on optometric practice which, if violated,
could have led to revocation of optometric license. The three studies have thus come to very
different conclusions regarding the effect of licensure on health care quality. More
important, it is highly unlikely that the quality measures used in the three studies captured all,
or even the most important, dimensions of health services quality. Carroll and Gaston
(Carroll & Gaston, 1981) measured quality as waiting time for dental appointments, while
Feldman and Begun (Feldman & Begun, 1985) measured it as length and thoroughness of eye
exams, and Haas-Wilson (Haas-Wilson, 1986) measured it as the thoroughness of eye exams.
The studies thus analyzed the effect of licensure legislation on some specific indicators of
process quality, while ignoring other quality dimensions (such as outcome quality).
However, in order to rule out the possibility that health worker licensure legislation benefited
consumers, information on the effects of licensure on all quality dimensions is necessary.

Second, analysis of the effect of licensure legislation on equilibrium consumption can be used
to determine whether consumers benefited from such legislation. If licensure legislation
caused an outward shift in the demand for health services that is greater than the inward shift
in supply, equilibrium consumption would have increase and consumers would have
benefited from the legislation; if, on the other hand, the outward shift in demand were smaller



15
  We use the word ‘quality’ here to mean all possible dimensions of heath service quality as well as increases in
certainty about the level of quality in the market for health services.

                                                       29
than the inward shift in supply, equilibrium consumption would have decreases and consumer
welfare would have been reduced.16

Svorny (Svorny, 1987) investigated the effect of two particular medical licensure regulations
(basic science certification and citizenship) on the consumption of physician services. She
found that, controlling for a range of socioeconomic, population, and health system
characteristics, more stringent licensure requirements in a US state were associated with
lower numbers of physicians per population in the state, and concluded that “the interests of
organized medicine dominated those of consumers in influencing the medical regulatory
supply process” (Svorny, 1987). Adams, Ekelund and Jackson examined the effect of a range
of variables capturing the stringency of midwife licensure and other midwifery regulations on
the consumption of the services of certified nurse-midwives (CNM) (Adams 2003). They
found that more stringent midwifery regulations in a US state led to lower consumption of
midwifery services in the state and concluded that “supply-restricting effects dominated
quality assurance in the U.S. market for CNM services” (A. F. Adams, Ekelund, & Jackson,
2003).

Both studies have technical limitations. Svorny (Svorny, 1987) assumed that her outcome
variable, physician population density by US state, was a measure of the quantity of
physician services consumed in the states. However, it is plausible that physicians in states
with lower physician population densities provided on average more services per year than
physicians in states with higher densities. The conclusion that licensure decreases
equilibrium consumption of health services may thus be wrong. Adams, Ekelund and
Jackson (A. F. Adams et al., 2003) controlled for endogeneity between their outcome variable
(the quantity of midwife services) and the licensure and regulation variables using a number
of instrumental variables. However, the instrumental variables (hospital charges for an
uncomplicated vaginal delivery, number of CNM per-capita, physician deliveries as a
percentage of total deliveries, total population in the state) may be invalid because they are
likely to have affected the outcome variable through many pathways other than the licensure
and regulation variables. The coefficients in the instrumental variable regressions may thus
be biased.

   This identification of the net effect of licensure legislation on consumer benefits is possible because we
assume that such legislation never leads to an outward shift in supply. If this assumption were not met,
consumer welfare could decrease when equilibrium consumption increases.

                                                        30
In sum, analyses of the licensure effect on health worker income or the price of health
services cannot determine whether licensure served the public interest. Analyses of the
licensure effect on health service quality can theoretically rule out that licensure benefited the
public, but past studies were not able to demonstrate that licensure was in the public interest
(and it seems unlikely that future studies will) because of practical difficulties in measuring
comprehensively all dimensions of health service quality that can be affected by licensure
legislation. The most promising approach within the second category of studies is to evaluate
the licensure effect on the quantity of health services. The results of the two studies that used
this approach suggest that licensure reduced social welfare, but technical issues diminish the
strength of this evidence.


   b. Third category of licensure studies: political power

A third category of licensure studies has analyzed the relationship between the political
power of health worker interest groups and the passage of licensure legislation and other
occupational regulation. Variables used to proxy interest group power were found to be
positively associated with passage of licensure legislation for physicians, nurses, dentists, and
pharmacists (Stigler, 1971) and physician assistants and psychologists (Graddy, 1991b), as
well as the stringency of licensure regulation for dentists (Becker, 1986) and the stringency of
other occupational regulation for optometrists (Begun, Crowe, & Feldman, 1981). The
authors of these studies interpreted their results as evidence that “interest group” explanations
of licensure hold true. However, it is unclear whether the proxy variables they used really
measured the political power of health worker interest groups. For instance, Stigler (Stigler,
1971) and Becker (Becker, 1986) used the percentage of an occupation living in urban areas
as a measure of political power. As Stigler argued, an occupation that is more concentrated
in cities will be more powerful: “When the occupation organizes a campaign to obtain
favorable legislation, it incurs expenses in the solicitation of support, and these are higher for
a diffused occupation than a concentrated one” (Stigler, 1971). However, the concentration
of health workers in cities may not matter for the political power of occupations in countries
where most members of the occupation have access to communication technologies, such as
mail or telephone, so that political support can be organized independent of physical distance
between health workers.

Graddy (Graddy, 1991b) assumed that the political power of health worker groups (physician
assistants and psychologists) increases with the ratio of group members “belonging to the

                                                31
major professional association” to the total number of employed persons, and Begun, Crowe,
and Feldman (Begun et al., 1981) assumed that the political power of optometrists increases
with the ratio of optometrists to their competitors (ophthalmologists and opticians).
However, political power may decrease in these ratios beyond some point. Ceteris paribus,
the ratios increased with group size. However, as group size increases, the cost of organizing
political support among group members may rise, reducing the group’s political power
(Peltzman, 1976):

“It is not enough for the successful group to recognize its interests; it must organize to
translate this interest into support for the politician who will implement it. This means not
only mobilizing its own vote, but contributing resources to the support of the appropriate
political party or policy: to finance campaigns, to persuade other voters to support or at least
not oppose the policy or candidate, perhaps occasionally to bribe those in office. While there
may be some economies of scale in this organization of support and neutralization of
opposition, these must be limited. The larger the groups that seeks the transfer, the narrower
the base of the opposition and the greater the per-capita stakes that determine the strength of
opposition, so lobbying and campaigning costs will rise faster than group size. The cost of
overcoming “free riders” will also rise faster than group size.”

Note also that a number of variables hypothesized to proxy political power of interest groups
in these studies were found not to be associated with licensure legislation and other regulation
(for instance “the ratio of the occupation to the total labor force” in Stigler’s 1971 study
(Stigler, 1971) and “the percentage of optometrists who belong to their state optometry
association” and “whether or not the state’s optometry association has a legislative lobbyist”
in the 1981 study by Begun, Crowe, and Feldman (Begun et al., 1981)). The absence of
significant relationships between these variables and occupation regulation suggests that the
variables either did not measure political power or that certain dimensions of political power
did not influence occupational regulation.

Another problem with the above analysis belonging to the third category of licensure studies
is that they did not control for reverse causality, so that their estimates of the effect of
political power of interest groups on licensure legislation may be biased. It seems likely that
in many cases the introduction of licensure or an increase in licensure stringency will reduce
the costs of organizing political support and thus strengthen health workers’ political power.
Licensed health workers are usually centrally registered (for instance, with a professional

                                                 32
chamber or council) and can thus be easily contacted in a political campaign. In addition,
licensure defines the scope of practice of different types of health worker groups, ensuring a
certain level of homogeneity of interests within the groups. Furthermore, the more stringent
the licensure requirements, the smaller the size of the group of licensed health workers and
the easier the political organization of the group.

In sum, while the literature on the relationship between political power of health worker
interest groups and licensure suggests that political power does determine licensure
legislation – i.e., that “interest group” explanations of the existence of licensure hold true –
the studies in this category suffer from a number of limitations. In particular, it is unclear
whether the proxy variables for political power chosen in these studies are valid and the
analyses failed to control for reverse causality in the relationship between political power and
professional licensure.

To sum up, we identify three categories of licensure studies: first, studies examining the level
of competitiveness in the market for health services; second, studies analyzing the effect of
changes in licensure legislation on health worker incomes or quantity, price, or quality of
health services; and third, studies investigating the influence of political power of interest
groups on the passage of licensure legislation. While several studies suggest that “interest
group” explanation of the existence of licensure hold true, the evidence is not conclusive.
Most of the studies we reviewed merely show that health workers have benefited from
licensure legislation (studies in the first and second category) or that health worker groups
have had some influence on licensure legislation (studies in the third category), but fail to
demonstrate that consumers suffered a welfare loss. Thus, these studies cannot rule out that
licensure legislation served the public interest. The studies of licensure effect on quality or
quantity of health services are an exception. A decrease in the quality of health services rules
out an increase in consumer welfare and an increase (decrease) in the quantity of health
services consumed implies an increase (decrease) in consumer welfare. However, the few
studies that investigated the effect of licensure on the quality or quantity of health services
suffer from technical limitations in measurement of variables and effect estimation, so the
evidence – again – is not conclusive.

An important shortcoming of the literature on health worker licensure is that almost all
published studies were conducted in the US, even though health worker licensure regulations
exist in most developed and developing countries. The US health services market has

                                                33
characteristics that are rarely found in other countries. Some of these characteristics are
likely to influence the effect of licensure on market outcomes. For instance, in the US, health
workers may already have strong incentives to provide high-quality health services because
of the high costs associated with health care malpractice suits. The marginal effect that
licensure can have on market outcomes may thus be lower in the US compared to settings
where malpractice suits are less expensive. Future studies need to investigate causes and
effects of licensure regulation in other countries.

Two further criticisms apply to studies in the first and the second category. First, the real
effects of licensure may differ from the effects that legislators or interest groups intend to
achieve. Changes in licensure regulation are infrequent events. Legislators and members of
interest groups will thus have little opportunity to observe the effects of licensure laws and to
learn from failures. Hence, inferences about the behavior of actors in the regulatory process
based on observed effects of regulation (as done in many of the studies discussed above) may
be invalid. A case in point is a study on the regulation of physiotherapists in the US. Sass
and Nichols (Sass & Nichols, 1996) found “that physical therapists have devoted
considerable effort to obtain passage of laws that ultimately result in lower wages”. As an
explanation of “this seemingly perverse result” the authors consider that physical therapists
incorrectly believed that the professional regulation would increase their earnings (Sass &
Nichols, 1996).

Second, analyses belonging to the first and the second category of licensure studies are
concerned with structures and outcomes in the market for health services. Health services,
however, are merely instruments to attain better health. It is therefore possible that
consumers suffered a welfare loss in the market for health services, while overall consumer
welfare increased. For instance, licensure regulation may have prevented incompetent health
workers from providing a health service intended to reduce childhood mortality. The
resulting inward shift in supply (due to the exclusion of health workers from the market) may
have exceeded the outward shift in demand (due to the increase in average quality of the
service), so that consumers suffered a welfare loss in the market for that health service.
Nevertheless, more children may have survived (since the fewer children who did receive the
service received a better service) and overall consumer welfare may thus have increased. In
measuring the effect of licensure on social welfare, future studies should thus include the
value of changes in population health outcomes due to licensure regulation.

IV. Third phase: The health worker as necessary resource

IV.1 Background

In the 1990s and 2000s, the lack of health workers became a major research focus in
developed and developing countries. In contrast to the first phase (see above), health worker
shortages in developed countries were local rather than nationwide, occurring in so-called
medically underserved areas, which were most commonly rural or remote areas but included
also certain areas in cities where predominantly poor people seek health care.17 In 2002,
Brooks and colleagues described health worker maldistribution and the resulting health
worker shortages in underserved areas in the US (Brooks, Walsh, Mardon, Lewis, &
Clawson, 2002):

“While 20% of the population of the United States resides in rural areas, less than 11% of
physicians practice in rural communities. Despite the fact that the supply of physicians has
increased over the last 20 years, the percentage of physicians practicing primary care
specialties has declined. Although the overall number of physicians practicing in rural areas
has increased, the proportion relative to urban areas continues to decline. In sum, it continues
to be difficult to attract and retain physicians in rural areas, particularly primary care
physicians.”

Six years later, Rabinowitz and colleagues repeated, in essence, Brooks’ problem statement
(Rabinowitz, Diamond, Markham, & Wortman, 2008):

“The persistent shortage of physicians in rural areas continues to have a major impact on
access to care for those living in small communities. Although one of every five Americans
(20%) lives in a rural area, only 9% of physicians practice there. The scope of this problem is
substantial, because more than 20 million of the 60 million people residing in rural areas live
in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas (HSPAs). This rural physician
shortage has existed for more than 80 years, despite the fact that, in general, people living in
rural areas have a greater need for medical care, being older, sicker, and poorer than their
nonrural peers. Of greater concern, the future rural physician workforce is likely to decline



17
  A medically underserved area is an area where the number of health workers falls below a target. As
described in section II., such targets can be based on need, demand, or supply criteria (such as service targets or
population ratios). Commonly, a mix of criteria is used in the definition of underserved areas (Bärnighausen &
Bloom, 2009b).

                                                        35
even further, with only 3% of recent medical students planning to practice in small towns and
rural areas.”

In developing countries, evidence emerged that the population density of health workers
affected both population health outcomes (such as child mortality (Anand & Bärnighausen,
2004)) and health systems outcomes (such as childhood vaccination coverage (Anand &
Bärnighausen, 2007)), emphasizing the need to increase health worker education and
retention in developing countries (Joint Learning Initiative, 2004; WHO, 2006b). In addition,
with the adoption of the MDGs by national governments and international organizations,
health became a major focus of development policies. In particular, the fourth MDG
(“reduce child mortality”), the fifth MDG (“improve maternal health”), and the sixth MDG
(“combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases”) emphasized population health
improvements as primary goals of development (United Nations, 2009). While these goals
do not depend on health services delivery alone, they are unlikely to be achieved without
substantial increases in service coverage in developing countries. The indicators used to
monitor the progress towards the health MDGs include health service targets, e.g., the
proportion of one-year old children immunized against measles (for the fourth MDG), the
proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (for the fifth MDG), and the
proportion of population with advanced HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs (for
the sixth MDG) (United Nations, 2009). It soon became apparent that such health service
targets could not be achieved without substantially increasing the health workforce in
developing countries (Joint Learning Initiative, 2004; WHO, 2006b, 2008).18 Access to
antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a case in point. A number of studies modeling the need for
health workers to provide universal access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) showed that at
current health worker education and migration rates in developing countries it is very
unlikely that sufficient health workers will be available to treat most patients needing ART in
the foreseeable future (Bärnighausen & Bloom, 2009a; Bärnighausen, Bloom, & Humair,
2007). Even at current levels of relatively low ART coverage, many developing countries are
struggling to find the health workers necessary to further expand coverage (Clark, 2006;
IOM, 2007; Kober & Van Damme, 2004; MSF, 2007; Ooms, Van Damme, & Temmerman,
2007).

18
  Of course, increases in the efficiency of health care delivery, e.g. through changes in health worker team
composition and task shifting from more to less highly educated health workers , could decrease the gap
between current health worker numbers and the numbers required to achieve the health MDGs. However, it is
very unlikely that efficiency increases can eliminate the gap (WHO, 2008).

                                                     36
The shift in perspective from regarding health workers as economic agents to viewing them
as a resource necessary to improve population health in underserved areas of developed and
developing countries led to research on means to increase health worker supplies to such
areas. In the following, we review two major topics in this third phase of research on the
health workforce: first, programs aimed at attracting health workers to underserved areas in
developed countries; and, second, health worker emigration from developing to developed
countries (Aiken, Buchan, Sochalski, Nichols, & Powell, 2004). While the supply of health
workers to underserved areas and regions is not only a function of health worker movements,
but also of education rates (Bärnighausen & Bloom, 2009a), studies on health worker
education are few (Eckhert, 2002) and thus do not warrant a review.

IV.2 Developed countries: interventions to increase the supply of health workers to
underserved areas
Programs to increase the supply of health workers to underserved areas can affect health
workers in different stages of their careers. Before the start of training to become a health
worker, selective admission strategies attempt to increase the number health workers who
will practice in underserved area by selecting those individuals into health care training who
– given observable characteristics – are most likely to work in underserved areas after
graduation. During training, curricula specific to health needs in underserved areas and
exposure to practice in such areas attempt to increase graduates’ likelihood of choosing
underserved practice by specifically preparing them for this type of service. Lastly, financial-
incentive programs offer scholarships (during training) or loan repayments (after training) in
return for service in underserved areas (Bärnighausen & Bloom, 2008). Table 3 shows an
overview of studies extracted from three recent systematic reviews of four types of programs
(selective admission to medical school, medical school training for practice in underserved
areas, residency training for practice in underserved areas (Brooks et al., 2002; Rabinowitz et
al., 2008), and finanicial-incentive programs for return of service in underserved areas
(Bärnighausen & Bloom, 2009b)), supplemented by studies identified through additional
literature searches by the authors of this chapter using the PubMed and Econlit databases.

We excluded from the overview in Table 3 studies that merely described program results and
included only those studies that compared outcomes in program participants with outcomes in
non-participants. All included studies measured an outcome in either one of two categories:
provision of care – if the study compared all health workers enrolled in a program to all
health workers – or retention – if the study compared only those enrolled and non-enrolled

                                               37
health workers who at some point took up practice in an underserved area. Two types of
retention outcomes can be distinguished: retention in the same underserved area (i.e., a health
worker leaving a particular underserved area to work in another underserved area counts as
non-retention) and retention in any underserved (i.e., a health worker leaving a particular
underserved area to work in another underserved area counts as retention).

Our extraction and literature searches identified only one study reporting the effect of
selective admission to medical school without additional medical school training to prepare
students for practice in underserved areas (Basco, Buchbinder, Duggan, & Wilson, 1998).
The study found – unsurprisingly – that students attending medical schools with selective
admission targeting future generalists were significantly more interested in primary care and
in rural practice than students attending medical schools that did not have such a selective
admission policy. Other studies investigated programs that trained (future) health workers
specifically for practice in underserved areas either during medical school (without or without
an explicit selective admission policies) or during residency. These studies found that
participants in these programs were significantly more likely than non-participants to practice
in underserved areas (Bowman & Penrod, 1998; Brazeau, Potts, & Hickner, 1990; Fryer,
Stine, Krugman, & Miyoshi, 1994; Rabinowitz, 1993; Rabinowitz, Diamond, Markham, &
Hazelwood, 1999b; Rabinowitz, Diamond, Markham, & Paynter, 2001; Smucny, Beatty,
Grant, Dennison, & Wolff, 2005), to intend to practice in underserved areas (Rosenthal,
2000), and to remain in the same underserved area (Pathman, Steiner, Jones, & Konrad,
1999; Rabinowitz, Diamond, Markham, & Rabinowitz, 2005) – with only one exception,
which did not find any significant difference between participants and non-participants
(Rabinowitz, Diamond, Hojat, & Hazelwood, 1999a).

Five of seven studies investigating the effect of participation in financial-incentive programs
on retention in the same underserved found that participants were significantly less likely to
remain in the same underserved area (G. M. Holmes, 2004; Pathman, Konrad, King, Taylor,
& Koch, 2004; Pathman, Konrad, & Ricketts, 1992, 1994a, b), while one study did not report
a significance level but found substantially lower retention among participants (Singer,
Davidson, Graham, & Davidson, 1998), and another study did not find a significant
difference (Jackson, Shannon, Pathman, Mason, & Nemitz, 2003).

On the other hand, 10 of the 12 studies investigating the effect of financial-incentive
programs on provision of care or retention in any underserved area found that participants

                                               38
were more likely to provide care to underserved populations (Brooks, Mardon, & Clawson,
2003; Inoue, Matsumoto, & Sawada, 2007; Matsumoto, Inoue, & Kajii, 2008; Pathman,
Konrad, King, Spaulding, & Taylor, 2000; Probst, Samuels, Shaw, Hart, & Daly, 2003;
Rabinowitz, Diamond, Veloski, & Gayle, 2000; Rittenhouse, Fryer, Phillips, Miyoshi,
Nielsen, Goodman et al., 2008; Xu, Fields, Laine, Veloski, Barzansky, & Martini, 1997a; Xu,
Veloski, Hojat, Politzer, Rabinowitz, & Rattner, 1997b) and to continue to practice in some
underserved area (G. M. Holmes, 2004; Pathman et al., 2000) . These differences were
shown to be statistically significant in eight of the ten studies (Brooks et al., 2003; G. M.
Holmes, 2004; Pathman et al., 2000; Probst et al., 2003; Rabinowitz et al., 2000; Rittenhouse
et al., 2008; Xu et al., 1997a; Xu et al., 1997b), while two studies did not provide the results
of significance tests (Inoue et al., 2007; Matsumoto et al., 2008) and two other studies
reported that participants were significantly less likely than non-participants to remain in
some underserved area (Matsumoto et al., 2008; Pathman et al., 1992).

In all of the above studies, the (future) health workers chose to participate in a program. It is
thus difficult to distinguish whether the finding that program participants are more (or less)
likely to provide care in underserved areas or to remain in an underserved area is a true effect
of program participation or merely a selection effect. Selection issues are particularly
apparent in the evaluation of programs with selective admission policies. All of the studies
evaluating such programs compare participating health care students to their non-
participating peers. However, such peers are unlikely to be a good counterfactual, because
they will on average be less likely than the participants to have the characteristic required for
participation in the program, e.g., rural upbringing or self-declared interest in primary health
care. As the selection criterion was likely chosen because it was observed to be positively
associated with practice in underserved areas, we would expect that observed differences in
the likelihood to practice in underserved areas between participating and non-participating
health care students can be (partially) explained by selective admission.

Indeed, the one study that does not find any significant difference in the provision of care in
underserved areas between participants and non-participants in a program with selective
admission (and medical school training for rural practice) controlled for rural upbringing in
the analysis (Rabinowitz et al., 1999a) – while the program “recruits and selectively admits
medical school applicants who have grown up in a rural area and intend to practice family
medicine in rural and underserved areas” (Rabinowitz et al., 1999b).


                                                39
Another study of the same program concludes that “the admission component of the PSAP
[Physician Shortage Area Program] is the most important reason for its success” (Rabinowitz
et al., 2001). Implicit in such a conclusion is the assumption that a large proportion of
participants would not have studied to become health workers, had they not enrolled in the
program. If this assumption were not met, the program would not have increased the supply
of health workers to underserved areas and could thus not be called a “success”.

Of the 16 studies of program effect in Table 3, 14 controlled for additional variables in the
comparison between participants and non-participants, such as sex, age, ethnicity, marital
status, medical specialty (Bowman & Penrod, 1998; G. M. Holmes, 2004; Pathman et al.,
2000; Pathman et al., 2004; Pathman et al., 1992, 1994b; Probst et al., 2003; Rabinowitz et
al., 1999a; Rabinowitz et al., 1999b; Rabinowitz et al., 2001; Rabinowitz et al., 2000;
Rittenhouse et al., 2008; Xu et al., 1997a; Xu et al., 1997b). However, even those studies that
control for factors likely to be closely related to care provision and retention in underserved
areas (such as growing up in an underserved area (Rabinowitz et al., 1999a; Rabinowitz et al.,
2000; Xu et al., 1997a; Xu et al., 1997b) or “strong interest” prior to medical school to
practice as a doctor in an underserved area (Rabinowitz et al., 2000; Xu et al., 1997b)) cannot
rule out that participants selected into the program on unobserved characteristics related to
the preference of working in underserved areas.

Only one study of program effect attempted to control for selection on unobserved variables
by using a selection model (G. M. Holmes, 2004). In order to identify the program effect, the
study used four medical school characteristics: “historical proportion of graduates
specializing in primary care”, “quality of the school”, a “tuition index”, and a “public school
indicator”. The use of these identifying variables assumes that they influenced selection into
the program but did not affect the provision of care in underserved areas other than through
their effect on program participation. However, the type of medical school that students
attend is likely to be related not only to the decision to enroll in financial-incentive programs,
but also – independent of program participation – to the decision to work in underserved
areas. For instance, students with strong preferences to work in underserved areas may be
more likely than their peers with weaker preferences for such care to select medical schools
with a high “historical proportion” of graduates pursuing careers in primary care, because
such schools are likely to focus on medical education relevant for underserved areas. This
selection may determine work location decisions, independent of any effect the medical


                                                40
school characteristic may have on participation in the programs. Thus the characteristics may
not be valid variables to identify program effects.

In sum, studies evaluating programs aimed at increasing the supply of health workers to
underserved area find that participants are more likely to provide care for underserved
population and to remain in underserved areas in the long run (even if not in the same
underserved area where they were initially placed). However, because the studies to date
have not convincingly controlled for selection effects, the evidence to date does not allow the
inference that the programs have caused increases in health worker supply to underserved
areas.

          Medicaid is a means-tested health program funded by the US federal government and the states. It covers health care expenditures of some categories of low-
        income individuals, including children, parents, pregnant women, and children with disabilities (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2009).

IV.3 Developing countries: health worker emigration

In the past decade, health worker migration from developing to developed countries has been a
common topic of editorials (Bundred & Levitt, 2000; Chen & Boufford, 2005; Mullan, 2007;
Pang, Lansang, & Haines, 2002), policy reports (International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP),
2006; Joint Learning Initiative, 2004; WHO, 2006b), and scientific publications. Below, we
summarize the research on international health worker migration regarding measurement (i.e.,
studies estimating the size of migration flows from developing to developed countries or the
stock of health workers who have migrated), causes (i.e., studies investigating migration
reasons), welfare impact (i.e., studies investigating how health worker migration affects social
welfare in source or recipient countries), and programs and policies (i.e., publications discussing
potential interventions to reduce migration or minimize any negative consequences of
international health worker migration).

Numerous studies have described international migration flows or stocks of in- or out-migrated
health workers for individual migration source countries (e.g., India , Zimbabwe (Chikanda,
2005), Ghana (Dovlo & Nyonator, 1999), India (Kaushik, Jaiswal, Shah, & Mahal, 2008),
Malawi (Zijlstra & Broadhead, 2007), Philippines (Institute of Health Policy and Development
Studies, 2005)) or from individual recipient countries (e.g., UK (Buchan, 2002; Buchan,
Baldwin, & Mundo, 2008), USA (Akl, Maroun, Major, Chahoud, & Schunemann, 2007; Akl,
Mustafa, Bdair, & Schunemann, 2007; Brush, Sochalski, & Berger, 2004), Italy (Chaloff, 2008),
Canada (Dumont, Zurn, Church, & Le Thi, 2008), New Zealand (Zurn & Dumont, 2008)). While
data on health worker migration published in these studies is useful to demonstrate the
magnitude of health worker migration from developing to developed countries, it is insufficient
for many research purposes. For one, the country-level data cannot be pooled for multi-country
analyses, because different studies used different methods to estimate the size of migration flows
and stocks. In addition, most of the studies covered only short periods of time. Finally, some
studies measured only migration of health workers who graduated from specific institutions or
regions in a country (e.g., (Zijlstra & Broadhead, 2007)).

Four different studies have published datasets of stocks of emigrated health workers from a
number of countries (Clemens & Pettersson, 2008; Hagopian, Thompson, Fordyce, Johnson, &



                                                51
Hart, 2004; Mullan, 2005; OECD, 2005; WHO, 2006b).21 All of the four datasets used numbers
of health workers reported in recipient countries in order to estimate the magnitude of emigration
from source countries. The stock estimates differ substantially across the datasets (see Table 4).
These discrepancies are due to several factors, demonstrating some of the difficulties in
estimating international health worker migration flows.

First, the four datasets used different sources of information on the numbers of foreign
physicians in recipient countries. WHO/OECD (OECD, 2005; WHO, 2006b) and Clemens and
Petterson (Clemens & Pettersson, 2008) used national census data, while Mullan (Mullan, 2005)
and Hagopian and colleagues (Hagopian et al., 2004) used data from health workers’
professional organizations.

Second, in order to estimate emigration stocks the different studies counted health workers in
different sets of recipient countries – WHO/OECD counted health workers in the UK, US,
Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Portugal; Clemens and Pettersson in the UK, US,
Australia, Canada, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, South Africa; Mullan in the UK, US,
Australia and Canada; and Hagopian and colleagues in the UK and US.

Third, the different datasets used different definitions of migrant health workers. WHO, Mullan,
and Hagopian and colleagues defined a migrant health worker as one who was trained in another
country, while Clemens and Pettersson defined a migrant health worker as one born in another
country. This distinction is important, because some of the countries with the worldwide lowest
population densities of health workers (such as Lesotho and Swaziland (WHO, 2009)) do not
have their own medical school and thus depend on physicians trained in other countries – in
particular their own citizens – to staff their hospitals and clinics (Clemens & Pettersson, 2008).
According to the definition of a migrant health worker as one who was trained in another
country, these countries can never have any emigrated physicians and any physician working in
these countries will always be an immigrant. Last, the four datasets estimate stocks of emigrated
health workers for different years (Table 4).

     The data reported in WHO 2006 (WHO, 2006b) is extracted from OECD 2005 (OECD, 2005).

One comprehensive dataset provides physician emigration rates for all countries worldwide for
each year in the period 1991-2004 (Docquier & Bhargava, 2006, 2007). Figure 3 shows annual
emigration rates (in % per year) for the year 2004 for all countries in sub-Saharan Africa covered
in the dataset. According to the dataset, in 2004 emigration rates exceeded 10% in seventeen
countries in the region and 20% in eight countries. Such panel on health worker emigration rates
is extremely useful for a wide range of analyses, including on the causes and consequences of
health worker migration. However, the dataset has a number of limitations. For one, the
definition of migrant physician used for different recipient countries in the dataset differed across
recipient countries (a physicians born in another country, a physician with citizenship in another
country, and a physician trained in another country) (Clemens & Pettersson, 2008). Moreover,
the data on physicians who immigrated to a recipient country was available for all fourteen years
from 1991 through 2004 for only 4 of the 16 recipient countries across which physician numbers
were summed to estimate emigration flows from source countries. For all other recipient
countries, the authors intra- or extrapolated some country-year values of emigrated physicians.

The relatively recent arrival of the above datasets and the fact that each suffers from some
limitations may explain why the literature on causes of health worker migration is largely
descriptive and the literature on the welfare impact of the migration is small. Studies on the
causes of health worker migration investigated reasons for migration decisions through surveys
of health workers in both source and recipient countries. In these surveys, health workers
consistently listed higher earnings in other countries as one of the most important reasons for
migration plans or past migration (Awases, Gbary, Nyoni, & Chatora, 2004; Chikanda, 2005;
Luck, Fernandes, & Ferrinho, 2000; Mackintosh, 2003; Martineau, Decker, & Bundred, 2002;
Nguyen, Ropers, Nderitu, Zuyderduin, Luboga, & Hagopian, 2008). However, health workers
also named a number of other factors as influencing their migration decisions, including job
security, flexible leave policies (Mackintosh, 2003), opportunities for education and training
(Awases et al., 2004; Mackintosh, 2003; Oman, Moulds, & Usher, 2009), opportunities for
promotion (Bach, 2004; Buchan, Parkin, & Sochalski, 2003; Muula & Maseko, 2006), the
management of health services (Bach, 2004; Chikanda, 2005; Kingma, 2006; Luck et al., 2000),
workplace safety (in particular the risk of work-related HIV infection (Bossert et al., 2007;
Institute of Health Policy and Development Studies, 2005; Muula & Maseko, 2006; Palmer,
2006)), family welfare (Chikanda, 2005; Oman et al., 2009), and country stability (Chikanda,
2005; Nguyen et al., 2008; Oman et al., 2009). Non-financial factors appear to be nearly as
important as earnings differentials in motivating migration, but the patterns of important non-
financial factors differ across countries (Awases et al., 2004).

Despite a well-developed economics literature on the welfare impact of migration (e.g., (Borjas,
1995; Goldfarb, Havrylyshyn, & Magnum, 1984; Grubel & Scott, 1966; Kwok & Leland,
1982)), only a few studies have examined the particular impact of international health worker
migration on social welfare in source and recipient countries. Studies in Kenya (Kirigia, Gbary,
Muthuri, Nyoni, & Seddoh, 2006) and Malawi (Muula, Panulo, & Maseko, 2006) estimated the
financial loss due emigration of a health workers as the total costs of educating such a health
worker (including tuition, study materials, accommodation , and living expenses during primary,
secondary and tertiary education). The estimated losses of returns on investment were about half
a million year-2005 US$ for a doctor in Kenya, more than 300 thousand year-2005 US$ for a
nurse in Kenya (Kirigia et al., 2006), and between approximately 240 thousand year-2005 US$
(when an interest rate of 7% per annum is used) and 26 million year-2005 US$ (when an interest

                                                 55
rate of 25% is used) (Muula et al., 2006). While these financial losses seem large, two studies of
remittances from emigrated health workers found that the remittances (of Filipino physicians
(Goldfarb et al., 1984) and Tongan and Samoan nurses (Connell & Brown, 2004)) exceeded the
initial investment in their human capital, suggesting that in some countries it may pay to train
health workers for export.

Another study estimated the social net present value of a financial incentive that pays fully for a
student’s education as a health worker in return for a few years of service in an ART program in
sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that these financial incentives are highly cost-beneficial if
they are effective in reducing health worker emigration. For instance, if the only effect of the
financial incentive were to reduce annual health worker emigration from 12% to 5% for five
years, the net present value of financing the education of a team of health workers sufficient to
treat 500 ART patients would be more than 200 thousand year-2000 US$ (Bärnighausen &
Bloom, 2009a).

A final set of publications on health worker migration has discusses potential programs and
policies to reduce emigration of health workers from developing countries or to mitigate negative
consequences of migration. Table 5 summarizes the proposed interventions. Some the programs
and policies have already been implemented in developing countries (such as compulsory service
(Reid, 2001) or financial-incentive programs (Ross, 2007) in South Africa or non-financial
incentives in Zambia (Koot & Martineau, 2005)) or been adopted by developed countries (such
as the UK’s “ethical recruitment policy” (Carlisle, 2004)). However, studies evaluating the
effect of the implemented programs and policies on health worker migration – similar to those
evaluating programs to increase the supply of health workers to underserved areas in developed
countries – are as of yet lacking.

In sum, although the recent focus of development policy on population health has sparked
research on health worker migration from developing to developed countries, the majority of
studies are descriptive in nature, in part, because comprehensive data on international migration
flows of health workers has not been available. Future initiatives need to emphasize further
improvements in data on international health worker migration. Once validated data are
available, researchers can draw on the extensive literature and theories of migration in economics



                                                 56
and other disciplines to further investigate the causes and consequences of health worker
migration and to evaluate existing interventions to reduce migration rates.

V. Conclusions
In this paper, we have reviewed research on the health workforce since the 1960s. We have
structured the review into three perspectives corresponding roughly to three chronological
phases. During the first phase – which is associated with the perspective “health workforce
planning” – shortages of health workers in developed countries triggered research on manpower
planning methods to aid policy makers in ensuring adequate supplies of health workers (1960s
through 1970s). Four main approaches to project future health worker requirements were
developed, viz., approaches based on health need, demand for health care, health care service
targets, and health worker-to-population ratios. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of
each of the four approaches and show that modified versions of the approaches, in particular the
service targets approach, are experiencing a renaissance in current studies estimating health
worker requirements to meet population health goals, such as the health MDGs, in developing
countries.

During the second phase – which is associated with the perspective “the health worker as
economic actor“ – a perceived “cost explosion” in many health systems in developed countries
shifted the research focus to the study of the influence of health workers’ behavior on allocative
and technical efficiency in health systems (1980s through 1990s). We review the literature on
one particular research topic during this phase, health worker licensure, which investigated
whether licensure regulation was introduced to benefit health worker “interest groups” or to
serve the “public interest”. We describe three categories of studies testing “interest group”
against “public interest” explanations of the existence of health worker licensure. Studies in the
first category, “market structure”, measured the level of competitiveness in the health care
market, taking competitive structures as evidence against and monopolistic structures as
evidence for “interest group” explanations; studies in the second category, “licensure effects”,
examined the influence of licensure on health worker incomes, and the price, quality, and
quantity of health services; studies in the third category, “political power”, analyzed the
relationship between the political power of health worker interest groups and the passage of
licensure legislation. While the findings of several studies suggest that “interest group”
explanation of the existence of licensure hold true, the evidence is not conclusive because of
technical limitations and conceptual problems in the analytical approaches.


                                                 59
During the third phase – which is associated with the perspective “the health worker as necessary
resource” – local health worker shortages in developed countries and regional shortages in
developing countries sparked research investigating the effectiveness of interventions to increase
the supply of health workers to so-called underserved areas of developed countries and health
worker migration from developing to developed countries (1990s through 2000s). Several
studies showed that participants in programs aimed at increasing the number of health workers in
underserved areas (such as selective admission to health worker education or financial-incentives
for return of service) were more likely to provide care in such areas than their peers who did not
participate. However, the studies could not conclude that the programs caused an increase in the
supply of health workers to underserved areas, because they cannot rule out that selection rather
than program effects was responsible for the differences in the behavior between program
participants and non-participants. International health worker migration has recently emerged as
a research topic (including studies on the causes and consequences of such migration), but has
been hampered by the lack of validated data on health worker migration flows and stocks of
migrated health workers.

Of course, the three research perspectives on the global health workforce are merely stylized
descriptions of main research thrusts and do not imply that such foci were necessarily the best
use of research resources during the different phases. Moreover, the three perspectives are not
mutually exclusive. For instance, some of the studies undertaken from a perspective of the
health worker as a necessary resource use health workforce planning approaches to estimate the
size of the gap between available and needed health workers – even if the starting point of these
studies is an observed health worker constraint in the delivery of certain priority health
interventions. Other studies that are motivated by a perceived or measured lack of health
workers clearly view health workers as economic actors that consider financial and non-financial
incentives in their location decisions.

Opportunities for future research on the health workforce abound. While they are likely to
include new approaches to the study, our review suggests that the transfer of existing approaches
from developed to developing countries could lead to important insights. For instance, studies
on health worker licensure were mostly carried out in the US. It seems likely that the strength of
health worker “interest groups” relative to the power of the public differs across stages of


                                                 60
socioeconomic development and by type of health system. Evidence on the causes and effects of
health worker licensure in different developing countries is thus likely to contribute substantially
to the licensure debate. Another example where transfer of research topics and methods could
lead to important insights is programs to influence health workers’ location decisions. Programs
similar to those aimed at increasing the supply of health workers to underserved areas in
developed countries have been implemented in many developing countries. Unlike their
developed-country counterparts, however, they have yet to be evaluated in their impact on health
worker movements from well-served to underserved areas and from developing to developed
countries, suggesting the need for a coherent economic model of medical migration..
