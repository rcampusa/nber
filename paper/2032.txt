         Consumption and Government-Budget Finance in a High-Deficit Economy




                                      ABSTRACT



         This paper characterizes empirically how government budget variables,

such as spending, taxes, and deficits, affected private—sector consumption in

the high—budget—deficit economy of Israel during the first half of the

1980g. The paper develops and estimates an intertemporal optimizing model of

consumption choice by finite—lived individuals. The evidence supports this

formulation against the Ricardian infinite—horizon case, but it does not

support it when compared to the unrestricted relations in the data.

1. Introduction

         The impact of government budget variables on private—sector

consumption is a key issue in assessing the implications of fiscal. and

monetary policy on the real side of the economy. In fact there are sharp

controversies on this topic, most of which center around the Ricardian—

Equivalence proposition !'.   The main purpose of this paper is to provide

empirical evidence on this key issue for the case of Israel in the first half

of the 1980s. This case is of particular interest because of the high

volatility of movements in the budget deficit, government spending, and

private consumption in an economy with unusually high government budget

deficit; the deficit amounting to 15% of output, on average, during this

period. These characteristics differ from those of the more stable

environments studied in previous empirical works, and thus enable a more

powerful test of the comovements of private—sector consumption and public—

sector spending and financing variables.

         The standard approach in empirical studies of these comovements has

been based on directly specifying regression equations linking consumption to

disposable income, measures of wealth, government spending, taxes, etc. (See

e.g., Kochin (1974), Tanner (1979), Feldstein (1982), Seater (1982), Kormendi

(1983), Reid (1985)). While the results from applying this approach are

informative, a limitation, which makes the interpretation of the results

ambiguous, is that the connection between the estimated equations and the

underlying theoretical model is not made explicit. In contrast, the present

 study adopts an intertemporal optimizing framework whose implications, derived

explicitly in the analysis, are the subject of empirical tests.

          Since the seminal contribution of Hall (1978), numerous studies have

 applied the intertemporal optimizing approach to examine consumption
FR—031/DPR/09—02—86                     2




behavior. However, almost none of these studies focus on the comovements of

consumption and government—budget variables. V   Moreover, these studies
typically assume an infinite—horizon consumer. This assumption severely

restricts the economic channels through which government—budget finance exerts

its effects on consumption, resulting in an extreme case where the model

exhibits Ricardian properties. To move away from this extreme case, Blanchard

(1985) extended the intertemporal framework by relaxing the infinite—horizon

assumption. His formulation allows for a richer set of interactions between

government—budget—deficit variables and consumption, with Ricardian

implications emerging only as a special case.

         In this investigation, we develop a version of Blanchard's model and

implement it to monthly time series data for Israel covering the 1980—1985

period. Section 2 outlines the model and derives the equations to be

estimated. Empirical results are reported in Section 3, and Section 4

contains concluding remarks.



2. The Model

         We assume that there are overlapping generations of rational agents

that, due to mortality, have finite horizons. Specifically, there is a

probability y, smaller than unity, that individuals will survive to the next

period. A small open economy is considered, one that takes as given the world

interest rate.

         Aggregating the budget constraints of all age groups yields the

following economy—wide budget constraint:



         C
             t
                 B—RB1'
                  t  t—1
                         +Yt —Tt    ,                                      (1)
FR—031/DPR/09—02—86                      3




where C denotes consumption; B is new private—sector debt at t; RB_1

represents the repayment of old debt at t (with R denoting one plus the

riskiess world real interest rate)           Y denotes real income and T the value

of taxes. All variables are expressed in units of the all—purpose consumption

good.

           Under the assumptions that individuals maximize expected lifetime

utility and that utility exhibits a constant intertemporal elasticity of

substitution, a, the aggregative consumption function can be written (in per—

capita terms) as:



             = (l—s)W    ,                                                   (2)


where W is wealth and s is the savings/wealth ratio, expressed as
  =   ala       and where 6 is the subjective discount factor. Wealth is equal

to the difference between the present value of future disposable income,

      and the value of past debt coninitment RB_1. Accordingly,



             =      — RB1,                                                   (3)



and, in turn,



          H =     = (.r(Yt+ — T+).

Note that the discount factor used in computing the present value of future

incomes is the effective (risk adjusted) factor, yIR.
FR—031/DPR/09—02—86                            4



         Substituting (2) into the budget constraint (1) yields




         B =          + (l_s)(H—RB_i)          —
                                                           + T1,

which in turn can be written as




         B = — s(H     —
                           RB_1)
                                    +              .                                  (6)


Using a similar expression for B1 and the definition of W we can now

express consumption as follows:



         C = (l—s)(l—Y)H        +
                                    aRC1

         Notice that        includes current and future taxes that are imposed on

the private sector. From the intertemporal government budget constraint, the

present value of taxes is given by




               RT = Rt(Ct+                 —
                                               D+)     +
                                                           RB_1,                       (8)




where C is the real value of government spending, D is the real value of the

change in the monetary base induced by the budget deficit, and BC is

government debt J. Substituting this expression into                     and into eq. (7)

yields




          c = (1_s)(1_y)[()TYt+
                                                                   —

                                               _0()t(Gt+t              D+)

               +           —               —               +
                               (Y)T)T          RB_11           sRC_i
FR—031/DPR/09—02—86                      5




          Eq. (9) summarizes the implications of the model for the comovements

of consumption and government—budget variables and thus constitutes the focal

relation for our empirical work. Note that the present formulation is general

enough to encompass both Ricardian and non—Ricardian systems as special

cases. The key parameter, in this context, is y. When y = 1 the system

possesses Ricardian neutrality, and eq. (9) indicates that only C_1 can be

used to predict C (as in Hall (1978)). However, when y < 1, the variable

affects current consumption over and beyond the impact of C_1. For example,

a current—period cut in taxes will result in an increase in perceived wealth

(through an increase in He). The reason is that the future tax increases that

are needed in order to balance the intertemporal budget constraint of

government are given a smaller weight, by the finite—horizon consumers, than

the weight they attach to the current cut in taxes.



3. Empirical Results

          To implement eq. (9) it is necessary to specify a tractable empirical

counterpart for the infinite forward—looking sums in this equation. The

specification that we adopt assumes that all individuals alive at time t

expect future values of the components of H to remain at their current (time

t) levels. It is further assumed that the econometrician observes

individuals' Ht up to an error term
                                        '     which is orthogonal to presently
known   information   at time t. Imposing these assumptions yields



                           —                                              +
c = (1—s)(1—.y)[(—)Y                      +
                                              (   _Y)Tt_RB_i1 + sRc_i         c•   (10)
FR—O31IDPR/09—02—86                            6




         Several versions of this equation are estimated on the basis of

Israeli monthly data for the period 1980—1985. The use of monthly data

clearly limits our choices of the actual time series that serve as

counterparts for the variables in the model. For consumption we use two

indices: one of total purchases within the organized retail trade, C, and

another one, C, which excludes purchases of consumer durables from the

total. Total wage bill is used for Y; for C we use public—sector outlays

(excluding debt service); for T we use government tax receipts; and for D we

use the amount of money financing of the government—budget deficit. Since no

data are available on the stock of government debt, on a monthly basis, we

construct a proxy for this variable by using the accounting relation

B = RB1    +           — Tt — Dt.   Accordingly, we obtain



                   =       att(c_      Tt D) + Rtl(R_1B1)
                                                                .               (11)


Substituting Eq. (11) into (10) yields the following equation



         C =                             — (T)(C—D)     +
                                                             (R_1XR_y)Tt


               —          —                +       ,                            (12)
                   BG1        (R1BC1)B1]

where B1G is the summation term on the right hand side of (11), and

       Rtl. The data source is Bank of Israel's publication Recent Economic

Developments (various issues).

         Tables 1 and 2 give the estimated equations J.             Row 1 in the tables

reports estimates of the unrestricted version of (12). With the exception of

    all the coefficients on the government budget variables are statistically
FR—031/DpR/09—02—86                       7




significant, but only those of       and T obtain the hypothesized signs. Row 2

imposes the Ricardian—neutrality restriction y = 1.             Comparing the fits of

these equations with the fits of the unrestricted equation yields the

statistics F(6, 62) = 12.71 and 9.50 for Tables 1 and 2 respectively. This

indicates rejection of the neutrality hypothesis at standard significance

levels. Row 3 reports estimates of (12) under the restrictions that are

implied by the model. To get parameter estimates we set the interest factor

at R =   1.002 and thus obtain the values of y and s reported in the tables.

(These estimates are quite insensitive to the choice of alternative,

plausible, values of R). For both tables, the annualized value of the

probability of survival turns out to be 0.988. The estimates for s are more

difficult to interpret because this parameter depends on two unknown

parameters, the subjective discount factor 6 and the intertemporal elasticity
                                                   a—i
of substitution a, as follows: s =     (y/6)(6R)         .     For example, if a =   0 then

s =   (y/R)   and from this perspective our estimated values for a appear to be

too low. However, if 6R < 1, which is the case of a net borrower, large

values of a yield low values of s, and from this perspective our estimates are

too high. Comparing the fits of Rows 2 and 3 yields the statistics

F(1, 67) = 21.67 and 17.22, which are statistically significant at the SZ

level. These results support relaxing the y =        1       restriction in the manner

specified by the model. However, comparing the fits of rows 1 and 3 yields

the statistics F (5, 62) =    8.49 and 6.53 for tables 1 and 2 respectively,

indicating rejection of the restricted version against the unrestricted one at

standard significance levels. This amounts to rejection of the joint

hypothesis consisting of eq. (9) and the auxiliary assumptions made in order

to implement it (as in eq. (12)). Relaxing and refining these assumptions

seems to us a promising task for further work, one that may result in a more
FR—031/DPR/09—02—86                      8




general version of the intertemporal model which will conform more closely to

the data.



4. Concluding Remarks

            This paper has shown that government budget variables, such as

spending, taxes, and deficits, have strong effects on private consumption in

the high—budget—deficit economy of Israel during the first half of the

1980s. These effects are shown to be at variance with the Ricardian

implications of an intertemporal optimization model with infinite—horizon

consumers. We developed a finite—horizon version of the intertemporal model,

which results in a richer set of potential channels through which government

budget variables affect consumption than in the infinite—horizon

formulation. The evidence supports the finite—horizon version over the

infinite—horizon one. However, the present finite—horizon version does not

conform sufficiently well with the unrestricted relations in the data,

suggesting the need for further refinements of the model and its auxiliary

assumptions, as well as the need for incorporating additional channels through

which government affects private consumption.

2/    For an exception, see Aschauer (1985).

3/    For analysis of effects of fiscal policy in open economies using this
      type of model, see Frenkel and Razin (1986).

4/    Throughout we use the assumption of a constant real rate. While this is
      a restrictive assumption, it need not be very unrealistic in an economy
      with widespread indexation in financial markets.

5/    rn this formulation the discount factor is (1/R), while it is (y/R) for
      private (finite—lived) agents. For a related analysis and test of
      equality of these discount factors, see van Wijnbergen (1985).

6/    The term R_1B1 was treated as a constant in the estimations.
