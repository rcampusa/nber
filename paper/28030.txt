                                        ABSTRACT

We study private equity in a dynamic general equilibrium model and ask two questions: (i) Why
does the investment of venture funds respond more strongly to the business cycle than that of
buyout funds? (ii) Why are venture funds returns higher than those of buyout? On (i),
venture brings in new capital whereas buyout largely reorganizes existing capital; this can
explain the stronger co-movement of venture with aggregate Tobin's Q. Regarding (ii),
venture returns co-move more strongly with aggregate consumption and therefore pay a higher
premium. Our model embodies this logic and fits the data on investment and returns well. At the
estimated parameters, the two PE sectors together contribute between 14 and 21 percent of
observed growth, relative to the extreme case where private equity is absent.

1         Introduction
Private equity funds account for a growing share of real investment in the U.S. economy,
averaging more than six percent of private domestic investment since 2001.1 We build a
model of private equity investment consistent with its cyclical properties, and ...t the model
to the observed levels and returns.

        We focus on the empirical regularity that investments in both venture capital (VC) and
buyout funds rise relative to other forms of investment as a function of aggregate Tobin'
                                                                                        s
Q, but that venture responds more strongly. The left panel of Figure 1 shows the relative
"intakes" of VC and buyout funds along with uctuations in Q from 1987 to 2016, and the
scatterplot in the right panel shows the positive relation between the two.2 The left panel of
Figure 2 shows the individual intakes and the closer link of venture with Q is apparent there
as well.

        Why is intake more Q-elastic for VC than for buyouts? Our model implies it is because
buyout funds reorganize existing capital, which is costlier to acquire when Q rises, whereas
VC does not face this impediment (and indeed ordinary investment faces it to an even greater
extent than buyout). The right panel of Figure 2 shows our second empirical regularity:

Figure 2: The intakes of venture and buyout funds with respect to gross pri-
vate domestic investment and their respective returns, as related to Tobin's
Q and the S&P 500, 1987-2016


payo¤s to venture funds on average exceed those of buyout funds over the cycle. In our model
this occurs because both ventured and bought-out capital collect the same amount, Q, per
unit when sold to the public, and it is thus only the di¤erence in costs that drives the stronger
response of VC intakes. Moreover, both types of private equity outperform the S&P 500, and
both co-move with it, yet venture returns respond more strongly to returns on the S&P 500.

   The key feature of the model is that the returns to venture and buyout are drawn from
di¤erent distributions with the returns known before investment decisions are made. This
implies that the investment choice for each type of fund is described by a simple cuto¤ rule:
invest as long as the return is su¢ ciently high. The cuto¤s vary over the business cycle, and
the relative returns, as well as the cyclical variation in relative intake of venture compared
to buyout funds, is determined by the shapes of the distributions from which the returns are
drawn. We show that, so long as the distribution of venture funds returns has a thinner tail
than buyout returns, and the cuto¤s are su¢ ciently close to each other, the model is consistent
with the empirical regularities documented above. The model delivers premia over the S&P
500 return because private equity pays more when the cost of capital is high, but that'
                                                                                      s also
the time when aggregate investment is low and consumption is high. Returns to private equity
funds must therefore be higher at these times to compensate for the lower marginal utility of
consumption. Earnings of the S&P 500 ...rms, on the other hand, depend primarily on TFP


                                                          2
shocks, and there is no incentive to substitute toward consumption when TFP is high. Hence
the premium for private equity.3

       Why do these distinctions between the two types of private equity matter for macroeco-
nomics? Although the two types together account for only 2-7% of total domestic investment,
with the average exceeding 6%, this share is growing rapidly. With VC intakes and returns
more procyclical than those for buyout, it is clear that VC can amplify business uctuations,
and importantly at times when activity is expanding and less promising ideas are getting
implemented. At the same time, venture has higher external bene...ts than buyout that may
o¤set the change in the average quality of ideas: Gompers et al. (2005), for example, show
that founders of venture capital-backed start-ups disproportionately come from prior positions
at previously venture-backed companies. This is learning-by-investing and therefore the Ar-
row (1962) type of e¤ect that Searle (1945) and Lucas (1993, Figure 1) document, with such
learning disproportionately associated with new ventures.

       In particular, we embed VC and buyout funds in a traditional Ak model with two capital
stocks and show, analytically and numerically, that their addition contributes to growth while
retaining all of the standard implications of the Ak model. A stylized parametric example
shows that PE can account for as much as half of observed growth. This e¤ect falls to 14
percent of observed growth in numerical estimations with less extreme distributional assump-
tions about the quality of new projects and under Epstein-Zin preferences. Under CRRA
preferences the e¤ect is 21 percent of observed growth. In all cases the e¤ect of VC on growth
is larger than that of buyout, and the overall growth e¤ects could be even larger if PE were
embedded in a heterogeneous-idea model of the Lucas and Moll (2014) or Perla and Tonetti
(2014) types.

       Opp (2019) also models the implementation of heterogeneous ideas by VC funds, and in his
model as in ours VC activity is procyclical, with funding standards declining during booms
in the sense that the average quality of implemented ideas is countercyclical. He analyzes
venture only, whereas we also analyze buyouts. As a result, we can study the movements in
   3
    Not pictured is the relation between returns and investment, but Kaplan and Stromberg (2009, Table 3,
panel B) ...nd that private equity commitments rise as a function of returns realized over the previous year,
and this occurs in our model as well.

the relative intakes (Figure 1) as well as the relative performance of venture and buyout funds
(Figure 2). To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the ...rst to endogenize both types of
investments or "intakes" in a dynamic general equilibrium model. In addition, Opp (2019)
quanti...es VC funds'impact on aggregate growth and welfare while we study contributions to
growth from both types of PE funds.

   A complementary explanation for the premium in private equity returns is illiquidity, where
there is an e¤ective lock-up period of as much as ten to twelve years. Sorensen, Wang and
Yang (2014) model the e¤ects of these lock ups and ...nd an annual premium of slightly more
than one percent, which we subtract from the returns that we target when estimating the
model because our premia are driven entirely by the correlation of PE returns with aggregate
consumption. Ang, Papanikolaou and Wester...eld (2014) also ...nd the premium to be about
one percent. Amihud and Mendelson (2006) argue that the low premia are the result of a
selection e¤ect whereby investors who can tolerate risk more easily are drawn into private
equity ­a preferred habitat view.

   Our discussion of private equity is con...ned to PE funds. A broader measure of private
equity includes occupation-speci...c investments in physical and human capital such as those
made by self-employed people. Hamilton (2000) and Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)
...nd the risk-adjusted return to self employment insu¢ cient to compensate for foregone wage
earnings, and that perhaps non-pecuniary bene...ts play a major role. Such bene...ts are pre-
sumably not present when investing in PE funds. Vereshchagina and Hopenhayn (2009) point
out, however, that the option of liquidating a private equity investment after realizing a low
return can also lower its equilibrium return.

   Earlier work ...nds that the mode of business investment varies across ...rms and over the
cycle; in particular, young ...rms contribute a larger fraction of investment when stock prices
are high. Gompers et al. (2008) ...nd that VC investment is positively related to Q. Jovanovic
and Rousseau (2014) show that a rise in aggregate Tobin'
                                                       s Q leads incumbents to reduce
investment, thereby creating opportunities for investments by new ...rms.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our model. Section 3 characterizes
the equilibrium and provides analytical examples. Section 4 discusses the empirical plausi-

model. Section 5 concludes. All data sources, estimation methods, and derivations are in the

2     Model
We begin with a model of the real side of the economy in Sec. 2.1, and then add a private
equity sector in Sec. 2.2.

2.1    An Ak Structure with two Capital Stocks

Output, y , is produced with physical capital, k , and human capital, h, as

                                        y = Zk h1      ;                                               (1)

where Z is a shock. Output is consumed, C , or invested in amounts X and Xh in the two
types of capital at the unit cost of q and qh . The income identity reads

                                     y = C + qX + qh Xh :                                              (2)

The laws of motion for k and h are

and let z be the scaled TFP shock

We summarize the results as follows:

Proposition 1 If        is constant, then h is proportional to k ,

                                              h = k;                                                                (10)

     output can be written as a function of k alone,

                                               y = zk;                                                              (11)

the goods cost of a unit of composite capital is
                                                                  q
                                          q (1 +       )=             ;                                             (12)

                                                   6
and the income identity reduces to a function of C , k , and composite capital investment, X ,
reads zk = C + q X; or in units of k ,


                                                            q
                                              z =c+             x;                        (13)

where x = X=k is investment in physical capital.

   Proof. Eqs. (8) and (10) imply that

                                                      y0             y0
                                         (1       )      =              :                 (14)
                                                      h0             k0

Substituting from (7) and (14) into (5) yields (6). Eq. (12) follows from (7) and (8). Finally,
(2) reads
                 y = C + qX + qh Xh = C + q (X + Xh ) = C + q (1 +           )X

and division by k yields (13).


2.2    Private Equity and the Implementation of Ideas

The arrival process for new ideas.-- Households get new ideas, and their number is pro-
portional to the aggregate stock of human capital, h. The number of ideas implementable by
VC funds is h, and the number implementable by buyout funds is h. Not all the ideas are
implemented. The presence of h is external to the households; a household does not take it
into account when choosing its human capital investment which still satis...es (5).

   Formally, the production function (1) and the law of motion for h in (4) remain the same,
but in (3), X is broadened as follows:
                                                X
                                     X=                    Xj        nb k;                (15)
                                              j 2fc;v;bg

where Xc represents investment in continuing projects, Xv is venture-backed investment in
new projects, Xb is investment mediated by buyout funds, and nb is the intake of buyout
funds, which is formally de...ned in Sec. 2.2.2.

   In other words, all three methods create the same commodity ­physical capital, but their
production functions di¤er. We now describe each in turn:

                                                      7
       (i) Continuing projects.-- Xc is created via existing projects and its total cost is qXc in
units of consumption.

       (ii) VC-backed projects.-- Xv denotes e¢ ciency units of k created by implementing new
projects. A project uses as inputs a unit of the consumption good and an idea. As output it
delivers " units of capital ready for use in the next period. The quality of the project, ", is
known at the start. New projects are born each period, and their quality is distributed with
a CDF Gv ("). Households get ideas at the rate h so that the unnormalized distribution of
new ideas is hGv (").

       (iii) Upgraded projects.-- Xb denotes e¢ ciency units of k created by buyout funds;              h
units of existing physical capital k can be upgraded at a cost              per unit. When upgraded,
its e¢ ciency changes from unity to ". Idea qualities for upgrading are described by "'
                                                                                      s drawn
from the CDF Gb . The unnormalized distribution of new ideas is hGb ("). As with the
venture funds, " is known before the fact.

       Contracting between agents and PE funds.-- Funds raise new subscriptions each
year and close the following period. Each vintage of investors thus receives a return on their
investments alone ­there is no mixing of dividends among investments of di¤erent vintages.
Costs predate returns by a period.4 We assume that the PE fund owners get all the rents
from the projects in which they invest.5 It takes one period for the projects to mature, and
                                                        y0
      s revenue from selling the project is q 0
a fund'                                                 k0
                                                           ".   Capital created though new projects is
sold by venture funds to incumbent ...rms or oated by IPO at a price equal to the cost, q ,
of making capital via the incumbents' technology. Capital created through buyout activity
results in an e¤ectively larger capital stock in the hands of existing ...rms.

2.2.1      Venture Funds

Let "v be the minimum project quality accepted by a VC fund. We shall measure intake and
payout relative to k , and using (10), relative to k the number of ideas is
                                               1

   The typical fund lasts 10-12 years but our data will allow us to infer the year-to-year returns.

new ...rms.

2.2.3      Di¤erences between the two funds

In the model, venture funds create new physical capital whereas buyout funds transform and
upgrade existing physical capital units into new ones subject to an implementation cost . One
can interpret a VC fund in our model as an investment vehicle that provides equity ...nancing
to startups and growth ...rms in their early stage. In our sample for empirical analysis, the
majority of VC funds (1,070 out of 1,680 funds) are in the early stage and earn large and
positive net-of-fee returns; this is consistent with Korteweg and Nagel (2016), who document
that VC start-up investments earn large positive abnormal net returns whereas those in the




                                                          10
later stage earn net returns close to zero.6

        On the other hand, buyout funds can be interpreted as investment vehicles that acquire
existing ...rms. As a result, the implementation cost                           could include any transaction fees
charged when a buyout fund buys or sells a company, similar to the M&A fees charged
by banks. Metrick and Yasuda (2010) argue that transaction fees are common features for
buyout funds but are rare for VC funds.7 A buyout fund therefore does not pay                                 to its
capital providers; rather,          is as a real cost that may in fact compensate fund managers (i.e.,
the general partners) for the due diligence they perform with takeover deals. That is why the
cuto¤ quality "b depends positively on :


3         Equilibrium and its Properties
Proposition 1 continues to hold with the two forms of private equity except the accounting
equations change slightly. First, the law of motion for k in (3) changes to

                                                    k0
                                                       =1         + i;                                         (25)
                                                    k

where corresponding to (15),
                                            i = xc + xv + xb             nb :                                  (26)

        Second, in our new notation, the RHS of the income identity (13) reads z = c + q i, the
presence of       reecting the investment of goods into h, which itself is proportional to k . The
two PE funds, however, generate k at a cost lower than q and the di¤erence is reected in
                                                                                         q
their pro...ts    v   +   b   that are added to the LHS of (13) along with                 n
                                                                                         +q b
                                                                                                of the buyout funds'
costs, which are transfer payments. Thus the income identity becomes

                                                              q          q
                                       z+   v   +    b   +       nb = c + i:                                   (27)
                                                              +q

     Similarly, Cochrane (2005), Hall and Woodward (2007), and Korteweg and Sorensen (2010) ...nd positive
abnormal round-to-round returns (gross of fees) from start-up VC investment. We therefore adjust PE returns
for early vs. later-stage funds in the empirics in Sec. 4.2.

     This di¤erence is re  ected in the RHS of Eqs. (16) and (21). Depending on the funding terms, transaction
fees for BO funds range from 1:68 to 3:37 cents per dollar of committed capital (Metrick and Yasuda 2010).

The functions ("i ; ni ;   i)   are de...ned in terms of primitives, and the remaining unknowns are
c (s), xc (s), and    (s). These functions solve Eqs. (27), (25) and (28) for all s.

   We use both c and i from Eqs. (31) and (32) to estimate parameters of the model, and
when we generalize the model in Sec. 4.4.1 to include Epstein Zin preferences, Eqs. (31) and
(32) will continue to hold with only the constant L di¤ering.

3.1       Private Equity and Growth

According to (11), y grows at the same rate as k in the long run. From (25), the growth rate
of k is

    The solution in (34) is of the same general character as that of other Ak models of growth,
being increasing in z and decreasing in q . What we add is a role for PE. When q is high,
so also are the costs of reorganizing capital through buyouts relative to VC, and while both
forms of PE rise to partially o¤set the decline in investment generally, VC rises more. These
points become clearer in the linear approximation; Appendix B4 further shows the following:

         The growth rate depends on the TFP term z and the cost q of physical capital as in all Ak
models, but also depends on value added from the two PE sectors in our model. Value added
by buyout is linear in             b= ( b     1), which is the mean of "b . The value added from two PE
funds becomes zero in the limit case where                     and are zero so that there are no implementable
ideas in the PE sectors, or when the distribution of " converges to a degenerate distribution,
as discussed next.

         Limiting case.-- As              ! 0 and           ! 0 the supply of PE projects disappears. And as

"0;v and "0;b . In these limiting cases PE plays no role in the model and

                                                                  14
         Numerical example ­We now provide a simple quantitative illustration of the impact
from the PE sectors to growth in the model using (34) and the Pareto assumptions above. This
is meant as a benchmark ­we later re...ne the model to consider alternative and more realistic
distributions for Gv and Gb . For now, we target the moments listed in Table 3 reported in
Sec. 4 using the Pareto with          b   =     v   = 1:6, which Jovanovic and Szentes (2013) used in
their simulations.9 The estimated growth rate from Eq. (36) is 2.66% per annum, and is
reduced to 2.36% and 1.68% when we shut down the buyout funds ( = 0) and venture funds
( = 0), respectively. When there are no PE funds at all ( =                   = 0), the annual growth rate
is halved to 1.38%. From this parametric example, the PE sectors contribute to almost 50%
of the growth in total and the e¤ect of venture on growth is larger than that of buyout; the
latter is consistent with the model'
                                   s implication that venture co-moves more strongly with
the business cycle. Figure A1 in Appendix D further shows that the marginal impact of PE
funds on growth attens out as             v   and    b   increase, which indicates that the PE sector has a
larger impact on the real side of the economy when the distributions of its projects'qualities
are more dispersed.

         While these relatively large growth e¤ects and the contrast between VC and buyout rely
on log utility and Pareto distributions, they represent closed-form analytical solutions for how
much PE may a¤ect the economy. We shall relax these assumptions in Sec. 4, and further
connect the model to the macro data and evaluate its empirical plausibility. We derive the
model'
     s implications for asset prices next.

3.2         Asset returns

We ...rst derive the general expressions for returns, and then provide three examples.
         Return on equity.-- By (11) we have y 0 =k 0 = z 0 and therefore the gross return on equity
is
                                                    1
                                          RE =        ( z 0 + (1    ) q0) :                           (38)
                                                    q
     9
    Di¤erent from parameters in Table 3, we set     = 1 as used in the proposition 3 and further set the
depreciation rate = 8% to achieve a reasonable range of growth rates. Similar to Table 3, we preset = 0:25
and = 0:95. The estimated parameters are = 1:58, = 0:91, = 0:12, and = 0:05.

   Cyclical implications.-- The model has the following cyclical implications for the ratios
in (40). The means of the "'
                           s and their truncation points are scaled by their costs which are
unity for venture and   + q for buyout.

   Three examples now follow ­the derivations are in Appendix B2.

   Example 1: Exponential Gv and Gb .-- For "                 0, let Gi (") = 1 exp (                         i ")   for i 2 fv; bg.

                          Rv  1  1                   Rb  1                        1
                             = +               and      = +                             :                                      (41)
                          RE  q   v                  RE  q                     b ( + q)

so that
                             Rv ? Rb           ,          ( + q)           b   ?     v:                                        (42)

   Example 2: The Pareto example again.-- Consider again the Pareto example in Eq. (33).
Then
                             Rv           v    1              Rb                b    1
                                =                  and           =                     :                                       (43)
                             RE      v        1q              RE           b        1q
As a result, the distribution with the thicker tail yields the higher returns:

                                  Rv ? Rb            ,            b    ?       v:                                              (44)

                                                                          2
                                                                          v)   and "b              N(    b;
                                                                                                              2

                                     2
generic Normal distribution N ( ;        ), the inverse Mills ratio is expressed as
                                                                                "i;m in        i

                                                                                    "i;m in

                                                                                                   i

where    and    are PDF and CDF of standardized normal distribution N (0; 1), respectively.
In our model the truncation points are "v, min = 1=q and "b, min = ( + q ) =q: The ratio of
return is proportional to the ratio of inverse Mills ratio,

                                   Rv   MRv ("v, min )
                                      =                ( + q) :                              (45)
                                   Rb   MRb ("b, min )

Choice of Gv and Gb          While both the Exponential and Pareto cases provide closed-form
expressions of returns, (42) and (44) imply that higher returns are associated with thicker tails.
Nevertheless, we will show in Sec. 4 that the cross-section data of buyout and VC returns
reveal the opposite : a lower average buyout return coexists with a thicker cross-sectional tail.
On the other hand, when Gv and Gb follow Normal distributions, Equation (45) shows that
even if VC has a thinner tail (smaller     ) than buyout, VC could still have a higher mean
return E [Rv ] > E [Rb ] if E [MRv ("v, min ) ( + q )] > E [MRb ("b, min )] for su¢ ciently large
implementation cost . We ...nd that this inequality indeed holds at the estimated parameter
values reported in Sec. 4.
   In the Pareto case, Equation (43) implies that the relative returns Rv =Rb are driven entirely
by the parameter choices of distributions and thus do not depend on q or aggregate risk ­
this is less supported empirically as we will show in the next section. This, however, is true
for the Pareto case only. Under the assumption of normal distributions, Equation (45) shows
not only that the relative returns depend on the distribution parameters, but that they also
covary with q and hence with consumption according to equation (31). We summarize this
...nding in the following Lemma, which is proven in Appendix B2.

Lemma 1 When the project quality "v and "b follows normal distributions, venture returns
pay a higher premium than buyout if VC returns co-move more strongly with aggregate con-
sumption.

   For the reasons above, we shall assume Gv and Gb follow normal distributions in the
estimation, as discussed next.

4     Empirical Evidence and Model Estimation
Figures 1 and 2 in the introduction provide some preliminary and distinct features of buyout
and venture funds. We begin this section by describing the empirical evidence in more detail
and follow with estimation of the model to verify its ability to ...t the aggregate time series
of private equity investment and returns, as well as some key macro moments. Appendix A
includes details of the data sources and estimation methods.

4.1    Empirical Evidence

We begin with regression tests of our model'
                                           s predictions. We ...rst verify the implications
for observed intakes and returns to private equity. Table 1 reports the results of time-series
regressions of the logs of venture and buyout intakes, as well as their log ratio, with respect
to aggregate Tobin'
                  s Qt 1 . The table shows that both log intakes are positively related at
the 1% level to aggregate Qt   1   (i.e., measured at the start of the period), but that venture
intakes are more responsive to Qt 1 . The regressions in the right-most panel show that the
log ratio of the intakes is also positively related to Qt    1   at the 1% level when we include a
linear time trend and at the 5% level without a trend. These results o¤er empirical evidence
that venture activities co-move more strongly with the business cycle and therefore should
pay higher premia than buyout.
    Table 2 reports time-series regressions for the returns to the two funds and their ratio
on aggregate Q and the productivity shock zt . Returns to both venture and buyout funds
are related negatively to start-of-period Qt   1   and positively to end-of-period Qt as the model
predicts, and typically at the 5% level or less, and returns to venture are more Q-elastic than
buyout returns. Consistent with the model in showing no signi...cant relation between the
ratio Rv =Rb and Qt 1 , the regression in the right-most panel indicates that the relation with
end-of-period Qt is positive but is imprecisely estimated.
    Comparing to the ...ndings in the literature, Kaplan and Stromberg (2009) measure returns
over the previous year and ...nd in their Table 3 that they relate positively to current period
commitments. Our model also predicts this: commitments rise in q and so do returns over the
previous period ­see Equation (43). Gompers et al. (2005) also ...nd that an increase in initial

4.2       Model Estimation

In this section we estimate the model and evaluate its performance with respect to the available
time series for private equity returns, intakes and other variables of interest. To do this, we
assign values to , , , and           and then choose Gb ,Gv (distribution parameters), , , , and
  jointly to target the means of c, nv =i, nb =i, RV C , RB , and RS&P .10

       For q , we use fourth quarter observations underlying Hall (2011) for 1987-1999, and then
join them with estimates underlying Abel and Eberly (2011) for post-1999 periods. More
details on the construction of the series are in Appendix A. The National Income and Product
Accounts (NIPA) provide us with zk , the ratio of output to physical capital. From it, we
compute z using Eqs. (7)-(9) as follows:

                                                        1
                                             z = zk +           qx:

Gross domestic product is then de...ned as

                                                            1
                                      y = zk =      zk +         qx k;

such that the "true"output and output-capital ratio are higher after bringing human capital
into the measurement.11

       Table 3 reports the values we assign for parameters for , , , and , along with those we
                                                                                     2                       2
estimate. We assume the distributions of "'
                                          s are normal: "v                N(    v;   v)   and "b   N(   b;   b ).

We set the model to an annual frequency with             = 0:95 and a 1% rate of capital depreciation.12
Table 3 shows that all estimated parameters are statistically signi...cant, with the exception of
human capital ratio , at the 5% percent level or less based upon 95 percent GMM con...dence
  10
     We take the S&P 500 return, denoted by RS& P , as our observed measure of the return on equity in (38)
  11
     This is also how Prescott and McGrattan (2010) treat unmeasured investment ­it is "lost output" as in
the Ben-Porath model where h is built by withholding time from production and not using goods that are
produced.
  12
     We set = 1% to match the level of equity returns; we later show that the results are robust to depreciation
rates of 4% as in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014), 5% as in Jovanovic and Rousseau (2014), and 6% as in
Nadiri and Prucha (1996).

tail than VC (         b   >   v ).

       Table 4 reports the means of the various series of interest as estimated and in the data for
1987-2016. The table incorporates two adjustments to the data:

       Adjustment for early vs. late-stage.-- For PE returns, Korteweg and Nagel (2016)
document that VC start-up investments earn large positive abnormal returns whereas those
in later stages earn excess returns near zero, net of fees. To address this, we adjust VC returns
as follows
                                                      ~ V C + (1
                                         RV C = ! V C R                 ! V C ) R S &P ;

where ! V C =        # VC funds in early stage       ~ V C is the combined VC return (i.e., without adjusting
                                                 and R
                        # Total VC funds

for early versus later stage funds).13 In our sample, 1,070 out of 1,680 VC funds are early
                                                                                     ~V C ,
stage, indicating that ! VC = 65%. We also note that the average combined VC return, R
in our sample is 18:1%, which is in line with the estimates in Table IA.II of Harris, Jenkinson,
and Kaplan (2015).

       Adjustment for the liquidity premium.-- We further subtract 1.05 percent from buyout
  13            ~ V C in our sample is 18.1% ; this is in line with the estimates in Table IA.II of Harris,
    The average R
Jenkinson, and Kaplan (2015). Table 7 in the robustness section later shows that our model ...ts the data well
using combined VC returns as well.


                                                              21
and venture returns, which is the liquidity premium reported by Sorensen, Wang and Wang
(2014) for these types of funds. This value was also subtracted from the series shown in the
top two panels in Figure 3. The 1.05 premium is similar to the value of 0.9 percent reported
by Ang, Papanikolaou and Wester...eld (2014).

                                             Table 2:
Note: The table reports targeted and non-targeted moments of the variables of interest for the baseline
estimation. The empirical moments are computed over the sample from 1987 to 2016.


   Table 4 shows that the model matches most of the means in the data well, and matches the
second moments of asset returns and average investment i reasonably well. The model predicts
larger average returns for VC than for buyout because the estimated average q-adjusted Mills
ratio for VC, E [MRv ( + q )], is larger than for buyout E [MRb ], as was discussed in example
3 in Sec. 2.3. The model, however, overestimates the average growth rate in order to match
average stock returns based on (38). Using the estimated parameters, the PE sectors together
contribute to 21% of growth. Table 8 reported in the robustness section later will show that
the model can match the average growth rate g with capital depreciation                set to 4% per
annum but at a cost of slightly lower ...tted average stock returns. In addition, the model
overpredicts the volatility for buyout whereas the estimated venture return is less volatile
than the data.

   The last non-targeted moment in Table 4 relates to Kortum and Lerner'
                                                                       s (2000) ...ndings
that, from 1983 to 1992, the ratio of venture intake to R&D spending averaged less than 3%
and venture generated 8% of industrial innovations. Assuming that the return to R&D would
be the same as to ordinary investment, our model indicates that the ratio of the average to
marginal product of VC, "v , was 8=3        2:67. Our model would interpret this as follows: Eqs.

shown in the last row of Table 4, is a slight underestimate.

       Figure 3 shows the intakes of venture and buyout funds as percentages of gross private
domestic investment in the data and in the model.14 The upper panel of Figure 3 shows
that the model ...ts the cyclical properties of the intake for venture investment well, with a
correlation of 0.68 between model and data. The series in the bottom panel have a correlation
of 0.75, and indicate the model can reproduce the spike in buyout funds that occurred in the
year 2000, albeit overly so.
       Role of Spikes in 2000 ­It is worth noting that the high correlation between the model
estimate and the data is not driven by the spike: when we exclude 2000 in the sample, the
top and bottom panels continue to exhibit high correlations of 0.73 and 0.69 respectively.
       Figure 4 shows the ...t between the model and data with respect to returns. The model
once again ...ts venture well with a correlation of 0.65 (upper panel) when we include the spike

    To produce the model-based time series, we insert historical (q; z ) into the corresponding policy functions
in the model.

      In sum, our model is able to match the dynamics of returns to buyout, venture and stock
well using data on the macro series (z; q ).

4.3      Empirical Validation: Estimation of Distributions

One of the key distinctions between the venture and buyout funds in the model is the di¤erence
in the distributions Gv (") and Gb ("). In fact, under the Pareto case (example 2 in Sec. 2.3),
we show that the relative returns are only driven by the parameters of the distributions,   v   and

 b.   In general, the model requires buyout "b to have a thicker tail than venture "v to match
the mean returns in the data. Does this hold empirically? To answer this question, given
that systematic data on the individual projects of venture and buyout funds are generally
unavailable, we construct an empirical counterpart of Gv (") and Gb (") using actual IPOs
and acquisitions from the Securities Data Company (SDC) Platinum and CRSP/Compustat
Merged (CCM) databases.

             Figure 5: The pooled data and their estimated distributions


      We de...ne a ...rm'
                        s value by that of its common stock and trim the top and bottom 2.5% of
...rm-year observations to avoid extreme values that may reect data errors.15 We examined
various other de...nitions of ...rm value such as total assets (common stock plus cash, debt,
and preferred stock), but chose to work with the value of common stock to obtain the largest
possible number of venture and buyout observations, although results using total assets are
very similar. The ...nal sample contains 8,209 venture and 665 buyout observations spanning
the period from 1986 to 2017. Appendix A provides detailed descriptions of data and sources.

      When a ...rm has an IPO or is taken over, its "v or "b is computed as follows:

                                       IPO Value
                              "v =                                                           (46)

where both the IPO value and "Combined Value" are de...ned as the number of common
shares outstanding at year end multiplied by the annual closing price. Following the model,
we further truncate the distribution of "v and "b by cuto¤s 1=q and 1 + =q .
      Figure 5 shows the estimated conditional probability densities of " for venture (blue dashed

      Results are highly robust to how we trim the sample.

ters reported in Table 3, against their corresponding empirical distributions from the SDC
database. The data are pooled over years and more observations tend to come from years
when q was high. The model implies that in year t, "v would be included only if "v > 1=qt ,
and "b would be included only if "b > ( + qt ) =qt . The predicted number of IPOs in year
                             P
t0 is therefore 1 Gv q10   = T  t=1 1  Gv q1t , and similarly for the number of buyouts.
Thus the predicted distributions are calculated as

where g i is the PDF of N ( i ;       i)   with the values    i   and     i    reported in Table 3 for i = v, b,
and Gv and Gb are the associated CDFs. I ( ) is an indicator function.16

       Figure 5 shows that, consistent with model'
                                                 s implication, the distribution of project qual-
ities for buyout indeed has a thicker tail than that for venture. This is consistent with Figure
F.3 of Gupta and Van Nieuwerburgh (2019), which shows the pro...t distribution of buyout has
a thicker tail than venture. Other evidence on fat tails in PE returns include Scherer (2000)
and Silverberg and Verspagen (2007).

       Before we conclude this section, it'
                                          s worth noting that we generate the estimated distribu-
tions by ...tting the same moments used in Table 4 rather than by ...tting the targeted empirical
distributions directly. Therefore, Figure 5 should be considered as further empirical validation
of the model.17

     An additional validation of distributional assumption is based on Jovanovic and Szentes (2013), who use
the Pareto distribution for their analog of "v . When ...tting distributions of waiting times to successful exit
and to termination of venture projects, in their Table 1 for the parameter v (for which their analog was titled
 ) they use 1:55; 1:6; and 1:73. At the middle value of v = 1:6 and the average q of 1.83, Eq. (43) from our

4.4      Additional Robustness Checks

In this section, we consider alternative estimations of model and di¤erent targets of the cali-
brations to check the robustness of results.

4.4.1    Model Extension: Recursive Preferences

In the model, households are assumed to have power utility over consumption C . Even though
this assumption substantially simpli...es the analysis and allows for closed-form solutions of
PE returns under certain distributional assumptions, it also leads to counterfactually high
volatility of the implied risk-free rate and the quantitatively implausibly low equity risk premia
analyzed by Mehra and Prescott (1985). In this section, we address the issue by relaxing
the assumption of power utility using Epstein and Zin (EZ, 1989) preferences that separate
parameters of risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.

   More speci...cally, we extend the model to allow for EZ recursive preferences,
                                                                                                  1

vature parameter. Our baseline power utility is a special case where                                          = . The stochastic
discount factor mt+1 is
                                                                                              !

   As in the baseline model, households own the ...rms and optimal investment in h requires
that the cost of a unit of human capital equals the present value of its expected wage payments.
Using Eq. (49) and written recursively, this condition now reads

the model simpli...es as k and h can be aggregated into a composite that is proportional to k .

    The following proposition, proven in Appendix B5, shows that the Ak property is preserved
under EZ preferences:

Proposition 4 Proposition 1 holds under EZ preferences and the value function takes the
form V (k; z; q ) = v (z; q )k

    Next, let the constant LEZ satisfy the following equation:
                            1=   Z                               1

                                                                                         q

Then Appendix B6 proves that the optimal policies take on the same functional form under
EZ preferences as they do under CRRA preferences except that the constant L is di¤erent.
In particular, analogously to Proposition 2, we have:

Proposition 5 With recursive preferences in Eq. (48), the solutions for c and i in Eqs. (31)
and (32) remain valid but with                substituted for , and with LEZ substituted for L.

    Comparison to Proposition 2.-- When                                           6= , the only e¤ect of the additional para-
meter on the policies c and i is through LEZ being di¤erent from L. Eqs. (31) and (32) remain
the same. In Appendix B6, we show that LEZ = L when                                          = , and so are c and i.

    We next estimate the extended model and again evaluate its performance with respect
to the available time series for private equity returns, intakes and other variables of interest.
Similar to the baseline estimation with power utility, we preset                                      = 0:25 and       = 0:95, but
choose a higher depreciation rate                  = 5% as in Jovanovic and Rousseau (2014). We further
set 1= , the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), to be 0:95 which is in line with

                                                                      28
studies such as Hall (1988), and let the data determine the curvature parameter . Table A2
in Appendix C shows an alternative estimation result when we freely estimate both                          and ;
the estimated EIS 1= remains less than 1.

     As in the baseline estimation, we choose Gb ,Gv ,                , , , and       to target the means of
c, nv =i, nb =i, RV C , RB , and RS&P . We again assume the distributions of "'
                                                                              s are normal:

"v     N(   v;    v)   and "b     N(   b;   b ).   The additional parameter       is jointly estimated with
other parameters by targeting the mean of the risk free rate de...ned as

larger mean and a thicker tail than VC.

as an improvement over power utility, the use of EZ preferences provides a much closer to ...t to
both mean risk-free rate (targeted) as well as its non-targeted volatility, as highlighted in the
last row of the table. Therefore, the estimated model under EZ can jointly ...t both volatility
of the risk free rate and the equity risk premium. In addition, the model is able to match the
non-target average growth well (1.9% in the model versus 2.0% in the data), and under the
estimated parameters, the two PE sectors together contribute 14 percent of observed growth,
relative to the extreme case when both         and      are set to zero.

tively. The third and seventh columns show that, when             is set to be 4%, the model can now
generate 2.5% annual growth, which is closer to the data counterpart (2%) than the base-
line estimate, albeit at a cost of slightly lower returns on the S&P 500. The fourth and last
columns of the table report results when the depreciation rate is set at 6%. While the model
can still match mean growth, investment, and the mean and volatility of various returns well,
we ...nd that the average equity return is about half of that observed in the data. As shown
earlier in Table 6, however, this issue can be partially resolved under general EZ preferences.

5     Conclusion
We document that the returns to venture funds are higher than those of buyout funds, and that
venture funds'intake responds more strongly to the business cycle than buyout funds'intake.
The model assumes that venture brings in new capital whereas buyout largely reorganizes
existing capital, leading venture intake to co-move more strongly with aggregate Tobin'
                                                                                      s Q.

    A thicker right tail for venture ideas also relates to venture'
                                                                  s higher returns. More venture
activity is drawn into the economy when q rises and in the model agents consume more when
q is high. Venture returns are thus more strongly correlated with aggregate consumption than
buyout and must pay a higher return.

    An extension we do not pursue is that of returns to self employment. Perhaps the modeling
distinction we make between how VC and buyout funds add value to capital also applies in
the domain of self employment choices. One can open a store in an entirely new location, or
one can buy someone else out or simply take over a location that someone else has vacated.
Another extension would be to an open economy; U.S. private equity ...rms are active abroad
and our estimate that private equity contributes between 14 and 21 percent of observed growth
does not include the e¤ects that private equity activity in or from the U.S. has on growth
elsewhere in the world.

Appendix A. Data and Methods
In this appendix we document the data sources and methods used to construct the series
depicted in our ...gures and included in the empirical analysis.

       Figure 1 . -- The "intakes" are the sum of investments made annually in U.S. venture
capital and buyout funds, divided by annual estimates of gross private domestic investment
from the BEA (2017, Table 5.2.5, line 4). Venture and buyout investments are from the April
2017 version of Thomson One'
                           s VentureXpert database, and are the sum of all investments
made in a given calendar year at any stage or round across funds of each type. The "intake
ratio," nv =nb , is the ratio of the respective investment sums in each year.

       For aggregate qt , we use fourth quarter observations underlying Hall (2001) for 1987-1999,
and then join them with estimates underlying Abel and Eberly (2011) for 1999 to 2005.
Abel and Eberly derive aggregate Tobin'
                                      s Q from the Federal Reserve Board'
                                                                        s Flow of Funds
Accounts as the ratio of total market value of equity and bonds to private ...xed assets in the
non-...nancial corporate sector. We bring these estimates forward through 2016 using the same
sources. Hall'
             s measure of Q in 1999 is higher than that of Abel and Eberly (3.376 vs. 1.819),
so we use a ratio splicing factor of 1.856 to adjust the series from 2000 forward.

       Figure 2 .-- Aggregate returns to U.S. venture capital funds for 1987-2016 are from Cam-
bridge Associates (2016a), and are annualized returns constructed by compounding one quar-
ter horizon pooled returns. Aggregate returns to U.S. buyout funds for 1987-2016 are from
Cambridge Associates (2016b), and are also annualized returns constructed from single quar-
ter horizon pooled returns. Both series are net of fees, expenses, and carried interest.18 It'
                                                                                             s
worth noting that the majority of the VC funds (1,070 out of 1,680) in our sample are in the
early stage and earn large and positive returns. This is consistent with Korteweg and Nagel
(2016), who document that VC start-up investments earn large positive abnormal returns
whereas those in the later stage earn net returns close to zero. In addition, the positive VC
returns could also reect the possibility that general partners have considerable equity in the
  18
    The fees that go to general partners absorb most of the rents and are thus not compensation going to
capital providers. While an investor obtains the return on the S&P 500 almost fully (an ETF costs a few
basis points annually), an investors'PE investment comes with a hefty fee, likely in excess of 10% (Metrick
and Yasuda 2010).

projects in addition to collecting fees. The average combined VC return R
is 18.1%; this is in line with the estimates in Table IA.II of Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan
(2015).

price index from the National Income and Product accounts. Annual returns to the S&P 500
are from Damodaran (2018),19 and deated by the consumer price index. We then subtract
1.05 percent from both venture and buyout returns, which is liquidity premium reported in
Sorensen, Wang and Wang (2014).

      Figures 3 and 4 .-- For zt , we use private output, de...ned as GDP less government expen-
ditures on consumption and investment from the BEA (2017) for 1987-2016. We then divide
the result by Kt     1   after adjusting it for ination during year t     1 by averaging the annual
ination factors across the two years that overlap t          1 and then using its square root as a
deator. The Kt are end-year stocks of private ...xed assets from the BEA (2017, table 6.1,
line 1) for 1987 through 2016. The aggregate investment rate it is constructed as annual gross
private domestic investment from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA 2017, table 5.2.5,
line 4) for 1987-2016 divided by Kt 1 .

      Figure 5 .-- We obtained the data on Venture and Buyout from the Securities Data Com-
pany (SDC) Platinum and CRSP/Compustat Merged (CCM) Database.

      For buyouts, the SDC lists the acquirer'
                                             s CUSIP and the market value before the merger.
It also lists the year the merger occurred and the target'
                                                         s assets. In the CCM, there are
multiple CUSIPs per year in both the SDC and the CRSP/Compustat. The multiple CUSIPs
per year in the SDC are due to an acquirer completing multiple mergers in a year. The
multiple CUSIPs per year in the CRSP/Compustat are due to ...rms with di¤erent permanent
numbers having the same CUSIPs. Unfortunately, the SDC does not contain permanent
numbers (lpermno) so we can only match via CUSIPs. As a result, all observations in both
datasets in which the same CUSIP appeared multiple times in a year were dropped from both
datasets. We then merged the CCM and SDC based on the CUSIP and year of the merger.
The combined value was then the shares outstanding at end of the year of the merger (CSHO

      For venture, we use the ...rms from CCM, only keeping data for the ...rst year a ...rm appears
in the CCM data, and de...ning IPO value as the shares outstanding at the end of that year
(CSHO) times the closing price (PRCCC ).20

      For both buyouts and venture, we further trim the sample based on ...rm'

stock at 95% level (i.e. observations at the bottom 2.5% and top 2.5% of common stock
values are dropped). Our ...nal sample contains 8,209 venture observations and 665 buyout
observations. The annual data spans the periods from 1986 to 2017. For each venture and
buyout funds in our sample, we compute the "v and "b as de...ned in Eqs. (46) and (47),
where IPO and combined value are de...ned as CSHO times the PRCCC . We truncate the

              1
Since L           ranges from zero to in...nity as L ranges over the positive line, and since                                                     > 0, a
necessary and su¢ cient condition for a solution for L to exist is that
                             Z                                                                                         1=

This is equivalent to

                                             1=                   1         z + (1      )q

Since     j   and     are positive, for (A3) to hold it su¢ ces that

B4: Taylor Approximation for the Growth

We consider a ...rst-order Taylor expansion of the growth g ( ; ) at                                                         =       = 0. First we notice
that
                                                       v (0; 0) = 0:

Therefore we have,
                                                      1
                          g (0; 0) = zq                             q (1                   ) (1                  )       :

The ...rst-order Taylor approximation reads,

                                g = g (0; 0) + g (0; 0) + g (0; 0) :

Note that,

B5: Value Function Under EZ Preferences

Nothing in Proposition 1 changes with EZ preferences, so the proof of Proposition 1 holds.
   As for the value function, we ...rst notice that the resource constraint is

                                                                       q          q

                                                                       +q

The law of motion is
                                                     k0
                                                        =1                     + i:                                                                        (A11)
                                                     k
Combining (A10) and (A11), we get

                                         q                                                                  q

                                                                                                            +q

We will verify that the value function takes the conjectured form:

   Proof that LEZ = L when          = .-- To show that LEZ = L; we set             =        in Eq. (50),
which then reads

         where v (z; q )     = h        P                 h               i                 i :   (A16)

Substituting from (A16) into (A15) and simplifying makes the resulting equation the same as
Eq. (29) in Proposition 2.
