                   MONEY, INCOME AND PRICES AFtER THE 1980s


                                   ABSTRACT




      Three empirical findings presented in this paper show that evidence based
 on the most recent U.S. experience does not indicate the kind of close or
 reliable relationship between money and nonfinancial economic activity that, if
 present, might warrant basing the design and implementation of monetary policy
 on money in a formally systematic way: First, extending the familiar
 time-series analysis to include data from the 1980s sharply weakens the
 evidence from prior periods showing that such relationships existed between
 money and nominal income, or between money and either real income or prices
 considered separately.  Focusing on data from 1970 onward destroys this
 evidence altogether.

      Second, the finding by Stock and Watson that particular forms of
 time-series experiments still showed a significant role for money in affecting
 real output through 1985 not only becomes weaker on the inclusion of da-ta from
 1986 and 1987 but also, even for data through 1985 only, turns out to depend on
 the use in their analysis of a particular short-term interest rate, the
 Treasury bill rate. Using instead the commercial paper rate, which apparently
 is superior in capturing the information in financial prices that matters for
 real output, also greatly weakens their result. Simultaneouslyusing the
 commercial paper rate and including data through 1987 destroys it altogether.

      Third, extending the analysis through 1987 also destroys the time-series
 evidence from earlier periods showing that money and income are co-integrated.
 Even if monetary policy were to be conducted in terms of targets for money
 growth, the failure of money and income to be co-integrated means that there is
 no empirical ground for resisting the "base drift" that results from persistent
 random differences between actual money growth and the corresponding target.

     Economists have long understood that the quantity of money, or its growth

rate, can play a useful role in the monetary policy process only to the extent

that fluctuations        in money over time regularly and reliably correspond to

fluctuations        in income, or prices, or whatever other aspects of economic

                                                                                           for
activity the central bank seeks to influence.           The same is true, of course,

any other financial quantity         --   non-money assets, for example, or measures of

credit   --   or,    for that matter, interest rates and any other financial prices.

Especially in the case of money, a rich literature developed over many years has

investigated in some detail the requirements that the relationships connecting

money to income and/or prices must satisfy in order to warrant focusing monetary

policy on money in any of several specific waysJ            An equally rich empirical

literature has repeatedly sought to establish whether these requirements have

actually been satisfied at specific times and in specific places.2

     Different ways of conceptuallybasing the monetary policy process- on money

place different empirical          requirements on the relationships between money and

the economic variables that are of ultimate policy concern.            These relationships

in turn depend on such basic dimensions of economic behavior as the nature of

the economy's        aggregate   supply process, the degree of price flexibility, the

interest and wealth elasticities           of aggregate demand, and, importantly     the


public's money demand behavior and the banks' money supply behavior.               For

that   is,   determining the money growth rate most likely ex ante to be consistent

with the central bank's macroeconomicpolicy objectives, and then conducting

monetary policy operations during some time interval as if achieving money
                                                                        -   -   is
growth along that path were itself the policy objective                              the closer to


being optimal as the demand for money is the closer to being both nonstochastic

and interest inelastic.             Looser relationships suffice for it to be optimal to

use money as an "information variable"             --   that   is, adjusting policy operations

during some interval in response to actual money growth that departs from the ex

ante path, and perhaps also in response to analogous departures for other

variables,     but in any case not in a way designed necessarily to restore money

growth to the ex ante path.3
                                                                                             -   -   and to
       What is essential to either of these ways of proceeding, however

others besides     -   -   is   that there be at least some reliably exploitable connection

between money and either income or prices, so that observed departures of money

from some ex ante path bear a systematic implication for income or prices in the

future.      Otherwise money, as a variable that the central bank cannot set

directly as a policy instrument, has no role in the policy process.                         From an

information-variable            perspective,   there is no point to the central bank's

reacting to fluctuations in money if those fluctuations bear no implication for

subsequent movements in income or prices.                From an intermediate-target

perspective,     there is even less point to making policy as if controlling money

were stochastically equivalent to controlling income and prices if in fact there

is no relation between them.

       It is for just this reason that the events of the 1980s have proved so

subversive to what had almost come to be standard ways of formulating and

implementing monetary policy, not just in the United States but in many other
                                             -3-




countries as well.       While there was never any lack of debate about the strength

or weakness of the empirical relationships connecting money to income and

prices, and therefore      about the appropriate role of money in the monetary policy

                                                                          that fluctuations        in
process, before the l980s there was widespread                agreement

                                                                future income
money did contain at least potentially useful information about

and price movements.       In the 1980s, however, the empirical basis underlying that
                                                                                    that
agreement has disappeared.          Empirical investigation based on sample periods

include the 19805 simply does not lead to results corroborating what were

                                                                                                    It
commonly accepted as facts of economic behavior not so many years earlier.

is not surprising that in this environment some central banks, including the

Federal Reserve System in the United States, have altered or abandoned                         the ways


in which they had previously relied on money to make policy.

      The object of this paper is to show how the passage of time                    --   in

particular,      the experience since 1980    -   -   has altered   familiar     empirical

relationships      previously taken to support a central role for money in the

monetary policy process.       Section I reports results for a variety of regression

and autoregressiontests, in each case seeking to establish whether fluctuations

in money are useful for predicting subsequent fluctuations                     in income or prices.


Here the consistent finding is that the positive results familiar from earlier

time periods      do not hold up when the sample is extended to include data from the

l980s.     Section II digresses      to focus on the role of the interest rate in the

Stock-Watson tests.       Here the main result          is   that, even within the earlier

                                                 for money in explaining
sample period, the finding of a significant role

subsequent movements       in income depends critically on the use in the analysis of

a particular interest rate that is unlikely to reflect debt market fluctuations

accurately.        Section III reports results for tests of the co-integrationof

                                     Here, as in Section I, the relationships                  that would

have to hold in order to warrant using money as the central focus of monetary

policy disappear when the analysis includes data from the 1980s.   Section IV

briefly concludes by drawing together the implications of these respective

findings for monetary policy.

across different      financial     aggregates    and across different        time periods, of

in the United States to lagged growth rates of a financial aggregate and

government spending.         Each equation is of the form

      For the sample spanning 1960:11-1979:111 --                 that   is, from the earliest time

for which the Federal Reserve provides data corresponding                    to its current

definitions of the monetary aggregates, until the introduction of its new

monetary policy procedures in October 1979               -   - these   equations   all exhibit the

modest success in accounting for nominal income growth that has become so

familiar in the literature.           The R2 values range from a low of .23 for the

monetary base to a high of .32 for Ml.              Extending the sample to include data

through yearend 1986 sharply lowers the            2 for         each aggregate,    however,   leaving

not one as high as        .20.   Going on to drop the observations from the 1960s,

thereby focusing on the most recent seventeen years of experience, eliminates

the explanatory power of these equations                almost altogether.         For the

1970:I-1986:IV      sample, not one of these equations has an               2 even as high as        .10.

of   whether money (or any other aggregate) can usefully play a role in the

monetary policy process has focused not just on whether past fluctuations of

money help predict fluctuations          of income (or prices, and so on) but on whether

lines constitute valid tests of "causality" is beside the point.                  As long as

movements      in money do contain information about future movements             in income

beyond what is already contained in movements in income itself, monetary policy

can exploit that information by responding to observed money growth- regardless

unobserved influence.                                                                                -

statistically        significant at the .01 level, regardless   of whether the analysis

includes the fiscal variable.           Merely including data through 1987 reduces the

significance       of Ml, and eliminates    it altogether for credit.    Dropping the data

from the 1960s renders not one of the resulting F-statistics significant even at

the .10 level.

       Table   3   presents analogous    F-statistics for equations    in which the variable

whose movements are to be explained is not nominal income but either real income

or the price level.        As is consistent with much of the existing literature, the

pre-1980 evidence is mixed, depending on which aggregate the equation includes,

whether    the dependent variable is income or prices, and whether or not the

equation includes the fiscal variable.5 Nevertheless, through 1979 each of

these aggregates contained          statistically significant information about at least

one of real income or prices, under at least one specification.              Including data

through 1987 eliminates most of these positive results.              Dropping the data from

the 1960s eliminates them altogether,          except for one F-statistic    (out of twelve

-   - about what would be     expected in the context of no systematic      relationship

whatsoever)        that remains significant at the .10 level.

       Not surprisingly, as such findings first began to appear they prompted a

search for alternative specifications          that would continue    to reveal a


statistically significant role for money in explainingmovements of income

and/or prices.        The most widely known such effort is perhaps that of Stock and

Watson (forthcoming), who showed that money (Ml) did have statistically

significant effects on subsequent movements of real income (proxied by

industrial production)        in appropriatelyspecified equations based on U.S.

                                     -   - the   F-statistic for the null hypothesis        that

all six coefficients on lagged money are zero was 3.04, easily significant at

the .01 level.

    Table 4 presents F-statistics summarizing the results of replicating Stock

and Watson's tests using data through September 1979, then through December 1985

as in their work, and then through September 1987.                  The results are for Stock

and Watson's preferred specification             (including a linear time trend) and also

for two variants that they used:            one with no time trend at all, and one with

both linear and quadratic trends.

     In the results based on the pre-1980 data, neither the F-statistic for

Stock and Watson's preferred specification nor that for the variant including

the quadratic trend is significant at even the .10 level.                    (In this context it

is no surprise that the literature           through that time did not emphasize the

inclusion of trends.)       As in Stock and Watson's results, the F-statistics for

all three specifications         are highly significant in the results based on data

through 1985.        Data revisions not incorporated by Stock and Watson change the

three F-statistics      only slightly.       Including the data from 1986 and 1987 sharply

lowers all three, however, leaving none             --    not   even that for the preferred

specification -       significant    at the .10 level.          Moreover,   results   (not shown)

F-statistic   for money significant,         even at the .10 level, in analogously

specified equations for nominal income,             or,    for that matter, in analogous

II.   Interest Rates and the Effect of Money on Out*.it

                                                  has become customary in tests for

effects of money on real output to control for the effect of interest rates.

Money growth, after all,    is not the   only potential source of information about

the state of financial markets, nor the only potential measure of whatever

Comparative examination of tests using different monetary aggregates

              as in Section I, have long been standard.       In recent years, however,
aggregates,

most studies have broadened the class of financial variables that may

potentiallybe of use in this context to include not just financial quantity

variables,    like money and credit, but also financial price variables including

interest rates.

      A                                                    of tests for the effect
          typical finding in such work is that the results

of money on output is highly sensitive to whether or not the analysis also

includes an interest rate.     One especially interesting     feature of Stock and

Watson's findings,    therefore,   was the limited nature of this sensitivity that


they reported.     True, deleting the interest rate from their preferred

specification    raised the F-statistic for the test of the effect of money on

output from 3.04 to 3.50.     The more important point is that even the smaller

                                                                   at the          .01
value, for the system including the interest rate, was significant

level.

      Although the inclusion of an interest rate in empirical work of this kind

has become standard,    there has beei little discussion     n the   lit   ature of just


which interest rate is appropriate.       Moreover what little discussion there is

has focused on such matters as the difference between long-term rates (with

their inherent anticipatoryproperties)          and short-term rates, rather than on

                                                                   the most

sense to use.7     Sims (1980) and Friedman (1983) both used the commercial paper

rate, while Litterman and Weiss (1985), Eichenbaum and Singleton (1986) and

Stock and Watson (forthcoming) all used the Treasury bill rate.8 None of these

authors, however, offered substantive           arguments in support of the selection

made.

        Just as different monetary aggregates correspond to different conceptual

ways of measuring financial market quantity information, different short-term

interest rates correspond    to different        conceptual ways of measuring financial

market price information.     In the case of the commerical paper rate                  -   - that      is,

the interest rate on short-term unsecured borrowing by corporations in

nonfinancial    lines of business   -   - and   the Treasury bill rate   -   -   that       is,   the

                                                              - -            there   are
analogous    unsecured borrowing rate for the U.S. Government

                                                                                of
substantive    grounds on which to question which one provides the better gauge

financial prices that matter for the determination of real economic activity.

        At the most obvious level, the commercial paper rate more directly reflects

the cost of finance corresponding         to potentially interest-sensitive             expenditure

flows than does the Treasury bill rate.            To the extent that interest rates

matter for nonfinancial economic activity primarily because they affect the

behavior of private-sectorborrowers,            therefore, any influence that causes these

two rates to covary imperfectly will make the commercial paper rate superior to

the Treasury bill rate as a measure of this effect.            For example, when changes

in the perceived creditworthiness         of the average business alter the spread

between the rate on potentially defaultable commercial paper and that on

presumably default-free Treasury bills, as often happens over the course of a

typical business cycle      it is the commercial paper rate that conveys more

information about the borrowing costs that may affect spending flows.                         By

contrast,     to the extent that interest rates matter for nonfinancial activity
                                             -11-




primarily by affecting the behavior of those who save and invest, rather than of

those who borrow,     the Treasury bill rate        is   plausibly more relevant.

     The interest rates on commercial paper and Treasury bills covary

imperfectly     for reasons other than time-varying perceptions of creditworthiness,

however.     Because many of the other sources of this imperfect           covariation

reflect technical oddities of the Treasury bill market,              rather than anything

directly bearing on the role of interest rates in affecting nonfinancial

economic activity,     in the end the commercial paper rate is probably the better

measure regardless of whether borrowers'            or lenders'   behavior is the more

important    in this regard.    Short-term   fluctuations in the Treasury's         cash flow

alternately swell the supply of bills or increase the demand (by forcing banks

to present eligible collateral against enlarged tax and loan account balances).

These fluctuations occur in part on a seasonal basis, but also in part

irregularly.     Fluctuations   in the volume of advance debt refundings by state and

local governments,     as sometimes   occur in anticipation of changes in tax

legislation,    also affect the demand for Treasury bills (because of legal

restrictions on these borrowers'      options for temporarily         re-investing advance

refunding proceeds).      So do fluctuations        in the Federal   Reserve's   open market

operations    (because most open market purchases and sales take place in Treasury

securities).     So do most exchange market interventions by foreign central banks

(because most, though nowadays not all, hold a disproportionatelylarge share of

their dollar portfolios in Treasury bills compared to the typical private market

participant).     So do the "window dressing" activities of banks and other private

investors    that choose to sacrifice   a few days'        interest differential in order to

show atypically large Treasury bill holdings on their year- or even quarter-end

financial statements.      The effect of each of these distortions is to make

movements    in the Treasury b11 rate less likely to correspond to what matters                in
                                             -12-




financial markets for nonfinancial economic activity than movements in the

comnierical paper rate.

     If the commercial paper rate is in fact the better measure of financial

market price information in this context, then using it instead of the Treasury

bill rate will make a difference for tests of the information about output

movements    contained   in money (or any other financial quantity variable).        Table


5 presents evidence showing that the choice of short-term interest rate does

indeed matter in just this way.           The table shows F-statistics for tests of the

null hypothesis that all of the coefficients on money are zero, and also for

                                                                               on the
(separate) tests of the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients

interest rate are zero, in Stock-Watsonequations for real output.             The table

shows results based on using the three month Treasury bill rate as the model's

short-term    interest rate, as in Stock and Watson's work,       and alternative    results


based on using the four-to-six month comniercial paper rate.          In both cases the

sample period ends in December 1985.

     Although the F-statistics for the effect of ftg          interest   fl on output are
uniformly larger for the commerical          paper rate than for the Treasury bill rate,

in no case does the change render this effect significant at any plausible

level.   By contrast, which short-term interest rate the model includes strongly

affects the significance of the effect of                on output.   In Stock and

Watson's preferred       specification,    the effect of money that is easily significant

at the .01 level in the presence of the Treasury bill rate is no longer
                                                                          rate.
significant even at the .05 level in the presence of the commercial paper

In both of the variant specifications,          making this substitution renders the

effect of money that is easily significant at the .05 level in Stock and

Watson's results no longer significant even at the .10 level.

      Just as the results presented in Section I show that adding data from 1986

md     1987 to the sample is subversive of Stock and Watson's findings, the

evidence shown here indicates that           within         °           Stock   and

latson's findings hinge crucially on the use of the Treasury bill rate (with all

,f its technical    oddities) rather than the commercial paper rate, to represent

rinancial market price information.       Not surprisingly,   simultaneouslyextending

:he sample        substituting the commercial paper rate for the Treasury bill rate

)verwhelnts Stock and Watson's positive findings altogether.        As Table 6 shows,

the F-statistic    for the effect of money on output in their preferred

.96,   with marginal significance level    .453.   The corresponding    collapse is just

tndication that the commercial paper rate is simply superior to the Treasury

conomic activity, further investigation shows that the relevant interactions

uay in fact be more subtle.     Table 7 presents F-statistics for several tests of

III. The Co-Intezration of Money and Income

        The empirical teata reported in Sections I and II all focus on

relationships    connecting the growth rate of money (or some other financial

aggregate)    to the growth rate of income or prices.    Formulating these tests in

terms of growth rates    is appropriate   in light of the repeated finding that in

fact money, income and prices all move through time in a nonstationary fashion,

with no tendency for the respective levels of these variables to return to

specific values.9     By contrast, for some questions of potential importance in
the practical conduct of monetary policy, what matters      is indeed the

relationship between the    ii&i of   money and the   ixi of   income or prices.

        The relationship between the respective   levels of money and of income or

prices is especially relevant in the context of the 'base drift' problem that

inevitably    arises when the central bank uses as an intermediate target a money

(or credit) aggregate    that is endogenous over short time horizons.     In

particular,    whenever actual money growth has differed from the growth rate

targeted ex ante, the central bank must decide whether to "let bygones be

bygones" and simply conduct monetary policy so as best to achieve the targeted

growth rate thereafter, or, instead, seek to return the chosen aggregate itself

to the previously targeted path, thereby offsetting the initial unplanned

deviation of actual from targeted money growth by a subsequent, deliberately

engineered deviation in the opposite directionJ0        As Walsh (1986) has shown,

which of these two strategies is preferable depends on whether whatever

disturbance    to the money-income (or money-price)   relationship has accompanied

the original departure    from the targeted path is more likely to prove permanent

or transitory, and a strategy of offsetting observed deviations only in part

will,   in general   dominate either one.   Offsetting in full all observed
deviations    of actual from targeted money growth is optimal only if all
                                                  -16-




disturbances    to the money-income relationship sre transitory.

      The snswer to the "base drift" dilemma therefore depends on whether the
                                                    snd income                          -   - in   its
relstionship between the respective levels of money

simplest snd most fsmiliar form, the ratio of money

is   stationary.    The fact that money and income are both individually

nonstationary      need not, of course, imply that the ratio of one to the other is

                              In statistical     terms, two series are co-integrated                     whenever
also nonstationary.

two that is stationary.           A stationary money-income ratio therefore means that

                                                in logarithms.
money and income are co-integrated

       An alternative statement of what co-integration implies that is especially
                                                                the point in
useful for applications to questions about monetary policy puts

terms of error correction.           As Engle and Cranger (1987) have shown, if two

variables   are co-integrated then it is possible to express the relationship

between them as an error-correction process in which the change in either

variable is a function of current and past deviations, from the equilibrium
                                                                             variables'
value, of the appropriately          specified linear combination of the two

respective levels.            For income chosen as the variable that changes in response

to disturbances,        such a representation of the money-income relationship is



                                   - (a
                        —                 +

where y and m are again the logarithms of income and money, respectively; A(L)

 is a disturbance       term.     Subject to the lags embodied in A(L),                 (3)   implies that

then the level of the money stock is an appropriate intermediate target of

monetary policy if the ultimate policy objective is to affect the level of

income   -




        Empirically   establishing the presence or absence of co-integration in this

case essentially amounts to testing for stationarity the estimated residual from

some form of regression of the level of income on the level of money.                    For

example,     if the error-correction   mechanism in     (3)   is a valid representationof

the adjustment process for y, the disturbance v in the regression




                                                                                          (4)




must be stationary.11       If v is stationary (with equilibrium level equal to zero,

because the equation includes an intercept), then y and               in   are co-integrated in

that y will tend to return to the equilibrium value               (a + $m) after any realized

disturbance.      Alternatively,   if v is as likely to increase or decrease from each

period's realized value, then y and m have no tendency to return to an

equilibrium relationship,      and hence are not co-integrated.

        The simplest test procedure,    proposed by Dickey and Fuller (1979), examines

the first-order autocorrelationof the residual from (3), or any other

co-integratingregression, by first estimating the secondary regression

where    the v are fitted values of v, p     and        are coefficients        to be estimated,

rejection of the null hypothesis therefore means

v for stationarity in the presence of higher-order autocorrelationsrequires the

use of an alternative procedure like the augmented Dickey-Fuller method, which

      It is always possible,              of course, that money (or credit, or the monetary

base) may in fact be co-integrated with income, but with a co-integrating

relationship    different         from     (4).      Tables 9 and 10 therefore report the results

used to be regarded as a stable trend, approximating                                 3% per annum, in the


relationship between income and                   Ml.   -   - while      (7)   treats v as a disturbance    to   t

results differ appreciably from those reported in Table 8 based on the simpler

co-integratingequation.                  Once again, the evidence supporting co-integration

before 1980 refers mostly to M2 and credit (and not at all to Ml), and there                                     is


no such evidence for the sample extended to include the 1980s.

      Unlike before the 1980s, therefore, there is no longer evidence to support

the claim that M2, credit, or the monetary base is co-integrated with income.

IV.   Summary   of   Conclusions and Policy Imvlicacions

      The empirical    findings presented   in this paper consistently show that

evidence based on the most recent U.S. experience           does not indicate a close or

reliable relationship between money and nonfinancial economic activity.               First,

merely extending the analysis to include data from the 1980s sharply weakens the

time-series     evidence from prior periods showing that such relationships         existed

between money and nominal income, or between money and either real income or

prices considered separately.       Focusing on data from 1970 onward destroys this

evidence altogether.      The deterioration of the evidence supporting a

relationship to either real or nominal income, or to prices, appears not just

for Ml but for other monetary aggregates           and for credit as well.

      Second, the finding that particular forms of time-series          experiments    still

showed a significant role for money in affecting real output through 1985 not

only becomes weaker on the inclusion of data from 1986 and 1987 but also, even

for data through 1985 only, turns out to depend on the use in the analysis              of a


particular short-term interest rate, the Treasury bill rate.            Using instead the

commercial paper rate, which apparently        is superior in capturing      the information

in financial prices that matters for the determination of real output, also

strongly weakens this prior finding.        Simultaneously     using the conunerical paper

rate and including data through 1987 destroys it altogether.

      Third, extending the analysis through 1987 also destroys the time-series

evidence from earlier periods showing that money and income are co-integrated.

As in the first set of conclusions,      this deterioration in the 1980s applies not

just to Ml but also to other monetary aggregates and to credit.

      These results bear strongly negative implications for monetary policy

frameworks    that focus the design and implementationof policy on money (or

credit) in any formally systematic way.            There is no longer empirical evidence
                                         -21-




to support the existence of relationships       that would warrant making monetary

policy in such ways.    The point is not just that the money-income      relationship

does not satisfy the stringent conditions that would be required to render

                                   an intermediate                 More importantly,
optimal the strict use of money as                       target.

there is no evidence to show that fluctuations       in money contain any information

about subsequent movements    in income or prices.     Further, even if the central

bank did choose for some reason to base monetary policy on the use of money as

an intermediate target, in the absence of evidence indicating that money and

income are co-integrated there would be no grounds on which to resist "base

drift."

     The paper's one finding with potentially positive implications        for monetary


policy is that the spread between the commerical paper rate and the Treasury

bill rate does contain information about future movements in real income,

information that is highly significant regardless of the sample period under

investigation.   It   is difficult   to imagine that the Federal Reserve could use

this interest rate spread as an intermediate policy target, and doubtful that

the relationships   found here would continue to hold if it did.       y contrast,     in

a world in which previously standard financial quantities can no longer serve as
                                                                        about
policy information variables because they no longer contain information

the macroeconomic   outcomes that monetary policy seeks to affect, policymakers

must somehow fill the resulting vacuum by exploiting information from wherever

they happen to find    it.

1.    See, for example, the literature   surveyed by Friedman (forthcoming).

2.    See, for example, the literature   surveyed by McCallum (1985).

3.    Kareken et al. (1973) first formally introduced the information variable
      concept into the analysis of monetary policy. See Friedman (1975) for a
      formal analysis of the intermediate target variable procedure.

4.    The monetary base and the three "M's" are based on the conventional Federal
      Reserve Board definitions. Credit is the outstanding indebtedness of
      domestic nonfinancial borrowers.  Income is gross national product.
      (Substituting domestic absorption for gross national product does not
      systematically change the results reported here, or in most of the tables
      introduced below; see, however, footnote 14.) All data are seasonally
      adjusted.

5.    The sensitivity of the results of such tests to these and other aspects of
      the underlying specification are well known.  See, for example, Zellner
      (1985)

6.    The same is true for credit. M2 is significant in some specifications of
      the equation for real income (though not for prices) for the
      1960:11-1987:11 sample, but not for the 1970:1-1987:11 sample.

7.    See Friedman (1984) for a comparative treatment of long-versus short-term
      interest rates, and Eichenbauxn and Singleton (1986) for a discussion of the
      use of equity prices, in this context.

8.    Eichenbaum and Singleton were incorrect in stating   (p.   125) that Sims had
      used the Treasury bill rate; see Sims (p. 252).

9.    See, for example, Nelson and Plosser (1982). In more precise statistical
      terms, the work "nonstationary" here means that the variance of a
      stochastic time series process grows over time without bound; see, for
      example, Fuller (1976).

10.   The origin of the label "base drift" for this problem was the complaint,
      often voiced during the late 1970s, that the Federal Reserve System was
      accommodating rising inflation by pursuing a "bygones" strategy in which
      the targeted rate of money growth was low each year but actual money growth
      on a multi-year basis was high because, with repeated upward errors, each
      year's target growth was calibrated from the higher "base" level resulting
      from the previous year's actual growth.

11.   Specifying the relationship in terms of a constant equilibrium value for
      the money-income ratio simply corresponds to setting $ — 1.
12.   As is well known, the distribution of the resulting test statistic is
      highly non-normal, and so critical values are typically calculated from
      Monte Carlo simulations. See Engle and Cranger (1987) for a discussion of
      these and other plausible test statistics for the presence of
      co-integration, and for computation of critical values.

13.   Significance levels are indicated according to critical values computed by
      Engle and Granger (1987) for a time series of length 100, and with lag
      length 4 in the case of the adjusted Dickey-Fuller test. As Engle and
      Cranger demonstrated, tests of the null hypothesis of no co-integration
      (p1
          — 1) tend to
                        display low power against alternatives corresponding to
                                  — .95. For example, with     — .9 and N — 100
      co-integration, such as p1                            p1
      the Dickey-Fuller test at the .05 level would, on average, reject the "no
      co-integration" null hypothesis only 15% of the time.   For the purposes of
      monetary policy, however -- including in particular the question of what to
      do about "base drift" - -it  matters little whether shocks to the
      money-income relationship are truly permanent (p1 — 1) or only very highly
      persistent.   Values of p1 equal to .95 or .99, for example, still imply
      shocks with half-lives equal to 13.5 quarters or 69 quarters, respectively.

14.   If y is defined as domestic absorption instead of gross national product,
      the ADF statistic for M2 is   3.76, significant at the .01 level.
