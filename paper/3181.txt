                                 THE WAGE CURVE


                                   ABSTRACT
     This paper, which follows in an LSE tradition begun by

Phillips and Sargan,     examines the role of unemployment           in

shaping pay.    In contrast to most of the literature, it

     1) uses microeconometric data on individuals

        and workplaces

     2) examines a variety of data sets as a check on

        the robustness of results, and

     3) studies the effects of unemployment on the real

        wage level (not on the rate of change of payor

        prices) .

The paper finds     evidence -    on British and US data -         of a

wage curve.    The curve has a negative gradient at low levels

of unemployment,    but becomes horizontal at relatively high

levels of unemployment.
