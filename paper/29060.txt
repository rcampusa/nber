Modeling Macroeconomic Variations after Covid-19

                                          ABSTRACT

The coronavirus is a global event of historical proportions and just a few months changed the
time series properties of the data in ways that make many pre-covid forecasting models
inadequate. It also creates a new problem for estimation of economic factors and dynamic causal
effects because the variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the
distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the latter view and use covid
indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty
remains high at the end of 2020 even though real economic activity has recovered and covid
uncertainty has receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in
magnitude and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or indirectly
modeling covid and treating it as exogenous. These responses to economic shocks are distinctly
different from those to a covid shock, and distinguishing between the two types of shocks can be
important in macroeconomic modeling post-covid.

1    Introduction

The 2019 coronavirus (hereafter covid) is a once in a century global pandemic and remains
very much active as of the first draft of this writing, one year after it surfaced in early 2020.
It is a health disaster that has resulted in a loss of over half a million lives. It has also
disrupted economic activities to such an extent that the three trillion dollar relief package
passed by the Congress was not enough to offset the economic disruptions covid has caused.
Ludvigson et al. (2021) suggests that covid constitutes a 192 costly disaster shock.
   In addition to social and economic disruptions, covid has also created challenges for the
modeling of economic time series. If we plot a randomly chosen series used in business cycle
analysis, we will likely see a spike around March 2020 so large as to drawf five decades of ob-
servations preceding it. Without any adjustment, the post-covid observations will dominate
to yield uninterpretable estimates, messing up the pre-covid fit. A case in point is factor
estimation which is used in a variety of economic analysis. Without any adjustment, the
first factor known to load heavily on real activity variables would be 19 standard deviations
away from the mean of zero in March 2020 when by way of comparison, the financial crisis
in 2008 registered four standard deviations.
    There is no simple solution as there were only two pandemics in the post World War II
era, and no lockdown was enforced in 1957-58 or 1968-69. As the historical data provide little
guide to help understand the economic implications of global health shocks, how to econo-
metrically handle pandemics is very much an open question. We may treat these irregular
data points as temporary, but standard outlier adjustments would still leave the real activity
factor 13 standard deviations below mean. It could be argued that the extreme values are not
void of economic content and should not be 'dummied out'. Though treating the extreme
observations as resulting from shifts to the underlying distributions may seem appealing,
there are not enough post-covid data to model the instabilities adequately. Introducing
restrictions and information may help. Foroni et al. (2020) corrects post covid forecasts
using information from the 2008 financial crisis. Primiceri and Tambalotti (2020) assumes
that covid is a one-period shock that propagates differently from a typical macroeconomic
shock, but whose trajectory can be approximated by a polynomial. Dynamic responses are
then obtained by calibrating the polynomial to represent, for example, the scenario that
the pandemic will dissipate by the end of 2020. Others incorporate information via priors.
Lenza and Primiceri (2020) specifies a pareto distributed prior to the variance of the shocks
while Huber et al. (2020) estimates an additive regression tree and uses flexible priors to
deal with the extreme values during the pandemic. Many of these studies were prepared at


                                               1
the early stage of the pandemic and it is unclear whether the conclusions would hold up in
an extended sample that include the subsequent waves.
    The approach considered in this note also uses additional information, but I take as
starting point that covid is not an economic shock, but rather a large and persistent health
event with pervasive economic consequences. Under this view, the variations in the post-
covid economic data are large not because of changes in distribution of variables already in
the economic model, but because the economic data are no longer driven by economic shocks
alone. The presence of a new, non-economic shock has implications for factor estimation as
the principal components are no longer linear combinations of economic variations alone, for
diffusion index forecasting as new predictors might be relevant, and for estimation of the
dynamic causal effects of economic shocks as covid now becomes a confounder.
   To address these issues, I use covid indicators either as controls in regressions to 'de-
covid' the data so that economic factors and shocks can be identified, or as additional
predictors to account for the persistent nature of covid. In a nutshell, I use the covid
indicators to either remove or incorporate additional information relevant for the task. The
covid indicators also allow the trajectory of covid to be determined by the data. Three
measures of covid indicators are considered: hospitalization (H), positive cases (P ), and
deaths (D). They enter the de-covid regressions in four ways reflecting different assumptions
about March and April of 2020. I study their implications in the context of updating the
JLN measure of economic uncertainty developed in Jurado et al. (2015) since the exercise
has a factor estimation step and a forecasting step. I also explore the impact of covid for
VAR modeling. In my set up, the issue covid creates is that a n variable VAR now has
covid as the n + 1-th shock.
  The main findings can be summarized as follows. All four models find economic uncer-
tainty in March/April of 2020 to be at a historical high but there is no corresponding decline
in the level of real activity after controlling for covid. A decomposition finds that while
covid uncertainty has subsided and real activity rebounded by the end of the year, eco-
nomic uncertainty even after controlling for covid remains high. But while the uncertainty
estimates are qualitative similar across methods, the impulse response functions are strongly
affected by the de-covid method used. Dynamic responses to economic shocks similar to
the ones identified pre-covid can be obtained if we directly or indirectly remove the covid
variations prior to VAR estimation, essentially assuming that covid is exogenous. These
responses to economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a covid shock, reinforcing
the need to distinguish the two types of shocks in post-covid estimation. The data support
the exogeneity assumption.

2         Estimation of Common Factors

The JLN concept of uncertainty is based on the premise that uncertainty arises because of
lack of predictability with respect to information available, and macroeconomic uncertainty
occurs only when the lack of economic predictability is board based. Three ingredients
are needed to make the uncertainty measure operational: factor estimation, forecasting,
and volatility estimation.1 Ludvigson et al. (2020) makes mean and standard deviation
adjustments prior to factor estimation and add covid variables as predictors. The procedure
worked well for the August release of FRED-MD but the adjustments treat too much of the
subsequent variations as predictable, making uncertainty counter-intuitively low. Moran
et al. (2020) uses the same approach to update a Q2 measure of Canadian uncertainty.
Quarterly data are less affected by spikes created by covid because the month-to-month
variations tend to average out, so the adjustments may perhaps not be necessary. My focus
in what follows is the modeling of monthly data.
        Generically let X be a panel of data with N columns. Let To = 720 be the size of the
pre-covid sample running from 1960:3-2020:2. The T0 × N matrix of pre-covid data X are
assumed to have a factor structure

                                        Xit - µi = i Ft + eX
                                                           it


where Ft = (F1t , . . . Frt ) is a vector of r common economic factors and eX
                                                                            it is an idiosyncratic
error associated with variable i. Under conditions in Bai and Ng (2002) for example, the
principal components of X will consistently estimate F and  up to a rotation matrix. In
practice, the data are transformed by taking log and first or second difference, and adjusted
for outliers data prior to estimation. The latter amounts to treating as missing those ob-
servations whose deviations from median are ten times larger than the difference between
values at the top and bottom 25 percentiles, and imputing the missing values using the EM
algorithm. Prior to covid this procedure affects only a few observations during the financial
crisis of 2008.
        Let T1 = 730 be the size of the full sample spanning 1960:3-2020:12, so observations
T0 + 1 to T1 are post covid. Instead of modeling covid effects through shifts to Ft or eX
                                                                                        it ,
    1
    In practice, rm = 8 economic factors Fm are estimated from a large panel of Nm macro economic
variables XM , and rf = 4 financial factors Ff from Nf financial time series XF . In implementation, data
for XM are taken from fred-md and transformed as documented in McCracken and Ng (2016), and XF are
based on those used in Ludvigson and Ng (2007). The data are demeaned and standardized prior to factor
estimation.




                                                   3
I allow for a virus factor Vt so that the factor representation of the extended sample is

                                     Xit - µi = i Ft + i Vt + eX
                                                               it


Assumption A

   i. Vt = 0 when t <= T0 , and for t > T0 + 1, Vt is a persistent process with innovations
                 2
         vt  (0, v ).

   ii. Let Ft = F (L)uF        F       2         X    X     X         X       2
                      t where ukt  (0, Fk ) and eit = i (L)uit where uit  (0, Xi ). The
         shocks (uF    X
                  t , ut , vt ) are serially and mutually uncorrelated.


       Assumption (i) states that Vt is non-zero only after March 2020 and allows it to be
persistent.2 Assumption A.ii assumes that the shocks (uF    X
                                                       t , ut , vt ) are serially and mutually
uncorrelated. Now Vt and Ft are both common factors in the sense that they affect a
sufficiently large number of series indexed by i. Unlike the pre-covid data, the principal
components of X over the full sample will no longer be spanned by the economic factors Ft
alone. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the full sample location and scale of the data will be
dominated by the last few observations, creating spurious revisions to estimates obtained
before covid.3
   I consider estimation of economic factors Ft from 'de-covid' data

                                              Xi,t - µ0it      t  T0
                                      xit =           1
                                              Xit - µit        t > T0

for suitably defined µ0       1                                           0     0
                      it and µit . For the pre-covid sample, one can let µit = µi for all t  T0 ,
and a consistent estimate of µ0
                              i is the mean of series i over the sample up to and including
T0 . Estimation of µ1
                    it is more delicate as covid is persistent and so its trajectory also needs
to be specified. Even if Vt was observed, there are fewer than a year's worth of monthly
data to work with. More problematic is that F and V are both latent, both pervasive, and
both persistent. Thus recovering both from the post-covid data would require additional
information. I make use of covid indicators.4
   2
     We can also model the non-zero values for the 1968-69 pandemic, but its health and especially the
economic impact were small relative to covid. See Doshi (2008) and article in 'Solving the Mystery of the
1957 and 1968 Flu Pandemics in Bloomberg Opinion, March 11, 2021.
   3
     The financial factors are much less impacted by the covid observations. The first financial factor based
on unadjusted data is -4.71, comparable to -4.73 in October 2008 and -6.15 in October 1987.

                 Note: H is HospitalizedIncrease, P is PostiveIncrease and D is DeathIncrease.
                 Daily data are aggregated to monthly.
                 Source: covidtracking.com/data/download/national-history.csv.

       Table 1 shows the daily data for H = 'hospitalizedIncrease, P ='positiveIncrease', and
D='deathIncrease' aggregated to monthly. The cumulative sum of P agrees with 11 million
cases documented for the United States in February 2021, while the cumulative sum of D
is 336802 in December 2020. Of the three proxies, D tends to lag H and P , while P may
overstate the situation because one could be tested positive and yet asymptomatic. From
these covid indicators, I construct three versions of vt :

                                                             Vt
                                             vt = log            .
                                                            Vt-1

Notably, the V series trend up throughout 2020 but the v series are less persistent.5 While
the data show large increases in V in the summer and the fall, it is the extraordinary jumps
at the outbreak of the pandemic that is problematic for estimation.
       Given my presumption that covid and economic shocks co-exist, the first task is to
isolate the (predictable and unpredictable) covid variations. It is natural to identify vT0 +1
   5
    The data for H vary across source but the v values are quite similar. Since there were zero hospitalizations
in February but the March value for vt is crucial, the calculation assumes H = 1 in February.

              t , ut )=(0,0) at t = T0 + 1. But covid was spreading rapidly in April at the
same time when the lockdown was in place, so different interpretations to April are possible.
I consider four specifications of the following:

                           Xit = do + i Dt + i0 vt + i1 vt-1 + iq vt-q + xit .

                         t           Model1*      Model 2 Model 3         Model 4
                         Dt=T0 +1    1            1          1            -
                         vt=T0 +1    0            vT0 +1     vT0 +1       vT0 +1
                         i0          0            0          =0           =0
                                      (*) data   adjusted for outlier

      In all models, i1 , . . . , iq are unrestricted and differ in the treatment for March and April
of 2020. Model 1 replaces the outliers by the pre-covid means. Since the interquartile range
is now computed on the full sample, the outliers are concentrated in the two months in
question. Models 1, 2, and 3 pick up the jump at the outbreak using a one time dummy Dt ,
essentially modeling March as a pure covid shock. By setting both vT0 +1 and i0 to zero,
Model 1 allocates all variations in April to economic sources and is expected to generate
large (economic) residuals for that month. Models 2, 3, and 4 control the extreme values
using covid data. Model 2 allows vt to enter only with a lag while Model 3 allows for
contemporaneous effects. Model 4 allows for economic shocks in March by simply letting
current and past effects of vt be removed from Xit as determined by the regression. To be
clear of what the models imply, I list the first few post-pandemic values of the regressors
(from March to July of 2020) for the P version below.

adjustments for March 2020 are quite similar across methods. For example, based on Model
4, µ
   ^0 napmnoi (new orders) changes from 55.440 in February to µ    ^1 = 42.269 in March,
napm from 52.983 to 49.122, cumfns (capacity utilization) from -0.013 to -3.617, umscent
(consumder sentiment) from -0.10 to -12.68, unrate (unemployment rate) from 0.01 to
0.969, and claims (unemployment claims) from 0.0 to 2.515, while housing variables such
as permit as well as awhman (average man hours) are much less affected. These results
are representative of all four models. However, the April estimates for Model 1 are quite
different from those for Models 2, 3, and 4. Model 1 gives (53.941, 0.005, -0.102) for napm,
payems. and claims, while Model 4 yields much larger changes of (42.081, -0.146, and
0.651) respectively, with the implication that the adjusted data x for Model 1 will have more
extreme values than the other three models.
      Figure 1 plots the 2020 adjustments for eight selected series. The impact and subsequent
adjustments vary significantly across series and over time. Compared to the Model 1 ad-
justments in the top panel, the Model 4 adjustments in the bottom panel tend to be more
concentrated around April 2020. The differences are most notable for rpi, payems, bus-
loans and claims.8 . According to Model 4, many series are back to the Janurary/February
levels shortly after April.
   Once xit = Xit - µ ^1it is available, I proceed to estimate the factors. Though xit is mean
zero in the two respective subsamples, they may not be mean zero when pooled. The stacked
data are demeaned and standardized prior to factor estimation by the method of principal
components. In the 2020-02 (pre-covid) vintage of FRED-MD which reports data up to
2019-12, F1 explains 16% of the variation in the data. All three post-covid estimates of
F1 continue to capture about 16% of the variations in the extended sample and are nearly
identical up till 2020-02, with pairwise correlations exceeding 0.99.
   Turning to the other factors, F^2 in the pre-covid data loads heavily on term spreads and
explains 7% of variations pre-covid, while F   ^3 which loads heavily on prices and explains
about 6.7% of the variations. In the post-covid sample, F ^2 still loads heavily on term spreads
          ^3 still loads heavily on prices. These two factor estimates, along with F
while and F                                                                           ^4 , F

three estimates of F1 are above the February level at the end of the year.


3        Forecasting and Measuring Uncertainty Post-Covid

The second step of the JLN exercise involves generating h-step ahead prediction errors.
Following Stock and Watson (2002), we form diffusion index forecasts by augmenting the
estimated factors to an autoregression:9 .

                         yjt+h = y           F     ^ ^ W (L)Wt + v y
                                 jh (L)yjt + jh (L)Ft + jh        jt+h


Prior to covid yjt is one of the 134 series in FRED-MD (ie. Xjt ) after standardization,

                                          ^ ,F
                                    Wt = (F    ^ ,F^2 , G ^ m,t ) .
                                            mt  ft  m,1,t

      ^mt is a set of eight macro factors, F
where F                                    ^f t is a set of four financial factors, Gm is the first
           2
factor in Xm . A t test with a threshold of 2.56 is used to screen predictors.
    covid changes this exercise in two ways. First, as there is now a new source of variation
in the data, predictability of yjt+h as measured by Xjt+h must be distinguished from pre-
dictability as measured by xjt+h . Second, the lingering effects of covid on economic activity
are not entirely unpredicted after the initial outbreak. Schorfheide and Song (2020) finds it
better to make forecasts shortly after covid using the model estimated pre-covid, but this
cannot be a sustained solution.10 . I expand the predictor set to include covid indicators:
Let
                                  Wt+ = (F            ^m,
                                               ^f t , F
                                         ^mt , F        2
                                                          1,t , v
                                                                ^tP
                                                                     ^t
                                                                    ,v D
                                                                         ).                           (1)

Since yjt has been transformed to be stationary, I use vt instead of Vt which is not stationary.
I enter two measures of vt in Wt because the number of deaths tend to lag the number of
positive cases, and the two may contain different information. However, Gm is no longer a

    The authors consider a mixed (monthly-quarterly) frequency VAR of eleven variables and finds that for
forecasts made in the end of January, April, and May of 2020, the model estimated using data up to the end
of 2019 are reasonable than those based on recursive estimation that includes the post covid data

potential predictor set. This factor would have to be estimated from the panel of Xjt which
necessitates additional adjustments. It is noteworthy that based on the t test criterion, the
variables being selected are quite similar before and after covid. The lags of v
                                                                               ^t are selected
with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 0.54.
    After an h period ahead diffusion forecast for series j is obtained from the factor-
augmented regression, step three of the JLN exercise estimates stochastic volatility models

This volatility estimation step is unaffected by covid though the volatility estimates will be
higher after covid. The three-steps yield N estimates of individual uncertainties which are
then aggregated to form macro-economic uncertainty by equal-weighting. I will denote the
macro-uncertainty measure based on predictability of x by U (x), to distinguish it from the
one based on predictability of X , which is denoted U (X ).
    Figure 4 plots the P version of uncertainty for Models 1 and 4. U (X ) is higher than U (x)
because X retains the covid variations which contribute to unpredicted forecast errors.
Model 1 suggests higher uncertainty in 2020 than Model 4 because of the treatment of
the April variations. But regardless of model and version, uncertainty is high in 2020 by
historical standard. There are now four episodes of uncertainty that exceed 1.65 standard
deviations: the 2007-09, the 1981-82 and 1973-74 recessions, and covid.
    The difference between UM (X ) and UM (x) can be thought of as 'covid uncertainty'. This
is plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 4 for Model 4. Though covid uncertainty' is high in
March, it has subsided by the end of 2020. Also of note is that the covid uncertainty series
for Models 2, 3, and 4 are very similar, suggesting that the March dummy incorporated in
Models 2 and 3 is unnecessary, and the agnostic approach used in Model 4 suffices. The next
section shows that Method 4 is also useful in VAR analysis.

4    Implications for Estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects

The data issues created by covid also apply to other forms of time series modeling. Prior
to covid, the model for the n × 1 vector of variables Yt is
                                   Yt =  + A(L)Yt-1 + Bet
where et is a vector of n economic shocks. Now extend the data to include ten months of
covid data. Under the view that covid is a health shock, there are now n + 1 shocks in
the n variable VAR which cannot be expected to recover n economic shocks.
    To illustrate, consider a VAR(p) in unemplyoment rate (UR) and log industrial produc-
tion (IP). The top panel of Figure 5 shows the dynamic responses to a UR shock using

                                                9
parameters estimate over the sample 1961:1-2019:12 with p = 6 lags. Both responses have a
hump shape shock, peak after eight months, and are persistent. The second panel of Figure
5 shows that the post-covid responses are generally larger in magnitude and distinctively
different in shape from the pre-covid responses in the top panel. In particular, they are
no longer hump shaped. Presumably, results like this have prompted Lenza and Primiceri
(2020) to scale up the variance of the shocks during the pandemic, and Carriero et al. (2021)
to incorporate outliers in a VAR with stochastic volatility. Instead of assuming changes to
the distributions of economic shocks, I assume that there is an additional shock.
       Following the arguments above, the idea is to purge v from each of the n · p variables in the
VAR. Note that this is not the same as running a VAR on n de-covid variables. However,
by Frish-Waugh arguments, it is simple to augment the n variable VAR in un-adjusted data
Y with v and its lags as exogenous variables.

                        Yt =  + Dt +  1t>T0 + A(L)Yt-1 +  (L)vt + Bet                           (VAR-E)

where Dt and each row of  (L) are defined as in Models 1 to 4 above. A mean shift dummy
is needed since the de-covid regressions are now run on the full sample. The role of v and
its lags is to partial out the effects of covid from the dependent variable and the regressors
so that coefficients can be used to construct dynamic responses to economic shocks, holding
v and its lags fixed. The third panel of Figure 5 shows the P version of the Model 4 impulse
responses based on (VAR-E) along with the 95% confidence interval. Notably, they are very
similar both in magnitude and in shape to the pre-covid responses in the top panel. The
results for D and H versions are similar. Methods 2 and 3 also retain the hump shaped
responses but not quite as close the pre-covid estimates as Model 4.
       It is of interest to consider a three variable VAR that includes a covid variable and
ordered first. While VAR-E assumes no feedback from UR or IP to v , a three variable
VAR allows for such feedback. The dynamic responses should be similar if covid is indeed
exogenous.11 The bottom panel of Figure 5 verifies that the responses of the three variable
VAR to a UR shock are similar to the ones plotted for VAR-E. However, these responses
to a UR shock are distinctly different from the responses to a covid shock. As seen from
Figure 6, a covid shock has much larger but shorter lived effects on economic activity. The
unemployment rate returns to control after about one year. The effect on IP, while large,
is statistically significant for only two months. A two variable VAR without controlling for
  11
    A six-variable VAR finds likewise that adding the covid indicators as exogenous variables recovers the
pre-covid impulse responses. The variables are unemployment rate (unrate), log of employment (payems),
log real consumption of durables (cdur), log real consumption of services (cs), industrial production (ip),
and log of the consumption expenditure deflator excluding food and energy.

covid would confound the responses to the two different shocks, as seen from the second
panel of Figure 5.

   A look at the orthogonalized shocks highlights the identification problem that covid
creates. The column labeled M0 is based on post-covid estimation without controls, while
M1, M2, M2, M4 correspond to the four methods above. These are all bivariate VARs and to
be distinguished from VAR3, which is a three-variable model for (v , UR, IP). The rows list
the values of the identified shocks from March through June as well as the correlation with
the corresponding shock identified pre-covid data over the overlapping sample. Evidently,
the M2, M3, M4 correlations are high and the shocks identified for UNRATE and IP in April
are small. With no or inadequate adjustments, the M0 and M1 correlations are lower, and
the shocks identified for UR and IP in April are large. The analysis lends support to treating
covid as exogenous which is the maintained assumption of Method 4 used to purge covid
effects from the data prior to factor estimation.
    Our covid variables are zero before March 2020 which can be approximated by time
series with values arbitrarily close to zero except for the few spikes in 2020. Data with such
extreme values have heavy tails, and one might wonder if our least squares used to estimate
the three variable VAR or the de-covid regressions are valid. Intuitively, the issue is that
in a standard regression framework, the response variable should have heavy tails if one of
the predictors has heavy tails. Yet, our economic data have fat but not heavy tails. For
such problems, Davis and Ng (2021) uses a new (heavy-light) framework to dampen the
coefficient on the heavy tailed predictor so that it can meaningfully affect the thin-tailed
response variable. In that setup, the coefficient on the heavy tailed regressor is consistent at
rate T 1/ where   (0, 2) is the tail index, implying that the estimated coefficient on the
heavy-tailed regressors are super-consistent.

5   Conclusion

covid can be treated as an outlier, a health shock with macroeconomic consequences, or
an economic shock. I use covid indicators to purge the data of their effects so that eco-
nomic factors can be estimated. Adding covid indicators to a VAR as exogenous controls
also makes it possible to recover impulse responses to economic shocks similar to the ones
estimated pre-covid. This note draws attention to the need to control for covid variations
in macroeconomic modeling.
