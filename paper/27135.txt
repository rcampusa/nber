                                           ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stay-at-home policies and other social distancing behaviors
in the United States in spring of 2020. This paper examines the impact that these actions had on
emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity
consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each U.S. county, we find that vehicle
travel dropped about 40% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home
policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states, but travel in all states
decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (e.g.,
balancing authority), we find that electricity consumption fell about six percent on average by
mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use, we
estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality, and therefore expected declines
in mortality. Overall, we estimate that, for a month of social distancing, the expected premature
deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by
approximately 360 deaths, or about 25% of the baseline 1500 deaths. In addition, we estimate that
CO2 emissions from these sources fell by 46 million metric tons (a reduction of approximately
19%) over the same time frame.

1         Introduction
The novel coronavirus outbreak, along with measures intended to contain the spread of
COVID-19, resulted in significant, and in some cases, unprecedented, changes in society.
Because of these alterations to daily life, demand for numerous goods and services fell pre-
cipitously from late February through the present. Evidence of the far-reaching effects of
social distancing, retail closures, and, generally, reductions in economic activity, is perhaps
most obvious in weekly unemployment claims which exceed those during the Great Recession
by a factor of ten. Equally evocative is the collapse of oil prices.
        In a fossil fuel-based economy such as the U.S., a large adverse demand shock is likely to
have appreciable repercussions for emissions and ambient pollution levels. Though long-run
outcomes are not yet discernible, it is feasible to assess near term changes in certain measures
of environmental quality. Further, because there is an established literature linking exposure
to ambient pollution to various health outcomes, it is possible to gauge the effects of such
changes on public health. The goal of this analysis is to quantify the health effects of these
unprecedented changes from two channels: reduced travel and electricity consumption. This
quantification is an important input in an economic analysis of social distancing.
        Our analysis uses cell phone data, which are reported daily for every U.S. county, to
measure changes in mobility, and by extension, vehicle-miles traveled, over the February to
April, 2020 period. For electricity, we employ hourly data by electricity region (e.g., bal-
ancing authority) to estimate the changes in electricity consumption, and the corresponding
emissions, over the same time period controlling for observable factors such as temperature
and a battery of temporal fixed effects. We focus on reductions in emissions that contribute
to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ).1 In recent years, emissions from travel
and electricity generation account for between 25% and 50% of national totals depending on
pollution species.2 We use integrated assessment modeling to connect emissions to changes
in ambient PM2.5 and the associated reductions in expected adverse health effects from
exposure to pollution. Of particular interest are reductions in PM2.5 -associated mortality
    1
    Emitted pollutants tracked in this study include primary PM2.5 , sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides
(NOx ), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

    See Table A in the Appendix.

risk, as this health endpoint contributes the largest share of air pollution damages (Muller,
Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus, 2011).
   The cell phone data indicates that personal mobility declined about 40% on average,
with larger decreases in states that were early in implementing social distancing measures.
The reduction in electricity generation, in contrast, is just 6% on average. While behavioral
responses to COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders induce a large decline in travel, power
consumption decreases are smaller, perhaps due to a shift from commercial to residential
applications.
   We find that reduced travel and electricity generation are associated with a monthly
decrease of about 360 deaths from PM2.5 exposure in the contiguous U.S. As a means of
comparison, these emission sources contributed about 1500 deaths per month. Further, we
estimate that social distancing resulted in approximately 46 million metric tons less CO2
emissions per month, or about 19% of the 242 million metric tons that are emitted monthly
from driving and using electricity.
   The bulk of the reduction in deaths, about 315 per month, manifest from the fall in travel.
Decreases in nitrogen oxides (NOx ) emissions account for the largest share of this reduction,
approximately 200 per month. Reductions in deaths are primarily from cities because both
baseline vehicle-miles traveled and exposed populations are larger than in rural areas. We
estimate that emission reductions from less travel in Los Angeles induce 75 fewer deaths. In
New York City, the analogous total is 25 fewer deaths. States with the greatest reductions in
deaths from travel emissions include California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Illinois.
Note that these estimates are a function of the behavioral changes in mobility in response
to COVID-19, the implied changes in vehicle miles traveled, population exposure per ton of
emissions, and demographics of the exposed population.
   Location-specific reductions in deaths from electricity are much lower given the smaller
declines in consumption. Emission and reductions in deaths also display a different geo-
graphic pattern, with the largest reduction in deaths due to demand changes in the South-
east and Midwest. These estimates of reduction in deaths from electricity generation depend
on behavioral changes in power use in response to COVID-19, the likely changes in the op-



                                              2
eration of power plants across the country, population exposure per ton of emissions, and
demographics of the exposed population.
        Upon previewing our central results it is important to underscore two issues. First, the
point of this analysis is not to argue that COVID-19 was in any way beneficial. Rather,
we are analyzing an unprecedented set of circumstances, and quantifying the associated
changes in emissions from two major sectors of the economy to estimate the health benefits
that accrue from less reliance on fossil-based transportation and power generation. Second,
potential interactions between reduced exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 mortality risks are
not modeled. Because observed mortality rates are substantially higher during the months
covered by this paper, and due to the fact that PM2.5 -induced mortality risk is multiplica-
tively related to baseline risk (Krewski et al., 2009), our estimates may underestimate actual
mortality risk reductions.
        The novel coronavirus outbreak has occasioned a large outpouring of scientific research
including in the field of economics. However, only a limited number of working papers relate
to environmental aspects of the coronavirus outbreak.3 Our paper contributes most directly
to the literature on the determinants and consequences of social distancing policy (Allcott
et al. 2020, Briscese et al. 2020, Fang et al. 2020, Friedson et al. 2020, Greenstone and
Nigam 2020).
        Section 2 describes the data sources and methods for our estimation of the reduction
in deaths from reduced travel and reduced electricity consumption. Section 3 describes the
results, and Section 4 concludes.



2         Methods
Calculating the expected health effects of the reductions in personal vehicle travel and elec-
tricity consumption from social distancing has three components: first, estimating the re-
duction in travel or electricity consumption; second, calculating the resulting reduction in
    3
     A search of the NBER working paper series for April 2020 revealed that a remarkable 41 out of 151
working papers dealt directly with the coronavirus outbreak. However, none of these working papers address
its environmental aspects. Similarly a search of the broader IDEAS/REPEC working paper series yielded
573 results for 2020, but only seven of these are related to the environmental aspects of the coronavirus
outbreak.


                                                    3
emissions; and third, calculating the health effects of the reduction in emissions. To esti-
mate the reduction in travel or electricity consumption, we use estimates of counterfactual
travel or electricity usage based on historical data with controls for relevant confounding
variables, e.g., weather. Next, estimates of emission reductions are based on emissions rates
per unit of travel or on observed emissions from power plants. Finally, the health effects
of the reductions in emissions are calculated from the AP3 integrated assessment model.
AP3 maps emissions of different primary pollutants from different sources (counties or point
sources) into ambient concentrations of secondary pollutants at receptor counties and uses
dose-response relationships and county-specific demographics to calculate expected deaths
from the emissions. The AP3 model is explained in detail in Clay et. al. 2019. Below we
describe the procedure for estimating health effects from reductions in travel and electricity
usage in turn.


2.1       Personal Vehicle travel

To estimate the health effects of reduced vehicle travel, we first need an estimate of how
much travel decreased. Comprehensive data on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is reported by
a variety of state agencies and collected at the national level. However, our analysis requires
high frequency data to estimate the effect of social distancing that has only been in effect
for a short time. For high-frequency travel data, we turn to Unacast (2020).4 Unacast,
which specializes in mobility data analysis, created a pro bono COVID-19 Toolkit to help
researchers and to raise public awareness of social distancing. Unacast analyzed cell phone
mobility data to calculate a percentage reduction in distance traveled for each county.5,6
       We combine these percentage reductions with county-level estimates of light duty vehicle
VMT from the US EPA MOVES model to determine the reduction in VMT in each county.
Light duty vehicles include cars, mini-vans, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and some pick-up
   4
     Another potential source of high-frequency travel data is from highway monitors. California has the
most comprehensive data collection but only covers major highways.
   5
     To date, Unacast has not provided information on the time frame over which they estimated counter-
factual travel reductions and which control variables they included. In the Appendix, we analyze data from
Streetlight, who use an alternative methodology to infer VMT from cell phone mobility data. The results
are similar for the two sources.
   6
     An important confound might be the concurrent, dramatic fall in gasoline prices. Because the decreasing
gasoline price would tend to increase gasoline consumption, our calculations may understate the true effect.


                                                     4
trucks. By applying the Unacast percentage reduction to all light duty vehicles, we are
assuming that reductions in travel are proportional across the vehicle classes.
       The resulting reduction in light-duty vehicle travel is summarized in Figure 1a which
shows the seven-day moving average of the VMT-weighted average reduction across counties
for two groups: counties in states that had an early stay-at-home policy in place by March 28
and counties in states that did not (some of which imposed a stay-at-home policy at a later
date).7 Before early March there is no reduction in VMT, but by the end of March, VMT
fell by approximately 40%. States with early stay-at-home policies reduced travel more than
others, however, there is a substantial reduction in travel in all the states.8 Since early April,
the VMT reduction seems to have stabilized at around a 40% average reduction. We use the
last week of data (from April 11 to April 17) to calculate the reduction in light duty VMT
for each county relative to the baseline.
       The dramatic reduction in VMT is corroborated by a simultaneous reduction in the
consumption of gasoline. Figure A in the Appendix shows the consumption of gasoline by
week over 2007-2020. This weekly data shows a decrease in gasoline consumption of about
40% beginning in about mid-March. This decrease is well outside the historical norm, but
is consistent with the drop in travel from the Unacast data.
       We use fleet average emissions rates of SO2 , PM2.5 , NOx , and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) to map the reduction in travel into the reduction in emissions. Emission rates for
PM2.5 , NOx , and VOC are based on national average fleet characteristics and fuel properties
in 2018 and are reported in Table 4-43 in NTS (2018).9 The emissions rate for SO2 assumes
22.3 fleet average mpg and 10 ppm sulfur in gasoline, which reflects the latest gasoline sulfur
content regulations.10 The resulting emissions rates (in grams per mile) are shown in Table 1.
       Emissions of different pollutants have different effects in different locations. The AP3
model accounts for dispersion of air pollution, atmospheric chemistry, dose-response relation-
ships, and demographics of the affected populations to calculate the premature deaths from
   7
     The robust standard errors for the confidence intervals are clustered at the state level and account for
serial correlation and correlations across counties within a state.
   8
     An F-test of an equal reduction during the last week of our data is rejected at the 5% level.
   9
     We use the average of emission rates for light duty vehicles and light duty trucks.
  10
     The fleet average mpg is for U.S. light duty vehicles in 2017 (BTS 2020). Carbon emissions per mile can
be calculated from this mpg and the carbon content of gasoline.

a unit of pollution emitted in each county. Hence, the model iterates over 3,100 counties
and each pollutant in tabulating the premature deaths per unit of pollution. We summarize
these damages in Table 1 which shows the VMT-weighted mean deaths per mile across all
counties in the contiguous U.S. The table shows that NOx emissions are by far the most
harmful pollutant from the current vehicle fleet resulting in almost two expected deaths per
billion miles traveled. Conversely, the very low SO2 emission rates yield fewer deaths, per
VMT, than NOx . Combined, these four pollutants account for over three expected deaths
per billion miles traveled.11
       To calculate the reduction in expected deaths through reduced travel in a county because
of social distancing, we simply multiply the county-level reduction in miles traveled (sum-
marized in Figure 1a) by the county-specific estimates of expected deaths per billion miles
(summarized in Table 1). The reduction in expected deaths is mapped in Figure C in the
Appendix. The reductions in deaths are the greatest in California’s urban areas.


2.2       Electricity use

To estimate the health effects of reduced electricity usage, we combine estimates of the
reduction in electricity use with estimates of the marginal health effects (marginal damage)
per unit of power produced.
       The reduction in electricity usage is estimated from data from individual Independent
System Operators (ISOs) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on hourly elec-
tricity consumption, referred to as ‘system load’. System load is the aggregate of all power
  11
    Using the fleet average mpg and the carbon content of gasoline, we can also calculate the average CO2
emissions per mile.


                                                   7
taken from the grid, including residential, commercial, and residential customers, as well as
line loses. ISOs and the EIA vary in the geographic specificity of their reporting, ranging
from zones covering local municipal utilities to the entire Tennessee Valley Authority. We re-
fer to each reported unit as a Power Control Area (PCA) to simplify the distinction between
types of load zones and balancing authorities.12
       We match hourly load data to local temperature readings from the National Weather
Service’s Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), a network of automated weather
stations that are typically located at airports. These stations are matched to counties, and
multiple stations’ data are aggregated up to the PCA using population weights. To account
for behind-the-meter generation, we also include hourly reports of solar generation for PCAs
in California and New England.
       To develop an estimate of reduced electricity consumption, we pool hourly readings of
load and temperature from 2017-present. For each PCA, we regress the natural logarithm of
hourly load on a set of day of week, hour of day, and week of year dummies. These control
for the regular fluctuations in consumption that follow the clock and calendar. Hourly
temperature data allow us to control for heating and cooling with the inclusion of a measure
of prevailing temperature relative to 18 degrees Celsius (see Cicala (2020) for more details on
the data assembly and estimation). Our estimate of the reduction in electricity consumption
in a PCA is the remaining unexplained variation in electricity consumption, which is captured
by a set of dummies for each date of interest.
       Figure 1b summarizes these estimated reductions in electricity consumption by plotting
the seven-day moving average of the load-weighted average coefficients across the PCAs.13
The results show that there are not reductions in electricity usage before early March but
by mid-April reductions in electricity usage average about 6%.14
       We estimate the health effects of these reductions in electricity consumption using a two-
step procedure similar to that in Holland et al. (2020) for estimating marginal damages.
The first step is to determine hourly expected deaths from pollution from power plants.
  12
     In total there are 105 PCAs in our data.
  13
     The robust standard errors for the confidence intervals are clustered at the PCA to account for serial
correlation.
  14
     Because PCA’s can cross state boundaries, we do not break out the reduction by state stay-at-home
policy.


                                                    8
The second step is to determine the change in expected deaths from a change in electricity
consumption.
       In the first step, we use data reported from EPA’s Continuous Emissions Monitoring
System (CEMS) to measure hourly emissions of SO2 , NOx , and PM2.5 at each of the ap-
proximately 1500 fossil fuel fired power plants in the contiguous U.S.15,16 Holland et al. (2020)
report a dramatic decline in emissions in recent years, so we use emissions from 2017, which
is the most recent year in their dataset. Based on the location of each power plant, we use
the AP3 model to map emissions of each pollutant into expected deaths. We then aggregate
across pollutants and across power plants within an interconnection to calculate the hourly
expected deaths from the pollution.
       In the second step, we regress hourly expected deaths on hourly electricity load in each
interconnection: East, West, and Texas.17 More specifically, let Dt be the expected deaths
in the interconnection due to emissions of all pollutants from all power plants in an inter-
connnection in hour t. Our estimating equation is


                                        Dt = βLoadt + αmh + t ,                                       (1)


where Loadt is electricity usage in the interconnnection in hour t and αmh are month of sample
times hour fixed effects (1 year * 12 months * 24 hours fixed effects). The coefficient β is the
change in expected deaths from a change in electricity consumption in the interconnection.
Table 2 shows the estimated coefficients and standard errors for each pollutant individually
as well as in total. The East is the dirtiest interconnection with three expected deaths per
TWh of electricity consumption. The bulk of the harm in the East comes from emissions
of SO2 . Marginal electricity consumption is least harmful in the West with less than one
expected death per TWh of electricity consumption.
  15
      SO2 and NOx are directly reported, and we impute hourly PM2.5 emissions based on average emissions
rates and observed hourly generation.
   16
      CEMS also reports carbon emissions. We use a similar procedure to estimate marginal carbon emissions
from a change in electricity usage.
   17
      We aggregate deaths and load to the interconnection because electricity generally flows throughout an
interconnection and PCA loads are highly correlated. See Holland et al. (2020).

       To calculate the reduction in expected deaths through reduced electricity consumption
from social distancing, we simply multiply the estimated reduction in electricity consumption
at a PCA (summarized in Figure 1b) by the expected deaths per TWh in Table 2 for the
appropriate interconnection. The reduction in expected deaths is mapped in Figure D in
the Appendix. The reductions are the greatest in the Midwest and Southeast, but are much
smaller than from reduced travel.



3        Results
Social distancing due to the COVID-19 outbreak led to reduced personal vehicle travel and
electricity consumption which in turn lowered emissions of pollution and expected deaths.
The overall effect of these changes, aggregated to the contiguous U.S., are shown in Table 3.
Our baseline estimated number of expected deaths per month from air pollution from all
light-duty vehicle travel is 666 expected deaths. Our estimated 40 percent average reduction
in travel implies that the expected deaths is reduced by 314 deaths per month due to reduced
travel.18 The table breaks the reduction in deaths into the precursor pollutant to which they
can be attributed. Over half of the reduction in deaths are due to reduced NOx emissions
but reductions in other pollutants such as VOCs and PM2.5 also contributed substantially.
For electricity consumption, our baseline estimated number of expected deaths per month
  18
    This 47% reduction in deaths indicates that travel reductions occurred disproportionately in high damage
locations.

from air pollution from electricity consumption is 859 deaths. This is a higher baseline than
for travel, but the six percent reduction in electricity consumption implies that expected
deaths are only reduced by 49 deaths (about 15% of the reduction in deaths from travel).
The primary reduction in deaths from electricity consumption can be attributed to reduced
SO2 emissions. Combining the results for the reduction in travel and electricity usage gives
a reduction of 363 expected deaths.

   The preceding analysis focuses on the expected health benefits from local pollutants of the
reductions in personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption due to social distancing.
Additionally, these reductions imply reductions in CO2 emissions which we can calculate
using similar procedures. In particular, for travel we can use the carbon content of gasoline
and the fleet mpg together with our estimated reduction in VMT to estimate the reduction
in carbon emissions. Applying this methodology, we estimate that CO2 emissions were
reduced by 35.4 million metric tons from a month of social distancing. For electricity
consumption, we use the hourly power plant CO2 emissions from CEMS to estimate the
marginal CO2 emissions from electricity consumption. Applying these estimates to our
estimated reduction in electricity consumption in the various regions implies an aggregate
reduction in CO2 emissions from power plants of 10.5 million metric tons from a month of
social distancing. Combining the reductions in CO2 from travel and electricity consumption
implies that the month of social distancing reduced CO2 emissions by 45.9 million metric



                                                   11
tons. This is approximately 19% of the 242 million metric tons that are emitted monthly
from driving and using electricity.
    Social distancing was not evenly distributed across the country as some states and cities
implemented stay-at-home policies while others did not. In addition, behavioral changes
differed across regions, and mortality risks (as specified by the AP3 model) differ across
counties. Table 4 shows the heterogeneity in the reduction in expected deaths and CO2
emissions due to the reduction in travel for the top MSAs and states. Social distancing in
Los Angeles resulted in the largest reduction in expected deaths (77) and carbon emissions
(1.1 million metric tons). New York City had a larger percentage reduction in travel but a
smaller reduction in expected deaths (26) because of the lower number of baseline deaths per
mile traveled. Behavioral changes in other large cities also induced substantial reductions in
expected deaths and in CO2 emissions. At the state level, social distancing in California led
to the largest reduction in deaths (115) and in CO2 emissions (4 million metric tons) from
reduced travel.
    Because the PCA’s do not map cleanly into states and MSA’s, we aggregate them into
geographic areas based on Independent System Operators and NERC regions. The reduction
in expected deaths and CO2 emissions from electricity consumption in these geographic areas
are given in Table C in the Appendix. About half of the reductions in expected deaths
and CO2 emissions comes from electricity consumption reductions in the Southeast and the
Midwest (reduction of 13 and 12 deaths and 2.5 and 2.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions).
Although California had one of the larger percent reductions in electricity consumption (an
8 percent reduction), this reduction led to smaller declines in expected deaths and CO2
emissions due to cleaner electricity generation in the West.



4     Conclusion
Social distancing to control the spread of the novel coronavirus resulted in unprecedented
changes in society and in economic activity. Among these are substantial changes in vehicle
travel and in electricity usage. This paper quantifies reductions in travel and electricity
usage relative to counterfactuals using highly-resolved data. We find that, at the county

level, average vehicle travel fell by about 40% whereas electricity usage dropped by about
6% during the months of March and April, 2020.
   We then combine the estimated reductions in travel and electricity usage with air pol-
lution emissions rates and the AP3 model, which links emissions to ambient concentrations
and expected deaths. We find that the reductions in emissions from travel and electricity
usage reduced deaths by over 360 deaths per month. The bulk of this reduction is attributed
to less personal vehicle travel, and in particular reduced NOx emissions from this travel. So-
cial distancing in California accounted for about a third of the reduction in deaths with Los
Angeles alone contributing 20% of the national total. New York accounted for about 10%
of the national total. Further, we estimate that social distancing resulted in approximately
46 million metric tons less CO2 emissions per month.
   We note important caveats to our findings. First, the AP3 model uses concentration-
response functions from the epidemiological literature (Krewski et al. 2009) that assume
the incremental risk from exposure to PM2.5 is proportional to baseline mortality rates.
Because of heightened mortality risk from COVID-19, our calculated reduction in deaths
may significantly understate actual reductions in PM2.5 exposure risk. See the Appendix for
a further discussion of this issue. In addition, our econometric estimation of counterfactual
emissions and Unacast’s estimates of counterfactual mobility are uncertain. Further, we are
interpreting changes in cell phone mobility data as translating directly into changes in VMT
from light-duty vehicles, and we do not model intermodal substitution from public transit
to personal vehicle use. Finally, we cannot attribute the observed changes in travel and
electricity usage to any specific policy or set of policies but only to behavioral changes as
observed over this time frame.
   Our work provides insight into the benefits and costs of policies related to social distancing
(Thunstrom et al. 2020). Of course, the primary inputs to a benefit-cost analysis of social
distancing would include avoided coronavirus infections, estimated in the trillions of dollars
(Greenstone and Nigam 2020), and reduced economic activity. Our work augments these
central arguments with one of the potentially many important non-market outcomes such as
health, education, and the environment. Monetization facilitates inclusion of these health
benefits directly into a benefit-cost analysis of social distancing. For example, if we assume


                                              14
a value of a statistical life (VSL) of $9 million and a social cost of carbon of $50 per ton, the
national environmental benefit of social distancing is $5.5 billion per month with about 60
percent of this benefit from reduced deaths. These benefits accrue substantially from social
distancing in large metropolitan areas: about $750 million per month from Los Angeles and
about $320 million per month from New York City.
   Using observed behavioral changes, our paper demonstrates the degree to which reduced
reliance on fossil-fuel based transport and power generation yields public health benefits. In
the long run these findings are, perhaps, most interesting when interpreted in the context of
a post-COVID-19 economy in which remote working and retail delivery are more common.
In this state of the world as observed in early April 2020, power demand is only marginally
affected, whereas personal travel declines appreciably. The paper shows significant local
health benefits from this adjustment. The extent to which consumption habits revert to
their pre-COVID-19 levels remains to be seen.

Emissions from all sources

Table A shows the tonnage of emissions of relevant criteria pollutants from the two broad
source categories covered by this analysis. Electric power generation contributes about 1.1
million tons of NOx while highway vehicles (inclusive of light duty cars and heavy duty
commercial trucks) emit another 3.3 million tons. Together these discharges amount to 43%
of the national total emissions. Power generation and vehicle emissions of primary PM2.5
comprise just over 20% of total, national emissions. Releases of SO2 from these two source
categories total up to about 1.3 million tons, or about half of the national total. And, for

Weekly gasoline sales

Figure A shows the sales of gasoline by week from 2007-2019 and the beginning of 2020.
Before 2020, the sales range between 8000 and 10,000 with an average around 9000 and a

small peak in summer consumption (units are thousands of barrels per day). The first 11
weeks of 2020 are within this range, but starting with the 12th week (March 20) there is a
precipitous drop down to about 5000. Sales remain depressed at this low level for the last
three weeks of data (up to April 17).

Streetlight mobility data

In the main text, we applied the travel reduction percentages from Unacast to the EPA’s
MOVES estimates of VMT. Alternatively, Streetlight (2020) uses cell phone mobility data
to directly estimate reductions in VMT. An analogous figure to Figure 1a made using the
Streetlight data is shown in Figure B. The results from using the Streetlight data to estimate
the reduction in deaths from decreased air pollution are given in Table B. Compared to the
results in the main text, the Streetlight data gives a greater decrease in VMT and hence a
greater reduction in deaths. However, the decrease in the Streetlight VMT is larger than
we would expect from the reduction in gasoline sales documented in Figure A, and the
baseline estimate of total VMT in the Streetlight data is about 40 percent greater than
other estimates. For these reasons, we present the results from the Unacast data in the main
text.

than in Table 3 because there are more counties with missing data.

Supplementary information about reductions in expected deaths

Figures C shows the reduction in deaths from reduced travel at the county level. The spatial
distribution of the reduction in deaths depends on reduced travel from COVID-19, observed
vehicle miles traveled, population exposure per ton of emissions, and demographics of the
exposed population. Figure D shows the reduction in deaths from reduced electricity con-
sumption at the PCA level. The spatial distribution depends on the reduction in electricity
usage from COVID-19, the regional mix of fuels used to produce power, population exposure
per ton of emissions, and demographics of the exposed population. These figures also illus-
trate that data is missing for a small number of counties. Table C shows the reduction in
deaths aggregated to geographic regions based on a combination of ISO and NERC regions.

COVID-19 deaths and Total Respiratory Deaths

There are aspects of PM2.5 and COVID-19 that require an important qualification, or caveat,
to our findings. The epidemiological literature that establishes the association between PM2.5
and premature mortality repeatedly finds that risk from exposure is proportional to baseline
mortality rates (Krewski et al., 2009; Lepeule et al., 2012). Because of this, our benefit
estimates may significantly understate actual benefits. The estimated ambient pollution
reductions have occurred during a period of time when baseline risks are elevated. We
modeled the link between emissions and monetary damages with data from the most recent
year comprehensive economy-wide emissions data are available, the 2014 model year. If risk
from exposure is proportional to mortality rates in a given period, then it is quite likely that
exposure during a period when mortality rates are elevated will yield a larger relative risk.
Thus, damages will be higher in the elevated risk period.
      To gauge how large this effect might be we gathered daily COVID-19 mortality data.
Figure E shows the monthly mortality rates for COVID-19 deaths and for total respiratory
deaths from 2018 (the most recent year for which month-by-county data are available) across
all counties in the contiguous U.S. It shows that risks are clearly elevated during the COVID-
19 period (March and April, 2020).19 The population-weighted average COVID-19 fatality
rate in April of 2020 is approximately three-times larger than the respiratory cause mortality
rate, in April of 2018. However, severe COVID-19 outbreaks are highly concentrated in a few
counties. Figure F depicts these cases. The intent is to convey how much baseline mortality
rates have changed due to COVID-19, and what that adjustment might mean for concurrent
benefits from PM2.5 reductions. The top-left panel shows the COVID-19 (April, 2020) and
respiratory (April, 2018) rates for New York City. The difference in baseline risk is clear
and extreme. Therefore, reductions in ambient PM2.5 may be severely underestimated in
this area. Detroit (top right) shows a more modest (though still five fold) difference. These
comparisons in Los Angeles and San Francisco reveal much smaller differences.
