                                             ABSTRACT

Quantity-based regulation with banking allows regulated firms to shift obligations across time in response
to periods of unexpectedly high or low marginal costs. Despite its wide prevalence in existing and
proposed emission trading programs, banking has received limited attention in past welfare analyses
of policy choice under uncertainty. We address this gap with a model of banking behavior that captures
two key constraints: uncertainty about the future from the firm’s perspective and a limit on negative
bank values (e.g., borrowing). We show conditions where banking provisions reduce price volatility
and lower expected costs compared to quantity policies without banking. For plausible parameter
values related to U.S. climate change policy, we find that bankable quantities produce behavior quite
similar to price policies for about two decades and, during this period, improve welfare by about a
$1 billion per year over fixed quantities.

1. Introduction

         Under the presence of uncertainty, welfare comparisons of regulatory instruments have

typically focused on price versus temporally fixed quantity instruments. Yet a common trend is

for policies to allow regulated quantities to be banked–that is, tradable permits can either be

saved for future use or possibly borrowed from future periods. This is true for the majority of

existing and proposed tradable permit markets.1 While the early motivation for banking

provisions was to allow firms to smooth the transition to more stringent future limits through

early reductions, more recent debates in the 110th Congress focused on accommodating

uncertainty and the risk of unexpectedly high costs. Many argued that an expanded banking and

borrowing system to regulate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could alleviate concerns about

uncertain costs in a manner similar to a price mechanism.2

         But can banking and borrowing provisions really accommodate cost shocks in a way that

resembles a price mechanism? To answer this question, we develop a model of optimal firm

behavior with a quantitative, periodic emission limit over an arbitrarily long horizon, the

flexibility to bank (and possibly borrow within limits) allowances, and cost uncertainty that is

2 See Murray et al (2009). The reality of the policy debate in the U.S. is evidenced by the evolution of legislative
proposals. The first time cap-and-trade legislation was seriously proposed in 2003, it included a simple banking
provision comparable to the sulfur dioxide trading program. By the time legislation passed the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2009, it included borrowing provisions, a price floor, and a quantity-limited price ceiling.

potentially correlated over time and never completely resolved. We show banking allows shocks

to be spread over time as long as the banking constraint is not expected to bind. When the

constraint is expected to bind, banking offers little practical flexibility. This highlights an

important connection between banking with and without uncertainty: it is the banking behavior

driven by deterministic features – what we could call deterministic banking – that creates the

window for uncertain shocks to be spread efficiently over time.

       In order to quantify these effects and compare welfare outcomes with ordinary price and

quantity controls, we must numerically solve for optimal firm banking behavior. For plausible

parameters related to U.S. climate change policy, we find bankable quantity regulation improves

welfare over a non-bankable system, but does not achieve welfare improvements over a price

policy, which represents an upper bound given exceedingly flat marginal benefits. In the early

years of the policy, when the banking constraint is not expected to bind for more than two

decades, bankable quantities behave like prices in terms of emissions and welfare but gradually

transition to behave like non-bankable quantity policies. The welfare improvement over non-

bankable quantity policies averages about a billion dollars per year – more than 80 percent of the

welfare improvement from prices – during the first twenty years but with little improvement

thereafter. While tighter banking constraints and higher discount rates reduce the ability to

match the welfare associated with prices, looser banking constraints and lower correlation of cost

shocks increase it.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature, highlighting

the gap between discussions of welfare differences among policies and banking behavior with

relevant constraints and information assumptions. Section 3 introduces the banking problem and



                                                      3
discusses the solution. Section 4 outlines the benefit model and provides intuition about welfare

effects. Section 5 presents the numerical analysis, and Section 6 concludes.

2. Background and Existing Literature

         This paper draws from two important strands of the economics literature, one looking at

the welfare differences among policy choices that differ under uncertainty about costs but are

otherwise equivalent, and one looking at behavior (and sometimes welfare) associated with the

ability to bank allowances in a more limited uncertainty environment.3 The first strand has

developed a well-known distinction between price versus non-bankable quantity policies

(Weitzman, 1974):the net welfare effect of prices over quantities hinges on the relative slopes of

marginal costs and benefits.4

         Papers on banking first emerged after the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments created the

SO2 trading program with an unlimited banking provision. These studies ignored uncertainty

and focused on how banking shifts emissions to the future to equalize otherwise unequal (and

higher) discounted marginal costs in the future, lowering total discounted costs (e.g. Cronshaw

and Kruse (1996), Rubin (1996), Kling and Rubin (1997), and Leiby and Rubin (2001)).

Analysis of banking with uncertainty followed but has been relatively limited. A number of

authors suggested that banking can reduce permit price volatility in the face of uncertain cost

shocks (e.g. Godby et al (1997), Jacoby and Ellerman (2004), and Ellerman (2005)). Yates and

Cronshaw (2001), Yates (2002), and Feng and Zhao (2006) investigate when banking and


3 Uncertainty in both damage and abatement costs has also been considered. In particular, Stavins (1996)
investigated correlated uncertainty between damage and abatement costs and found that in many cases quantity
regulation was desirable. However, as our motivating application is global climate change, where the dominant
sources of uncertainty are uncorrelated and marginal benefits exceeding flat, we do not focus on this aspect of the
problem.
4These results were later extended by Hoel and Karp (2001, 2002) and Newell and Pizer (2003) to consider stock
externalities (pollutants).
                                                               4
borrowing improve welfare, with results that support Weitzman’s original intuition about the

importance of the relative slopes of marginal costs and benefits. However, their models have

quite stylized features – two time periods and no borrowing constraints –that make it difficult to

assess real-world programs.

       Schennach (2000) is the first (and perhaps only) author to build a theoretical model with

banking, banking constraints, multiple (even infinite) periods, and uncertainty, in order to study

the U.S. SO2market. She focuses on qualitatively understanding the optimal price and emissions

paths (but not welfare) with and without cost uncertainty when emission targets feature a step-

wise decline. Our analytical discussion of banking behavior draws heavily from her work.

       A study by Williams (2002) mirrors the welfare-focused spirit of our paper. Williams

analyzes regulation under prices, quantities and tradable quantities and extends this framework to

include banking and borrowing. An important contribution is his intuition that banking and

borrowing effectively flatten marginal costs compared to earlier analyses that ignored banking

and borrowing (Hoel & Karp, 2002; Newell & Pizer, 2003), consistent with our own results.

However, while he goes on to draw a stronger conclusion that banking does not affect the

expected benefits from stock pollutants, we relax a number of his assumptions (e.g., no

constraints on negative banking) and are more equivocal, a point we return to below.

       Currently, there exists no welfare analysis of bankable quantities capturing both

uncertainty about the future from the firms’ perspective as well as the regulators’ and constraints

on banking (e.g., that borrowing is constrained in some way, to zero or to a small, limited

amount). Our contribution, therefore, is to provide a more realistic model of banking behavior

under uncertainty that lends itself to quantitative analysis, to develop a welfare framework for

comparing that policy to fixed quantity and price policies, and to then use these tools to look at

                                                     5
the choice among these policies for the particular problem of controlling greenhouse gas

emission to address climate change.

3. The Banking Problem

        We begin by looking at how otherwise equivalent policies – prices, quantities, and

quantity controls that allow banking – lead to different optimal emission and marginal cost

behavior when uncertainty arises. Ordinary price and quantity controls pose a relatively simple

behavioral problem for the firm to solve and the regulator to understand. Consider the quadratic

cost function in Newell and Pizer (2003), hereafter NP (in turn, a multi-period extension of

Weitzman (1974)):

                                        ,                                                                       (1)
                                                                  2

The variable qt is the chosen emission level,          is the average, cost-minimizing level of emissions

in the absence of regulation (i.e., the expected baseline or “uncontrolled” emissions level), ct > 0

describes the slope of marginal costs, and θt is a current-period shock to marginal costs observed

by firms (but not by the regulator). Potential changes in ct and qt allow for cost reductions and

growth in uncontrolled emissions over time. We view (1) as an aggregate, representative firm’s

cost function arising from a competitive within-period emissions trading market (Rubin, 1996).5

        How do various policies differ in their emission and marginal cost outcomes? First

consider non-banking regulation. In the case of quantity controls,               , the regulated firm actually




5 As shown in Rubin (1996) in a model without uncertainty, the decentralized firm behavior in a cap-and-trade
program with banking leads to the same emission path as that of a cost-minimizing social planner. Under the
assumption that all regulated firms have the same expectations about future shocks, we can therefore use a
representative firm framework to describe aggregate behavior.

faces no choice: it simply emits the regulated volume of emissions, setting                           .6 Marginal

costs are given by

                                 ,
                                                                                                                   (2)


Note that as we regulate to reduce emissions,                      , so marginal costs of emissions are

negative – which makes sense because emissions, qt, are a negative externality. In the case of

price controls (e.g., taxes),        , the firm will want to reduce emissions until marginal abatement

costs (       /     ) equal the regulated price each period, solving                                         for qt.

Assuming the price policy is set to match the quantity policy in expectation, we can write the

emission outcome under a price policy as:


                                      ,                                                                            (3)

          The opportunity to bank (and borrow) emission allowances poses a trickier challenge for

deriving optimal firm behavior. To be specific, the regulator gives the firm a pre-specified

emission allocation each period, which we label yt. The firm also starts each period with a bank

Bt of unused allowances from the end of the previous period. The firm is free to use the sum of

these allowances yt + Bt to cover emissions qt this period, but any leftover allowances can, in

turn, be saved for use in future periods. That is,

                                                                                                                       (4)

becomes the starting point for next period’s emission decision.7 It may even be possible to leave

a negative bank for the next period; generally, the firm is told that the start-of-period t+1 bank,


6 To be precise, the regulated firm can choose any        .Firms will choose           so long as costshocks are
small compared to expected marginal costs, which is true in our eventual parameterization. We adopt thegeneral
assumption that          , consistent with Weitzman and NP, as it does not materially affect our results and simplifies
exposition by allowingE            .
                                                               7
Bt+1, must be equal to or greater than             , which is a constraint limiting the minimum level of

banking (borrowing). Here,               is typically zero but could be negative when a regulation allows

limited borrowing. The firm now has the flexibility of choosing emissions qt anywhere between

0 and yt + Bt –         . Finally, the firm needs to make an assumption about the evolution of cost

shocks θt. For simplicity, we assume a simple autoregressive model.

         We can summarize the firm’s optimization problem under a bankable quantity policy as

an effort to minimize discounted expected costs each period,

                                                                                                    0

where β = 1/(1+r) is the discount factor and Et[ ] is the expected value given all the information

known at time t. As noted, θt follows a stationary autoregressive process, with                         ~   0,     and

|ρ| ≤ 1.8 Given the ability to pick qt each period based on new information at time t, it makes

sense to rewrite this problem (5) in the form of a Bellman equation,

                                                                         0                                                (6)
                                         subject to




7 A more general banking relationship would allow for non-unitary and even non-uniform trading ratio between
periods, so Bt + 1 = Rt(Bt + yt – qt) and Rt( ) is some monotonically increasing function. Assuming Rt(x) = x, as we do
and consistent with actual emission trading programs, implies that whenever banking occurs, prices rise at the
interest rate.
8 The cost shock variance at time t, var(θt) is therefore given by var                    1       / 1        , assuming
that θt <0 = 0.
                                                                  8
The value function Vt(Bt,t) is defined recursively as the minimized expected net present value of

costs, conditional on the current bank Bt and baseline cost shock t, and assuming similarly

optimal behavior in every future period. The solution to this problem (6), an optimal decision

rule          ,    and            ,    , requires a numerical approach, to which we return in Section 5.

However, as shown in the appendix, the necessary first-order conditions for the problem (6) are

given by:

                                                                                                                (7)

                                                                                                                (8)

where πt, μt, and γt, all ≥ 0, are the Lagrange multipliers on the allowance constraint (4), non-

negative emissions constraint, and the minimum bank constraint, respectively.9 While not

revealing the exact solution path, these first-order conditions provide useful intuition about

optimal banking behavior under uncertainty, particularly how banking can smooth out cost

shocks and, as we will see in Section 4, affect welfare.

           First note that, from Equation (7), πt is the shadow price of allowances and equals the

marginal abatement cost, so long as emissions are strictly positive and μt = 0.10 The Euler

equation (8) displays the traditional Hotelling rule that expected allowance prices rise at discount

rate r = (1/β) – 1 each period when the minimum bank constraint is not binding, e.g., when γt =

0.11 That is, firms will try to minimize costs across periods t and t+1 by shifting emissions to

equalize discounted marginal costs. If they reach Bt+1                      and discounted expected future



9Note that we associate the Lagrange multiplier γt with the constraint Bt+1      . We chose this specification
because the bank at the start of next period, Bt 1, is fully defined by the current state and the current emission
decision in period t, making the Lagrange multiplier on the minimum bank constraint for next period a
current period variable.
10   Compare to Equation (9) in Rubin (1996), where his et and Λt are comparable to our qt and πt.
11   Compare to Rubin (1996) Equation (22) or Schennach (2000) Equation (1).
                                                                9
marginal costs are still lower than current marginal costs, they would prefer to bank even less

than      for next period, but cannot. In that case, γt > 0 in order to balance Equation (8).

       The preceding results have been described by Rubin (1996) and others for the case

without uncertainty. In particular, they distinguish those time intervals where the minimum bank

constraint is not binding and discounted allowance prices are equalized over the interval, versus

those time intervals where the minimum bank constraint is binding and discounted allowance

prices are falling. Schennach (2000) looks at this problem with uncertainty and describes a third

type of interval that literally connects the other two. That is, uncertainty implies transition

periods where it is unknown today whether the constraint is binding or not. Uncertainty tends to

smear the exact point envisioned by Rubin where minimum bank constraint begins to bind and γt

changes from zero to positive. For example, the constraint might bind early if costs are

unexpectedly high, or late if costs are unexpectedly low.

       These different types of banking intervals turn out to be important for our intuition about

emissions, prices, and ultimately welfare outcomes, under different policies. In particular, we can

look at how prices respond to shocks θt during different banking intervals and contrast it with

behavior under price and non-bankable quantity policies. Consider, for example, a perturbation

δθt to a realized θt, and how the perturbation affects prices under different policies. Under a price

policy, prices are fixed and there is no price change. Under a non-bankable quantity policy

  , we can work out the perturbation in price based on (2) and the assumption that price is the

negative marginal cost of emissions: namely, δpt                = –δθt .

       With banking, if we begin in a period where the minimum bank constraint is not binding,

and we assume we know with certainty that the bank is constrained by Bt+s+1                beginning

s periods in the future, but not before, we show in the appendix that
                                                     10

Here, δπt is the change in allowance price arising from δθt, ρ is the correlation among cost

shocks, ct is the slope of marginal costs in period t, and β is the discount factor. With no

correlation, no discounting, and constant ct this simplifies to:12

                                                                                                     (10)
                                                              1

In other words, the price increase δθt is spread over however many periods the bank is

unconstrained. That is, optimal behavior considers this period of unconstrained banking to be a

single pool of emission reduction effort, with any required increase or decrease in effort spread

evenly throughout the pool. If the unconstrained interval is quite long (e.g., s approaches

infinity, as in Newell, Pizer, and Zhang (2005)), the price increase is spread so thinly so as to be

imperceptible and behavior will be very similar to a price policy.

           On the other hand, with perfect auto-correlation and no discounting (9) simplifies to ∂πt =

–∂θt. In this case, there is no reason to spread the cost shock because we now expect future cost

shocks to be the same as today; behavior will be very similar to a non-bankable quantity policy.

This behavioral difference between high and low correlation cost shocks is analogous to the

difference between of high and low correlation income shocks for the resulting effect on

consumption (Friedman, 1957).

           Even without autocorrelation, if s is zero and we are instead in an interval where banking

is constrained, there is little flexibility to spread the price increase δθt and behavior will be very

similar to a non-bankable quantity policy. It will not be exactly the same because it is always


12   This is implied by equation (13) in Schennach (2000) though it is not discussed.
                                                                  11
possible that a particularly favorable shock will spontaneously create a brief period of banking (a

point ignored in (9-10) by the simplifying assumption that s is known and fixed). That is, a

favorable cost shock creates a bounty of unexpected cost savings that can be used today or

spread over several periods. When discounted marginal costs are lower in the future, as occurs

when banking is constrained, the discounted cost savings from spreading this bounty to the

future will generally be less than using it all today. However, if the bounty is large and today’s

marginal cost is otherwise depressed by a favorable cost shock below the discounted value of

future marginal costs, it will make sense to bank some of it for the future.

        This leads us to the following summary of banking behavior under uncertainty:

        When deterministic trends in baseline emissions, allowance allocation, and costs lead to

a period of certain banking activity unrelated to cost shocks and where we do not expect the

minimum bank constraint to bind, bankable quantities under uncertainty lead to behavior that is

similar to price regulation so long as the end of this period is sufficiently far in the future.

During periods when we do expect the minimum bank constraint is expected to bind, bankable

quantities lead to behavior that is similar to non-bankable quantity regulation. As we approach

the end of a period of unconstrained banking, outcomes under bankable quantity policies will

transition from price-like to non-bankable-quantity-like behavior.

        Much of this discussion and the expression (9) assume firms always know the exact

future moment t+s+1 when the minimum bank constraint becomes binding, ignoring the

uncertain transition interval created by cost uncertainty. This creates ambiguity about exactly

what is meant by “the end of a period of unconstrained banking” and makes it impossible to

derive analytically exactly how prices,πt, respond to cost shocks. While we expect the

aforementioned intuition will continue to hold, we must ultimately turn to numerical analyses to

                                                      12
quantify the results, which we do after rounding out our model of costs and firm behavior with a

model of pollution impacts, mitigation benefits, and welfare.

4. Welfare

       So far we have focused on mitigation costs and how different price, quantity, and

bankable quantity policies lead to different emission and marginal cost outcomes in the face of

uncertain cost shocks. To understand the welfare consequences of these outcomes, we need to

add a model of mitigation benefits and evaluate the expected net benefits across alternative

policies. We continue to use the basic framework in NP to do this.

       First, we allow for emissions to accumulate in the environment

                                          S t  (1   ) S t 1  qt                                  (11)

where St is the accumulated stock of emissions at time t, which accumulates with decay rate .

The decay rate can take on values representing cases ranging from a “pure stock externality” that

persists forever ( = 0) to a “flow externality” ( = 1) that replicates the traditionally analyzed

case. “Benefits” associated with the stock of emissions are then given by

                                                         bt
                                         Bt ( St )        ( S  S t )2                              (12)
                                                         2 t

where S t represents a benefit maximizing level of the stock (possibly zero, possibly a

background level) and bt ≥ 0. The latter assumption implies that pollution in excess of       faces

increasing marginal damages (e.g., increasingly negative marginal benefits).

       The above relations (11-12) and results from the previous section are sufficient to solve

the firm’s cost-minimization problem numerically, simulate outcomes under uncertainty, and

compute expected net benefits under bankable quantities and alternate policies. However, we

can also use the model to derive more refined expressions for comparing welfare that provide

                                                            13
intuition for our results. In the spirit of Weitzman (1974) and NP, we can derive the welfare

difference Δt between alternate policies and a benchmark of non-bankable quantity controls in a

given period t. That is, we can derive an expression for

                                      Δ = E0[NBt,policy x] – E[NBt,quantity],                                        (13)

where E[NBt,policy x] is the expected net benefits under policy x – price controls or a system of

bankable permits in our case – in period t, and E[NBt,quantity] is the expected net benefits of a

(non-bankable) quantity policy in period t. Here, the quantity control is set at the same emission

level as the expected emissions under policy x.13

         As we show in the appendix, we can use our model of costs and benefits to write

                                                          var               var
                               Δ                  1                                                                  (14)
                                       2                                       ⁄

where var(pt) and var(St) are the variance in allowance prices and the accumulated emission

stock, respectively, under policy x. To understand this expression, first note that aside from the

time subscripts and factors multiplying ct and bt, Equation (14) appears remarkably similar to

Weitzman’s (1974) expression comparing welfare under alternate price and quantity controls in a

simpler one-period model,


                                                  Δ                                                                  (15)
                                                          2

The intuition in his simpler model and policy scenarios is straightforward: prices offer a cost

savings over quantities, given by 1/2                 ⁄         , by trading off high marginal cost emissions

for low marginal cost emissions in different states of the world. This goes along with a loss in



13Note  that in a comparison of bankable to non-bankable quantity policies, fixing non-bankable quantities at the
expected emission level E0[qt] will not be the same as fixing them at the allocation level yt. Fixing emissions at the
allocation level would conflate advantages of banking unrelated to uncertainty.
                                                                  14
expected benefits associated with prices,      1/2    ⁄      , stemming from the induced variance

in quantities coupled with concave benefits.

       Second, our more general model reduces to Weitzman’s result when policy x represents

price regulation and we consider a flow pollutant where St = qt. In this case by construction

var(pt) = 0 and, from (3) and the assumption that St = qt, we have var(St) = var(qt) and var(qt) =

  ⁄ . That is, the Weitzman price-versus-quantity welfare comparison is a special case of (14).

       More generally, these factors multiplying ct and bt in Equation (14) provide intuition

about how expected costs and benefits change based on a more general set of policies. The first

factor shows that cost savings relative to a non-bankable quantity policy has everything to do

with reducing price (or marginal cost) variance under a given emission response function. Price

variance represents missed opportunities to trade off high price emission reductions for low price

emission reductions while maintaining the same expected emission level. Under a quantity

policy, var(pt) =   based on (2) and there is no cost savings by construction. Under a price

policy, var(pt) = 0 and cost savings is maximized. Other reasonable policies will generally fall

somewhere in between.

       The second factor shows that benefit losses relative to a non-bankable quantity policy are

related to variance in the accumulated pollution stock, which is in turn driven by variance in

emissions. Under a quantity policy, var(St) = var(qt) = 0 and there is no benefit loss by

construction. Under a price policy, var(qt) =    /   based on (3). However, except in the case of

a flow pollutant, where var(St) = var(qt), translating this emission variation into accumulated

stock variation is non-trivial. Calculating var(St) is even more problematic under bankable

quantities, where emissions are path-, as well as shock-, dependent and must be numerically

derived. While we know there is a benefit loss from policies that introduce emissions

                                                     15
uncertainty compared to a regulation that fixes the emission path, ultimately a numerical analysis

is required to quantify this loss.

           We note these results generally are consistent with Williams (2002), who concludes that

banking and borrowing effectively reduce the slope of marginal costs when comparing prices

and quantities and offer welfare improvements over non-bankable quantity controls for stock

pollutants. His interpretation of flatter marginal costs when comparing prices to bankable rather

than non-bankable quantities is consistent with our factor (<1) multiplying ct term in (14).14

Going further, certain assumptions in his analysis eliminate (or minimize) the loss of expected

benefits under bankable versus non-bankable quantities for a stock pollutant. In our approach,

we relax his assumptions (e.g., no banking constraint, a fixed banking horizon, no correlation of

shocks, full knowledge of all shocks in all periods) and leave to a numerical analysis a

determination about the magnitude of expected benefit loss, a task to which we now turn.

5. Numerical Analysis

           To parameterize the problem, we consider sets of values related to an emissions control

policy implemented in the U.S. This allows us to answer the question of whether banking

significantly reduce price volatility, and consequently expected costs, in an immediately relevant

context.15 Table 1 presents our benchmark parameter values, where cost-related parameters are

based largely on recent estimates of U.S. compliance costs with H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey)

given in (EPA, 2009) and benefit-related parameters derive from NP. Additional detail on the

rationale and data sources can be found in the appendix.


                                                              price    bankable
14 The ct term in a price-to-bankable-quantity comparison, Δ           Δ        , would be (var(pt)/σ2)ct, where var(pt)
   2
<σ would be measured for bankable quantitites. In that sense, the effective marginal cost slope, e.g., the entire ct
term including the pre-multiplying factor, is flatter for the price-to-bankable-quantity comparison versus the
effective marginal cost slope in a price-to-non-bankable quantity comparison (ct).
15   For reference, we also compare our results to those in NP who consider a global policy in footnote 20.
                                                                16
           The numerical approach is relatively straightforward: we take a finite-horizon

approximation to (5), discretize the state space in (6), and solve backwards from a final period

for the value function Vt(Bt, θt) and optimal decision rule qt(Bt, θt) or Bt+1(Bt, θt) each period.16

For this application, we allow both the shock state variable θt and the bank state variable Bt to

take on 201 discrete values. Thus, a 201 201 grid can fully describe the range of possible states

at any given period. Given the discretized shocks and the assumed autoregressive process for the

shocks, we can also derive a transition probability matrix, P, that describes the probability of

moving from any of the 201 θt values to each θt+1 value. We consider a terminal period at T = 51,

allowing us to consider behavior through 2050 without endpoint effects.17

           With a chosen horizon T, we can easily find the optimal rule for qT(BT, θT) and value

function VT(BT, θT) in the final period T, for all possible 201×201 states. We assume the terminal

conditions that BT+1≥ 0, which implies that the representative firm must settle all outstanding

allowance debts by the end of the finite horizon, and that VT+1(BT+1, θT+1) = 0. For a given bank

BT at the beginning of period T, the problem in period T then simplifies to a fixed quantity

problem with an allocation of BT + yT that the firm can either use in period T or discard. Solving

this problem yields the function VT(BT,θT); we can then recursively solve the problem of finding

the optimal q(Bt,θt) and V(Bt,θt)functions going from period T – 1back to 0 using (6).

           The end result of this backward recursion process gives us T, 201×201 matrices of

optimal qt values for each possible (Bt, θt)state in each time period (i.e., the optimal policy rules).

Given the optimal qt matrices and starting bank B0 (=0), we can then run simulations given a set

of generated θ values. Each iteration provides a different realization of the shock series θ1,…,θT,


16 Discretizing the bank state variable implicitly discretizes the control variable, or vice versa, given the bank
transition equation (4).
17   None of our results through 2050 change when instead use T = 101 or when we switch to a gridsize of 301 × 301.
                                                                17
which we use to simulate the emission level qt(from our optimal q matrices), bank Bt+1 (based on

(4)), and accumulated stock St (based on (11)), period by period. Assuming emission allowance

prices equal marginal abatement costs (i.e., a competitive allowance market), prices are

calculated using equation (2) evaluated at the chosen emission level qt with banking.

         We use this procedure to forward simulate banking behavior over 10,000 random

realizations of the cost shocks. This yields a distribution of 10,000 emission levels, bank levels,

prices, and pollution stocks in each period, which we can use to compute var(St) and var(pt). We

then use these measures to calculate welfare differences for banking compared to non-bankable

quantities given in (14).18Welfare differences Δt for multiple years t are then discounted and

added together to calculate expected welfare differences over various horizons.

         The results are summarized in Table 2.19From earlier work by NP and others, we know

that marginal benefits are exceedingly flat for greenhouse gas emissions, so prices are close to

the first-best optimum. We therefore start with prices versus non-bankable quantities in column

2 as a benchmark. That column closely replicates NP and reminds us the prices are

unambiguously better than non-bankable quantities.20The third column provides our central

estimates for the welfare gains from banking versus non-bankable quantities, which range from

under a billion dollars for one year to over $15 billion for 20years. Column 4 expresses this gain



18A similar procedure can be used to simulate the welfare advantage of price policies compared to non-bankable
quantities, replacing the recursively solved function qt(Bt, θt) with equation (3) in the simulation procedure.
19 These welfare comparisons are based on price and non-bankable quantity policies determined by the expected
price and emission paths associated with the bankable quantity policy. In this way, the comparison is among
policies with the same expected outcomes.
20 NP report welfare gains for prices versus fixed quantities of 0.52, 4.6, 11, 21, and 35 billion dollars, respectively,
over the 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 year horizons. While our estimates for prices versus fixed quantities are quite similar,
they reflect cost shocks that are roughly one-third smaller and a marginal cost slope that is roughly ten times larger –
differences that cancel out in Equation (1). These differences reflect not only global versus U.S. cost functions but
also different data sources. For both marginal cost slopes and cost shock magnitudes, we use EPA (2009) while NP
use Weyant and Hill (1999).
                                                               18
as a share of the (essentially first-best) welfare gain from prices, and we see that bankable

quantities in the U.S. achieve almost all of those welfare gains in the early periods of the

regulation. However, the relative advantage of bankable quantities stops growing after 20 years

and prices begin to look much better. Why?

       As described above, when deterministic trends in baseline emissions, allocation, and

costs create a long period of certain banking activity, bankable quantity policies lead to behavior

much like a price policy when the banking constraint remains far in the future; e.g., based on

(10) and a large horizon s, cost shocks δθt do not translate into significant price changes δπt .

However, as time passes the expected horizon to the banking constraints falls; in cases with more

adverse shocks it falls more quickly and in cases with more favorable shocks it falls more

slowly. With a small s in (10), costs shocks translate more directly into price changes and a

bankable-quantity policy looks more like a non-bankable quantity policy.

       To better understand the relationship between the banking constraint and welfare, it is

useful to look at the path of relevant variables over time. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show how the

banking constraints become binding over time. Figure 1 shows the banking path (both the

median value and 95 percent simulation intervals) while Figure 2 shows the probability that the

banking constraint is binding. Both reflect a large amount of certain banking through 2030

driven by the deterministic trends in baseline emissions, allocations, and costs, which would

arise even without uncertainty. By 2030, both figures indicate that the banking constraint begins

to bind with an observable probability even though it still does not bind with certainty by the end

of our reporting horizon in 2050. This wide range of possible endpoints for the initial banking

period sharply contrasts with the Williams (2002) assumption that the endpoint is known with



                                                      19
certainty and is qualitatively different from Schennach (2000), where the transition interval is

relatively short.

        Of particular interest to us, the effectiveness of banking as a cost control (and welfare

improving) mechanism begins to diminish long before the initial probability of a banking

constraint arises in 2030. As the horizon to 2030 becomes too short to adequately smooth out

shocks based on (9), particularly given the high autocorrelation in the benchmark scenario (ρ =

0.8), price variance increases. This can be seen clearly in Figure 3, showing the path of

allowances prices (both the mean and 95 percent simulation intervals). Allowance price

volatility under bankable quantities starts very small but increases steadily through 2035, by

which point it matches the variability under non-bankable quantities. Thus, expected gains from

a bankable quantity policy relative to a non-bankable quantity policy diminish as we look over

longer horizons because in later periods the bankable quantity policy begins to resemble the non-

bankable quantity policy. This explains the results from Table 2, where most welfare gains arise

in the first 10 years and none arise after 20 years.

        Sensitivity analysis in Table 3 confirms this intuition and provides additional insight into

what happens under a banking policy. The first row repeats the 20-year results from Table 2,

labeled “benchmark,” followed by simulation results with the noted parameter changes. All

other parameters are otherwise the same as the benchmark. The second row of the table, labeled

“double shocks”, shows that doubling the standard deviation of cost shocks roughly quadruples

the welfare gain of both prices and banking over non-bankable quantities (as we would expect

from (14)) with little relative change between prices and banking. For the “high discount rate”

case, where the discount rate is increased to 7%, there is a significant drop in the welfare

advantage of both prices and banking, as the net present value of the same Δ each period

                                                       20
declines. However, the banking advantage over non-bankable quantities declines more

(indicated by the lower ratio of banking gain / price gain). Higher discount rates reduce

deterministic banking because the future is valued less. This means that the horizon for

unconstrained banking shrinks, and, consequently, the flexibility and ultimate welfare advantage

gained through a bankable versus non-bankable quantity policy diminishes.

         In the “flat allocation path” scenario we completely eliminate deterministic banking by

setting it = 2.84 billion tons for all t (which has the same cumulative allocation and emissions as

the benchmark; compare to the benchmark initial allocations of 6 billion tons declining by -3.4

percent, given in Table 1). With such a low initial allocation, there is no banking absent

uncertainty; prices start at over $35 per ton and then rise at less than 1 percent per year.21 The

firm would desperately prefer to do less abatement now and more in the future, but cannot do so

because of the borrowing constraint. Even with uncertainty, there is little banking. Favorable

shocks have to drive down prices by more than 20 percent in order to encourage spontaneous

banking, which is unlikely because the shocks’ standard deviation is barely 10 percent of the

initial price.22 Correspondingly, the bankable-quantity policy offers little benefit over a fixed-

quantity policy.

         While the high discount rate and flat allocation cases show why banking performance

might decline, the last two highlight why it might improve. In the case where we relax the


21 Initial abatement is 3.16 billion tons and the initial price is $36 per ton. Prices then grow at the growth rate of
abatement. Given abatement equals qt − yt, yt is constant, and qt grows at 0.35 percent, the growth rate of
abatement is 0.35 percent divided by abatement, which begins at slightly more the 50 percent and grows. Hence
prices start growing at 0.70 percent and decline over time to 0.35 percent.
22 A favorable shock that drove down current prices by 20 percent would also drive down expected prices next
period by 16 percent, based on the correlation of 0.8. The improved expected return to banking of 20 – 16 = 4
percent, on top of the original expected return of about 1 percent, would just match the discount rate. More
favorable shocks would offer a return to banking in excess of the discount rate, and therefore banking would occur.
This would improve welfare compared to fixed quantities, but only in these limited states where large favorable
shocks occur.
                                                                21
borrowing constraint to       = -4yt+1 , four times the annual allowance allocation, the probability

of a binding borrowing constraint decreases and the bankable-quantity policy mimics the price

policy for a much longer period of time. The advantage of a bankable-quantity policy under this

relaxed borrowing constraint therefore increases relative to the benchmark almost matching the

price policy and similar to the results discussed in Newell, Pfizer, and Zhang (2005). In the last

row, we consider a no correlation case (ρ = 0) and see that bankable quantities now nearly match

prices. Absent correlation, it is considerably easier to accommodate shocks with banking because

shocks are unlikely to build on one another. This was pointed out analytically in equation (9)

where lower correlation reduces deviations in prices for a given cost shock and time horizon.

       Summarizing, our results and sensitivity analysis support the intuition provided at the end

of Section 3: banking (and borrowing) provides the flexibility to spread cost shocks over time,

to emit less and save allowances when costs are low, consequently emitting more and using

banked allowance when costs are high. However, the value of this flexibility depends on the

horizon over which banking is already occurring unrelated to uncertainty, and shifting emissions

over time is costless. Such banking arises due to expected trends in baseline emissions,

allocations, and costs – what we call deterministic banking. Without deterministic banking,

when the banking constraint is binding, it is impossible to borrow allowances in the face of an

adverse shock and, even with a favorable shock, the amount of cost savings today typically does

not make it prudent to save allowances for the future (unless the shock is particularly large).

Higher discounting and lower initial allocations all bring forward the likely time when

deterministic banking will end and the banking constraint will bind, lowering the benefits of

banking relative to fixed quantities. Looser borrowing constraints clearly delay the onset of the



                                                     22
banking constraint, while lower correlation makes it easier to accommodate shocks for a given

banking horizon.

6. Conclusion

          Welfare comparisons between otherwise equivalent price and quantity instruments have

long emphasized a basic difference. Price instruments accommodate cost shocks and maintain

fixed prices; quantity instruments provide no such accommodation and maintain fixed quantities.

Yet most real quantity-based policies provide flexibility not accounted for in this dichotomy,

namely the ability to bank (and sometimes borrow) against a multi-period quantitative constraint.

For example, the ability to over-comply with a tradable permit system and bank unused

allowances for future use is a central part of most observed emission trading systems.

Intuitively, this banking flexibility should lead otherwise fixed quantities to behave more like

prices.

          While many papers have looked at banking behavior as a way to smooth deterministic

costs over time, few have looked at banking behavior as a way to smooth uncertain costs. Those

papers that have looked at banking under uncertainty did not focus on welfare, did not consider

uncertainty about the future from the vantage point of the firm, and/or did not consider the

typical banking constraint (that borrowing is limited). These features are important if we are

interested in a normative analysis of realistic policies over a horizon where firms as well as

regulators have incomplete information.

          Our results confirm the intuition that optimizing firms would use banking to spread cost

shocks over time, lowering costs compared to fixed quantities. However, this tendency is limited

to periods where deterministic banking arises and by the horizon before which the banking

constraint is likely to bind. Once the banking constraint is binding, adverse shocks cannot be

                                                     23
accommodated and even favorable shocks are unlikely to lead firms to save allowances unless

the shock is sufficient to reduce today’s marginal cost below expected future discounted

marginal costs (which are typically much lower than today’s marginal costs when banking is

constrained). Based on the exceedingly flat marginal benefits associated with climate change

policies, we know that price policies represent a limit on how much costs can be lowered from

this kind of emission shifting, and the question remains: how much can banking match the

performance of price policies?

       Parameterizing our model based on recent U.S. cap-and-trade proposals, we find banking

improves welfare by about $1 billion per year compared to fixed quantities over a 20-year

horizon, but subsequently banking constraints imply no further gains. In relative terms, banking

achieves over 95 percent of the price advantage over the initial decade, and over 80 percent over

the first two decades. More expansive borrowing provisions can extend the banking gains, as

would lower correlation among cost shocks. Higher discount rates and lower initial allocations

(or more restrictive borrowing), however, would all reduce the banking gains.

       Given the observation that such policies frequently remain fixed for a decade or two at

the most, limiting the relevant horizon for welfare comparisons, these results provide strong

evidence that bankable quantity policies to address climate change can provide the bulk of the

welfare advantages previously afforded to price policies. Still, a number of interesting areas

remain for further work. Importantly, this analysis has not examined how the likelihood of

policy adjustments might affect both banking behavior and the welfare analysis. Recent changes

in the regulation of sulfur dioxide, for example, suggest potential advantages and disadvantages

from banking in the face of policy changes. In addition, while we have sought to understand



                                                    24
how banking ought to proceed, it remains for future work to more carefully compare these

predictions to observed behavior.

Appendix

First-order conditions

We start by augmenting the Bellman equation (6) with the specified optimization constraints:

                                                                                             ,
                    ,         min                         2                                                    (A.1)
                               ,



Here, β = 1/(1+r) is the discount factor, Et is the expectations operator given information at time

t, and πt, μt, and γt, all ≥ 0, are Lagrange multipliers on the allowance constraint (4), non-negative

emissions constraint, and the next-period minimum bank constraint, respectively.23 The first-

order conditions are then:

                                                                                                               (A.2)

                                                              ,
                                                                                                               (A.3)



In addition the constraints noted in (6), we have the complementarity conditions                         0 and

                        0. Given the envelope condition result that             ⁄                , Equation (A.3)

can be rewritten as the following Euler equation:

                                                                                                               (A.4)

Derivation of price response to δθt with active banking for s periods

        With banking active for s periods, but not longer, small quantity adjustments δqt+j, 0 ≤ j ≤

s, can be made over the next s periods but

                                                    s

23 See Section 3 and Appendix D of (Schennach, 2000) for further discussion. Her model is similar to ours
(compare her Equation (16) with m and λ to our Equation (A.4) with π and γ) but her discussion is focused on the
expected path rather than uncertainty and welfare.
                                                                  33
That is, the cumulative change must be zero. From Equation (2) we know that

                                       and                                            for s ≥ j≥ 1. Solving for

δqt+j and substituting into the above expression,

Using equation (A.4), we can recursively solve for                                  or                       .

Substituting again into the above expression,

Rearranging,

Derivation of the relative advantage expression Δ in (14)

       As noted in the text, the general policy x-quantity welfare difference Δ can be

decomposed into effects on expected costs and effects on expected benefits. That is, Equation

(13) can be rewritten:

           Δ = E[NBt,policyx] – E[NBt,quantity] = (Bt,policyx – Bt,quantity) – (Ct,policyx – Ct,quantity)   (A.8)

Starting with the change in expected costs, if we rewrite the cost function by completing the

square, we can express the cost function as

                                                                            1

Here,  t2 = var(θt) is the variation in prices under non-bankable quantities, and var(pt) is the

variation in prices observed under a mean preserving alternative, policy x.24 Note that by

constructing a mean preserving alternative x,                                                                     ,a

        Turning to the benefit expression in (A.8), we note that                          under policy x equals

the abatement cost advantage flexible quantity policies have over fixed quantity policies.

where var(pt) and var(qt) are measured for any mean-preserving alternative to non-bankable

quantities and which simplifies back to (15) when                                   , qt  qt  ( t / ct ) , δ = 1,

Parameterization

           Our cost parameterization is based on recent estimates of U.S. compliance costs with

H.R. 2454 (Waxman-Markey) given in (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2009).

In particular, we assume initial baseline emissions, q1 , of 6 billion tons CO2e and initial

allocation of allowances, y1, of 6 billion tons, with qt growing at 0.35% per year ( g q  0.0035)

and yt declining at 3.4% per year (gy = -0.034). This parameterization is roughly in line with

regulated abatement path of H.R. 2454 considered in EPA (2009). Given this allocation path and

baseline emissions path, we parameterize c1 such that P1 $13 per ton CO2underbankable

quantities, the initial price estimate given in EPA (2009).25 This leads to c1 = $12 per ton per

billion tons, or $12 x 10-9 $/ton2. We assume an initial standard error for cost shocks, σ0, of $4

per ton CO2 based on the reported variation in EPA scenarios,26 and a correlation of 0.8 based on

NP. Consistent with Waxman-Markey, we assume that firms can costlessly borrow from the

next period’s allocation, thus we set              = –yt+1.27

           On the benefit side, we start with the NP estimate of b1, 8.7 x 10-13 $/ton2 and multiply by

0.64 to convert from a price of retained CO2 to a price of emittedCO2.28 This allows easier

comparison with conventional cost analyses based on emissions, such as EPA (2009), but

requires an adjustment to compare with the original NP results. As in NP, we assume these

benefits grow at 2.5% and that the discount rate is 5%. Table 1 summarizes these benchmark

parameter values.




27The Waxman-Markey legislation allows for borrowing from allocations beyond the next period’s allocation,but
an eight percent interest charge is assessed to these borrowed allowances. Such a steep borrowing charge makes
borrowing from allocations beyond next year’s allocation highly unlikely (see the “flat allocation path” sensitivity
analysis). Thus, we omit this type of borrowing from our analysis.
