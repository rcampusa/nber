                                               ABSTRACT

Virtually all public policies regarding taxation and the redistribution of income rely on explicit or implicit
assumptions about the long run effect of wages rates on labor supply. The available estimates of the
wage elasticity of male labor supply in the literature have varied between -0.2 and 0.2, implying that
permanent wage increases have relatively small, poorly determined effects on labor supplied. The
variation in existing estimates calls for a simple, natural experiment in which men can change their
hours of work, and in which wages have been exogenously and permanently changed. We introduce
a panel data set of taxi drivers who choose their own hours, and who experienced two exogenous permanent
fare increases instituted by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, and we use these
data to fit a simple structural labor supply function. Our estimates suggest that the elasticity of labor
supply is about -0.2, implying that income effects dominate substitution effects in the long run labor
supply of males.

I. Introduction

        The effect of wage rates on long run labor supply is a key ingredient in the

discussion of virtually all public policies regarding taxation, social safety nets, and the

redistribution of income. Although there is a relatively broad consensus that the long run

elasticity of labor supply is not likely to be large, especially for adult males, this

consensus is a result of many individual studies that face a litany of familiar limitations. 1

The two most serious problems in studying worker preferences between income and

leisure that modern studies face are (a) the inability of most workers to alter their hours of

work without changing jobs and (b) the consequent inability of the analyst to measure

exogenous changes in wages that workers face. Our goal in this paper is to provide a

straightforward analysis of the labor supply of workers whose hours are flexible in

response to an exogenous wage increase. To do this we have deliberately selected data

for a group where a transparent econometric analysis is feasible, rather than apply more

complex methods to a broad based and representative data set. Needless to say, our

approach has the obvious advantage of transparency, while suffering from the

disadvantage that it may not be appropriate to generalize our findings to other

populations.

        Our analysis relies on a new panel dataset of New York City taxi drivers who

choose their own work hours, and who experienced two exogenous, permanent increases

in their real wages. New York taxi drivers either own or lease taxi “medallions,” which

and Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) for the details. Formal evidence that workers face constraints on hours
worked within jobs dates from at least Ham (1982) and Altonji and Paxson (1988).

give them the right to collect passengers when hailed on the street, subject to a number of

rules and regulations, including the fees they may charge. This economic environment

provides a straightforward method for estimating the labor supply response to a wage

change, if one occurs. Our data indicate that work responses to exogenous increases in

the fare structure are small, and negative. Worker wages, on the other hand, are strongly

affected by increases in the fare structure. Taken together the evidence implies that the

long run uncompensated elasticity of labor supply lies around -.2, and that it may be

estimated in our data with considerable precision.

       Taxi drivers have been the subject of several studies that attempt to use the time

series behavior of individual drivers who face stable fare structures to study intertemporal

substitution and reference dependence in driver preferences. (See Farber (2005) and the

references therein.) However, absent the observation of exogenous, permanent wage

changes, these papers cannot measure long run labor supply parameters and they do not

attempt to do so.

       In the next section of the paper we provide a brief discussion of the New York

City taxi industry. We then introduce our new data set on taxi revenues and fares, set out

a simple theoretical model of taxi driver incentives, and discuss the empirical results.

The final section contains some brief concluding remarks and indicates some of the

implications of our findings for future research.



II. Taxis in New York
                                                      4


           There are five main types of cabs in New York City: yellow taxis, car services,

black cars, limousines, and illegal so-called gitney cabs. 2 Only yellow cabs are legally

allowed to accept passengers from street hails, and this – along with hails from

passengers waiting in lines at airports, train stations, and hotels – is the only legal source

of passengers for yellow cabs. All taxi and livery services are regulated by the New York

City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

           In 2006, there were 12,779 yellow taxis in New York City, out of a total of about

46,000 legal taxis, car service, and black car vehicles. The yellow taxis concentrate on

serving Manhattan residents, who are transported in 71% of their trips. As of 2002, “two-

thirds of Manhattan residents used cabs for work and/or personal trips at least some of the

time,” and overall, “Manhattan adults hail a cab an average of 100 times a year” (Schaller

2006). In turn, “90% of all taxi trips originate in Manhattan” (Schaller 2006). Yellow

taxis are thus an important part of the Manhattan transportation system, with “8.5 yellow

. . . taxis per 1,000 Manhattan residents in 2005” (Schaller 2006).

           The only way to legally drive a yellow taxi is with a taxi license: “a painted

aluminum medallion . . . which is affixed to the hood of every yellow . . . cab” (Schaller

2006). The number of medallions is determined by the TLC, and has not varied much

from around 12,000 for the past 60 years. There are three main ways to get access to a

medallion: (1) buying one on the open market; (2) renting one for long-term periods of

time as a “named driver”; and (3) renting a medallion one shift at a time as an “unnamed

driver.” Individually-owned cabs are now required to “be driven 210 shifts per year by

the medallion owner, for licenses transferred since 1990,” although there is some

question about whether the required number of shifts is enforced (Schaller 2006).
2
    A comprehensive source, on which we rely for much of the following material, is Bruce Schaller (2006).
                                                5


        The TLC also sets the fares that taxis must charge. A taxi trip begins with a fare

drop: a large charge that is accrued as soon as the cab drives for more than a short

distance (this distance has ranged from 1/7 to 1/5 of a mile since 1952). After this, the

passengers are charged for mileage (when the cab is moving more than 12mph) and wait

time (when the cab is stopped or moving less than 12 mph). Finally, there are and have

been various surcharges for trips beginning during certain times of the day, and various

flat fares for trips to and/or from specific airports.

        Since July 1952, the TLC has changed the fares 13 times. In nominal dollars, the

fare drop has increased from $0.25 for the first 1/5 mile to $2.50 for the first 1/5 mile, the

charge per mile has increased from $0.20 to $2.00, and the charge per minute has

increased from $0.03 to $0.40. Average fares have increased from $0.83 to $9.61.

        The recent fare increases analyzed in this paper (March 1996 and May 2004) have

resulted in increased total revenue per hour (i.e., the number of passengers hailing cabs

did not decline enough to offset additional revenue from higher fares per trip), which

suggests that the demand for taxis is inelastic. It is possible to interpret some of these

fare increases as accounting for inflation, however after the 2004 fare increase, drivers’

real cash incomes exceeded “driver incomes in 1929 for the first time since the Crash”

(Schaller 2006). This suggests that there have been long-term changes in drivers’ real net

hourly wages that have been precipitated in part by nominal fare changes instituted by the

TLC.

        In the next section, we discuss the data we use to analyze the response of taxicab

drivers to two changes in real revenue per mile that were brought about by the 1996 and

2004 fare increases.

III. Data

       The City of New York’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) inspects each

yellow taxicab three times a year at its central inspection facility. The data used in this

paper is the TLC’s complete set of official inspection records from September 1994

through December 2005. Each inspection record includes the medallion number, the

registered type of driving arrangement (owner-driver, owner-driver with another driver,

named driver, or unnamed driver), the odometer reading, the taximeter reading, and the

date of the inspection. From these data, we can calculate the number of days since the

last inspection (always about 4 months), the month in which the inspection took place (to

capture seasonal effects), the number of miles driven since the last inspection, and the

revenue earned since the last inspection.

       The measure of labor supply that we construct from these data is the number of

miles driven. With a constant average speed (which we take to be driver specific in the

analysis below), miles driven is a good measure of hours worked, and thus of labor

supply. However, it should be clear that although hours worked and miles driven are

highly related, they are not identical. The primary difference will be due to waiting time

that results in passenger revenue, but that does not result from miles being driven. We

suspect that the primary place where this happens is where cabs are waiting in a line at an

airport or a hotel, for the purpose of shuttling passengers between the two. However, as

of 1990, only four percent of all yellow taxi trips began or ended in La Guardia or

Kennedy airports (the number at Newark airport was negligible). (Schaller 2006) This
                                                    7


implies that most taxi drivers are probably cruising on Manhattan streets when they are

looking for a passenger, so that miles driven and hours worked will be closely related. 3

        The corresponding real net revenue earned per mile driven in a given four month

period is the real revenue earned during that period minus the real costs, divided by the

number of miles driven. We use as our measure of the real earnings from driving a mile

the real revenues divided by the number of miles driven. Holding velocity and real costs

constant, the average real revenue per mile is proportional to the average hourly wage. In

the interest of holding real costs constant, which we presume are primarily fixed, we

exclude from our sample all medallions that are being leased by their drivers (named

drivers, and unnamed drivers), since real lease rates change over time.

        Since we are interested in estimating the labor supply of taxi drivers, not of

taxicabs, we would like each observation to be for a particular driver. To help achieve

this, we also exclude from our sample all medallions owned by a driver who rents out his

medallion to another driver for the complementary shifts. Finally, we exclude from our

data set all records in which the inspection took place more than 365 days before one of

the fare increases, records in which the inspection took place less than four months after

one of the fare increases (this eliminates inspection periods that straddle both sides of the

fare increase), and records in which the inspection took place more than four months plus

365 days after a fare increase.

        We are left with a total of 19,134 observations (inspections) of 2,637 medallions,

where each medallion at any point in time is driven by an individual owner-driver. 4

3
 The potential linkage between driver labor supply and miles driven would ideally be studied with some
measure of actual hours worked or clocked, which is not available at this time. However, in our analyses
we do control for driver fixed effects and for month variability and it seems likely that much of the
systematic variation in driver down time that otherwise exists will be unrelated to the timing of fare
changes.
                                                       8


These observations cover the labor supplied by these drivers from: March 1st, 1995

through February 9th, 1996; from July 1st, 1996 through July 1st, 1997; from May 12th

2003 through May 3rd, 2004; and from September 7th, 2004 through September 7th, 2005.

Our data covers an average of 825 days for each medallion, with a standard deviation of

368 days.

           We do not know with certainty that each observation represents the work of one

driver, since the driver associated with a medallion at the beginning of an inspection

period may have sold his medallion before the next inspection. We also do not know for

sure that the driver associated with a medallion in one year is necessarily the same driver

associated with that medallion in another year. However, we do know the total number

of taxi medallion sales each month from January 1990 through December 2005. On

average, only 18 exchanges of privately-owned medallions occur each month, meaning

that within the average inspection period less than three percent of medallions change

hands. Some of these should actually involve sales to corporations that lease medallions,

thus removing drivers from our sample, not matching new drivers to existing medallions.

Our medallion fixed effects are thus only a proxy for driver-level fixed effects. Since at

most three percent of these medallions changed hands in any given period, most

medallions must have stayed in the hands of the same owner drivers during the small

periods of time before and after each fare change, which implies that our primary analysis

should not be affected.

           We report summary statistics from these data in Table 1, and a very simple pre-

post analysis of differences in miles driven and revenue received per mile in Table 2a

(the full panel) and Table 2b (a balanced subset of the full panel). The basic data
4
    Only 2,535 of these medallions have sufficient meter information for revenue and related calculations.
                                                9


surrounding the fare structure increases are also reported in Figures 1 and 2. It is clear

from the figures that the real average revenue per mile was higher in the three years after

each fare change than in the years before, suggesting that we can measure the labor

supply response of owner-drivers to changes in real wages using the fare changes as an

instrument. The figures also are consistent with only a small, and perhaps negative,

permanent change in miles driven in response to the fare changes. Taken at face value,

the simple division of the proportionate change in miles driven by the proportionate

change in revenue per mile provides a measure of the uncompensated labor supply

elasticity. For the balanced sample of data these estimates are all roughly -5%/20%=-.25.

As we shall see below, this is close to the estimate obtained from a more complete

econometric analysis.



IV. A Simple Model of Behavior for Taxi Driver Labor Supply

       What is apparent from the previous discussion is that drivers do not face explicit

wage rates, but instead face a taxi fare function that relates their income to hours worked

through the miles they travel. A simple model of this behavior starts with the standard

assumption that a driver has utility function

   (1) u=u(h,y),

where h is hours worked and y is income from driving, and uh<0, uy> 0. A worker also

faces a schedule relating work to income

   (2) y=g(h;θ),

where θ represents the parametric part of the fare structure. The driver optimizes by

working at a point where
                                                     10


    (3) - uh / uy = gh ,

the rate of substitution of leisure for goods equals the marginal effect of hours on income.

         A convenient parameterization to the rate of substitution function - uh / uy is - uh /

uy = αhß , while g(h;θ)= θh is a first order approximation for the earnings function, and

we can thus measure θ as revenue per mile driven. The function αhß captures the notion

that whether the uncompensated labor supply function is positively or negatively sloped

depends on whether the rate of substitution of leisure for goods increases or decreases at

higher work hours. 5 There is nothing in the conventional theory of labor/leisure choice

that compels either to be the case, so that the issue is entirely an empirical one.

         These assumptions lead to a supply function of the form

    (4) ln(h)=(1/ß)lnθ – ln(α/ß),

which is a straightforward log linear regression. In principle, in this setup fixed effects

for individual drivers have the interpretation as variation in α, which affects the level of

hours worked, but does not affect the response of hours worked with respect to the wage

rate. Note that because of our linear approximation g(h,y)= θh, we are assuming that

individual drivers face perfectly elastic demand schedules for hours worked. 6

         Our estimation strategy is straightforward. We first fit reduced from equations for

revenue per mile (θ) and miles driven (h) as functions of monthly dummy variables for

the month in which an inspection is observed, a measure of the number of days since the

previous inspection, and an indicator for the fare structure in place. We then fit the labor



5
  This functional form was first apparently used by Burtless and Hausman (1978) and the implied utility
function and other aspects of it are discussed extensively by Stern (1986).
6
  It is important to understand that, even though the demand curve for aggregate taxi rides is downward
sloping, this is not the demand curve that individual drivers face Our assumption about the driver’s
revenue function implies that an individual driver may drive as much as they like at the equilibrium price in
the aggregate market.
                                                    11


supply function (4) by ordinary least squares and also using the fare indicator variables as

instruments. In this context, the fare structure instruments serve two purposes. They

permit us both to identify a shift along a labor supply function from an exogenous shift in

the wage, and they also serve to correct for measurement error that results from the

“division” bias produced from the way we construct our measure of revenue per mile. 7



V. Empirical Results

        Our identification of the effect of the wage rate on labor supply depends on

observing an exogenous wage increase that is not confounded by other factors that would

affect labor supply. We use exogenous fare increases for this purpose. It is hard to

imagine precisely what other factors would be likely to serve as confounding factors.

Factors such as unpredictable increases in the demand for taxi rides (as from a

spontaneous demand shock) would not be permanent, while most other shocks would be

related to the seasonal or individual driver fixed effects for which we control. 8

(A) The Uncompensated Wage-Elasticity of Labor Supply

        We report the first stage results of regressing revenue/ per mile driven on the fare

dummy variables and some other control variables in Table 3. It is apparent that the fare

increases are associated with an average 19% increase in revenue per mile, and that this

effect is precisely measured. It is also notable that both the month dummies and the


7
  This measurement error tends to produce an automatic negative correlation between miles driven and
revenue per mile, because the former is contained in the denominator of the latter. Measurement errors in
miles driven thus results in a spurious negative correlation between miles driven and revenue per mile. See
especially Farber (2005) for a discussion of this issue.
8
  One exception might be gasoline prices, which is an important cost for a driver. However, gasoline prices
were very stable in the period surrounding the 1996 fare increase. Gasoline prices were on an increasing
path during the period surrounding the 2004 fare increase, which would imply that we have somewhat
underestimated the increase in real revenues per mile driven and therefore underestimated (in absolute
value) the labor supply elasticity.
                                                  12


“days since inspection” variables have very small coefficients, implying that reporting

month deviations in revenue per mile are typically within 1 to 3 percent. 9

         We also report the reduced from regression of miles driven on the fare dummy

variables and some other control variables in Table 4. The results indicate that miles

driven decline from 2 to 4 percent following a fare increase, depending on the

specification. The more appropriate specification, which controls for medallion fixed

effects, indicates an average 4.2 percent decline in miles driven. In this exactly identified

model, the ratio of these two reduced from estimates is precisely our instrumental

variables estimate.

         The instrumental variables estimates are reported in Table 5. In what we

consider the most appropriate specification, using fixed effects, we estimate an

uncompensated labor supply elasticity of -.23, with a standard error only about one-tenth

that size. This is our preferred estimate of these drivers’ uncompensated wage-elasticity

of labor supply and it is estimated with considerable precision.

        There are two other determinants of labor supply that might well have changed at

the same time that the fare changed and as a result of its change: (a) the drivers’ incentive

to rent their medallion to others may have increased because of the increased medallion

rental rate, and (b) the value of the medallion on the medallion transaction market may

have increased. We examine these issues in order to see what, if any, effect they may

have on the interpretations of our primary empirical results.

        (B) The Change in the Medallion Rental Rate.


9
  Recall from the discussion above that the “month” dummy variables record the month that the taxi
inspection took place. These inspections cover a 4 month period. Thus, the coefficients on the month
dummies are linear combinations of effects that would be estimated with dummy variables that measured
the revenue per mile in an actual calendar month.
                                                     13


         We do not observe the medallion rental rates over time. However, we know that

in 1996 the TLC raised the cap medallion lease, but that in 2004 the TLC only raised the

cap medallion lease rate by 8% in order that most of the fare increase “would end up in

drivers’ pockets.” (See the timeline in the appendix for more details.) Although we

cannot document all the details there is a potential for large changes in the lease rate

around the time of the fare changes that might affect the labor supply of drivers who

owned medallions, despite the fact that these lease rates do not affect them directly,

because of the potential incentives a change in the lease rate might give an owner driver.

         For example, this change in the incentive to lease to others could potentially cause

at least one serious bias: it could selectively remove people from our sample after the fare

increase, because they then start renting their evening shift to others.

         Since our data set has the universe of drivers inspected by the TLC between 1990

and 2005 we may examine the number of medallions that switched from being

associated with an owner-driver to being associated with both an owner-driver and

another driver, after the fare increases were announced. The data on switchers shows that

this type of selection affected less than one percent of our sample 10. Thus, it seems

unlikely that increased medallion renting has any effect on our results.

         (C) The Change in the Price of the Medallion

         The New York City taxi medallion is a major asset. In December 2005, the

average nominal transaction price in the market for individual medallions was $350,000.


10
  There are 17 medallions in our sample that were owner-driver medallions as of March 2004, but became
medallions associated with both an owner-driver and another driver after March 2004 (i.e., after the
announcement of the fare increase). Assuming that all of these drivers sought out partners because of the
increased lease rates, this would mean that the selection rate was 17 out of the total of 2705 medallions in
our sample. According to our data, no medallions that were associated only with an owner-driver before
the 1996 fare increase later appear as associated with an owner-driver and another driver after the 1996 fare
increase. Dividing 17 over 2705 gives a selection rate of under 1%.
                                              14


A change in the medallion’s value occurring at the same time as the fare change could

lead to two biases: (a) it could selectively remove people from our sample, because they

sell their medallion in response to the jump in its value; and (b) for those who remain in

our sample, it might affect their labor supply via an additional income effect. We can

examine the selections issue (a) by looking at the number of individually-owned

medallions sold around the time of the fare changes. We regress the number of

medallions sold per month on the dummy for post-fare-increase and on month-of-the-

year dummies. In results not reported, we find that the fare increases are associated with

an extra 1.4 medallions sold per month, or 17 extra per year, and the increase is not

statistically significant. This point estimate thus suggests that perhaps 1% of our sample

selected to leave through selling their medallions, which seems unlikely to affect our

results.

           Finally, to examine possible income effects due to medallion price increases we

examined the time series of monthly average medallion prices reported in Schaller

(2006). Medallions trade in an open, public market and the prices are likely to be

affected by many factors, including whether the City increases their supply, which they

do from time to time (see the Timeline in the appendix), and on caps that the TLC places

on lease rates. Clearly both the former and the latter are likely to drive prices down. The

time series around the 1996 fare increase does not provide any evidence of medallion

price increases, but the time series around the 2004 fare is more suggestive. It is clear

that starting around September 2001 there was an upward trend in the price of

medallions. It is clear that between September 2001 and April 2004 (when the new fare

was announced), the trend in prices was almost linear, whereas as soon as the new fare
                                            15


took effect in May, the trend began to be broken. Fitting the data between September

2001 and April 2004 to a linear time trend shows that a rate of increase of $1,834 per

month gives an R-squared of 0.95. This trend may thus represent a good counterfactual

for what would have happened if the fare change had not been implemented. Using this

counterfactual, we calculate that by December 2005, when our data set ends, the

medallions were priced at $53,000 more than they would have been without the fare

change.

       Is a $50,000 increase in the value of a medallion likely to affect the continuing

labor supply of an owner-driver separately from the wage increase with which it is

associated? The answer to this question depends on the foresight and age of a driver. To

the extent that the owner-driver continues to work and expects to do so for a long time,

the income effect produced by the fare increase is entirely captured by the observed fare

increase, just as any permanent wage increase affects a worker’s lifetime income.

However, for workers with shorter horizons, there may be other effects.

       .According to revenue information from our data set and cost information from

The 2006 New York City Taxi Fact Book, the drivers in our sample could expect to

generate net earnings of about $50,000 per year over the course of their careers, so the

medallion price increase is about equivalent to a single year of pay. Assuming an average

career length of 30 years, the medallion price increase would constitute about 3% of

lifetime income, while the medallion price increase would increase lifetime income by

only about 3%. This suggests that any direct effects of the medallion price increase on

driver-owner labor supply will be small.

VI. Conclusions

        Our results imply that the uncompensated labor supply elasticity for taxi drivers is

almost certainly negative and small. This will come as no surprise to those who know the

extensive literature devoted to the study of male labor supply. In addition, this finding is

consistent with a broad variety of historical evidence that suggests that the massive

increases in real wages seen in the United States and Europe since 1879 have been

accompanied by significant declines in annual hours worked per worker. It is also

consistent with the evidence that work hours are longer in poorer countries than in richer

ones.

        An important limitation of our results is that they capture only one margin on

which labor supply is adjusted, neglecting especially issues of labor force participation

and retirement. These participation issues may loom especially large for groups whose

attachment to the labor force is not as strong as the primarily adult male workers who

make up the bulk of taxi drivers.

        Our results have important implications for much of the continuing discussion of

tax and transfer programs in many countries. Many of these discussions continue to

operate in nearly complete ignorance of the extensive scientific evidence about labor

supply behavior that has been accumulated over the last four decades. No doubt this is a

product, in part, of wishful thinking, but results like those in this paper, replicated in a

variety of settings, might serve as a useful antidote for those who are prepared to examine

the facts.

March 2002:          New York City Taxi Workers Alliance organized forum to hear
                     taxi driver’s stories of their financial deterioration after September
                     11. Federal Emergency Management Agency had assisted taxi
                     garages and brokers but not the drivers and at this hearing, FEMA
                     officials heard the taxi drivers’ stories. Soon after, FEMA opened a
                             new Rental and Mortgage Assistance program- over 2,000
drivers                              participated.

September 29th, 2003: “A group representing thousands of taxi drivers said it would
                      begin to push harder for an increase in fares, after a broad survey
                      of drivers found that many -- facing higher gas prices and a weak
                      economy -- are increasingly unable to support themselves with
                      their jobs. The survey, to be released today, included 581 drivers
                      who were interviewed at Kennedy International and La Guardia
                      Airports last winter. It was the first time such a large group had
                      been interviewed by the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which
                      represents 4,800 of the more than 40,000 licensed taxi drivers in
                      the city.”

October 20th, 2003:   “A group representing thousands of taxi drivers in New York City
                      is threatening a strike if the Taxi and Limousine Commission does
                      not enact its first fare increase in seven years.”

January 1st, 2004:    “A formal study ordered by the city has essentially cleared the way
                      for the largest taxicab-fleet expansion in nearly 70 years. It
                      concluded that adding 900 cabs over the next three years would not
                      pose environmental concerns and indicated that a moderate fare
                      ease would probably assuage taxi owners.”
                      “The intention is for 300 cabs to be added in each of the next three
                      years, with the first group expected to be cruising city streets by
                      June.”

January 12th, 2004:   “In recent months, drivers have threatened to strike if the fare is
                      not increased. Officials are currently proposing a 25 percent hike.”

                      the first batch of 300 planned for issuance by the end of the current

                    “Most of the increase will end up in drivers' pockets, because the
                    commission also ruled that lease caps - the maximum amount that
                    fleet owners can charge drivers - can be raised by only 8 percent.”
