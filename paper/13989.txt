                                               ABSTRACT

Business leaders, government officials, and academics are focusing considerable attention on the concept
of "corporate social responsibility" (CSR), particularly in the realm of environmental protection. Beyond
complete compliance with environmental regulations, do firms have additional moral or social responsibilities
to commit resources to environmental protection? How should we think about the notion of firms
sacrificing profits in the social interest? May they do so within the scope of their fiduciary responsibilities
to their shareholders? Can they do so on a sustainable basis, or will the forces of a competitive marketplace
render such efforts and their impacts transient at best? Do firms, in fact, frequently or at least sometimes
behave this way, reducing their earnings by voluntarily engaging in environmental stewardship? And
finally, should firms carry out such profit-sacrificing activities (i.e., is this an efficient use of social
resources)? We address these questions through the lens of economics, including insights from legal
analysis and business scholarship.

1.         Introduction

           Business leaders, government officials, and academics are focusing more and more attention

on the concept of “corporate social responsibility” (CSR). The central issue is the appropriate role

of business. Everyone agrees that firms should obey the law. But beyond the law -- beyond full

compliance with environmental regulations -- do firms have additional moral or social

responsibilities to (voluntarily) commit resources to environmental protection?

           One of the challenges of examining the concept of CSR is simply identifying a consistent and

sensible definition from among a bewildering range of concepts and definitions that have been

proposed in the literature.1 We adopt a simple definition originally offered by Elhauge (2005):

sacrificing profits in the social interest. This definition has the merit of being consistent with some

of the most useful prior perspectives (Graff Ziven and Small 2005; Portney 2005; Reinhardt 2005),

while focusing the discussion on the most interesting normative and positive questions.

           Of course, questions regarding sacrificing profits in the social interest apply beyond the

environmental sphere. The academic debate over the legality of sacrificing profits in the public

interest appears to have begun in 1932 with opposing articles (Dodd 1932, Berle 1932) in a Harvard

Law Review symposium on “For Whom Are Corporate Managers Trustees?” The debate in

economics began more recently, with Milton Friedman’s 1970 article, “The Social Responsibility of

Business Is to Increase Its Profits,” in the New York Times Magazine. Since then, the debate has

continued, and CSR has received considerable attention from both scholars and the public, especially

in the environmental protection area.

        The purpose of this article, which is part of a three-article symposium on Corporate Social

Responsibility and the Environment,2 is to introduce and provide an overview of the major issues

related to CSR, synthesize what is known about CSR in the environmental arena, and thereby

identify where the greatest uncertainties remain. To this end, we address four key questions about

the issue of firms sacrificing profits in the social interest.3 May they do so within the scope of their

fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders? Can they do so on a sustainable basis, or will the

forces of a competitive marketplace render such efforts and their impacts transient at best? Do

firms, in fact, frequently or at least sometimes behave this way, reducing their earnings by

voluntarily engaging in environmental stewardship? And finally, should firms carry out such profit-

sacrificing activities? In other words, is this an efficient use of social resources?

        This article is organized as follows. We begin by examining legal thinking about whether

firms may sacrifice profits to benefit individuals other than their shareholders, and then look at the

legality of CSR in the United States and other countries. Next, we draw on theories of industrial

organization and management to identify circumstances under which firms can sacrifice profits

without being punished by market forces. We then turn to positive questions about whether firms

theoretical and empirical perspectives, respectively.

  These four questions were originally identified by Hay, Stavins, and Vietor (2005).

actually do engage in CSR. Here we review and synthesize empirical evidence to assess whether

some firms truly exceed full compliance with the law, and if so, whether their “socially responsible”

actions actually sacrifice profits. To address our fourth question, should firms -- from a societal

perspective -- be carrying out such activities, we examine CSR in a normative light and consider

economic arguments on both sides of the issue. The final section summarizes our findings and offers

some conclusions.

2.     May Firms Sacrifice Profits in the Social Interest?

       The prevailing view among most economists and business scholars is that corporate directors

have a fiduciary duty to maximize profits for shareholders. While this view underlies many

economic models of firm behavior, its legal basis is actually not very strong. The judicial record,

although supportive of a duty to maximize profits for shareholders, also leaves room for the

possibility that firms may sacrifice profits in the public interest. The courts’ deference towards the

judgment of businesspeople -- the “business judgment rule” -- prevents many public-minded

managerial actions from being legally challenged.

2.1    The Legal Purpose of the Corporation

       The most widely accepted position on the legal purpose of the corporation – known as

shareholder primacy (Springer 1999; Fisch 2006; Ehrlich 2005) -- was articulated by Milton

Friedman in 1970:

       In a free-enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of

       the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That

       responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which

       generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic




                                                  5
        rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical

        custom (Friedman 1970).

        A more subtle version of the shareholder primacy argument is the “nexus of contracts”

approach (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Easterbrook and Fischel 1991), which views the corporation

as a nexus of legal contracts between the suppliers of various factors of production, who agree to

cooperate in order to generate monetary returns. These agreements specify that in exchange for their

contributions, the owners of most factors of production -- labor, land, intellectual property rights,

etc. -- will receive set payments with little risk. Shareholders -- the suppliers of capital -- accept the

residual financial risk of doing business, and in return receive the residual profits.                     Since

shareholders have no contractual guarantee of a fixed payment from the firm’s activities, any profits

that are diverted towards other activities, such as pursuit of “the social good,” come directly out of

their pockets (Butler and McChesney 1999). Thus, from this perspective, CSR is close to theft.

        A second view of the role of the corporation is found in the team-production model (Blair

and Stout 1999), which views the corporation as the solution to the moral hazard problem that arises

when the owners of factors of production must make firm-specific investments but fear they will not

be rewarded ex post. To solve this problem, the board of directors of the corporation functions as a

neutral “mediating hierarch” that allocates residual profits to all of the factors of production (team

members) according to their relative contributions.4 Under the team-production model, sacrificing

profits in the social interest is legal, as long as the profits are allocated to a deserving factor of

production.

        A third view of the purpose of the corporation is the “operational discretion” model, which

holds that the law grants corporate managers discretion to comply with social and moral norms, even


4
  For example, many U.S. states have enacted statutes that permit corporate directors to consider the interests of
stakeholders other than shareholders.


                                                        6
if doing so reduces shareholder profits (Elhauge 2005). The judiciary’s unwillingness to second-

guess matters of business judgment has the practical effect of shielding managers who choose to

sacrifice profits in the public interest.

        A fourth and final position is the “progressive view” that the corporation is organized for the

benefit of society at large, or at the very least, corporate directors have fiduciary responsibilities that

extend to a wide variety of stakeholders (Sheehy 2005; Gabaldon 2006). Under this view,

sacrificing profits in the public interest is entirely legal. The progressive view, however, is not well-

rooted in either statutes or case law (Clark 1986).

2.2     The Legality of CSR in the United States

        In the United States, a variety of legal requirements define the responsibilities of the

corporation (and its board of directors) to shareholders and other stakeholders. However, as

discussed below, these requirements are limited in practice.

2.2.1   Corporate Responsibilities to Shareholders and Other Stakeholders

        Although corporations in the United States are granted the “legal fiction of separate

corporate personality,” a corporation’s decisions are made by its board of directors, or by executives

who have been delegated decision-making authority (Clark 1986). To ensure that directors and

managers do not act negligently or subvert corporate resources for their own benefit, the legal

system imposes fiduciary duties of care and loyalty.

        The duty of loyalty requires directors to act “in good faith and in the best interests of the

corporation” (Scalise 2005), and places limitations on the motives, purposes, and goals that can

legitimately influence directors’ decisions (Cox and Hazen 2003). The duty of care complements the

duty of loyalty by requiring managers to “exercise that degree of skill, diligence, and care that a

reasonably prudent person would exercise in similar circumstances” (Clark 1986, p.123). Violation

of fiduciary duties can result in personal liability for directors (Scalise 2005). Legal formulations of


                                                    7
fiduciary duties typically refer to the “best interests of the corporation”, but whether the

corporation’s “best interests” include only its shareholders or a wider set of constituents is not

immediately clear (Cox and Hazen 2003). The prevailing opinion is that fiduciary duties are owed

to shareholders (Blomquist 2006), but a minority supports the view that corporations can be

managed in part for the benefit of other stakeholders (Lee 2005).

          Every U.S. state recognizes the right of businesses to make charitable contributions. Seven

states allow charitable donations regardless of corporate benefit, and nineteen other states allow

donations that benefit the business or advance the public welfare (Choper, Coffee, and Gilson 2004).

Statutes in the remaining 24 states (including Delaware) include similar language, but without legal

clarification about whether donations are permitted when they do not benefit the firm (Donohue

2005).5

          State corporate statutes grant corporations legal powers similar to those of people, and allow

corporations to participate in lawful activities (Clark 1986). As a result, corporations presumably

have the power (but not necessarily the right) to undertake CSR activities (Donohue 2005).

Corporations can write their own corporate charters to explicitly authorize themselves to participate

in CSR. For example, the New York Times is incorporated to pursue objectives other than profit

maximization (Donohue 2005).

          These statutory requirements and judicial precedents place limits on the actions of

corporations and their boards. But an important judicial construct -- the business judgment rule --

creates substantial deference to firms’ managerial decisions.




5
 In addition, 29 states have statutes that allow managers to consider the interests of non-shareholders such as employees,
customers, suppliers, creditors, and society at large (Springer 1999).


                                                            8
2.2.2    The Business Judgment Rule

         The business judgment rule “acts as a presumption in favor of corporate managers’ actions”

(Branson 2002). It requires courts to defer to the judgment of corporate managers, as long as their

decisions satisfy certain basic requirements related to negligence and conflict of interest. The basic

premise is that since corporate managers are far more skilled at making business judgments than

courts, allowing courts to second-guess managers’ decisions would create potentially large

transactions costs (Elhauge 2005).

         The business judgment rule makes fiduciary duties difficult to enforce, and it effectively

grants managers discretion to “temper business decision making with their perceptions of social

values” (Clark 1986; Fisch 2006; Scalise 2005; Blair and Stout 1999).6 As a practical matter, as

long as managers can plausibly claim that their actions are in the long run interests of the firm, it is

almost impossible for shareholders to challenge the actions of managers who act in the public

interest.

         The business judgment rule also offers managers protection from accusations of conflict of

interest, primarily because it does not recognize most non-financial incentives as conflicts (Elhauge

2005; Branson 2002). Corporate managers’ decisions can be regarded as irrational -- and thus not

protected by the business judgment rule -- only if they “go so far beyond the bounds of reasonable

business judgment that their only explanation is bad faith” (Blomquist 2006, p.699). Donohue

(2005) cites the extreme example of a Delaware court that ruled that the business judgment rule

protected the 1989 decision by Occidental Petroleum to spend $120 million, slightly less than half of

 For example, Clark cites the 1968 case of Shlensky v. Wrigley, in which the Illinois Court of Appeals allowed William
Wrigley, Jr., the president and majority shareholder of the Chicago Cubs, to refuse to install lights at Wrigley Field
because of his belief that night games would be bad for the surrounding neighborhood (1986).

the company’s yearly net profit, on an art museum named after its 91 year old CEO, Armand

Hammer.

        So, are firms in the United States prohibited from sacrificing profits in the public interest?

And if so, is the prohibition enforceable? The answers to these two questions appear to be “maybe”

and “no,” respectively. “While case law falls short of unequivocally mandating shareholder wealth

maximization, it also falls short of unambiguously authorizing the pursuit of non-shareholder

interests other than instrumentally for the benefit of the shareholders” (Lee 2006, p. 557). And as

long as managers claim some plausible connection to future profitability, the business judgment rule

grants them substantial leeway to commit corporate resources to projects that benefit the public.

2.3     The Legality of CSR in Other Countries

        With their cultural traditions of social democracy or firm loyalty to employees, most

European countries and Japan have legal systems that differ from the system in the United States.

The legal systems in these other countries place a greater emphasis on stakeholder participation, and

sometimes codify this by legalizing various forms of profit-sacrificing behavior. Europeans have

sought to incorporate CSR into their investment climate, both at the institutional and individual level

(Sutton 2004), and in strong social democracies, such as Germany and France, stakeholders

(particularly employees) have much stronger legal positions than in the U.S. (Roe 2000).

Corporations in Europe and Asia are also more likely to have a few large shareholders, who may

take social responsibilities seriously, particularly those towards employees (Roe 2000). This

contrasts with the pattern of highly dispersed share ownership in the United States.

2.3.1   Industrialized Countries

        Common law industrialized countries, primarily former British possessions, share many legal

features with the United States. Corporations in these countries have similar board structures, face

similar legal requirements, and even share some legal precedents. In such countries, CSR is

                                                  10
discouraged, but permitted. Under Australian corporate law, for example, corporate managers are

required to make decisions in the best interest of the corporation, while a statutory business

judgment rule grants managers considerable discretion (Corfield 1998). Likewise, Canadian law

requires that directors and officers of corporations act in the best interests of the corporation, but the

director is not permitted to ignore the collective interests of shareholders (Borok 2003). The United

Kingdom’s legal system permits corporate managers to engage in socially beneficial activities, as

long as there is a plausible rationale that the activities are in shareholders’ interests (Lynch-Fannon

2007).

         In contrast with common law jurisdictions, countries with civil law systems tend to place a

greater emphasis on stakeholder participation in corporate governance. Corporate boards often

include employee representatives, and cultural traditions emphasize loyalty to employees. In these

countries, more forms of CSR are permissible. In France, corporate directors have both a duty of

care and a duty of loyalty (Fanto 1998). Although there has been a shift towards more investor

friendly laws, the French legal code explicitly allows directors to make decisions based on the

interests of all constituencies. German law does not even give management an explicit obligation to

maximize shareholder value (Marinov and Heiman, 1998), and large German corporations have a

two-tiered board structure that encourages the board to consider the interests of parties other than

shareholders (Corfield 1998).

         Japanese corporate law is similar to corporate law in the United States, in that directors have

duties of care and loyalty, which, if violated, can be grounds for shareholder lawsuit. But Japanese

corporations have a strong tradition of CSR oriented towards their employees. In years with high

profits, large corporations usually retain their earnings and reinvest them for the benefit of

employees (Miwa 1999). The shares of many firms are owned by banks who handle firms’ credit or

by important business partners (Corfield 1998). These shareholder-creditors have financial goals

                                                   11
that are similar to those of long-term employees, particularly in terms of corporate stability and

minimizing risk (Roe 2000).

2.3.2   Developing Countries and Multinational Enterprises

        Corporate law in developing countries has a number of special characteristics. First, the

corporate legal system is often new. As a result, businesses have little experience complying with

the law, and there are fewer judicial precedents mapping out the law’s boundaries. Second, legal

institutions in developing countries are often weak. Regulations can go unenforced; agency

problems can be a serious issue; and members of the judiciary may be corrupt. Third, the operations

of multinational corporations in these countries can lead to conflicts between the interests of home

and host states.

        Thus, both the laws governing CSR and the degree to which those laws are enforced may

vary substantially across developing countries. Assuming that the laws in most developing countries

allow some scope for managerial activity that may sacrifice profits, the question remains whether

firms can do so in view of competitive pressures in the markets for their outputs and inputs. It is to

this question that we now turn.

3.      Can Firms Sacrifice Profits in the Social Interest?

        Simply because the legal system may allow firms to sacrifice profits in the social interest

does not mean that firms can do so on a sustainable basis in the face of competitive pressures.

Under what conditions is it economically feasible for firms to sacrifice profits in the social interest?

Before turning to this question, we address a somewhat broader question: under what conditions

might it be sustainable for firms to produce goods and services, such as public goods, that benefit

individuals other than their customers (Lyon and Maxwell 2004; Vogel 2006)?




                                                  12
       We identify six conditions that would facilitate the production of such goods and services.

All six of these conditions involve government intervention, imperfect competition, or both. First is

the imposition of regulatory constraints that require a firm as well as its competitors to carry out

some socially beneficial actions. Second is the possibility that such production is not costly to the

firm. For example, restaurants frequently donate leftover food to homeless shelters. The third

condition is that the socially beneficial actions may reduce a firm’s business expenses by an amount

greater than the cost of the actions themselves. For example, installation of energy-saving (climate

friendly) technologies may generate long-term cost savings that outweigh upfront costs. Fourth, in

some cases socially beneficial actions may yield an increase in revenue. It is easy to think of goods

and services that are differentiated along environmental lines, such as clothing made of organic

cotton, or wood from forests managed in accordance with some principles of sustainability.

Socially beneficial actions could also generate goodwill, improving reputation and sales. Fifth, firms

may choose to go beyond full compliance with environment, health, or safety laws in order to

improve their position in current or future regulatory negotiations. By doing so, they may be able to

deflect or influence future regulation or deflect enforcement of existing regulation. Sixth, some

firms may use over-compliance to spur future regulation, which would provide a competitive

advantage over less adaptable firms

       We now turn to our more restrictive definition of CSR and address the question raised above:

under what conditions is it economically feasible for firms to sacrifice profits in the social interest?

3.1     When Is it Feasible for Firms to Engage in Profit-Sacrificing CSR?

       In some cases firms undertake CSR actions voluntarily, while in others they engage in CSR

only under pressure from market participants or other social forces. In practice, it is difficult to

discern voluntary from “reluctant” CSR. Whether CSR initiatives are voluntary or reluctant, their



                                                  13
economic sustainability depends on the market pressures and social expectations confronted by the

firm (Borck, Coglianese, and Nash 2006).

3.1.1    Voluntary CSR

         The first possibility -- that stakeholders voluntarily sacrifice profits -- is what some observers

would think of as the “purest form” of CSR. The primary economic agents who could fund such

activities are shareholders and employees.

         Some shareholders may be willing to subsidize firms’ profit sacrificing behavior. Stock

issued by socially responsible firms is a composite commodity which combines a financial

investment product with a charitable giving vehicle (Graff Zivin and Small 2005). When investors

purchase the stock, they may be motivated by self-interest or by altruistic motives. As long as

investors are willing to fund CSR activities, firms can participate in them. But whether investors are

willing to accept lower returns may depend on whether the firm already enjoys an economic position

that allows it to obtain rents, such as through natural monopolies, niche markets, imperfect

information, regulatory distortions, anti-takeover laws, and other market imperfections.5 In this

case, investors sacrificing profit may still earn returns above the market norm.

         Willingness to accept below market returns may depend on whether investors hold stakes in

publicly- or privately-held companies. Investors with large private holdings are more likely to take

an interest in their companies’ activities and be able to influence the companies’ actions. Whether

this additional interest and influence would have a positive or negative influence on CSR is an open

question.


5
 Firms have strong economic incentives to take advantage of any market power available to them. If a firm maintains
market power, it can -- in principle -- pass on the costs of CSR to its suppliers and/or customers. For example, regulated
public utilities, which are granted geographic monopolies on specific conditions such as provision of universal service,
may decide to engage in CSR activities and use the firm’s monopoly power to pass resulting costs on to consumers.




                                                           14
         Evidence suggests that some individuals are willing to pay more for socially responsible

goods (Jensen et al. 2002). The existence of such “ethical investors” could -- in principle -- have

consequences for firms that do not participate in CSR activities (Heinkel, Kraus, and Zechner 2001).

For example, if ethical investors’ choices increase the cost of capital for “irresponsible” firms, some

of these firms might be forced to adopt more socially responsible practices. If the share price

differential becomes sufficiently large, these firms may decide to participate in CSR activities to

increase their own stock price (Heinkel, Kraus, and Zechner 2001; Graff Zivin, and Small 2005).

But the effect of green investors on the cost of capital may be small. Because irresponsible firms

will generate higher returns (relative to their stock price), investors in these firms will accumulate

capital more quickly than socially responsible investors, and over time may dominate the capital

market. This would lead to a decrease in the cost of capital for irresponsible businesses (Heinkel,

Kraus, and Zechner 2001).

         Employees may sacrifice part of the returns to labor to further the social good. This could

occur explicitly if employees are given the opportunity to use their own salary and benefits to fund

CSR projects. For example, some executives may be able to channel part of their compensation

towards the cost of CSR activities, or lawyers may be able to donate their time to pro bono work.

Employees may also fund CSR implicitly, such as when a firm works in a field that employees

perceive as socially responsible (e.g., providing services to the elderly, remediating oil spills).

Employees may be willing to accept less than the fair market value of their labor (as determined by

the wage they would receive for working in a less-socially responsible industry), because they are

compensated in other ways through the knowledge that their work benefits society at large (Frank

1996).

         Unfortunately, empirical evidence on CSR and wages is inconclusive. Most revealed

preference studies show that wages are lower at non-profit firms than at for-profit firms, but this

                                                  15
non-profit wage penalty disappears in econometric analyses that control for worker and firm-specific

characteristics (Francois 2004). If non-profit status is a proxy for social responsibility, then socially

responsible firms may not enjoy a significant discount on labor prices. This conclusion is supported

by findings that CEO compensation at firms listed in the Domini Social Index (DS 400) is not

significantly different from CEO compensation at other firms in similar industries (Frye, Nelling,

and Webb 2006).

3.1.2   Reluctant CSR

        Corporate decisions are actually made by individual managers and directors, not by the

“firm” per se. Those decisions often further the interests of profit-minded shareholders, but not

always. Investors may have little choice but to accept some degree of CSR profit-sacrificing

activities. It may be less costly to accept a degree of principal-agent “slack” than to eliminate it

completely, because managers who are excessively constrained may be ineffectual.

        Investors may also be forced to accept profit-sacrificing activities that are the result of

external constraints.     This may be particularly relevant in the developing world, where

environmental regulatory standards lag behind those of industrialized countries. For example,

equipment purchased from industrialized countries may incorporate pollution control technology

that meets standards considerably stricter than those in effect in a developing country (Jaffe,

Peterson, Portney, and Stavins 1995).

        The magnitude of the profits that managers can sacrifice against investors’ wishes depends

on the structure of managers’ compensation and the strength of shareholder oversight.

Principal/agent problems can be costly. Managers have been observed to “satisfice” profits, that is,

seek to achieve an adequate rate of return for shareholders and then divert the firms’ resources to

their personal ends (Choper, Coffee, and Gilson 2004; Clotfelter 1985).



                                                   16
3.1.3   Unsustainable CSR

        Under many conditions, firms that participate in costly CSR activities will have to raise

prices, reduce wages and other costs, accept smaller profits, or pay smaller dividends -- and accept

the economic consequences. For example, a firm’s stock price may decline until it is proportional to

returns, and attracting new capital may be difficult because returns are below market averages.

Other short-term economic consequences may include loss of market share, increased insurance

costs, increased borrowing costs, and loss of reputation. In the long term, the firm may face

shareholder litigation, corporate takeover, or closure. Such consequences simply illustrate the

general proposition and observation that (financially) inefficient firms tend to disappear (Alchian

1950; Altman 1999).

        This process of economic survival of the fittest suggests that firms that engage in

unsustainable CSR may find themselves being pushed out of business. The forces of globalization

only increase this pressure. Given the seemingly inevitable outcome of this process, why would any

firm choose to participate in unsustainable CSR activities? First, principal/agent problems may lead

managers to make decisions that commit the firm to short-term CSR actions, even if those activities

will not be continued in the long run. Second, managers may misjudge the potential profitability of

certain actions, leading them to invest in actions that benefit society but harm the firm’s bottom line.

Neither the managers’ probability assessments nor their motivations are transparent to outside

observers, making it very difficult to distinguish between them (Baron 2006).

3.2     Economic, Structural, and Organizational Constraints

        A variety of factors influence the economic actors who make decisions about engaging in

CSR activities. These factors include managerial incentive and monitoring constraints, and

organizational structure and culture.



                                                  17
       Whether or not firms are able and likely to engage in CSR depends on managers’ incentives

and constraints, which in turn are determined by managers’ preferences, ethical beliefs, contracts,

and goals. The most direct incentives managers face are their employment agreements. For

managers whose compensation is designed to align their incentives with those of shareholders,

sacrificing profits means reducing their own compensation. In the United States, chief executive

officers (CEOs) are usually paid in a mixture of stocks, stock options, and salary, with their

compensation linked to explicit measures of the firm’s performance (Prendergast 1999). But the

relationship between compensation and firm performance may be close to flat at some levels of firm

performance, which means CEOs may be able to trade off compensation against CSR activities at a

rate they judge acceptable.

       Organizational culture may also be significant (Howard-Grenville, Nash, and Coglianese

2006). Organizational identity influences how individuals within the firm view the purpose of the

firm, what it stands for, and its future goals. Organizational self-monitoring affects how an

organization interacts with outside stakeholders. Firms that are more self-conscious about their

image may expend greater effort to communicate and interact in “socially appropriate” ways than

other firms, even if their core values related to socially beneficial behavior are similar.

       Other factors may also affect whether firms can sacrifice profits in the social interest. For

example, firm size appears to matter, with evidence that larger firms can sacrifice proportionately

more profits (Adams and Hardwick 1998). Further, public visibility may increase pressure on firms

to participate in CSR activities: firms in notoriously “dirty” industries may find themselves under

heavy pressure from public advocacy groups to reduce their emissions or to participate in offsetting

activities (Brown et al. 2006). Finally, firms cannot participate in CSR if their work provides no

scope for it. CSR activities are simply much more plausible for firms in certain industries (Porter

and Kramer 2006).

                                                 18
4.     Do Firms Sacrifice Profits in the Social Interest?

       As described above, there are specific circumstances in which firms can sacrifice profits in

the social interest without suffering serious adverse economic consequences. Whether they actually

do so is another matter. This section discusses empirical evidence about the existence of such profit-

sacrificing behavior.

       Before interpreting the evidence, it is important to be aware of several challenges to making

inferences about CSR. First, it is difficult to test whether firms’ actions actually go beyond ordinary

compliance with environmental regulations. Data on environmental performance are typically very

limited, and because of the difficulty of observing appropriate counterfactuals, it is difficult to

demonstrate that firms sacrifice profits. Whole industries often engage in CSR together, leaving

behind no comparison group. Even when firms act individually, it is difficult to know whether

unobservable characteristics explain differences in both socially responsible activity and

profitability. Studies that link profitability to CSR practices are particularly vulnerable to this

problem. For example, because many high-technology companies have low pollutant emissions (in

contrast with firms engaged in electricity generation, heavy manufacturing, or resource extraction),

the high-tech boom in the 1990s created a perceived but spurious correlation between market

measures of “socially responsible business practices” and stock returns. Furthermore, as discussed

above, there are a variety of ways in which firms can profit from investments in socially beneficial

projects. Many actions also have effects on profitability that differ in the short versus the long term,

with a short-term decrease in profits followed by a more-than-compensatory increase in long-term

profits. Thus, demonstrating that an action has truly sacrificed profits in the social interest is

exceptionally difficult.




                                                  19
        Of course, distinguishing between motivations and outcomes is even more difficult.

Although most firms are likely motivated by a combination of social and financial concerns,

managers may cite social responsibility as the motive for actions that were actually driven by

profitability. Or managers may use profitability to justify socially responsible business choices,

even when those choices result in smaller profits (Baron 2006).

        4.1    Do Firms Over Comply?

        A first step in evaluating whether firms participate in CSR is to determine whether they over

comply with regulations or participate in other costly activities that benefit society. We consider

five sources of evidence: voluntary government programs, voluntary industry initiatives, voluntary

action by individual firms, corporate charitable donations, and shareholder resolutions.

4.1.1   Voluntary Government Programs

        In principle, the willingness of a firm to participate in a voluntary government program could

be evidence of CSR activity. A variety of studies have evaluated the determinants of participation in

voluntary government programs (Borck, Coglianese, and Nash 2006). Several patterns emerge.

First, larger firms are more likely to participate in voluntary programs. Second, participation is more

likely for firms that either produce final goods or experience more pressure from NGOs and

consumers. Third, firms with higher emissions or poor compliance records are more likely to

participate in voluntary programs. And fourth, participation may be positively influenced by factors

such as industry association membership, R&D expenditures, organizational culture, and managerial

discretion. However, there is no consensus that voluntary government programs have generated

environmental benefits net of the opportunity cost of the resources required to implement them.

4.1.2   Voluntary Industry Initiatives

        In addition to voluntary programs administered by governments, industry associations have

created voluntary initiatives. For example, the Responsible Care program, established in 1989 by

                                                  20
the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Association, requires participating facilities to adopt ten guiding

principles and six codes of management practices related to the environmental and social dimensions

of community interactions, facility management, and customer and supplier interactions. By and

large, the program was ineffective because it did not provide strong incentives for compliance (King

and Lenox 2000). Similarly, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) was created in the

wake of the 1979 reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant in Harrisburg,

Pennsylvania. A third example is Sustainable Slopes, a voluntary program for reporting and

encouraging improved environmental performance at ski resorts. The evidence indicates that firms

took advantage of positive publicity, although the actual environmental benefits are debatable

(Rivera and de Leon 2004).

        In general, industry-sponsored programs exhibit the same kinds of participation patterns as

government-administered voluntary programs. That is, larger firms, more prominent firms, and

firms with poorer environmental records are more likely to participate. Again, there is no systematic

evidence of positive environmental impacts net of social costs.

4.1.3   Voluntary Action by Individual Firms

        An indicator of firm participation in independently developed CSR activities is whether firms

adopt CSR plans, environmental management systems, or other plans that seek to encourage

socially-beneficial decision making within the firm. These plans often have the nominal goal of

taking a holistic management approach towards compliance with environmental and safety laws,

contractual and voluntary environmental obligations, management of environmental and social

impacts and risk, and other issues (Clark 2005). These systems may benefit firms by allowing them

to manage the business aspects of environmental and social issues, but they may also serve as a

mechanism for firms to improve environmental quality or otherwise benefit society.



                                                 21
        One such mechanism is ISO 14001, an international standard that provides guidelines for

monitoring environmental outputs, controlling environmental processes, and improving

environmental performance (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2006). To demonstrate that its

environmental management system complies with the standard, a business (or any other

organization) must be audited by a third-party auditor. Capital intensity, intensity of competition,

and dependence on overseas markets are all positively associated with voluntary compliance with

the standard (Chapple et al. 2001).

        The best source of evidence about whether firms participate in CSR activities on their own

initiative is independent studies of socially responsible actions. Perhaps surprisingly, many studies

of individual beyond-compliance behavior analyze firms in developing countries (Hartman, Huq,

and Wheeler 1995; Hettige et al. 1996; Pargal and Wheeler 1996; Blackman and Bannister 1998;

and Dasgupta, Hettige, and Wheeler 2000). One possible reason for this focus is that firms in

industrialized countries are subject to a wide range of environmental regulations that make it

difficult to judge whether their actions are legally required, risk-averting, or voluntarily beyond

compliance. In contrast, in the developing world, pollution regulations may be poorly enforced or

even nonexistent, making it easier to identify individual beyond-compliance behavior.

4.1.4   Corporate Charitable Contributions

        Evidence of corporations making financial contributions to charity supports the general

hypothesis that corporations can and do commit corporate resources to CSR. Average contributions

as a percent of net income before taxes increased, from less than 0.5 percent in the 1930s to 1.1

percent in the 1960s and 1970s (Harris and Klepper 1976). In general, CEOs and other high-level

corporate officers have a high degree of control over the amount and destination of corporate

charitable contributions, even if their company has established a separate charitable foundation

(Kahn 1997). But charitable giving can be curtailed by debtholders (Brown et al. 2006; Adams and

                                                 22
Hardwick 1998). Overall, the evidence shows that charitable giving is more likely when financial

and monitoring constraints are weak. Corporate charitable giving is also sensitive to firm income

and marginal tax rates (Clotfelter 1985).

4.1.5   Shareholder Resolutions

        Shareholders sometimes request that corporations comply with ethical or other requirements.

In 2005, the shareholders of public U.S. corporations proposed 348 resolutions on social and

environmental issues, of which 177 reached a proxy vote (Social Investment Forum 2006). On

average, these resolutions have received support from 10 to 12 percent of all votes cast. Of the 25

social policy resolutions in the U.S. that gained the highest percentage of votes during the years

2003 to 2005, only six gained a majority of all votes cast. But winning even a modest share of votes

in a shareholder resolution can influence management policies.

4.2     Is There Evidence of Profit-Sacrificing Behavior?

        According to our strict definition of CSR, beyond-compliance behavior is a necessary but not

sufficient condition for CSR because, under some conditions, such behavior can be profitable. One

way to measure the profit sacrificed by socially responsible companies would be to calculate the

difference in profitability between firms that do and do not participate in socially responsible

activities. In fact, a large literature, consisting of at least seventeen review articles, has explored this

relationship.8

        The most recent and comprehensive review is by Margolis, Elfenbein, and Walsh (2007). In

a meta-analysis of the results from 167 studies of the relationship between financial performance and

socially responsible business practices (ignoring the mechanism and direction of causality), they

find that 27 percent of the analyses show a positive relationship, 58 percent show a non-significant

8
 See, for example, Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield 1985; Wood and Jones 1996; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Orlitzky,
Schmidt, and Rynes 2003.


                                                      23
relationship, and 2 percent show a negative relationship.6 Margolis, Elfenbein, and Walsh argue that

the evidence indicates that CSR, in general, has little effect on profitability, but note that there is

stronger evidence to suggest that some causality does operate in the opposite direction: companies

that are profitable are more likely to engage in more CSR activities.

           The finding that there is little relationship between CSR and profitability is consistent with a

market equilibrium in which firms invest in socially responsible projects until the marginal returns

decline to the overall market rate of return. In this situation, investing in CSR is not profitable (in

the sense that it does not generate economic rents), but neither is it a losing proposition. Instead it

means that for most firms, CSR “pays for itself.”

           These conclusions require a number of caveats. First, when evaluating studies of the

relationship between social responsibility and stock returns, it is important to keep in mind that not

all companies that are classified as socially responsible actually sacrifice profits. Many operate in

industries, such as software development, that by their very nature have little environmental or social

impact. Second, many of the measures of CSR used in such studies are not consistent with CSR as

we define it in this article. Thus, measured effects on profitability may have more to do with

advertising, charitable contributions, or other tangentially relevant factors than with CSR.

           In summary, evidence on sacrificing profits in the social interest is lacking. The bulk of the

available evidence suggests that most firms view socially responsible actions in the same way that

they view more traditional business activities, such as advertising and R&D. Instead of altruistically

sacrificing profits, they engage in a more limited -- but more profitable -- set of socially beneficial

activities that contributes to their financial goals. Hence, although proponents of sustainable

business practices may argue that being environmentally responsible will inevitably lead to higher

profits in the long term, the relationship between socially responsible activities and profitability may

be best characterized as some firms will generate long-term profits from some socially responsible

activities some of the time (Reinhardt 2000).

5.     Should Firms Sacrifice Profits in the Social Interest?

       Even if firms may, can, and do sacrifice profits in the social interest, an important normative

question remains, namely, should they? In other words, is it really in the broadly defined social

interest for firms to carry out such activity? There are two main approaches to answering this

question. First, we can compare firms’ actual CSR choices with the CSR alternatives available to

them. For any firm, such alternatives include a broad range of projects addressing various private

and public issues, costing different amounts, and resulting in varying degrees of environmental

protection and profitability. For example, a power plant could reduce its emissions of carbon

dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or particulate matter; switch to a renewable source of fuel; implement a job

training program to benefit local community members; make a donation to a charitable organization;

or take any number of other “socially responsible” actions. The question of interest here is whether

firms’ actual CSR choices are likely to be optimal relative to available alternatives.

       A second approach takes a public policy perspective, where a comparison is made between

allowing CSR (i.e., permitting firms to sacrifice profits in the social interest) and prohibiting CSR

(i.e., requiring firms exclusively to maximize profits for shareholders). To evaluate these two

approaches, we employ a variety of criteria, including social welfare and legal, political and social

considerations.

5.1    Social Welfare

       In the context of CSR, the social welfare criterion suggests that: (1) firms should invest in

projects that produce the highest level of social welfare; and (2) it is preferable to allow CSR if

aggregate welfare is likely to be higher when CSR is allowed than when it is prohibited.



                                                 25
        The benefits of CSR include direct welfare gains to individuals, such as asthmatics living

near a power plant that voluntarily reduces its emissions. More broadly, if firms voluntarily

internalize externalities, a more efficient allocation of resources may result. Of course, there is no

reason, ex ante, to anticipate that firms will reduce externality-producing activities to efficient levels.

        The direct costs of CSR are the loss of consumer surplus resulting from firms producing less

output at higher cost and hence at higher prices. In addition, shareholders receive reduced financial

returns. On the other hand, some shareholders may gain utility from the knowledge that their profits

have been invested in socially responsible projects.

        There are a number of reasons to believe that firms do not make socially optimal CSR

investments, in the sense of choosing activities that generate the greatest net social benefits, subject

to budgetary constraints. This is because firms’ CSR decisions are influenced by a number of

factors that are unrelated to social benefits and costs.

        First, firms’ CSR investment choices are influenced by managers’ personal preferences and

by firm characteristics. For example, some managers may favor building art museums, while others

favor the provision of affordable housing. This idiosyncratic element of personal preference is

particularly likely if principal/agent issues drive CSR (Butler and McChesney 1999). Similarly,

firms’ choices about CSR activities are affected by the nature of their industry, firm size, technical

capabilities, and relevant expertise, geographic location, and existing regulatory limits. To the

extent that these factors are unrelated to the social benefits and costs of CSR, their influence on firm

decisions about CSR may result in social inefficiency.

        Second, although firms may be well informed about the private costs of CSR, they may have

little experience evaluating its social benefits, leading them to choose inefficient levels of

environmental protection effort. Third, firms may fail to consider alternative mechanisms to achieve

                                                    26
their social goals. For example, firms may be able to achieve higher social returns by donating

profits to charities, which are dedicated exclusively to the task of improving social welfare and thus

presumably are well-suited to the task. If this is the case, then firms that fund CSR activities

effectively “crowd out” their own donations to more efficient charities (Graff Zivin and Small 2005).

Finally, choice of CSR activity is affected by the firm’s ability to sacrifice profits. Firms that are the

most profitable are also the most able to sacrifice profits in the public interest. However, the

opportunity cost of sacrificing profits may also be greatest for these firms, assuming they could

otherwise invest the resources in their businesses and earn similarly high returns.

        Although there are reasons to doubt the optimality of firms’ decisions about CSR, there are

also reasons to believe that firms’ CSR investment decisions may increase welfare. First, firms have

access to private information about their current and future pollution activities, including control

costs. Such information can lead firms to identify better policies than less well-informed government

agencies. Second, firms have relevant expertise and operational capacity. Third, government

policies are driven by a variety of objectives, only one of which may be maximizing social welfare.

Hence, compared with the counterfactual of prohibiting CSR but leaving government policy

otherwise unchanged, allowing CSR may generate higher net social benefits.

        Many types of potential CSR activities -- from reducing particulate emissions to preserving

open space -- are mandated to some degree by federal, state, or local laws and regulations. To the

extent that such regulations require a level of environmental protection that is below the socially

optimal level, additional corporate investment in these activities can increase social welfare (if

incremental social benefits exceed incremental social costs). In addition, there may be socially

responsible activities that address environmental issues that are unregulated but of significant

scientific or political concern (e.g., global climate change). In such cases (i.e., in the absence of

government policies), CSR activities may lead to positive net social benefits. However, given that it

                                                   27
appears to be relatively rare for firms to actually sacrifice profits in the social interest, the overall net

welfare flow from CSR, whether positive or negative, is unlikely to be large.

5.2     Legal, Political, and Social Considerations

        Although legality is not synonymous with social desirability (as evidenced by the legality of

many socially undesirable activities), some observers would surely identify legality as a normative

criterion by which to judge many actions. In the second section, we argued that in the United States

and other common law countries, sacrificing profits in the social interest is not strictly legal,

although in practice CSR is not prohibited because of the business judgment rule and problems of

enforcement.

        One argument that can be made against CSR is that it is not a democratic process. There is

no particular reason to believe that society should prefer firms’ choices and priorities over the

choices and priorities of a democratic government. Some observers might also argue that

corporations already dominate too many aspects of modern life, and that it would be undesirable for

them to control the supply of public goods as well.

        Under a broader interpretation of the idea of social responsibility, however, it can be argued

that businesses have a moral commitment to hold themselves to higher ethical standards and to

engage in activities that benefit society. In fact, in a poll of citizens’ attitudes towards the

responsibility of businesses in 23 developed and developing countries, public opinion seems to

support the notion that corporations in the West should “set higher ethical standards and help build a

better society.” In countries such as China and Kazakhstan, however, the notion that corporations

should “make profits, pay taxes, create jobs, and obey all laws” dominates (Environics International

Ltd. 1999).




                                                     28
5.3     The Special Case of Developing Countries

        Given that economic, social, and environmental conditions in developing countries are so

different from those in industrialized countries, one would expect the answers to normative

questions about CSR to also be different. For example, environmental regulations in the developing

world are often not well-enforced. Hence, many relatively cost-effective interventions that have

already been implemented in industrialized countries may still be available to businesses that operate

in the developing world. This suggests that CSR could lead to significant gains in net social welfare.

        Other concerns about CSR arise in the developing country context. Precisely because legal

and contractual systems often operate poorly in developing countries, it is important to prevent

activities that could erode the basis for future economic growth. Thus, strong investor protections

may be particularly desirable in developing economies (Marinov and Heiman 1998) to help buttress

the political viability of privatization and market-based systems. Allowing managers to divert

profits to socially responsible projects means giving managers substantial discretion. However,

there is also the risk that this discretion could tempt managers to use corporate resources for personal

gain.

6.      Summary and Conclusions

        This article has examined the concept of firms sacrificing profits in the social interest in the

environmental realm. This section summarizes our answers to the four questions posed at the outset:

May they do so within the scope of their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders? Can they

do so on a sustainable basis? Do firms behave this way? And, finally, should firms carry out such

profit-sacrificing activities?

        Our starting point for examining the first question -- may they -- was the prevailing view

among economists and business scholars that corporate directors have a fiduciary duty to maximize



                                                  29
profits for shareholders. Surprisingly, the legal basis for this view is not very strong. Although the

judicial record is supportive of a duty to maximize profits for shareholders, it leaves room for firms

to sacrifice profits in the public interest. The deference that courts show towards the judgment of

businesspeople -- the “business judgment rule” -- effectively protects many public-minded

managerial actions from successful legal challenge.

       Are firms in the United States prohibited from sacrificing profits in the public interest? And

if so, is the prohibition enforceable? The answers to these two sub-questions appear to be “maybe”

and “no”, respectively. U.S. corporate law is consistent with the shareholder primacy model, but as

long as managers claim some plausible connection to future profitability, the business judgment rule

grants them leeway to commit corporate resources to projects that benefit the public.

       Simply because the legal system may permit firms to sacrifice profits in the social interest

does not mean that firms can do so on a sustainable basis in the face of competitive pressures. Under

many conditions, firms that participate in costly CSR activities will have to raise prices, reduce

wages and other costs, accept smaller profits, or pay smaller dividends -- and accept the economic

consequences. After taking such measures, a firm’s stock price may decline until proportional to

returns, and attracting new capital may be difficult because returns are below market averages.

Other short-term economic consequences may include loss of market share, increased insurance

costs, increased borrowing costs, and loss of reputation. In the long term, the firm may face

shareholder litigation, corporate takeover, or closure.

       This process of economic survival of the fittest would suggest that firms that engage in

unsustainable CSR will find themselves being pushed out of business. Given the seemingly

inevitable outcome of this process, why would any firms choose to participate in unsustainable CSR

activities? First, the firms that engage (or say they engage) in CSR are often active in markets that

are imperfect or distorted by government intervention, so that they are buffered from Friedman’s

                                                 30
evolutionary imperatives. Second, principal/agent problems may lead managers to make decisions

that commit the firm to short-term CSR actions, even if those activities will not be continued in the

long run.

        Despite a large and growing literature, evidence of firms actually sacrificing profits in the

social interest is lacking. The bulk of the available evidence suggests that most firms treat socially

responsible actions the same way they view more traditional business activities. Instead of

altruistically sacrificing profits, they engage in a more limited -- but more profitable -- set of socially

beneficial activities that contribute to their financial goals.

        Although proponents of sustainable business practices and the “triple bottom line” may argue

that being environmentally responsible inevitably leads to higher profits in the long term, the

relationship between socially responsible activities and profitability may be more accurately

characterized as some firms generate long-term profits from some socially responsible activities

some of the time.

        Is it in the social interest for firms to carry out CSR activity? More to the point, should

governments allow such activity? Allowing CSR may be preferable to realistic alternatives. To the

extent that existing regulations require a level of environmental protection below the socially

optimal level, additional corporate investment can increase social welfare. In this context, CSR

should be seen as a complement to increasingly effective government regulation and not as a

substitute for it.
