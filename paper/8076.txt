   I.      Introduction
   Political opposition to “globalization” has grown rapidly during the last few years.
Protesters in Seattle, Washington D.C. and other cities around the world have rallied
against the alleged evils of an increasingly interconnected world economy, and of the so-
called “Washington Consensus.”
   The opening of domestic capital markets to foreigners is, perhaps, the most reviled
aspect of this “consensus.” In rejecting a higher degree of capital mobility across
countries, the anti-globalization activists and protesters are not alone. Indeed, a number
of academics have argued that the free(er) mobility of private capital during the 1990s
was behind the succession of crises that the emerging markets experienced during that
decade. According to this view, increased capital mobility inflicts many costs and
generates (very) limited benefits to the emerging nations. It has been argued that, since
emerging markets lack modern financial institutions, they are particularly vulnerable to
the volatility of global financial markets. This vulnerability, the story goes, will be
higher in countries with a more open capital account. Moreover, many global-skeptics
have argued that there is no evidence supporting the view that a higher degree of capital
mobility has a positive impact on economic growth in the emerging economies (Rodrik
1998).
   Surprisingly, the debate on the effects of capital mobility on economic performance
has been characterized by a very limited number of empirical analyses. Some exceptions
are Rodrik (1998), Klein and Olivei (1999), Quinn (1997) and Reisen and Soto (2000).
The purpose of this paper is to analyze empirically the relationship between economic
performance and capital mobility in the world economy. I am particularly interested in
understanding two related issues: First, is there any evidence, at the cross country level,
that higher capital mobility is associated (after controlling for other factors) with higher
growth? And, second, is the relationship between capital mobility and growth different
for emerging and advanced countries? The paper is organized as follows: Section I is
the introduction. In section II I provide an analysis of the magnitude, importance,
composition and other characteristics of capital flows in the world economy between
1975and 1997. In section III I deal with measurement problems. I argue that the
                                                    2


complications associate to the measurement the actual, as opposed to legal, degree of
capital mobility makes the analysis of the connection between capital mobility and
growth particularly difficult. In this section I discuss the properties of various measures
on the degree of capital mobility recently constructed by a number of analysts. In section
IV I report the results from a series of cross-country regressions on economic
performance. I focus on two independent variables – GDP growth, and total factor
productivity growth – and I control for the standard variables, including human capital
and the initial degree of economic development. Finally, section IV is the conclusions.
     II.      Capital Flows in the World Economy During 1975-1997
     In this section I focus on the behavior of capital flows in the world economy during
the last two decades. The main objective of this analysis is to unearth regularities, and to
detect differences across groups of countries. I consider six groups of countries, that
correspond to the IMF’s International Financial Statistics classification: (1) Industrial,
(2) African, (3) Asian, (4) Non-industrial European, (5) Middle East and (6) Western
Hemisphere or Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, I make a distinction
between three type of capital flows: (1) Foreign direct investment (FDI); (2) debt flows,
including debt to banks and bonds purchased by foreigners; and (3) other type of flows,
mostly portfolio equity flows.
     In Tables 1 through 5 I summarize the behavior of capital flows to these six regions
during the period under study. I provide data on averages, medians, standard deviations
and coefficients of variation for the volumes of flows relative to GDP.1 While Table 1
contains data for the complete period, Tables 2 through 4 present data for each category
of capital flows – debt, FDI, equities and total flows – for three different subperiods: The
first period is 1975-82, and corresponds to the years prior to the debt crisis of 1982. The
second subperiod is 1983-89, and corresponds to the years when most emerging countries
had difficulties attracting foreign capital. The final subperiod is 1990-97, a period when
private capital flew, once again, into the emerging economies. This period also
corresponds to the initiation of market-oriented reforms in most regions in the world,
including the former communist nations.

    These data have been constructed as differences in stocks. The raw data comes from the World Bank.
                                                 3


      Visual inspection of Tables 1 through 5 suggests that capital flows have behaved
differently across categories, regions and periods. Flows appear to have been more
volatile in the emerging economies and in particular in Africa. These tables also capture
the slowdown in flows in the period 1983-89, when most of the emerging world was
battling the consequences of the debt crisis, and the resumption of capital flows in the
1990s, including the surge of portfolio flows. It is also apparent from these figures that
Africa has been lagging behind other emerging nations in most capital flows categories.
         In order to test formally whether capital flows behaved differently across
countries, I estimated a series of non parametric Kruskal-Wallis χ 2 tests on the equality
of the distribution of capital flows in each of the five emerging market regions and the
industrial countries. The null hypothesis is that the data from the industrial nations and
from each of the emerging regions have been drawn from the same population. The
Kruskal-Wallis χ 2 test is computed as:



(1)      K = { [ 12/ n( n + 1) ] Σ ( Rj 2 / n j ) } – 3( n + 1),


where n j is the sample size for the j group (j = 1,…m), n is the sum of the n js, Rj is the
sum of the ranks j group, and the sum Σ runs from j=1 to j=m.
         The results are reported in Table 6. As may be seen, these tests clearly indicate
that capital flows have behaved differently in emerging markets (as a group), and in the
industrial countries. With the exception of FDI in the 1975-82 period, the χ 2 test statistic
is larger than the critical value, for every type of flow and for every subperiod considered
in this study. The more detailed analysis by region reveals that in most subperiods and
for most regions the hypothesis of equality of distribution is rejected strongly. In the case
of Africa the χ 2 test statistics are particularly large, and are highly significant in 15 out of
sixteen cases. During the more recent 1990-97 period the χ 2 test statistic is below the
critical value for FDI flows to Asia, Europe and Western Hemisphere; it is also below its
critical value for equity flows into Europe. In spite of these few instances of χ 2 test
statistics below the critical value, the overall picture that emerges from Table 6 indicates,
quite strongly, that when it comes to capital flows (relative to GDP) to the emerging
                                                 4


markets – both as a broad group and as regional aggregates -- have indeed been different
than capital flows to the industrial nations.
   III.       Measuring the Extent of Capital Mobility in Emerging and Advanced
              Economies
          During most of the last 50 years the vast majority of what we today call emerging
nations severely controlled international capital movements. This was done through a
variety of means, including taxes, administrative restrictions and outright prohibitions. It
has only been in the last decade or so that serious consideration has been given to the
opening of the capital account in less advanced nations. Many analysts have associated
the proposals to free capital mobility with the policy dictates of the so-called
“Washington Consensus.” Williamson’s (1994) original article on the Washington
Consensus, however, says very little about the opening of the capital account. What it
does say, however, is that the reform policies favored by the multilaterals included
encouraging foreign direct investment and the liberalization of domestic capital markets.
          Legally speaking -- and as the IMF documented year after year --, during most of
the post World War II era the vast majority of the emerging countries had a closed capital
account. From an economic point of view, however, what matters is not the legal degree
of capital restrictions, but the actual or “true” degree of capital mobility. There is ample
historical evidence suggesting that there have been significant discrepancies between the
legal and the actual degree of capital controls. In countries with severe impediments to
capital mobility -- including countries that have banned capital movement --, it does not take
a long time for the private sector to find ways to get around the restrictions. The most
common mechanisms have been the overinvoicing of imports and underinvoicing of
exports. The massive volumes of capital flight that took place in Latin America in the wake
of the 1982 debt crisis clearly showed that, when faced with the "appropriate" incentives, the
public can be extremely creative in finding ways to move capital internationally.
III. 1 Previous Measurement Attempts
          Measuring the “true” degree of capital mobility is not easy, and is still subject to
considerable debate. In two early studies Harberger (1978, 1980) argued that the effective
degree of integration of capital markets should be measured by the convergence of private
rates of return to capital across countries. He used national accounts data for a number of
                                                5


countries -- including eleven Latin American countries -- to estimate rates of return to
private capital, and found out that these were significantly similar. More importantly, he
found that these private rates of return were independent of national capital-labor ratios.
Harberger interpreted these findings as supporting the view that capital markets are
significantly more integrated than what a simple analysis of legal restrictions would suggest.
        In an effort to measure the “true” degree of capital mobility, Feldstein and Horioka
(1980) analyzed the behavior of savings and investments in a number of countries. They
argue that if there is perfect capital mobility, changes in savings and investments will be
uncorrelated in a specific country. Using a data set for 16 OECD countries they found that
savings and investment ratios were highly positively correlated, and concluded that these
results strongly supported the presumption that long term capital was subject to significant
impediments. Frankel (1989) applied the Feldstein-Horioka test to a large number of
countries during the 1980s, including a number of Latin American nations. His results
corroborated those obtained by the original study, indicating that savings and investment
have been significantly positively correlated in most countries. Montiel (1994) estimated a
series of Feldstein-Harioka equations for emerging countries. He argues that the estimated
regression coefficient for the industrial countries could be used as a benchmark for
evaluating whether a particular country’s capital account is open or not. After analyzing a
number of studies he concludes that a saving ratio regression coefficient of 0.6 provides an
adequate benchmark: if a country regression coefficient exceeds 0.6, it can be classified as
having a “closed” capital account; if the coefficient is lower than 0.6 the country has a
rather high degree of capital mobility. Using this procedure he concludes that many
emerging nations have exhibited a remarkable degree of capital mobility – that is, much
larger than what an analysis of legal restrictions would suggest.
        In a series of studies Edwards (1985, 1988) and Edwards and Khan (1985) argued
that time series on domestic and international interest rates could be used to assess the
degree of openness of the capital account (see also Montiel 1994). The application of this
model to the cases of a number of countries (Brazil, Colombia, Chile) confirmed the results
that, in general, the actual degree of capital mobility is greater than what the legal
restrictions approach suggests. Haque and Montiel (1991), Reisen and Yeches (1991) and
Dooley (1995) have provided expansions of this model that allow for the estimation of the
                                                    6


degree of capital mobility even in cases when there are not enough data on domestic interest
rates, and when there are changes in the degree of capital mobility through time. Their
results once again indicate that in most Latin American countries “true” capital mobility has
historically exceeded “legal” extent of capital mobility. Dooley et al (1997) have developed
a model that recognizes the costs of undertaking disguised capital inflows. The model is
estimated using a Kalman filter technique for three countries, including Mexico. The results
suggest that Mexico, the Philippines and Korea experienced a very significant increase in
the degree of capital mobility between 1977 and 1989.
        More recently, some authors have used information contained in the International
Monetary Fund’s Exchange Rate and Monetary Arrangements to construct indexes on
capital controls for panels of countries. Alesina, Grilli and Milesi-Ferreti (1994), for
example, constructed a dummy variable index of capital controls. This indicator -- which
takes a value of one when according to the IMF capital controls are in place and zero
otherwise -- was then used to analyze some of the political forces behind the imposition of
capital restrictions in a score of countries. Rodrik (1998) used a similar index to investigate
the effects of capital controls on growth, inflation and investment between 1979 and 1989.
His results suggest that, after controlling for other variables, capital restrictions have no
significant effects on macroeconomic performance. Klein and Olivei (1999) used the IMF’s
Exchange Rate and Monetary Arrangements data to construct an index of capital mobility.
The index is defined as the number of years in the period 1986 and 1995 that, according to
the IMF, the country in question has had an open capital account.2 In contrast to Rodrik,
their analysis suggests that countries with a more open capital account have performed
better than those that restrict capital mobility.
        An important limitation of these IMF-based indexes, however, is that they are
extremely general and do not distinguish between different intensities of capital restrictions.
Moreover, they fail to distinguish between the type of flow that is being restricted, and they
ignore the fact that, as discussed above, legal restrictions are frequently circumvented. For
example, according to this IMF-based indicator, Chile, Mexico and Brazil were subject to
the same degree of capital controls in 1992-1994. In reality, however, the three cases were


2
   Milner (1996), Leblang (1996) and Razin and Rose (1994) have also used indicators based on the IMF
binary classification of openness.
                                                        7


extremely different. While in Chile there were restrictions on short-term inflows, Mexico
had (for all practical purposes) free capital mobility, and Brazil had in place an arcane array
of restrictions. Montiel and Reinhart (1999) have combined IMF and country-specific
information to construct an index on the intensity of capital controls in 15 countries during
1990-96. Although their index, which can take three values (0, 1 or 2), represents an
improvement over straight IMF indicators, it is still very general, and does not capture the
subtleties of actual capital restrictions.
           Quinn (1997) has constructed the most comprehensive set of cross country
indicators on the degree of capital mobility. His indicators cover 20 advanced countries
and 45 emerging economies. These indexes have two distinct advantages over other
indicators: First, they are not restricted to a binary classification, where countries capital
account’s are either open or closed. Quinn uses a 0 through 4 scale to classify the
countries in his sample, with a higher number meaning a more open capital account.
Second, Quinn indexes cover more than one time period, allowing researchers to
investigate whether there is a connection between capital account liberalization and
economic performance. This is, indeed, a significant improvement over traditional
indexes that have concentrated on a particular period in time, without allowing
researchers to analyze whether countries that open up to international capital movements
have experienced changes in performance.
III.2 A Comparison of Two Alternative Measures of the Extent of Capital Mobility
           In this sub-section I analyze of the main properties of two broad measures of
capital mobility3: (1) An index based on the number of years within a certain period that,
according to the IMF, a particular country has not imposed capital controls. This is the
type of indicator used by Alesina, Grilli and Milesi-Ferreti (1994), and by Rodrik (1998)
in his study on the relationship between capital controls and economic performance. I
call this index NUYCO. A higher value denotes a higher degree of capital controls. And
(2) Quinn’s (1997) index of capital mobility. This indicator can take values goes from 0
through 4, with increments of 0.5. A higher value of this index denotes a higher degree
of capital mobility.

    I am grateful to Gian Maria Milesi-Ferreti for making his data set available to me.
                                                      8


         The Number-of-years-with-controls (NUYCO) Index: I computed this index for
three periods 1981-85, 1986-1990 and 1981-90 for a sample of 61 countries. Of these 40
are emerging nations and 21 are advanced countries. Panel A in Table 7 contains
summary statistics. Two properties of this index emerge from this table. First, as
expected, capital controls have been more pervasive among the emerging countries.
Second, while the emerging nations appear to have relaxed capital control somewhat
during the second half of the 1980s, the emerging countries appear to have tightened
them slightly. In order to analyze formally whether this index is statistically different in
industrial and emerging countries I computed, once again, Kruskal-Wallis test statistics.
The χ2 was (p value in parenthesis): 2.33 (0.12) for 1981-85; 5.57 (0.018) for 1985-
1990; and 3.67 (0.057) for the 1981-1990 period. Overall these test statistics confirm the
hypothesis that the extent of capital controls has been significantly larger in the emerging
countries, especially in the second half of the 1990s.4
         One of the most serious limitations of the NUYCO index is that it tends to
classify most countries in the extremes, as either being subject to no controls, or as
completely impeding capital mobility. For the period 1981-85 only eight out of 61
countries have values different from 0 or 5; and for 1985-1990 only three countries have
an index value different from the extremes of 0 or 5. As pointed out above, this inability
to consider intermediate cases of limited controls is one of the greatest shortcomings of
this index. In my view this problem is so severe that it reduces very significantly its
usefulness in empirical cross section analyses.5
         Quinn’s Indicator (CAPOPEN): Panel B in Table 7 contains summary statistics
for Quinn’s index of capital account restrictions. As was pointed out, this index can take
values that go from 0 to 4, and is available for 65 countries – 20 of which are industrial
and 45 emerging – and for two periods: the mid 1970s and the mid/late 1980s.6 As may
be seen from Table 7, according to this indicator the advanced countries have had a more
open capital account than the emerging economies. These data also suggest that the
difference between the two groups of countries became more accentuated in the late

4
  This could be, in part, a result of these countries efforts to get over the debt crisis of 1982. Formally
testing this proposition, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.
5
  The index used by Klein and Olivei (1999) also suffers from this limitation. The very vast majority of
countries in their sample appear to be either completely open or completely closed to capital mobility.
                                                    9


1980s. The Kruskal-Wallis χ2 for equality of the distribution across the two groups of
countries is (p value in parenthesis): 5.1 (0.02) for the mid 1970s; and 23.7 (0.0001) for
the 1980s. In contrast with the NUYCO index, Quinn’s indicator allows for considerable
gradation in the extent of capital mobility. For instance, for the 1970s in 49 of the 65
countries the index has a value other than the extremes of 0 or 4. In the 1980s there are
46 countries with an intermediate value for the index – that is a value that is neither 0 (the
capital account is completely closed) or 4 (the capital account is completely open). For
example, while according to NUYCO Greece and Ireland had a completely closed capital
account during the second half of the 1980s, according to Quinn’s index they had a semi-
open capital account during this period.
      An important feature of Quinn’s index is that it has been computed for two different
periods, allowing us to investigate the effects of capital account liberalization on
economic performance. In order to understand further the properties of Quinn’s indexes,
I compared them with an indicator based on Montiel’s (1994) savings-investments
regressions for emerging countries. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient had the
expected sign, but was rather low. Moreover the null hypothesis of both indexes being
independent could not be rejected at conventional values.
      IV.      Capital Mobility and Economic Performance: New Results
            In principle, a greater of openness of the capital account can impact on economic
performance through two alternative channels. The first, and most obvious one, is
through it effect foreign savings, and through them, on aggregate investment. Countries
with a more open capital account will have, in principle, the ability to finance a larger
current account deficit, and thus increase the volume of foreign savings. If increases in
foreign services are not reflected in a one-to-one decline in domestic savings, aggregate
savings will be higher. This will allow for higher investment and, thus, faster growth.
            Figure 1 presents the relationship between the degree of capital account
liberalization during the 1980s – denoted as (qopen87-qopen73), and measured in the
horizontal axis --, and the change in aggregate capital inflows, measured in the vertical
axis. This figure suggests, quite strongly, that countries that reduced the degree of capital
controls experienced an increase in capital inflows. This, in turn, was translated into

6
    The indexes were formally computed for 1973 and 1987. See Quinn (1997) for details.
                                                        10


higher current account deficits. Whether this, in turn, resulted in higher aggregate
investment depends on the extent to which foreign savings crowd out domestic savings
and is, ultimately, an empirical issue.
           In Edwards (1996) I used a broad cross-country data set to analyze this issue. My
results suggested that an increase in the current account deficit – that is, an increase in
foreign savings – crowd out private domestic savings partially. The point estimate
ranged (in absolute value) from 0.38 to 0.625, depending on the specification used for the
regression. These results were confirmed by the direct estimation of investment
equations that included the CAPOPEN index of capital mobility as a regressor. These
regressions are similar to those estimated by Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), and are not
reported here due to space considerations.7
           The second (potential) channel through which capital mobility may affect
performance refers to efficiency and productivity growth. According to a number of
authors, the elimination of capital controls, reduces an important distortion, and will tend
to result in higher return to investment, and higher productivity growth. That is,
according to this channel, countries with a more open capital account will outperform
those with restrictions on capital mobility, even after controlling for the direct investment
effect. In this section I use the data described above to investigate the importance of this
particular channel.
IV.2 Basic Econometric Results
           According to economic theory, countries with fewer distortions will tend to
perform better than countries with regulations and distortions that impede the functioning
of markets. For some time now, most (but not all) economists have agreed that freer
trade in goods and services indeed result in faster growth (Barro, 1995; Edwards 1998).
In standard models this ‘free trade’ principle extends to the case of trade in securities, and
countries that have fewer restrictions on capital mobility will, with other things given,
tend to outperform countries that isolate themselves from global financial markets. This
view is clearly exposed by Rogoff (1999, p.23):
       “From a theoretical perspective, there are strong analogies between gains in
       intertemporal trade in goods, and standard intratemporal trade…In theory, huge long-

      run efficiency gains can be reaped by allowing global investment to flow towards
      countries with low capital-labor ratios…[R]esearchers have now come to believe that
      the marginal gains [international] trade in equities can be very large…[It allows
      countries] to diversify production risk, which allows smaller countries to specialize,
      and more generally to shift production towards higher-risk, higher return projects”
         Whether gains from an open capital account are as large as Rogoff believes, is
largely an empirical question. In this section I use a new cross-country data set to
investigate this issue. More specifically, I concentrate on two measures of performance:
real GDP growth, and total factor productivity growth during the 1980s. I rely on
Quinn’s index to measure the degree of capital mobility in different countries. The data
on GDP growth are taken from Summers and Heston and those on TFP growth are from
Edwards (1998).
         From a policy perspective analysts are interested in two related issues: (a) Have
countries with a more open capital account performed better – in terms of higher
productivity growth and per capita GDP growth -- than countries that restrict capital
mobility? (b) Have countries that have opened their capital account performed
differently than countries that have not done so? As noted, a particular important
question is whether there is a “performance effect” over and above the investment effect
discussed above. One of the advantages of Quinn’s index is that is available at two
different periods in time, allowing us to address both of these questions. The analysis
presented in this section investigates the relationship between capital account restrictions
and economic performance, is based on the estimation of the following two equations:


(2)              g j = α 0+ α 1κ j + Σ α 2 X j + ε j

(3)              τ j = β 0+ β 1κ j + Σ β 2 X j + µ j ,


where g j is average real GDP growth in country j during the 1980s; τ j is the average rate
of TFP growth during the 1980s; κ j is a measure of capital account openness in country
j, or an indicator of the extent of capital account liberalization between 1973 and 1987;
the X j are other variables that affect economic performance; ε j and µ j are
                                                   12


heteroskedastic errors with zero mean. The αs and βs are parameters to be estimated.
Following the recent literature on growth and cross country economic performance in the
estimation of equation (3) the following X j were included: (a) The investment ratio
during the 1980s (INV80). Its coefficient is expected to be positive. (b) A measure of
human capital, taken to be the number of years of schooling completed by 1965 (Human).
Its coefficient is expected to be positive. And (c) the log of real GDP per capita in 1965,
which is take to be a measure of initial economic activity. To the extent that countries
real income tends to converge, the coefficient of this variable (GDP65l) is expected to be
nagative. In the estimation of equation (3) initial GDP and human capital were used as
the two X j.
        The first measure of capital account openness (CAPOP) captures the degree of
openness of the capital account in each country during the mid/late 1980s and
corresponds to Quinn’s index discussed above. The second index captures the extent to
which capital account restrictions changed between the mid 1970s and the mid/late
1980s . This index, which is denoted D_CAPOP corresponds to Quinn’s capital account
liberalization indicator; a higher value means that the country in question liberalized its
capital account during the period under study. The sign and statistical significance of the
capital account openness coefficient, is at the heart of recent discussions on the effects of
globalization, and is the main interest of the econometric analysis reported in this section.
        Equations (2) and (3) were estimated using a number of procedures, including
weighted least squares, weighted two stages least squares, SURE, and weighted three
stage least squares. In all regressions GDP per capita in 1985 was used as a weight.
        Table 8 summarizes the basic results obtained from the estimation of equations
(2) and (3) using the level of capital account restrictions (CAPOP) as the independent
variable. In Table 9, on the other hand, I present the regression results from the
estimation of these two equations using the capital account liberalization index,
D_CAPOP, as the independent variable.8 In both tables the sample includes all countries
for which data are available.

  The basic SURE and three stage least square results are not reported due to space considerations. See,
however, the discussion below.
                                             13


       As may be seen, the estimated coefficients of human65, inv80, gdp65l have the
expected signs in every regression. Moreover, in the vast majority of the regressions the
estimated coefficients for these variables were significant at conventional levels. More
important for the subject matter of this paper is that the coefficients of the capital account
openness variables are positive in every regression, and significant in all but one of them.
These results suggest that, once controlling for other variables, countries that are more
integrated to global financial markets have performed better than countries that have
isolated themselves. This is the case both for countries that had a more open capital
account and countries that liberalized their capital account.
       It is interesting to note that if instead of using Quinn’s indexes of capital account
restrictions, the more common IMF-based indicator is used, the coefficients become
insignificant. For instance, in the WLS estimation of the growth equation, the coefficient
of NUYCO is 0.0002 with a t-statistic of 0.657. When this equation was estimated using
IV-WLS the coefficient was o.ooo8 and the t-statistic 1.12.
IV.2 Outliers and Measurement Errors
       In order to investigate the robustness of these results, I performed a sensitivity
analysis: I checked for the possible undue influence of outliers, and I dealt with
measurement error.
       Outliers: In order to investigate the possible undue influence of outlier
observations, I computed Cook’s Influence distance test. The results point out towards
three potential outliers: Nicaragua, India and Ethiopia. When these countries were
excluded from the estimation, however, the results did not changed in any relevant way:
countries with a amore open capital account and countries that have liberalized capital
flows appear to have outperformed more isolationist nations.
       Errors in Variables: Even though Quinn’s indicators of capital account
restrictions are vastly superior that the more traditional ones – including the IMF-based
indexes used by Rodrik (1998) and others --, they are still an imperfect measure of the
“true” degree of capital mobility. In that sense, the estimation of equations (2) and (3)
are subject to a classical error-in-variables problem. The traditional, textbook solution to
this problem is to estimate the equation en question using instrumental variables. If the
“mis-measured” variable is properly instrumented, the estimated coefficient is consistent.
                                              14


In that sense, then, it is possible to argue that since the results reported above were
obtained with instrumental variables, the measurement problem has been properly
tackled.
       In the current case, however, the extent of measurement error is likely to be more
severe than the simple textbook case. Indeed in this case all independent variables are
(possibly) measured with error. Klepper and Leamer (1984) have shown that when
measurement error is generalized, it is possible to use a set of reversed regressions to
compute bounds for the coefficients of interest. These authors show that if there are no
changes in the pattern of coefficient signs when estimating the reversed regressions, the
“true” value of each coefficient will be bounded by the minimum and maximum
estimates from the set of reversed and direct regressions. If, on the other hand, there is a
change in the sign pattern of any of the coefficients, it is necessary to bring in additional
information to be able to bound the coefficients.
       Following Klepper and Leamer (1984) I estimated the reversed regressions
corresponding to equations (2) and (3), and analyzed the sign pattern of the coefficients.
Unfortunately, in each equation there were two sign changes, indicating that it is not
straightforward to bound the “true” coefficients. This suggests that the estimates reported
above are (somewhat) fragile. In order to address this issue further, I estimated the
critical minimal level for the R 2 between the dependent and the “true” (error free)
explanatory variable, that is consistent with a coefficients vector bounded by the original
orthant. For the TFP equation on capital account liberalization, this minimum value, or
Rm 2, is 0.57. This critical value is not completely unreasonable, indicating that, although
the estimated equations (2) and (3) are fragile – in the sense that the reversed regression
coefficients exhibit a sign switch --, it is possible to assume that their “true” values
correspond to those obtained in the direct regressions. In that sense, then, this analysis
provides some further support for the finding that, at least for the period under
consideration counties with a greater degree of integration with the rest of the world
performed better than more isolated nations.
IV.3 How Different are Emerging Countries?
       As pointed out in section I of this paper, one of the most important policy
questions – and one that is at the heart of recent debates on globalization – is whether the
                                              15


effects of globalization on economic performance is similar in advanced and in emerging
economies. In fact, according to many intellectually prominent global skeptics, capital
account liberalization is not bad per se,. The problem, in their view, is that the emerging
countries are unprepared for it. The problem is, according to this view, that the poor
nations do not have the required institutions to handle efficiently large movements of
capital. In this subsection I provide some preliminary results that address this issue. Due
to space considerations I concentrate on the case when the degree of capital account
openness is used as the independent variable. More specifically, I investigate whether the
effect of capital restrictions on growth depends on the country’s level of development. I
do this by adding the interactive independent variable (log GDPC * CAPOP) in the
estimation of equations (2) and (3). GDPC is GDP per capita in 1980. In this case,
equation (2) becomes:


(2’)           g j = α 0 + α 1 CAPOP j + α 2 (CAPOP j log GDPC j ) + α 3 human65 j +
                       + α 14 log GDPC65 j + ε j.


If coefficient α 2 is significant, the the total effect of capital openness on growth becomes
country-specific, and will be given by:


(3)            E j = α 1 + α 2 log GDPC j .


If α 2 is positive (negative), the effect of capital account openness on growth increases
(declines) with the level of development. Table 10 contains the results obtained from the
three stages least squares estimation of equations (2) and (3), with an added interactive
regressor. As may be seen, all the coefficients are significant at conventional levels.
More important, however, the coefficient of the interactive term (CAPOP j log GDPC j )
is positive, indicating that the effect of a more open capital account increases with the
initial level of development of the county. Furthermore, since the coefficient of the
openness index is negative, an open capital account may in fact have a negative effect at
very low levels of development.
                                              16


         A particularly important question is what is the average value of the total effect
coefficients (α 1 + α 2 log GDPC j) for industrial and emerging countries. In both
equations these averages were positive for the advanced nations and negative for the
emerging countries. The actual averages in the growth equation were (standard errors in
parentheses), 0.0075932 (0.0035522 ) for industrial countries and -0.0104921 (0
.0091007) for emerging nations. In the TFP growth equation the industrial average was -
0.0133434 (0.0083494), while the emerging markets average was -0.0133434
(0.0083494). Notice, however, that not every emerging country has a negative (α 1 + α 2
log GDPC j ) coefficient. In fact, in the case of the growth equation, the following
emerging countries had a positive “total effect” coefficient:


Israel
Venezuela
Hongkong
Singapore
Mexico.
V. Conclusions
         Although this analysis is preliminary, the results reported in this paper suggests,
quite strongly, that the positive relationship between capital account openness and
productivity performance only manifests itself after the country in question has reached a
certain degree of development. A plausible interpretation is that countries can only take
advantage, in the net, of a greater mobility of capital once they have developed a
somewhat advanced domestic financial market. I explored this interpretation by a term
that interacted the CAPOP index with standard measures of domestic financial
development, including the ratio of liquid liabilities in the banking sector to GDP and the
exchange rate black market premium. Broadly speaking, these results support the view
that while for financially sophisticated countries an open capital account is a boon, at
very low levels of local financial development a more open capital account may have a
negative effect on performance. In that sense, then, emerging markets are essentially
“different” from advanced nations.
