                                              ABSTRACT

The past decade has seen significant changes in the structure of the corporate lending market, with
non-commercial bank institutional investors playing larger roles than they historically have played.
In addition, non-commercial bank institutional lenders are often equity holders in their borrowing
firms. In our sample of 11,137 tranches of institutional “leveraged” loans, 2,008 (18%) have a non-commercial
bank institution that also owns at least 0.1% of the firm’s equity. Such “dual holder” loan tranches
have higher spreads than otherwise similar loan tranches without equity holder participation. The dual
holder premium is present for both revolver and term loans, and exists within all non-investment grade
credit rating classes. Contrary to risk-based explanations of this finding, dual holder tranches are priced
with premiums relative to other tranches of the same loan package. Dual holding premiums are higher
when the equity-holder’s stake is larger, when the dual-holder’s share in the loan is larger, and when
the equity holder is a hedge fund or a private equity fund. These premiums likely represent additional
compensation to dual holders for providing capital to firms when the firms are having difficulty raising
capital otherwise.

1. Introduction

         The past decade has seen significant changes in the structure of the corporate lending market,

with non-traditional lenders such as non-commercial bank institutional investors playing larger roles than

they historically have played. 1 Because institutional investors often have greater flexibility than

commercial banks in the type of assets they can hold, profitable opportunities arise from investing in

multiple securities issued by the same firm. For example, Ivashina and Sun (2011b) document that when

institutional investors lend to firms and trade in those firms’ equities, such trading tends to have

abnormally good performance. Another way in which an institutional investor can take advantage of

multiple investments in a firm’s securities is by lending to firms in which it is already an equity holder. In

this paper, we document the extent to which non-commercial bank institutional equity holders have

become increasingly important lenders to their firms, as well the way in which they are able to obtain

more superior terms than outside investors when they lend to their firms.

         To evaluate the way in which institutional equity holders are involved in the lending process, we

consider a sample of 11,137 tranches of institutional “leveraged” loans from the DealScan database,

originated between 1997 and 2007.2 We focus on the leveraged loan segment of the market because

institutional investors’ participation in the corporate lending market has been concentrated in this lower

quality, non-investment grade segment of the market.3 Of the 11,137 institutional leveraged loan tranches,

2,008 had the participation of an institutional lender that also held at least 0.1% of the firm’s equity

during the one-year period prior to the current loan origination. These “dual holders” can have meaningful


1
  We use the term “institutional” investor to refer to non-commercial banking institutions.
2
  The technical definition of leveraged loans varies by organization. For example, DealScan defines as leveraged
any loan with a credit rating of BB+ or lower and any unrated loan. Bloomberg defines leveraged loans as those
with spreads over LIBOR of 250 basis points (bp) or more. Standard & Poor’s deems loans with spreads over
LIBOR of 125 bp or more as leveraged loans. Thompson Financial denotes as leveraged loans, all those with an
initial spread of 150 bp or more before June 30, 2002, or 175 bp or more after July 2, 2002. We follow DealScan’s
classification of leveraged loans in this paper. By “institutional” loan facilities we mean loan facilities in which at
least one institutional investor is involved.
3
  The proportion of leveraged loans among loans classified as institutional loans by DealScan is about 90% during
the sample period. Similarly, Nandy and Shao (2010) find that 86.1% of institutional loans are leveraged loans with
the proportion increasing over the years during the period from 1995 to 2006. In our sample, the proportion of
leveraged loan facilities with institutional participation almost doubled during our sample period, from 38% in 1997
to 74% in 2007.


                                                          1
equity positions; of the 2,008 dual holder loan tranches in our sample, 493 had the participation of

institutional investor(s) with equity holdings of at least 3%, and 279 had the participation of institutional

investor(s) holding at least 5%. In addition, 106 loan tranches had the participation of equity-holding

hedge funds or private equity funds which held on average 4.3% of the borrowing firm’s equity.

           Theoretically, lending to a firm in which an investor already has an equity position is sub-optimal

from a diversification perspective. Therefore, to induce such an investor to lend to the firm, he must earn

more than the rate on comparable loans, or receive some other benefits to offset the loss of diversification.

Jiang, Li and Shao (2010) argue that one such benefit could arise if lending leads to common ownership

of equity and debt that could reduce future investment distortions arising from conflicts between

claimholders. A second possible benefit, arising from information asymmetries among potential lenders,

is that an equity holder’s lending to the firm could certify the firm’s quality and facilitate participation of

other institutions in the loan. Finally, firms or lead arrangers sometimes approach firm insiders, such as

institutional equity, investors to participate in loan facilities that are particularly important to the firm or

for which demand is relatively weak.4 In this case, by participating in the loan syndicate, the equity holder

would provide value by alleviating a financial constraint, and receive a premium return that represents his

compensation for providing capital when it is most valuable.

           To evaluate these explanations for institutional investors’ dual holdings of equity and debt, we

estimate the difference in all-in-drawn spreads between loan tranches in which dual holders invest, and

otherwise similar loan tranches. We first estimate the incremental effect of a tranche’s being held by an

institutional dual holder on the spread of that tranche. In doing so, we control for other factors that affect

the loan tranche’s spread, such as the firm’s risk measured by either firm-level accounting variables, or

the rating of the issuer, as well as the loan’s type (Term Loan A, Term Loan B, or Revolver) and other

tranche-specific characteristics.

           Our results indicate that loan facilities in which at least one institutional equity holder participates

have, on average, 13 basis-point higher spreads than otherwise identical loan facilities which is

4
    Throughout the paper, we use the terms “facilities’ and “tranches” interchangeably.


                                                           2
approximately 5% of the average total spread of 258 basis points. This premium exists for different types

of loan tranches: There is a 12 basis-point premium when dual holders invest in revolvers and a 16 basis-

point premium for term loans, both of which are economically significant and statistically significantly

different from zero. In addition, there are premiums associated with dual holders for loan tranches made

to issuers of each non-investment grade rating class, and the premiums are generally larger for lower-

rated issuers. For example, for loan tranches to issuers rated below CCC, the dual holder premium is

about 21 basis points compared to a 12 basis-point premium for BB-rated issuers.

        In computing these estimates of the dual holder premiums, we control for publicly observable

variables that could affect spreads. However, it is possible that dual holder premiums could reflect

unobservable heterogeneity across firms that is correlated with both the likelihood of a dual holder and

the all-in-drawn spreads on the loan tranches in which they invest. For example, suppose that an equity-

holder helps to arrange or to certify a loan at a time when the firm is having financial problems that

prevent it from receiving a loan from other lenders. In this case, it is likely that the borrowers’ true risk

would not be reflected in observable variables, so that the positive estimated premiums could reflect

compensation for risk that is unobservable to an outsider.

        To evaluate the possibility that the premiums to dual holders could reflect incremental risk

differences between dual holder loans tranches and other loan tranches, we estimate the effect of the dual

holder on the pricing of different tranches within the same loan. Different tranches of the same loan

package share the same underlying firm fundamentals and typically have the same seniority and hence

have the same default risk. Yet, they have different maturities, sizes and members of syndicate, so we

control econometrically for those differences in tranche-specific attributes when estimating our equations.

If the existence of a dual holder affects the relative spreads on different tranches of the same loan, it

cannot reflect a correlation between dual holders’ existence and a factor related to firm-level risk.

        The within-loan estimates indicate that when a dual holder participates in a Term Loan B tranche,

the tranche trades at a positive premium relative to Term Loan A tranches or revolvers of the same loan.

This positive premium is higher than that for non-dual holder Term Loan B tranches relative to other


                                                      3
tranches in their loans. In addition, when a dual holder purchases part of the revolver, the spread gap

between the Term Loan B tranche and revolver decreases, suggesting that ceteris paribus, dual holders

are able to invest in revolvers with higher spreads. Finally, we consider the cases in which a dual holder

invests in a Term Loan B facility and there is also another institutional Term Loan facility in the same

loan. In these cases as well, the one with the dual holder trades at a higher spread. These findings confirm

that particular tranches for which equity holders invest have higher spreads than otherwise similar

tranches, even holding borrower characteristics constant.

        The fact that the dual holder premium appears to be a function of the particular tranche in which

the equity holder participates suggests that the explanation for the premium is tranche-specific rather than

firm-specific. This finding is not consistent with arguments that dual holding reduces conflicts that

potentially increase the value of future investments, or that the dual holder’s presence signals something

about the firm’s quality. Rather, the tranche-specific nature of the dual holder premium favors the

argument that an equity holder participates in a particular loan tranche that is relatively difficult to obtain,

or for which the capital raised from the loan tranche is particularly important. This logic suggests that

equity holders are opportunistic lenders who provide capital to firms when it is most needed and receive

higher spreads in return for doing so.

        The idea that dual holder premiums can be explained by opportunistic lending implies that the

premiums should be larger when equity holders are most flexible in the type of investments they can

make, and when they have larger incentives to maximize the returns of their investments. Consequently,

we consider the way pricing of loan facilities varies with lender characteristics. First, we consider whether

the type of institutional investor affects the loan tranche pricing. In particular, private equity and hedge

funds tend to have substantial direct and indirect incentives to increase the returns of their investments, as

well as the freedom to make different kinds of investments relatively quickly without being subject to

restrictions faced by other institutional investors. Consequently, we expect private equity and hedge funds




                                                       4
to be the most likely investors to lend at relatively higher spreads.5 The empirical results are consistent

with this hypothesis; our estimates indicate that hedge funds and private equity funds loan facilities have

spreads that are 54 basis points higher than otherwise similar facilities that do not have a dual holding

institution. Facilities held by other funds who are equity holders have 28 basis point higher spreads, and

loans from other institutional equity holders have 6 basis-point spreads than comparable loans without

dual holding institutions. These findings suggest that the institutions managed by individuals with the

strongest incentives and most information about their firms receive the highest spreads when they lend to

firms.

           Second, we estimate whether the size of the dual holder’s equity position affects the loan

pricing. The results suggest that institutions with larger equity stakes receive higher interest rates when

they lend to their own companies. In particular, holding other things constant, institutions with higher

than average (2.6%) equity holdings receive a 20 basis-point premium over comparable non-dual holder

loan facilities, while institutions with less than average equity holdings receive a 11 basis-point premium.

When we consider both the type of the institution and size of the institution’s equity position together,

both characteristics affect the dual holding premium, although hedge funds and private equity funds’

loans tend to have particularly high spreads regardless of their equity ownership.

           Third, we estimate whether the size of the dual holder’s share of the loan affects the loan’s

pricing. Controlling for the size of the dual holder’s equity position, as well as firm and tranche

characteristics, our estimates indicate that the dual holder’s loan share is positively and statistically

significantly related to the loan tranche’s spread. They imply that a one-standard deviation increase

(12.5%) in dual loan share is associated with an 18 basis-point increase in the loan spreads.

           Finally, we consider the idea that if equity-holding lenders are paid premiums to invest in the

particular tranches in which dual holders participate, then these tranches should be for loans in which

5
  Hedge funds and private equity funds started to actively participate in corporate lending market starting in the mid-
1990s. According to HedgeFund.Net, there were more than 100 funds specializing in lending as of 2007. Large
funds are accelerating this trend by raising giant funds dedicated to loan investing; for example, the private equity
firm Blackstone Group started a $3 billion fund to invest in leveraged loans in 2011.



                                                          5
capital is particularly important for the borrowing firms. Therefore, we expect that these firms should

spend the capital they raise more quickly than when a dual holder does not participate. To evaluate this

hypothesis, we estimate equations similar to those in Kim and Weisbach (2008) that predict the fraction

of an incremental dollar raised that goes to alternative uses. Our estimates indicate that virtually none of

the capital raised from dual holder lenders is saved as cash, while between 19 and 28 cents from every

dollar raised by non-dual holder lenders is saved as cash. This difference is consistent with the notion that

dual holders receive a premium as compensation for participating in situation when raising capital quickly

is particularly important to the firm.

          Our findings are parallel those of Brophy, Ouimet, and Sialm (2009), who find that hedge funds’

equity investments are typically to firms that otherwise would have trouble raising capital. When making

equity investments, hedge funds typically negotiate discounts relative to the public stock price paid by

other investors, and earn abnormal returns because their purchases are at a discount. Thus, hedge funds

abnormal returns on private placements of equity can be thought of as the return to providing liquidity.

Our findings can be viewed similarly; we find that equity holders contribute to loan tranches in firms with

spreads that are relatively high. Since spreads are determined through an auction process, high spreads

that cannot be explained by risk and other firm and loan attributes mean that the tranche would have

relatively few investors or would have difficulties in fully subscribing absent the equity holder. Therefore,

we view dual holders’ incremental return as compensation that they receive in exchange for providing

liquidity to their firms in the tranche that is in less demand from other investors.

          Our paper is related to Jiang, Li, and Shao (2010), who also analyze the pricing of loans held by

equity-holding institutional investors. In contrast to our findings, these authors find that loans from

institutional equity holders have lower spreads than otherwise similar loans. The likely source of the

difference in findings between the two papers is the sample. In contrast to our sample that is made up

entirely of relatively risky leveraged loans, 51% of Jiang, Li and Shao’s sample are investment grade. If

we re-estimate the equations in our paper using only the institutional leveraged loan tranches in the Jiang,

Li and Shao sample and our definition of non-commercial institutional dual holders, we find a positive


                                                       6
spread premium similar to what we report in our paper.6 Consistent with this argument, we do not find the

dual holder premium for the subsample of issuers that have investment grade ratings (BBB or above). In

addition, Jiang, Li and Shao’s sample is somewhat earlier than ours in calendar time, and therefore likely

has fewer hedge fund and private equity funds as dual holders. Given that our findings suggest that these

institutions receive by far the highest spreads on their loan tranches, a sample like Jiang, Li and Shao’s

that does not contain as many hedge funds and private equity funds is likely to have smaller dual holder

spread premium than ours.

           The paper is also related to the literature on potential conflicts of interest that arise when

institutional investors engage in syndicated lending. Ivashina and Sun (2011b) and Massoud, Nandy,

Saunders, and Song (2011) focus on the trading of institutions that participate in syndicated lending, and

the associated potential conflicts of interest. Both papers find evidence that institutional investors in the

syndicated loan market exploit their access to private information when trading and earn abnormal returns

when they trade in the firm’s equities.

           The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data sources and sample. Section 3

discusses hypotheses about why equity holders might lend to their firms. Section 4 estimates the

differences in spreads between dual-holder loan tranches and comparable non dual-holder loan tranches.

Section 5 examines the impact of dual holder characteristics of the dual-holders on premiums. Section 6

considers the way in which the uses of funds differs between dual holder and non-dual holder borrowers,

and Section 7 concludes.

 We are extremely grateful to Wei Jiang, Kai Li and Peng Shao for sharing their sample and allowing us to
understand the differences in the results between the two papers. The estimated equations using the Jiang, Li and
Shao sample are available from the authors by request. The definition of dual investor used in our paper is somewhat
different from the one used in Jiang et al. (2010) in terms of both timing and size of equity holdings. To define a
dual holder, Jiang et al. (2010) measures the lender’s equity holding at the end of the quarter in which the loan is
originated, whereas we start from the list of shareholders during one year prior to the loan origination and then
examine whether any of these shareholders participated in the loan syndicate. Moreover, they consider only equity
holdings above 1.0% as dual holding, whereas we consider all holdings above 0.1%.

2. Data and Sample

2.1. Sample of Institutional Leveraged Loans

        We obtain a sample of leveraged loans with institutional participation from the Reuters Loan

Pricing Corporation’s (LPC) DealScan database for the 1997-2007 period. Leveraged loans are loans with

credit ratings of BB+ or lower or any unrated loan (see footnote 2). In a leveraged loan, term loans

tranches are often packaged together with revolver facilities. A term loan tranche is a loan tranche for a

specified amount, fixed repayment schedule and maturity, and usually fully funded at origination. In

contrast, revolvers typically have shorter maturities than term loan tranches and are not fully funded at the

origination of the loan syndicate. The Term Loan A tranche is a term loan that is usually amortizing, and

is typically held by the lead arranger. Institutional term loan tranches (Term Loan B, C, D, E, …) also can

amortize like Term Loan A tranches but are more often “bullet”, meaning that they have one payoff at

maturity.7

             We focus on leveraged loans because participation of institutional investors in this segment of

the loan market has been particularly pronounced, with institutions making up more than 70% of the

capital funding of these loans. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of institutional loans are

leveraged loans with the proportion increasing over time. We begin our sample in 1997 because major

developments in the market that fueled institutional involvement in the corporate loan market occurred in

1995 and 1996.8

             To construct the sample, we begin with all leveraged loans listed in DealScan made to non-

financial U.S. public firms and completed between 1997 and 2007, a total of 37,552 loan facilities. We

require that the data on deal value and dates not be missing. We additionally restrict the sample to the

  The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) was founded in 1995 and S&P first started rating bank
loans in 1995. In 1996, LSTA first started providing mark-to-market pricing (for dealers only). In addition, the
secondary market for syndicated loans became well established by mid-1990s: by the early 1990s specialized loan
trading desks were operating in a number of institutions led by Bankers Trust, Alex Brown, Bear Stearns, Citibank,
Continental Bank and Goldman Sachs. By 1997, about 25 institutions had active trading desks and there were two
inter-dealer brokers. These innovations spurred the fast growth of the syndicated loan market, which in turn fueled
institutional participation in the primary lending market. Moreover, there are very few leveraged loans before 1997,
as is documented in Figure 1.


                                                         8
most common type of tranches, where the type of instrument is either a line of credit (Revolver/Line, 364-

Day Facility, Demand Loan, Limited Line) or a term loan (Term Loan, Delay Draw Term Loan, Term

Loan A, B, …, H).9 We further restrict the sample to the borrowing companies for which we could match

to the Compustat database.10 Finally we exclude loans whose primary purpose is LBO financing, because

our goal is to study the way equity holders influence the lending environment in the corporate

environment. The above screening process results in a sample of 20,031 facilities associated with 13,122

loans made to 5,627 borrowing firms.

           We consider a loan facility to have institutional participation if at least one non-commercial

bank institutional investor is involved in the lending syndicate. Non-commercial bank institutions include

hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, pension funds and endowments, insurance companies,

financing companies, and investment banks. A narrower definition of institutional participation is if at

least one institutional investor plays a major role in the lending syndicate.11 We consider a lender to be a

commercial bank if it and/or its ultimate parent have major commercial banking operations. To

distinguish the identity of a lender between commercial banks and non-commercial bank institutional

investors, we rely primarily on DealScan’s information on lender type. We confirm this identification by

the lender’s primary SIC code and Investor Type code in Thompson Reuters Institutional Holding

Database.12 We also take into consideration the changes in the institutional type. So for example, JP

Morgan is classified as institutional lender before its merger with the Chase Manhattan Corp in 2000, and

JP Morgan Chase is coded as a commercial bank afterward. According to this classification, 1,137 of the

traded letters of credit, multi-option facilities, and undisclosed loans.

file, we also manually confirmed the matching between DealScan and Compustat.

   The lenders with the following roles are considered as the major participants: admin agent, agent , arranger, book
runner, co-agent, co-arranger, co-lead manager, co-manager, co-syndications agent, co-underwriter, collateral agent,
coordinating arranger, documentation agent, facility agent, issuing agent, joint arranger, L/C issuer, lead arranger,
lead manager, lead participant, manager, managing agent, mandated arranger, PRC agent, packager, paying agent,
reference agent, senior co-arranger, senior lead manager, senior manager, senior managing agent, sole lender,
syndication agent. We have estimated the equations reported in the paper using this narrower definition of
participation and get similar results to those reported below.
12
   A lender is classified as a commercial bank if its primary SIC code falls in 6011-6082 or 6712, or its Thompson
Financial institution type code equals one.

20,031 leveraged loan facilities in our sample had institutional participation, and 8,408 had major

participation by institutional lenders.

          Information about other loan- or facility-specific variables is also taken from DealScan.

Because loan tranches are almost always floating-rate, we use the all-in-drawn spread as a measure of

loan pricing. The all-in-drawn spread is the sum of the spread of the facility over LIBOR and any annual

fees paid to the lender group. DealScan also provides data on the facility’s size and maturity, the number

of investors participating in the lending syndicate, as well as information on whether the facility is senior,

secured, second-lien, syndicated, and the type of facility (revolver or term loan). We also consider the

firm’s lending relationship with the dual holding lenders and other lenders, by examining whether the

firm borrowed from the same lender previously.

          To identify whether the lender held equity stake in the borrower prior to the loan origination,

we create the list of shareholders of the borrowing company from Thompson Reuters Institutional

Holding Database (13F) for the one-year period leading up to the current loan, as well as the list of

lenders who are participating in the current loan. For example, for a loan originated in April 2000, we

create a list of equity holders using four 13F filings: filings for the quarters that end in June 1999,

September 1999, December 1999, and March 2000, respectively. An institutional investor’s equity stake

is measured as the average of the holdings that appear in these four filings. We focus on the equity stake

held by lenders prior to loan origination because we wish to evaluate the effect of holding an equity

position on the loan decision. We then match lender information from DealScan to the institutional

investors in the 13F by the lender’s name, and the lender’s ultimate parent’s name. We consider a loan

facility to be a dual-holder facility if at least one non-commercial bank institutional investor or its

ultimate parent participating in the loan syndicate also held an equity stake larger than 0.1% on average in

the same borrower during the one-year period prior to loan origination.

          We match the borrower’s and/or borrower’s parent name to the Compustat firm by a

combination of algorithmic matching and manual checking following Chava and Roberts (2008). Using

this matching procedure, we are able to obtain other firm-level variables from Compustat, CRSP, I/B/E/S,


                                                     10
13F, and SDC Platinum. The total number of loan facilities with institutional participation that have a full

set of data for the most recent prior fiscal year-end is 6,350.

2.2. Overview of Sample

           Table 1 provides statistics on the annual distribution of institutional loan facilities. This table

emphasizes increasing trend of institutional participation in the leveraged loan market. As Table 1 and

Figure 2 document, the portion of leveraged loans having institutional participation grew from 38% of

loan facilities in 1997 to 74% in 2007.

        The emergence of institutional investors in the leverage loan market has been accompanied by an

increase in institutional equity holders’ participation in loans. In our sample of leverage loan facilities,

2,008 loan facilities (18%) had institutional investors who were also equity holders of the firms. As the

last column of Table 1 and Figure 3 show, this phenomenon of dual holding also has increased over the

sample period from about 16% of the sample in 1997 to almost 24% of the sample in 2007.

        Table 2 presents summary statistics for both loan facilities and borrowing firms. The dual holders

have substantial equity stakes in the firms to which they lend, averaging 2.6% of the firm’s equity. The

sample average facility amount is $250 million, the average number of investors involved in a lending

syndicate is about nine, and the average maturity is about 52 months. Approximately 74% of facilities are

secured, 2% are second-lien, and roughly half are revolvers. Almost all loan facilities are senior debt

distributed in loan syndication.

           Not surprisingly, because the sample consists of leveraged loans, borrowers tend to be risky.

The average leverage, measured by book value of total debt to total assets ratio, of our sample firms is

67.1% and the median is 63.3%. In addition, the sample firms also exhibit relatively low Z-scores and

credit ratings (BB-rated on average). 13,14 Finally, these firms underperformed relative to their industry, as

indicated by a negative industry-adjusted ROA prior to the loan origination.



13
  “Z-score” is intended to be a negative function of bankruptcy probabilities. It is taken form Altman (1968) and
defined by: Z = 1.2 Working Capital / Total Assets + 1.4 Retained Earnings / Total Assets + 3.3 EBIT / Total Assets
+ 0.6 Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Total Liabilities T4 + 0.999 Sales/ Total Assets.

3. Why Would Equity Holders Lend to their Firms?

         All else equal, investors prefer to concentrate their lending in firms other than the ones for which

they have a substantial equity stake. Lending to a firm for which an investor has a substantial equity stake

increases the investor’s exposure to firm-specific shocks, which could be mitigated to some extent if the

investor were to lend to a comparable firm for which it does not have an equity stake. Therefore, to

induce an investor to lend to a firm for which it is an equity holder, its lending must lead to an additional

source of gains that offsets her loss of diversification.

         One potential source of such gains to a dual holder comes from aligning the interests of equity

holders and debt holders. Classic papers by Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Myers (1977) point out how

differences the incentives of equity holders and debt holders can lead to both underinvestment of value-

increasing projects and overinvestment of value-decreasing ones. Common ownership of debt and equity

potentially decreases conflicts of interest, improving the quality of the firm’s investments. Thus, the dual

holding of equity and debt by an institutional investor provides a channel which could lead to efficiency

gains. 15 If the improvement in investment efficiency arising from dual holding is larger than the

associated costs from sub-optimal diversification to the investor, as Jiang, Li and Shao (2010) argue, the

required return from dual holder loans is likely to be lower than that for similar non-dual holder loans.

Empirically, if dual holding occurs to increase investment efficiency, the incremental effect of dual

holding on spreads should be negative.

         Another way in which equity holders can create value by lending is if imperfections in capital

markets lead firms to face financial “constraints”, meaning that firms cannot borrow at the interest rate

reflecting the firms’ fundamental risks. When firms are constrained at a time when access to capital is

particularly important, equity holders, who internalize some of the value created by the positive NPV

14
   We use issuer ratings, not ratings for individual loans, because information on ratings for individual loans is often
missing. Therefore the sample includes 796 loans made to investment grade borrowers, despite the fact that all of
our loan facilities are classified as “leveraged”.
15
   However, Parrino and Weisbach (1999)’s simulations suggest that the magnitude of this effect is trivial unless the
firm is substantially more levered than the average public U.S. firm.


                                                          12
project, are potential sources of capital. If the equity holders receive a return commensurate to the firm’s

risk minus the fraction of the value created through the project belonging to the equity holders, then the

loans could be priced at a discount relative to comparable ones. However, if the equity holder receives

compensation for providing capital through lending when others are unwilling to, or is able to negotiate

rents because of their influence inside the firms, then it is possible that the loan tranches could be priced

at a premium. Since firms will only be willing to pay a premium to avoid financial constraints at times

when raising capital is particularly important, a prediction of this argument is that firms will spend the

capital from these loan tranches more quickly than the capital raised from other ones.16

        Finally, asymmetric information among potential lenders could potentially lead equity holders to

lend to the firm. By participating in the loan tranches themselves, insiders “certify” the quality of the firm,

and signal to other investors that the firm’s prospects are relatively good. We expect that the certification

argument leads to dual holdings at relatively risky-looking firms, and that the loan tranches should trade

at a premium to otherwise comparable loan tranches, since they were the ones that required certification

in the first place. In addition, to induce the equity holder to certify the quality of a loan that is undesirable

from a diversification perspective, the loan tranche is likely to require a premium over comparable loan

tranches that are more desirable to the equity holder.

        Overall, there are several reasons why equity holders would choose to lend to their firms despite

the diversification costs they face from doing so. Equity holders receive a portion of value created

through better real investments, which could potentially be improved by reducing conflicts between

equity and debt holders, and also by providing capital to firms when they face financial constraints.

Theoretically, such capital could be priced at either a discount or a premium: A discount would occur if

equity holders internalize some of the value created and a premium if the equity holder receives


16
  An interesting issue is why an equity holder would lend through a syndicated loan rather than through a private
placement. In practice, equity holders, especially hedge funds and private equity funds, do lend to firms in which
they hold equity positions, sometimes through affiliated mezzanine funds. These loans are generally at relatively
high interest rates and contain substantial control rights; however the positions are private so it is impossible to
quantify their magnitude. Involving an equity holder in a syndicated loan can be thought of as an intermediate way
of involving the equity holder without paying the larger premium associated with a private placement of debt.


                                                        13
compensation and/or rents from providing capital when it is most needed. In addition, if equity holder

participation is necessary to certify the quality of a deal, the equity holder should receive some sort of

compensation for being under-diversified, so in this case, we expect the loans to trade at a premium.



4. Differences between Dual Holder Loans and Non-Dual Holder Loans

4.1. Differences in Characteristics

         Table 3 summarizes the univariate differences between the 2,008 dual holder and 9,129 non-dual

holder loan tranches in our sample. Dual holder tranches are somewhat less likely to be revolvers than

non-dual holder loans, but revolvers still make up more than half the dual holder sample (52.3%). The

other loan tranches in both samples are term loans. Both samples have roughly the same proportion of

Term Loan A facilities (between 6 and 7 percent), while dual holder facilities are more likely to have a

larger fraction (41.3%) of Term Loan B facilities than non-dual holder facilities (37.4%).17

         Within a sample of institutional leveraged loan facilities, the dual holder facilities tend to be less

risky than non-dual holder facilities. A much higher proportion of borrowers of dual holder loan facilities

have ratings than borrowers of non-dual holder loan facilities (82.5% vs. 51.6%). Of the borrowers that do

have ratings, dual holder borrowers’ ratings tend to be higher. For example, of the dual-holder loan

facilities with issuer ratings, 34% have a B rating or lower, compared to 48% of the non-dual holder loan

facilities. Also indicative of dual holder facilities having lower risk is the fact that dual holder facilities

are substantially larger than non-dual holder loans ($461 million versus $212 million). Finally, dual

holder loan facilities tend to have more participating lenders (14 versus 8), to have somewhat longer

maturity, and are less likely to be secured or second-lien than non-dual holder loans.
17
   We treat tranches with B or higher designations (e.g. C, D, etc.) as Term Loan B since all of them are marketed to
institutional investors. Moreover, about one-third of the term loans in our sample has no letter designation but is just
called ‘Term Loan’. In all reported tables, we treat these undesignated term loans as Term Loan B. We do so
because the facility attributes, such as the spread and payment schedule, of the unlabeled Term Loans in our sample
appear to be more like the Term Loan B’s than the Term Loan A’s. Detailed comparisons of attributes across
different tranche types are provided in Appendix B. In addition, when a tranche is first launched and appears in the
‘Calendar’, which is the weekly record of outstanding loans published by Reuters Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC),
often its type is originally described as “Term Loan”, but ultimately is classified in DealScan “Term Loan B”, or
vice versa. We have re-estimated all equations reported in the paper treating unclassified term loans separately and
all results are similar to those reported below.


                                                          14
        Table 4 reports selected statistics on the types of institutional investors who are dual holders.

Column (1) reports the number of loan facilities with each type of institutional dual holder.18 Over 60% of

the dual holder loan facility sample has an investment banker as a dual holder, while only 5.3% of the

sample has as a hedge fund or private equity fund as a dual holder. As Column (4) shows, most of the

participation by hedge funds or private equity funds (over 75%) is in Term B Loan tranches. Loan

participating mutual funds also participate more often in Term B loan tranches, while other institutional

dual holders such as investment bank and finance company participate more frequently in revolvers

(about 60%). The equity stakes by institutional dual holder also varies by institutional type; Column (7)

reports the average equity stake by type and shows that hedge funds and private equity funds tend to have

the largest holdings, with an average of 4.3%.

4.2. Differences in Spreads

        The goal of this paper is to understand the motives underlying equity holders’ investments in loan

tranches to the companies in which they have equity investments. One possibility is that they are able to

earn additional compensation by lending to these firms because of an information advantage, enabling

them to lend in situations where spreads are higher than usual. Alternatively, as suggested by Jiang, Li

and Shao (2010), having an equity position creates an extra motive for equity holders to lend, since doing

so potentially reduces conflicts of interest, and also could increase the value of their equity stake by

facilitating valuable investments. This argument implies that lending to a firm could be sufficiently

desirable to an equity holder that we could observe them lending at lower rates than other investors.

        To evaluate these alternative hypotheses, we estimate equations predicting the interest rate on a

particular loan facility. Because the loans in our sample are floating rate with LIBOR as their index, we

estimate equations predicting the “All-in-Drawn Spread”, which is the spread of the loan facility over

LIBOR plus any annual fees that the borrower must pay the lenders. Our goal is to estimate the




18
  The column sums to 2,399, not 2,008, because a loan can have more than one type of institutional investor as a
dual holder.


                                                        15
incremental effect of a dual holder on the spread, holding other factors that could affect the spread

constant. Therefore we estimate the following equation:

                     All - in - drawn      Dual Holder Indicator    X                           (1)

where X is a vector of covariates that include facility- and firm-specific control variables. The control

include the facility amount, the number of participating lenders and the lenders’ past relationships with

the firm, the maturity of the facility, whether the facility is secured or second-lien, whether the loan has

covenants, as well as the borrowing firm’s size and its ratio of fixed to total assets. Definitions of all

variables are provided in the Appendix A.

        The loan facilities are generally either revolvers or term loans. The term loans are of two types,

Term Loan A facilities, which are usually syndicated to banks, or Term Loan B facilities (sometimes

labeled just “Term Loan”), which are typically structured for institutional investors. Since each type of

tranche usually has a different spread, it is important to control for differences in type of tranche when

estimating these types of equations.

        A key factor in determining the spread on a loan facility is its default risk. The majority (82.5%)

of the firms in our sample have issuer credit ratings at the end of fiscal year prior to the loan origination.

The credit ratings presumably reflect the risk of the issuer as assessed by professionals around the time

the loan is issued. However, relying solely on credit ratings to measure risk necessitates dropping loans to

firms that do not have ratings. Therefore, we present specifications using issuer credit ratings as a

measure of risk for the loan facilities for which credit ratings are available, as well as equations using the

Z-Score and leverage to control for default risk for the larger sample that includes loan facilities without

credit ratings.

        We present the OLS coefficient estimates of Equation (1) and the corresponding p-values on the

full sample in Table 5, and on the sub-sample with credit ratings in Table 6. Each equation includes

tranche-type fixed effects, tranche-purpose fixed effects, and year fixed effects, and reported standard

errors are clustered by borrower.




                                                     16
         Column (1) of Table 5 presents estimates of Equation (1) using all observations for which all

required data are not missing (6,350 loan facilities). In this column, the coefficient on the institutional

dual holder indicator variable is 13.4, and is statistically significantly different from zero. This coefficient

indicates that holding other things constant, loan facilities with institutional dual holder participation have

spreads that are 13.4 basis points higher than other loan facilities. This spread difference is relatively large,

given the average spread of 257.5 basis points, so the estimated dual holder premium equals 5.2% of the

total spread.

         The coefficients on the remaining variables, which control for other factors that potentially affect

spreads, are consistent with the notion that spreads are a function of borrower and loan risk. Larger loan

facilities with more participants, especially when the participants have past relationships with the

borrowers, tend to be less risky and have lower spreads. Secured and second-lien facilities tend to be

more risky, and hence have positive coefficients. 19 Z-Score has a negative coefficient and leverage a

positive one, suggesting that riskier firms have higher spreads, and profitability in the form of industry-

adjusted ROA, not surprisingly, lowers spreads. We also control for market-wide risk premia by including

the high-yield credit spread, measured as the gap between the spread on AAA loan index and the spread

on BB loan index in the month of loan origination. Not surprisingly, since our sample is relatively riskly

leveraged loans, the high yield spread is positively related to the all-in-drawn spread.

         In Column (2) of Table 5, we present estimates of Equation (1) for the subsample of revolvers, in

Column (3) for all term loans, and in Column (4) for only the Term Loan B facilities. In each column, the

coefficient on the institutional dual holder indicator variable is positive and statistically significantly

different from zero. For revolvers, the coefficient on the dual holder indicator variable implies that loans

from dual holders have 12.0 basis point higher spreads than other loans. For all term loans pooled

(Column (3)), the premium is 16.5 basis points, and for just Term Loan B facilities, it is 17.7 basis points.

These results imply that there is a positive premium for different types of loan facilities.

19
  Security by itself lowers the risk of a loan. However, secured loans tend to be issued by younger, riskier firms
with lower cash flows, so the positive relation with spreads likely reflects this additional risk. See Berger and Udell
(1990) and Erel, Julio, Kim, and Weisbach (2012).


                                                         17
        In these equations, we control for default risk based on accounting measures such as leverage and

the firm’s Z-Score. An alternative way of controlling for risk is to use the issuer’s credit rating. Since

credit ratings are constructed to measure firms’ comprehensive default risk, it is likely a preferable

approach. However, credit ratings are not available for all firms, so the use of credit ratings is limited to

those firms that have them.

        Table 6 presents coefficient estimates of Equation (1) for different credit ratings (Columns (1)

through (5)) and for issuers of no credit ratings (Column (6)). Column (1) contains estimates for all

facilities from issuers with credit ratings, including indicator variables for different rating categories.

Columns (2), (3), (4), and (5) present estimates for BBB and above rated firms, BB-rated firms, B-rated

firms, and CCC and below rated firms, respectively. As in Table 5, we include control variables for

tranche and firm characteristics, tranche-type, tranche-purpose and year fixed effects. The reported

standard error estimates are clustered by borrower.

        In each column in Table 6, except Column (2), the coefficient on the dual holder indicator

variable is positive and statistically significantly different from zero. For all firms with ratings (Column

(1)), the estimates indicate that there is about an 11.0 basis point premium for dual holder facilities. This

premium rises with the risk of the firms: It is an insignificant 5.8 basis points for firms rated BBB and

higher, 12.0 basis points for BB-rated firms, 17.4 basis points for B-rated firms and 21.0 basis points for

firms with ratings lower than CCC. In addition, for firms without ratings, there is a positive but not

significant premium of 9.1 basis points to dual holders. These estimates suggest that this positive

premium to equity holders who lend to their firms increases with the firm’s default risk.

4.3. Do the Dual Holder Spread Premiums Reflect Unobservable Heterogeneity?

        One possible interpretation of the results in Tables 5 and 6 is that there is some sort of

heterogeneity that is unobservable to an outsider, but affects both the likelihood that an equity holder

lends to the firm and also the spreads on the loans in which the dual holder participates. A potential

source of such heterogeneity is the unobservable risk of the firms. If dual holders are more likely to lend

in situations in which ratings understate true risks, then the premiums would reflect risk rather than


                                                      18
liquidity provision. A second potential source would be if dual holders are less likely to have covenants or

other restrictions in their loan facilities, and the spread premium represents compensation to the lenders

for having fewer rights than other lenders.20 If equity holdings strengthen the relationship between lender

and borrower, they could act in a similar manner to lending relationships and affect the optimal number of

covenants to use in a loan.21

        A method of measuring dual holder premiums that is unlikely to be affected by such unobserved

firm heterogeneity comes from the relative pricing of different tranches within the same loan.22 Since

each tranche of a multiple tranche loan has the same seniority and covenants, the default risk of tranches

and the creditor rights attached to the tranches in the same loan is essentially the same. Different tranches

in the same loan will generally have different maturities and implicit options from one another that will

affect their pricing. However, once these other differences are controlled for econometrically, the

incremental effect of a dual holder on the relative pricing of tranches within a given loan should reflect

the dual holder’s impact. This approach will not be affected by unobservable firm-level heterogeneity

causing a spurious relation between the dual holder’s existence and the firm’s risk.

        Within-loan estimates can also help to distinguish between alternative explanations for the dual-

holder premiums. Factors that affect firm-level value such as a change in ownership that is likely to

reduce future conflicts between equity and debt holders, and/or a signal to the market that the quality of

the firms’ assets is high, should affect the spreads on all tranches of the loan similarly. In contrast, a

systematic difference in the relative spread between different tranches that is a function of whether an

equity holder participates in that tranche has to be a function of tranche-level rather than firm-level factors.

One such possibility would be if different types of tranches have different liquidity and demand. For



20
   Bradley and Roberts (2004) and Reisel (2010) estimate that, holding other factors constant, additional covenants
lower the equilibrium interest rate paid by borrowers.
21
   The relation between lending relationships or equity holdings and covenant use is not clear theoretically. In
principle, they could lower the marginal cost of monitoring and lead to more covenants, or increase the ability of
lenders to extract rents through covenants, leading to fewer covenants. Prilmeier (2011) develops these hypotheses
in the context of lending relationships and finds empirical support suggesting both effects are important.
22
   This approach was developed by Ivashina and Sun (2011a) and was recently adopted by Nadauld and Weisbach
(2011).


                                                        19
example, commercial banks, typically the lead arrangers, hold the Term Loan A portion of the loan and

sell the Term Loan B portion to non-commercial bank institutional investors. If the lead arranger is

worried about being able to sell a particular Term Loan B tranche it can increase the spread, probably

above the reservation price of equity holders, leading an institutional equity-holder to purchase part of

that tranche. In this case, the dual holders are likely to receive an unusually high spread, measured relative

to the Term Loan A tranche of the same loan.

           To estimate the incremental effect of a dual holder on the differences in spreads between tranches

of a given loan, we estimate the following equation:

          Spread Gap     Dummy indicatingwhich tranche the dual holder bought  γ  X              (2)

where X includes differences in tranche-specific characteristics such as facility size, the number of

participating lenders, maturity, and whether the tranche is secured by collateral, as well as firm-level

characteristics and market-wide high-yield spread. The dependent variable in this equation is the

difference between the spreads of different tranches within the same loan. The indicator variable denoting

which tranche the dual holder bought measures the incremental effect on the spread gap of the dual

holder’s existence, and the control variables are intended to capture other differences between the

tranches. We estimate these equations on the sample of loans that have multiple tranches of the type

considered in that specification.23

           Column (1) of Panel A of Table 7 presents estimates of Equation (2) for the subsample of 227

loans that have both Term Loan A and Term Loan B tranches. In this subsample, it was more common for

the dual holder to participate in the Term Loan B portion of the loan than the Term Loan A portion: Of

the 227 loans, there were 37 in which the dual holder participated in the Term Loan B tranche and only

one in which he participated in the Term Loan A tranche. For this reason, we estimate the incremental

effect of an equity holder participating in the Term Loan B portion of the loan.




23
     We exclude cases in which dual holders exist in both types of tranches.


                                                           20
        Term Loan B tranches tend to have a longer effective maturity than Term Loan A tranches

because the majority of Term Loan B tranches are bullet while the majority of Term Loan A tranches are

amortizing (see Appendix B). With a longer duration, Term Loan B tranches will have higher spreads

regardless of whether there is a dual holder participating in the tranche. The hypothesis that dual holders

are able to invest in the most attractive tranche implies that there should be an additional premium over

the corresponding Term Loan A tranche for the Term Loan B tranches in which they invest. The

coefficient estimates indicate the presence of a dual holder in the Term Loan B portion increases the

difference in spreads between Term Loan B and Term Loan A tranches by 11.9 basis points. However,

because of the relatively small number of cases with both tranche types present, the difference is not

statistically significant at conventional levels.

        There are 1,055 loans in our sample that have both a Term Loan B tranche and a revolver. Of

these 1,055 cases, equity holding institutions participated in 71 of the Term Loan B tranches and five of

the revolvers. We estimate Equation (2) on this subsample of loans, considering the effect of the dual

holder purchasing the Term Loan B tranche in Column (2) and the effect of the dual holder purchasing the

revolver in Column (3). The dependent variable in these equations is the difference in spreads between

the Term Loan B tranche and the revolver. Therefore, the coefficient estimate of 28.3 on the dual holder

variable in Column (2) implies that the spread between Term Loan B tranches and revolvers is by 28.3

basis points higher when a dual holder is present in Term Loan B. Similarly the coefficient estimate of -

26.2 in on the dual holder variable in Column (3) implies that the spread difference is 26.2 basis points

lower in the small number of cases in which the dual holder participates in the revolver. These estimates

suggest that dual holders are more likely to participate in whichever tranche has the highest spread

holding other factors constant.

        A potentially cleaner test of the hypothesis that dual holders are able to invest in the most

attractive tranches comes from cases in which the dual holder invests in one of multiple tranches of the

same type in a particular deal. Our sample contains 100 such tranches, coming from 50 loans. In Panel B

of Table 7 we estimate equations similar to Equation (1) on this subsample of loans. In Column (1) we


                                                    21
present estimates of Equation (1) without controlling for firm-level characteristics, since each pair of

loans share the same firm-level fundamentals. In Column (2), we report estimates when controlling for

firm-level characteristics to further deal with the possibilities that cross-sectional variation in firm

characteristics across different pairs matters. Again, the coefficient estimate on the dual holder indicator

variable is positive and statistically significantly different from zero, implying between a 30.7 and a 36.1

basis point premium to dual holders.

        Finally, there are 322 cases in which a borrower issues two of the same tranche type in the same

year, but not necessarily in the same deal. We re-estimate the equation for this subsample in Column (3)

and (4) of Panel B of Table 7. For this subsample, the coefficient estimate is statistically significant and

implies a positive dual holder premium of between 13.7 and 14.9 basis points.

        Overall the results from Table 7, in which we compare tranches within a given loan, or across

similar tranches from the same borrower within a short period of time, are consistent with the results in

Table 6 that are based on comparisons across different loans. When an equity holding institution lends to

the firm, it receives a premium on the particular tranche in which it chooses to participate. These

premiums do not appear to be a result of unobserved heterogeneity across tranches in terms of their risk,

or in terms of the rights of lenders through protective covenants.



5. Dual Holder Characteristics and Spreads

        The within-loan results suggest that the dual holder premiums occur because of tranche-specific

and not firm-specific factors. The most plausible explanation is that tranches in which equity holders

participate appear to be relatively more difficult to market than the ones in which they do not participate.

When institutional equity holders are relatively flexible in making their investment decisions, they can

lend to a firm fairly quickly and are able to earn compensation for providing capital in these

circumstances. This explanation implies that the types of institutions that are most flexible and can lend to

a firm under these circumstances are most likely to earn premiums. In addition, when an institutional

investor’s personal incentives are strongest, he is most likely to seek out investment opportunities with


                                                     22
relatively high returns. Finally, when an investor owns a larger share of the firm’s equity ownership, he is

likely to be more influential or have more information inside the firm, and thus more able to earn

premium by lending to it. We evaluate these predictions empirically in this section.

5.1. The Type of Institutional Dual Holder.

        As documented in Table 4, there are a number of different types of institutional investors that

invest in loan tranches. If institutional investors’ incentives and their flexibility to make different kinds of

investments relatively quickly are factors that lead to larger dual holder premiums, then we would expect

hedge funds and private equity funds to be associated with relatively high premiums. Hedge funds and

private funds provide very large direct and indirect incentives to their managers and are relatively

unrestricted in the types of investments they can make.24 Other asset managing funds also have strong

pecuniary incentives, albeit not as strong as hedge fund and private equity fund managers. However, their

investments are more often subject to various kinds of restrictions (e.g. diversification requirement).

Finally, other institutions such as financing companies, investment banks and insurance companies tend

to have lower monetary incentives than the other groups that are directly related to loan pricing. For

example, insurance companies tend to focus on ensuring that their loan portfolio has the right term

structure and risk profile, rather than seeking out unusual opportunities to achieve abnormal returns.

Investment banks in our sample are often take the role of security broker whose major sources of profit

consist of not only loan spreads, but also fees they receive in exchange for providing services to the

borrower and other members of syndication.25

        In Column (1) of Table 8, we re-estimate Equation (1) with the dual holders broken down by the

type of institution. To do so, we include separate indicator variables for hedge funds and private equity


24
   General partners of private equity and hedge funds receive direct incentives through carried interest that usually
equals 20% of profits. In addition, they receive indirect incentives because their performance affects their future
incomes. These indirect incentives are likely to be of similar magnitude as the direct incentives. [See Chung,
Sensoy, Stern and Weisbach (2012) for estimates for private equity funds and Lim, Sensoy and Weisbach (2012) for
estimates for hedge funds.]
25
   One concern about the dual holding investment banks is that it is possible that the equity and debt positions are
controlled by different parts of the bank, and consequently have virtually nothing to do with one another. It is
impossible to tell from our data exactly which part of the bank is controlling each investment. This issue is another
reason why we estimate the premiums separately by type of dual holder in this section.


                                                        23
funds, other funds, and other institutional investors. The coefficient estimates indicate that the premium is

substantially larger for hedge and private funds than for other types of funds. The coefficient on the

indicator variable for hedge and private equity funds is 53.7, indicating that when these funds lend to their

firms, they receive a 53.7 basis point premium over other non-dual holder facilities. The regression

coefficients also indicate that other fund dual holders have a 27.7 basis point premium over other

investors, while other institutional dual holders have just a 6.4 basis point premium. This pattern indicates

that the type of institution clearly matters in the premium the dual holders receive when they lend. Hedge

and private equity fund managers have substantially larger pecuniary incentives than other investors; they

also receive better interest rates when they lend to their firms.

        Column (2) of Table 8 includes indicator variables for each un-grouped type of institutional dual

holder. Again, similar to the results in Columns (1), the coefficient estimates indicate that the type of

institutional investors matters. The coefficient estimate on the hedge fund and private equity fund

indicator variable is 36.9, while the coefficient estimates on the mutual funds and finance company dual

holder indicator variables are 22.5 and 12.1, respectively. The coefficient estimates on other types of dual

holders are not statistically significant or large in magnitude.

        Columns (3) and (4) of Table 8 re-estimate this equation using just the loan facilities in which the

dual holders have participated, omitting the “Other institutional dual holder” variable from the equation in

Column (3), and the “Pension fund/CDO dual holder” variable in Column (4). Again, the hedge funds and

private equity funds have a largest premium relative to other institutional dual holders (33.5 to 44.8 basis

points). The other funds also do have a premium relative to the other institutions (16.4 basis points);

however, it is substantially smaller than the premium for hedge and private equity funds. These results are

consistent with hedge fund and private equity funds receiving the largest premiums relative to other loan

participants when they lend to firms in which they hold equity positions.

5.2. The Size of Dual Holder Equity Ownership.

        The extent to which institutional equity holders invest in loan facilities that have relatively high

spreads also depends on the extent to which their equity position affords them informational or strategic


                                                      24
advantage inside the borrowing firm. Larger equity ownership implies that the investor will share a larger

fraction of the gains created through a value-increasing loan, but also potentially increases the

institution’s ability to facilitate participation in the most attractive tranches. To evaluate the extent to

which equity ownership influences their lending to their firms, we estimate the effect of the size of the

equity ownership on the dual holder premium.

        To do so, we re-estimate Equation (1) using two dual holder indicator variables, one of which

measures that there is a dual holder with less than average (2.6%) equity holdings and the other which

indicates that there is a dual holder with above average holdings. Columns (1) - (4) of Table 9 contain

coefficient estimates for different types of tranches. The coefficients on these indicator variables represent

the premiums for dual holders with small and large stakes for all tranche types, revolvers, all term loans,

and only Term B facilities, respectively.

        The premiums for large shareholdings range from 20.4 to 21.9 basis points, and the premiums for

small shareholdings range from 8.5 to 15.8 basis points. For each type of tranche, the premium is higher

for above average shareholdings than for below average shareholdings. This pattern indicates that dual

holding premiums, in addition to being affected by the type of institution, are increasing in the equity

ownership of the institution.

        It is possible that these size effects are related to the type of institutional investor, since private

equity funds and hedge funds have the largest premiums and also tend to have the largest holdings (4.3%

compared to 2.5% for other dual holders). Therefore, we re-estimate this equation using separate controls

for whether the dual holder is a hedge fund or private equity fund, and how this is affected by the fund’s

equity ownership. The results, presented in Column (5) of Table 9, indicate that the largest effect is the

type of the fund, rather than the ownership of the fund. Hedge and private equity funds with small equity

ownership stakes have a 38.2 basis point premium and those with large ownership stakes have a 46.0

basis point premium. These premiums are substantially larger than the 8.6 basis point and 17.1 basis point

premiums for small and large shareholdings of non-hedge or private equity fund institutions.




                                                     25
5.3. The Proportion of the Loan Held by Dual Holders

         If the dual-holder premiums represent compensation to equity holders for lending to the

borrowing firms, then, within the sample of dual holder loans, this compensation should be higher when

the firm would have had difficulties funding this particular facility absent the presence of dual holders.

An additional prediction of this argument is that the spread should be higher when the dual holder

provides a larger portion of the loan tranche. To evaluate this hypothesis, we estimate equations

predicting the spread on a particular loan tranche as a function of the dual holder’s loan share, as well as

the control variables we have used throughout the paper. Data on the share of the loan contributed by each

lender is available for only 301 dual holder loan tranches.26 We present estimates of the way the spread is

affected by the dual holder’s contribution on this sample in Table 10.

         The estimates indicate that larger positions in the loan are associated with larger spreads. The

coefficient on the dual holder’s share in the base-case specification (Column (1)) is 147.5, which is

statistically significantly different from zero. This coefficient implies that for each additional percentage

point of dual holder loan ownership, the spread increases by 1.47 basis points, or that for one standard

deviation increase in loan share (12.5%, see Table 2), the spread increases by 18.4 basis points. Since it is

possible that loan share is correlated with a lender’s equity ownership, we include a variable indicating

whether the equity ownership is above the mean ownership of 2.6% in Column (2) of Table 10. The

results indicate that consistent with the results reported in Table 9, having above average equity

ownership leads to a 17.7 basis-point increase in spreads; however the coefficient on the dual holder’s

loan share is essentially unchanged. Finally, in Columns (3) and (4) of Table 10, we replace the dual

holder’s loan share with a variable indicating whether the dual holder is the largest lender. The results

reported in these columns indicate that a dual holder being the largest lender increases the spread by about

20 basis points. Overall, it appears that the size of the lender’s share has a statistically significant and

economically important effect on the tranche’s spread.


26
  Our test here is restricted on a sample of dual holder loans, since non-dual holder loans, by definition, do not have
any dual holder loan share.


                                                          26
6. The Uses of Funds

        The analysis so far suggests that the dual-holding premiums are most consistent with a story in

which equity holders provide capital for tranches that are particularly hard to fund, and receive

compensation for doing so in the form of a higher spread. Such premium will be even higher, if this hard-

to-fund facility is also particularly important to the firm. The idea is that, if it is difficult to raise a specific

tranche, firms will pay additional compensation for an equity holder to participate, provided that the

capital has a valuable use that cannot be delayed to a point in time in the future when capital markets are

potentially more liquid and it is unnecessary to pay an additional premium to acquire capital. This

argument predicts that firms borrowing from dual holders will spend a higher proportion of the raised

cash relatively quickly, rather than saving it as additional cash.

        We test this prediction by estimating models similar to those in Kim and Weisbach (2008) that

predict the uses of the funds raised in a particular time period following the capital raising. In particular,

we estimate the following equation:

                                                                                                         t

assets0]+1] for V = capital expenditure, acquisition, R&D, and long-term debt reduction, and t=1, 2, 3, 4

quarters subsequent to the loan issuance quarter.

        We present estimates of Equation (3) in Table 11. We present the coefficient estimates for β1 and

β2 for the sake of brevity. Each row of this table represents a regression predicting a different possible use

of the capital that is raised in a specified time period. For example, the top row predicts the change in cash


                                                         27
during the first quarter following the capital raising, the second, the change in cash during the four

quarters following the capital raise, and the third row the change in cash during the eight quarters

following the capital raising. In the first row, the positive coefficient on β1 means that a portion of capital

raised is used to increase cash holdings in the first quarter following a loan. However, the negative

coefficient on β2 implies that the fraction of loan used to increase cash holdings is smaller for firms that

raised capital through at least one dual holder tranches. The final two columns transform the coefficients

into the predicted quantity of cash saved from an additional dollar raised by a median-sized firm.27 These

estimates suggest that, depending on the window used to measure the change in cash holdings, cash

increases at non-dual holder firms by between 20 and 29 cents for every dollar raised, while at dual holder

firms, the increase is only between 1 and 3 cents for every dollar raised.

         The implication of these results is that firms with dual holder lenders appear to spend virtually all

of the capital they raise, while firms with non-dual holder lenders save between 20 and 29 cents of each

dollar raised as cash. The remaining rows of Table 11 attempt to gauge the types of use for which dual

holder firms tend to use the cash. These estimates are somewhat inconclusive, with total assets increasing

and long-term debt is reducing at all sample firms, with a somewhat larger effect for firms using dual

holder lenders. Nonetheless, these results suggest that firms with dual holder lenders spend the capital

they raise more quickly than non-dual holder firms, consistent with the view that capital raising was

particularly important at the firms that had equity-holder participation in their loans.




27
  The calculations are based on a median-sized firm in the sample using Year and Quarter fixed effects for 3Q2003.
For example, the dollar changes in cash for t=1 is calculated as follows: Median loan proceeds are 150 and median
total assets prior to the loan issuance are 790. The estimates for β2 and β3 are 0.063 and 0.001, respectively, and the
constant term reflecting 3Q2003 is 0.007. Using these numbers together with coefficients from Table 11 yields a
predicted change of 40.37 in cash for non-dual holder lenders and a predicted change of 62.54 in cash for dual
holder lenders. Then we add one to median loan proceed and repeat the above procedure, which results in a
predicted change of 40.57 for non-dual holder lenders and 62.55 for dual holder lenders. The difference in the two
predicted changes represents the dollar change in cash for one unit increase in loan proceed, which equals 0.20 for
non-dual holder lenders and 0.01 for dual holder lenders.

7. Conclusion

        Participation by equity-holding institutions has become a major part of the syndicated loan

market. In our sample of 11,137 institutional “leveraged” loan tranches between 1997 and 2007 from the

DealScan database, 2,008 (18%) have participation by a “dual holder” institution that owns at least 0.1%

of the borrowing firm’s equity. Lending to firms in which one has an equity position goes against the

principle of diversification, since it exposes the investor to firm-specific shocks through both its equity

and debt ownership. To justify dual holding, the investor must receive compensation of some sort, either

through the improvements in the value of its equity holdings, or by above market rates of return on the

loan.

        We estimate the abnormal return a dual holder receives by comparing spreads on dual holder

tranches to those on observationally equivalent tranches that do not have a dual holder. Our estimates

indicate, holding all else equal, that loan tranches with dual holder participation receive a 13 basis-point

higher spread than otherwise similar tranches without an equity holder’s participation in the lending

syndicate. The positive spread is statistically and economically significant for revolvers as well as term

loans, and for loans to borrowers of different ratings and to unrated borrowers as well.

        It is possible that the equity holding by an institutional investor is correlated with other,

potentially unobservable factors related to the loan tranche spread, which could drive the spread

premiums. For example, suppose that the risk of the particular tranches for which equity holders tend to

invest tends to be higher than is reflected in their ratings. We address the possibility that these spread

differences in spreads could reflect unobservable sources of risk by considering differences in spreads

across tranches of the same loan. Since different tranches of the same loan share the same underlying risk

and have the same seniority, unobservable differences in risk cannot explain differences in spreads of

tranches of the same loan. Because factors such as maturity and implicit options affect the spreads of

different types of tranches, we test whether the existence of a dual holder affects the relative difference in

spreads, holding other factors constant. Our results suggest that in a loan with both a Term Loan B and a

revolver, if a dual holder invests in a Term Loan B tranche, the spread between the two is higher than


                                                     29
would be expected absent dual holder participation, while if the dual holder invests in the revolver, the

spread is lower than expected. In the subsample of dual holder loans that have multiple tranches of the

same type, the tranches with dual holder participation have higher spreads than the tranches without dual

holder participation.

       These results are not consistent with the view that dual holder premiums reflect unobservable risk.

Instead, they suggest that equity holders receive additional compensation in terms of additional returns

when they lend to firms for which they hold equity positions. There are several channels that would lead

to these additional returns. It is possible that common ownership of equity and debt could reduce conflicts

of interest between claimholders, leading to improved firm-level investment, or that participation by an

equity holder could certify a firm’s quality to outside investors. However, these arguments predict that

returns to all tranches of a loan will be higher, and do not explain differences in returns between tranches

of the same loan. The within-loan results are better explained by a story in which equity holders receive

compensation for participating in tranches that are relatively difficult to fill at times when it particularly

important for the firm.

        An implication of this argument is that the equity holders with the largest monetary incentives

and the flexibility to make loans quickly will receive higher premium. Our results suggest that there are

large differences in premiums going to different types of dual holders. When private equity and hedge

funds are dual holders, they have a 54 basis-point premium over other loans when other kinds of money

managing funds are dual holders, the premium is 28 basis-points, and when all other types of institutional

investors are dual holders, the premium is only 6 basis points. Since incentives to maximize returns from

holding multiple securities of the same firm are substantially higher in private equity and hedge funds

than in other institutions, these large differences reinforce our interpretation of the premium as reflecting

equity holding institutions utilize their position inside the borrowing firms when they lend to their firms.

In addition, spreads are higher when the investor has a larger equity position in the firm, and when it

purchases a larger portion of the loan.




                                                     30
        Institutional investors, especially private equity and hedge funds, have become substantial equity

holders in corporations. In addition, they are important lenders to corporations through their role in the

syndicated loan market. In principle, institutions could use one type of investment to improve returns in

their other investments. The evidence in this paper suggests that their substantial equity stakes can lead

these investors to obtain higher interest rates than other investors when they lend to the companies in

which they hold equity. By comparing spreads across loan tranches of the same loan, we can rule out

explanations for this finding coming from unobserved heterogeneity coming from risk or other loan

features being associated with dual holders.

        The basic point, however, is that there can be interactions among different investments by one

financial institution in a particular firm. These interactions can potentially create efficiencies and rents

that can be captured by one party or other. Understanding the way in which institutional investors utilize

different types of investments to benefit their overall returns would be an excellent topic for future

research.

     Table 1. Trends in Institutional Participation in Leveraged Loans and Dual Holdings
Panel A and Panel B present the distribution of loan origination during 1997-2007 by number and dollar value,
respectively. Column (1) reports the total number (value) of all leveraged loan facilities from DealScan database.
Column (2) reports the total number (value) of loan facilities in which only commercial banks participated. Columns
(3) and (4) report the total number (value) of loan facilities in which at least one institutional investor is a participant
and a major participant of a loan syndicate, respectively. Column (5) reports the total number (value) of loan
facilities in which an institution is involved as a dual holder.

This table reports selected statistics on the types of institutional investors who are dual holders. Columns (1) and (2) report the number and amount of loan
facilities with each type of institutional dual holders. The number of loan facilities in Column (2) sums to 2,399, which is greater than the total number of dual
holder loan facilities in our sample, because a loan facility can have more than one type of institutional investor as a dual holder. Columns (3) and (4) present the
frequency of participating in revolvers and Term B tranches by type of dual holders, respectively. Columns (5) and (6) report the average dollar amount and
syndicate size of loan facilities in which each type of dual holder is involved, respectively. The last Column (7) presents the average equity holdings of each type
of dual holders.

                                   Unobservable Heterogeneity across Firms?
Panel A of this table presents the OLS regression coefficient estimates of Equation (2) and corresponding p-values
on the sample of loans that have multiple tranches. Definitions of all variables are provided in the Appendix A. The
dependent variable is the spread gap between different tranches within the same loan in basis points. The dummy
variable indicating which tranche the dual holder bought measures the incremental effect on spreads of the dual
holder’s existence, and the control variables are intended to capture other differences between the tranches. Column
(1) of Panel A presents estimates for the subsample of 227 tranche pairs that have both Term Loan A and Term Loan
B tranches, and Columns (2) and (3) present estimates for the subsample of 1,055 tranche pairs that have both a
Term Loan B tranche and a revolver. Panel B of this table presents the OLS regression coefficient estimates of
Equation (1) and corresponding p-values on the sample of dual holder loans and the matched non-dual holder loans
of the same tranche type. Column (1) employs 50 loans (100 facilities) that have both a dual holder loan and a non-
dual holder loan of the same tranche type. Column (3) considers 161 pairs (322 facilities) of a dual holder loan and a
non-dual holder loan of the same tranche type issued by the same borrower in the same year, but not necessarily in
the same deal. Number of observations drops in Column (3) and (4), as we require firm-level information. All
specifications include tranche-purpose fixed effects and year fixed effects. All regressions in Panel B additionally
include tranche type fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing firm level. ***, **, * correspond to
statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

               Table 8. Does the Type of Dual Holder Affect the Loan Facility Pricing?
This table presents the OLS regression coefficient estimates of Equation (1) and corresponding p-values, with the
dual holders broken down by the type of institution. Definitions of all variables are provided in the Appendix A.
The dependent variable is the all-in-drawn loan spread over LIBOR in basis points, and the analysis is conducted at
the loan facility level. In Columns (1) and (3) dual holders are classified into three different groups: HF/PE Dual
holder, Other Fund Dual holder, and Other Institutional Dual holder. HF/PE Dual holder indicates that the
institutional type of a dual holder is a hedge fund, a private equity fund, or other vulture fund. Other Fund Dual
holder indicates the cases in which a mutual fund, a pension fund, or a CDO participated as a dual holder. Other
Institutional Dual holder indicates the cases in which a financing company, insurance company, or an investment
bank participated as a dual holder. In Column (2) and Column (4) each type of dual holders is considered separately.
Columns (1) and (3) employ all loan facilities in our sample for which all required data are not missing (6,350 loan
facilities), whereas Column (2) and (4) present estimates for the subsample of loans in which the dual holders have
participated. All specifications include tranche-type fixed effects, tranche-purpose fixed effects, and year fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing firm level. ***, **, * correspond to statistical significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 9. Does the Size of the Dual Holder’s Equity Position Affect the Loan Facility Pricing?
This table presents the OLS regression coefficient estimates of Equation (1) and corresponding p-values, using two
dual holder indicator variables: Below-Mean equity holding and Above-Mean equity holding. Below-Mean equity
holding indicates that there is a dual holder holding less than average (2.6%) equity stake and Above-Mean equity
holding indicates that the dual holder has above average holdings. Definitions of all other variables are provided in
the Appendix A. The dependent variable is the all-in-drawn loan spread over LIBOR in basis points, and the
analysis is conducted at the loan facility level. Columns (1) and (5) employ the full sample of loan facilities for
which all required data are not missing (6,350 loan facilities). Columns (2)-(4) employ the subsamples of revolvers,
all term loans, and just the Term Loan B facilities, respectively. In Column (5) both Below-Mean equity holding and
Above-Mean equity holding are interacted with HF/PE Dual Holder indicator to measure the combined effect of the
size of equity ownership and the type of institution. All specifications include tranche-purpose fixed effects and year
fixed effects. The specifications in Columns (1) and (5) additionally include tranche type fixed effects, because they
consider the full sample of all tranche types. Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing firm level. Wald-test
statistics and the corresponding p-value are reported at the bottom of the table. ***, **, * correspond to statistical
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

             Table 10. Is the Spread Higher When the Dual Holder Has Funded a Larger Portion of the Loan Facility?
This table presents the OLS estimates and corresponding p-values of the spread regressions on measures of the dual holder’s loan share, in a subsample of dual
holder loans that have the lender share information available. Dual Holder’s loan share measures the portion of the total facility amount funded by dual holder(s).
Dual Holder is the largest lender indicates that the dual holder is the largest lender in the loan syndicate. Definitions of all variables are provided in the
Appendix A. The dependent variable is the all-in-drawn loan spread over LIBOR in basis points, and the analysis is conducted at the loan facility level. All
specifications include tranche type fixed effects, tranche-purpose fixed effects and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the borrowing firm level.
***, **, * correspond to statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

t=1, 4, 8 corresponds to the fiscal quarter following the issuing quarter. All regressions include year-quarter fixed
effects. Loan proceeds are aggregated within a calendar-quarter. The coefficient for Dual Holding Indicator and
ln[total assets0] as well as fixed effects are omitted for the sake of brevity. Dollar changes are the implied change in
the dependent variable when the loan proceeds are increased by $1 for non-dual holder borrowers and for dual
holder borrowers, respectively (calculations are based on a median-sized firm/facility in the sample. Year-quarter
fixed-effects are for 2003Q3). ***, **, * correspond to statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level,
