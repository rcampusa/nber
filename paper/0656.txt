                 Minimum Wages and the Demand for Labor



                                ABSTRACT



     I formulate measures of the effective minimum wage, based on broad

definitions of the labor costs that face employers, and use these measures

in reestimating some simple equations relating the relative employment of

youths and adults to the U.S. minimum wage using aggregate data for 1954—78.

I then ground the model more closely in the theory of factor demand, first

by adding the relative wages of youths and adults to the equation describing

their relative employment, and then by specifying a complete system of

demand equations for these two types of labor. Teen employment responds

quite robustly to changes in the effective minimum in these specifications,

with an elasticity of —0.1. A translog cost function defined over young

workers, adults, and capital shows that the effective minimum wage reduces

employers' ability to substitute other factors for young workers. Using

both sets of results, I find that a subminimum wage for youths would have

increased their employment with at most a small loss of jobs among adults.

        The vast amount of research on the effects of the minimum wage on

employment requires that we justify the presentation of additional results.

Economists have examined the issue: (1) Recognizing the importance of

incomplete and changing coverage of the minimum (Kaitz, 1970; Goldfarb, 1974);

 (2) Considering how to define the real effective minimum wage in a manner

consistent with economic theory (Welch, 1974); and (3) Acknowledging the

role played by spillovers and turnover in completely and incompletely covered

markets (Hashimoto—Mincer, 1971; Welch, 1974). Yet, as Siskind (1977) has

shown, the findings about the magnitude of the effect of higher wage minima

on employment seem sensitive to minor changes in the data and specification.

A more careful specification of the underlying theoretical model and more

attention to the data used could have a substantial payoff in terms of the

confidence one can place in the estimates produced. Thus, though a great

deal of research precedes this study, that research is not as thorough as

current theory and techniques enable the analysis to be.

       In the next section we describe some new measures of the effective

minimum wage and examine how they affect estimates of ad hoc models of the

minimum wage's impact on youth labor markets, one of which introduces factor

prices directly into the estimating equations. In Section III we estimate

a complete system of demand equations for teen and adult labor that incorporates

 the effective minimum wage within a framework based entirely on the theory

of factor demand. In Section IV we examine how changes in the effective minimum

wage change the structure of firms' costs, using a translog approximation to a

three—factor cost function involving youths, adults, and capital. In Section V

we show how to calculate the net effects of higher minima and use the method

to simulate the impact of the minimum wage on youth and adult employment and on

factor shares. As does all previous empirical work on this subject, our results

present only the net employment effects; they cannot show the larger gross effects

as workers are displaced from some firms and find employment elsewhere.
               II. MEASURES OF EFFECTIVE MINIMUM WAGES
                   AND THEIR EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT



     The most thorough previous work on the employment effects of the

minimum wage is based on weighted averages of legislated minimum wages relative

to average hourly earnings in particular sectors, with the weights dependent on

coverage of the minimum and on youth employment in each sector. Earnings per

hour paid for, though, are not a good measure of the cost of employment.

Required payments such as payroll taxes for social insurance, and negotiated

and unilateral payments such as bonuses, are a cost of employment. Increases

in paid holidays and vacations have imposed a growing wedge between hours

paid for and hours worked. Changes in the user cost of training will also

cause the correlation between broader measures of labor costs and average

hourly earnings to differ.

     These are not minor distinctions. Real average hourly earnings (ABE) in

manufacturing rose 55 percent between 1953:1 and 1978:IV. In the same period

real compensation per hour actually worked (COSTWK) rose 93 percent, while the

sum of this measure and real user costs of training (ECNT) rose 92 percent.

Comparable figures for the private business sector are 67 percent, 94 percent

and 98 percent. Clearly, there is room for substantial differences in the

estimated effects of higher legislated minimum wages on employment depending

upon the labor cost measure to which the minimum is compared)-"

     For each of the eight private nonfarm one—digit industries we form:


          MINi. = (B.COVB. + N.COVN.)/AHE. = MIN./AHE.
              1     1    1    1    1     1      1    1                      (1)


where B and N are the minimum wage rates applying to previously and newly

covered workers, and COVB and COVN are the corresponding fractions of workers


                                 —2—
covered in the i'th industry.-' Alternative measures of the effective minimum,

MIN2. and MIN3., are defined by dividing (1) by the ratio of COSTWK to CaMP,

hourly compensation (wages, social insurance and pension payments), and the

ratio ECNT to COMP respectively. Since our focus is on teenage employment as

affected by changes in the minimum wage, we calculate effective minimum wage

measures for the private nonfarm sector as weighted averages over the eight

industries of MINi., MIN2. and MIN3. using each industry's share of teen

employment as its weight.!

     In the top half of Table 1 we list the means and standard deviations of

the minimum wage measures for the years 1954 — 1978 for the private nonf arm

sector and for the three industries —     services   (except private household workers),

retail trade and manufacturing —   for   which there are large samples of teen

workers. The more inclusive nature of these labor cost measures ensures

that the effective minimum wage variables based upon them have lower means than

do those based on AHE. Also, it is worth noting that the effective minimum is

highest in manufacturing among the three industries considered: This occurs,

even though labor costs are higher in manufacturing, because the coverage rate

has historically been far higher there than in services or retail trade.

Finally, note that in manufacturing, though not in the other industries, the

coefficient of variation of NIN3 (.095), based on ECNT, is much larger than

that of MINi (.079), based on AHE.

     These measures of the effective minimum wage compare the minimum price

employers must pay for an hour of labor to the average cost of an hour of labor.

Since most of the interest in the employment effects of the minimum wage is in

the labor market for youths, they have serious problems insofar as they are not

specific to that market. To circumvent these problems we replace AHE (COSTWK

or ECNT) in (1) by RY*AEE (or RY times COSTWK or ECNT), where RY is the ratio of

the weekly earnings of full—time workers age 16 to 24 to those of all full—time

at its highest value, .86, in the years 1954—1978 in 1955, and fell to .70

in 1977. In addition to its use in forming a better effective minimum wage

measure, we use RY to define hourly labor cost measures,-'

     The means and standard deviations of the redefined effective minimum wage

variables are shown in the bottom half of Table 1. Because the teen wage

is below the average, the effective minimum measures based upon it exceed

those based on average labor costs. Also, because the coverage rate outside

manufacturing (which affects the numerator of the effective minimum wage

variable) was rising at the same time RY (which affects the denominator) was

falling, the effective minimum measures for nomnanufacturing industries based

on teen labor costs have much more variance than do those based upon average

labor costs.

     Our modifications of the effective minimum wage variables in (1) have

been concerned chiefly with broadening the terms included in the denominator.

The only adjustment of the numerator has been the inclusion of social insurance

and pension payments (through COMP). If persons at the minimum wage receive

nonwage benefits (reduced hours, specific training) at the same rate as does the

average worker, the ratios MIN3 and MIN2 should equal MINi. Whether this

extreme assumption or our partial adjustment of the numerator is correct is

unknowable a priori. However, by comparing fits of employment equations using

the different measures, we can infer which assumption is superior.

     Our initial approach is to estimate equations describing the behavior of

teen relative to adult employment over time. The equations have the form:



        ER =    *   a1MINJt + ct2U   +o3t + a4DUNS +                             (2)


                                     —4—
 where ER is the logarithm of relative teen/adult employment; MINJ is the

 logarithm of one of the effective minimum wage variables we constructed;

 U is the logarithm of the adult unemployment rate; DIJMS is a vector of three

 quarterly dummy variables, and '   is    a disturbance term. This equation was

 developed by Welch (1974) and used by Siskind (1977). The employment data

 are monthly CPS data, seasonally unadjusted, averaged into quarterly observa-

 tions. Teenagers are persons 14—19; adults are those 20 and over. Because

of the limits on the availability of data on coverage of the minimum wage by

industry, and because previous studies that used (2) started their samples in

1954, our estimates too begin with that year. Since it is likely that the

disturbances are autocorrelated, (2) is estimated in each case using the

Cochrane—Orcutt iterative technique

     The results of estimating (2) for the four samples (three industries and

the aggregate of private nonfarm employment) for 1954 — 1978 are presented in

Table 2.11 Examining first the coefficients of MINJ in the specification

based on ABE, we find that, with the exception of services, the coefficients

on the MINJ variables are all significantly negative at the 99 percent level of

confidence. Comparing these to Siskind's (1977) estimates for 1954—68, we observe

quite similar effects. The main difference is that our elasticities have

greater statistical significance in the equations for the private nonfarm sector and

for services, and less in that for manufacturing. Despite the addition of the

extra years of data, the adjustment for serial correlation, and the use of cor-

rected series on teen employment, the estimated minimum wage elasticities

differ only slightly.-'

     The discussion above is based on results using an effective minimum

wage variable whose denominator is average hourly earnings. When equations (2)

are reestimated using ?iIN2 and MIN3, we find uniformly that the explanatory

power of the model increases. Noreover, the best fits for all four data sets

are in the equations based on an effective minimum variable that includes

Not only are the fits better, the estimated minimum wage elasticities are higher

as well, by about 10 percent in the private nonfarm sector as a whole and in

manufacturing, by 50 percent (on a low base) in services, and by a tiny

fraction in retail trade.

     Equation (2) is a strange hybrid whose basis in theory is quite difficult

to discern.-1 There are three problems:

             (1) It appears to be a relative demand equation, yet the relative

            price measure cannot be claimed to reflect the prices of the two

            types of employee. Implicitly the equation states that the price

            of adults (the denominator of the effective minimum) is average

            hourly earnings (or labor costs), while the coverage—weighted

            minimum (MIN) is the price of teenagers.


            (2) If equation (2) is in part based on the theory of factor demand,

            it puts substantial restrictions upon the adjustment of the

            employment of youths and adults. Implicitly it states that employers

            are concerned only about the ratio of employment in these two

            groups, and that there are no separate disturbance terms that

            reflect random effects in the adjustment of employment in the

            two groups.


            (3) If the equations are intended to reflect the demand for labor,

            they should include a scale effect, measured by the demand for

            output. From this viewpoint the trend can be seen as reflecting

            changes in factor productivity, but the unemployment rate is

           difficult to rationalize as a good measure of shifts in demand.

       As a first step toward grounding (2) in the theory of factor demand,

we add the relative prices of teen labor and adult labor, based on RY.



                                  —6—
We also replace the MINJ variables with MINT (the variables whose means and

standard deviations are listed in the bottom half of Table 1.), whose

denominators are based on those labor costs specific to teenagers. These

two modifications force us to reinterpret the meaning of the minimum

wage variable. Increases in that term produced by legislated increases in

MIN imply the truncation of the distribution of the marginal productivity

of teen labor. Essentially, the labor cost measures based on RY show the

average prices of teen and adult labor, while the minimum wage variable shows

how the distribution of productivity of teens is truncated from below

by changes in the legislated minimum)"     In terms of Figure 1, the relative

price variable is based upon an average of the wages of teens in the shaded

area beyond MIN, while MIN, the numerator of MINT, reflects the truncation

point. This suggests that the net effect of any increase in the minimum

wage must be calculated very carefully. An increase in MIN from MIN to

MIN1 will affect both MINT and relative prices (because the truncation

point of the distribution of teen wages is changed). The cross—hatched

area in Figure 1 will drop out of the observed distribution Of wages.

     The revised version of (2) is:

     ERt o + iMINTt + 2 W1t + 3 Ut +         t +    DUMS +                 (2')
where WR is the log of the relative teen—adult wage or labor cost, and MINT is

in logs. The coefficient      can be interpreted as showing the effect of a higher

effective minimum on relative employment if WR is unchanged. Conceptually it shows the

extra impact of a higher minimum once that effect has been compensated for by

adjusting WR to account for the increased average wage of teenagers produced

when the truncation point in Figure 1 moves rightward. The compensating change

to hold WR constant when MIN increases must occur through a drop in wages of

high—wage teens sufficient to offset the effect of the truncation. That            0

follows from the assumption, based on the studies surveyed in Hamermesh—Grant

(1979), that the demand elasticity for low—wage workers exceeds that for high—

wage workers; the net negative effect on teen employment of a higher MIN,
holding WR constant, results from the partly offsetting positive and negative

effects on high— and low—wage teens respectively. This suggests that the net

minimum wage variables based on ARE and ECNT.— Despite the drastic decline

in RY since the l960s, and the different bases of MINT and MINJ, the

addition of the relative labor cost variable has little impact on the estimated

minimum wage elasticity, as a comparison of the estimates in Tables 2 and 3

clearly shows.-'    Moreover, as in Table 2 the equations based on the most

complete labor—cost measure, ECNT, produce slightly better fits and slightly

higher minimum wage elasticities. Despite the stability of the minimum wage


elasticity, the inclusion of a relative price measure is justified in terms

of achieving a better fit to the data (except in manufacturing). The other

t—statistics on relative labor costs exceed one, and all the estimated

relative price elasticities are negative.


     Since coverage and the legislative minimum are separate issues, we

experimented with separate variables for each. The logs of the fraction of teen

employment covered and the ratio of the minimum wage to AHE (     or to ECNT

were both entered in (2'). (For the private nonfarm sector these
measures were teen—employment weighted averages of the variables for each industry.)

For retail trade and the private nonfarm sector only did o decrease. In all

four cases the larger effects were through the relative minimum; their elasticities

were —.21, —.14, —.21 and —.43 for the four equations using ECNT, and they were

significantly negative except for services)-'    Since coverage is now fairly

 complete, any future increases in the effective minimum wage must come

 through higher legislated minima. These estimates suggest that the employ-

ment effects of such increases would be more severe than implied by estimates

based on increases in the MINT variables (that combine coverage and the

 legislated minimum).

                 III. THE MINIMUM WAGE IN A COMPLETE SYSTEM
                        OF DEMAND EQUATIONS FOR LABOR



      In this section we generalize the model of Section II by transforming it

into a complete system of demand equations for the two factors of production,

 teen and adult labor:

                  ETt= a1 + a1WT + iWAt +           + SMINTt + K1Xt + Li ,       (3a)

                  EAt =
                          a2
                               + 2t + 2WAt + )'Q +           + £2,               (3b)
                                                       K2X


where ET and EA are logarithms of employment of teenagers and adults

respectively; WT and WA are logarithms of labor costs per hour; Q is the

log of output; X is a vector including a time trend and quarterly dummy

variables; and the e are random disturbance terms)" It implicitly assumes,

as did Figure 1, that an increase in the effective minimum wage facing employers

of teenagers directly affects only their employment. This equation system

respecifies (2) further to account for the objections in Section II.

      As it is written, system (3) imposes no restrictions on the effects of one

wage rate on employment in the other group. This allows the testing of

hypotheses stemming from factor demand theory. The theory implies the symmetry

of cross—price effects, 2 =       R1,   where R is the ratio of factor shares; and it

also requires that there be homogeneity in the responses of employment to changes in

all prices, i.e., ct, + 131     0 and 2 + 2 = 0. (We assume here and in Section IV

that the legislated minimum is included in the phrase "all prices.") The model




                                          —s,-
 in (3) is estimated using the data for the private nonfarni sector underlying

 the estimates in Tables 2 and 3. Separate first—order autoregressive processes

 are assumed for     and C2, and the parameters p describing these processes are

 estimated. Because the fits of (3) were always slightly better when ECNT

 was used, we present here estimates in which WT, WA and MINT are based upon that
       15/
measure.—

      The restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry cannot be rejected at the

99 percent level of significance 0(2(3) =   10.72),   though they can at the 95

percent level. Since the restricted system is more consistent with economic

theory, and the estimate of the coefficient on MINT from the unconstrained

model differs only slightly from that from the model in which homogeneity and

symmetry have been imposed, we present the restricted estimates in Table

The equations were estimated by iterative least—squares, a procedure that is

asymptotically equivalent to maximum likelihood.

     As a result of the imposition of the constraints, there is only one

independent coefficient on the labor cost terms, c. Though this coefficient

is negative, its t—statistic is very low. Further, the elasticity is far

below that found in Section II, and far below values that seem reasonable in

light of recent research (see Hamermesh—Grant, 1979). The output elasticity is

also quite low in light of those found in previous work (Hamermesh, 1976). It

is impossible to believe in the degree of increasing returns implied by the estimate

of y. The trend coefficients are positive and always significant. This

too is disturbing in view of the usual interpretation of them as reflecting

increases in productivity.

    We added a variable like MINT, but based on adult labor costs and

employment weights, to (3b) to test whether a change in the effective minimum

wage directly affects the employment of adults. The x—test of this hypothesis

is 1.50, not significantly different from zero.--'      We may conclude that our

interpretation of the effective minimum wage variable here and in Section II

                                   —10—

as a reflection of the truncation of the distribution of labor costs for

teenagers is not inconsistent with the data. This finding allows us to interpret

an increase in the effective minimum wage in the context of the models in (2')

and (3) as directly affecting only the employment of teenagers. There is,

though, an indirect effect on the employment of adults: With a rightward

movement in the truncation point of the distribution of teenagers' labor costs,

their average labor cost increases, and there is some substitution toward

adult workers.

     The elasticity of the effective minimum wage variable is negative and almost

significantly different from zero, though its size is somewhat below that in

Section II. The basic message is that, even if we take the theory of factor

demand seriously and modify it to include the effect of the minimum wage, we still

find a negative employment effect on teenagers as the effective minimum rises.

No matter what formulation we have used — from the hybrid nontheoretical model

in (2) to system (3) —   increased coverage and higher legislated minima are
found to reduce the employment of teenagers.




             IV. THE MINIMUM WAGE AND FACTOR SUBSTITUTION



      The theoretically based estimating models we have constructed

must stem from some underlying production or cost function. Here

we examine how the minimum wage affects the structure of firms' costs

or the nature of production using annual data on the employment of

teenagers and adults, and on services of capital. The view implicit

in the model is that a higher minimum wage constrains the factor

choices of the firm and thus raises its costs at a given output.




                                    —11--
       The work in this section is based on the flexible translog form (see

Berndt—Christensen, 1974, for an early application). Throughout the discussion

we use a cost rather than a production function. Though these are dual to

each other, and thus should theoretically give identical results, this does

not in practice occur. Both the nature of the translog form as an approxi-

mation, and the problem of finding the appropriate terms —                 prices   or quantities —

that   can be treated as exogenous for estimation purposes, have been cited as

causing differences between estimates produced using the cost or production

function appraoches. Although Grant—Hamermesh (1981) argue

that the production function approach, in which quantities are taken as

exogenous, is more appropriate for estimating substitution parameters

among groups of workers disaggregated by age and sex, this argument rests on

the assumed relative inelasticity of labor supply in most groups. Since that

assumption is likely to be incorrect for teenagers, the main focus of interest

of this study, and since our estimates must in any case involve a price term

in the form of the effective minimum wage, we use an approxi-

mation to a generalized cost function.

       The translog cost function for this study is:

        C =             c WY         [WY.MINT] + 2 WA + ct3 PK
              Q-I-c0+
                                                                                          (4)
         + 1l [WY]2 + 1l [WY]2 MINT + 22 [WA]2 + 33 [PK]2
               2                 2                       2             2

         + l2 WYWA        + 12       WY WA MINT   + 13   WY•PK

         + l3 WY PK MINT + 23 WAPK

where C are the typical firm's costs, Q is output, PK is the user cost of capital,

WY and WA are the wages of young and older workers, and the ct., cc,                     and .
are   parameters describing the firms' costs.                (All variables are in logarithms; MINT

 is based on the series shown in the bottom part of Table 1.). The interaction terms


                                              —12—
 between MINT and WY and the three price variables reflect the assumptions that

 a higher effective minimum affects costs by constraining firms' choice of in-

 puts, and that this effect works only through the price of teen labor.

        We can use (4) to derive equations describing the shares of total output

accruing to each of the three inputs. Implicit in this derivation are the

assumptions of constant returns to scale and price—taking firms. The

derivation yields:

              S =     +    MINT + S11 WY +            WY.MINT        (5a)


             + l2 WA + l2 WA•MINT + l3 PKMINT;

              SA =   + l2 WY + l2 WY•MINT + 22 WA + 23 PK;
                                                                     (5b)
  and


             SK=c3+Sl3wY+5j3WY.MINT+5WA+5 PK,                        (5c)

where S denotes the share of the particular factor. We expect 13.to be such

as to imply price elasticities that are closer to zero as MINT is higher. For

example, as MINT increases, the workers who are disemployed are the lowest—

skilled, for whom the demand is likely to be most elastic (see Hamermesh—Grant,

1979); thus n, the own—price elasticit will rise toward zero. Similarly,

the substitutability of skilled and unskilled workers suggests the measured

will fall toward zero when the least—skilled youth are disemployed.

      The symmetry of cross—substitution effects has already been imposed in

(5) by assumption in (4). However, homogeneity restrictions must also be imposed

if the share equations are to make economic sense. These are:
                          ll + ll MINT + l2 + l2 MINT + l3 +            MINT   0;   (6a)


                           l2 + i2 MINT +
                                                 22   + S33   = 0;                  (6b)

                                                                                    (6c)
                          13 + l3 MINT + 22 + S33 = 0;
and                                                                                 (6d)

                             +    +       + oj   MINT = 1.

These restrictions are quite standard in the empirical literature, though one
                                   —13—
should note that they are modified here by our inclusion of the effective

minimum wage in (4).

     One more homogeneity constraint is needed to complete the model. If the

effective minimum increases, factor shares must still sum to one; the restric—

tion must hold that:

                 +     WY + i2 [WI + WA] +      [WI + PK] =   0.           (6e)


Restrictions (6a through e) cannot be valid for all values of the factor price

variables and the effective minimum wage, so that there is some problem in

interpreting them. We make the assumption that each constraint holds at the

sample means of the factor prices and the effective minimum wage, implicitly

assuming that the stochastic process generating (5) conforms with the

restrictions imposed by theory only at the mean of the process. To denote

this, we write superior bars over the price terms in (6); because of the

constraints (6), equations (5) contain eight independent parameters. This

model too is estimated using iterative least squares.

     The capital stock data cover both private and government capital, and are

from Freeman (1979). The user cost of capital is computed accounting for

changes in the tax treatment of capital, depreciation and capital gains. Data

on the labor quantities and prices are based on the Money Incomes of Families

and Persons (CPR Series P—60). The estimates cover twenty—one annual observa-

tions, 1955—1975. The input prices WY and WA are based on the annual incomes

of full—time, year—round workers ages 14—24 and 25+ respectively. Both WY

and WA were deflated to constant 1972 dollars using the deflator for the

private business sector. Factor quantities were computed as full—time

equivalent employment by prorating the total number of persons in each age

group who reported some earnings by the ratio of their earnings to those of

year—round, full—time workers. Thus we are implicitly assuming that each

person in the two labor subaggregates works the same number of hours.-'


                                  —14—
     Table 5 shows the estimates of the parameters in (5). Those in the

first column are based on a model in which all terms involving MINT have

been deleted (in which       and the       have been set equal to zero); those

in the second column are based on the complete model in (5). It is worth

noting that the fit of the complete model is statistically better than that

of the model from which the minimum wage terms have been excluded: The

x2—statistic describing this test is 29.01, significantly different from

zero at the 99 percent level. Most of the parameter estimates in the full

model are quite significant, though l2 and some from the terms in MINT

are not. (This undoubtedly results from the instability induced by the

small share of costs accounted for by young labor. As shown in Grant—

Hamermesh, 1981, it is difficult to get sensible parameter estimates from

systems like (5) when the average shares become small.) Given this problem,

we should not expect high levels of significance for any of the estimated

effects of the minimum wage on the substitution parameters that we calculate

below.

     We can use the estimates in the second column of Table 5 to calculate the

implied partial elasticities of substitution, own substitution elasticities,

and cross— and own—price elasticities. Partial elasticities of substitution

are calculated from (5) as:


                         =
                                ij:
                               ..      . ij
                                         MINT
                                                     + 1      ,          (7a)



while own—substitution elasticities are:
                              ..    +. MINT          + 1— 1       .      (7b)

                                       :
Cross— and own—price elasticities are calculated from (7a) and (7b) respectively

by multiplying by the share of the factor whose price is assumed to change.

     Table & lists the values at the sample means of all the substitution

 and price elasticities involving youths.2.2' The former are also presented

 as linear functions of the logarithm of the effective minimum wage. The

 estimated demand elasticity for young workers is quite low, —.59, though not

 nearly so low as that produced in the system in Section III (a system, though,

 that excluded capital). We find here that workers in the two groups are

 substitutes on average during the sample period. Young workers and capital are

 found to be complements, though the cross—price elasticity is essentially zero,

 and its accompanying t—statistic is tiny.

      The most important finding of this section is implicit in the representa-

 tion of the substitution elasticities as linear functions of MINT in Table 6.

Increases in the effective minimum wage during the period 1955—1975 reduced

the own—substitution elasticity of demand for young workers and decreased the

extent to which employers were able to substitute older for young workers in

response to an exogenous increase in the price of young workers. Based upon

the value of MINT in 1955,     = —.718, and     =   .643;   for 1975 the

comparable elasticities are —.233 and .500. We observe the same result for

YK' though the very low t—statistic attached to the estimate prevents us

from drawing any useful inferences from it. These estimates provide evidence

for our rationale for including the minimum wage in the cost function (4).

They imply that a higher effective minimum wage induces a rigidity into firms'

responses to exogenous changes in factor prices by restricting the range of

choices. This inference is strengthened by the calculation that the estimated

  C/ MIN > 0; we estimate that increases in the legislated minimum
                                                                   wage
raise the estimated total cost, as logic suggests they should.

                      AND SOME POLICY SIMULATIONS


    Here we use the results of Sections II—IV to analyze the effects of changes

in the FLSA. The effects cannot simply be computed on the basis of the estimated

minimum wage elasticities, for changes in the legislated minimum or its coverage

will change average labor costs. This will have an additional effect on teen

employment through the variable WT included in (3) or in (2').

     Writing all prices in logs, assume that the distribution of WT (teen

labor costs) is normal. Then, following Johnson—Kotz (1970, Volume 2, p. 81),

the observed mean of this variable is

                                    f(MIN — i-i)
                   E(WT)    +                            '                    (8)
                                   1 — F (MIN— 11)


where f is the normal density function; F the normal distribution function;

p is the mean of the untruncated distribution; and a    is   its standard deviation.

From (8) the derivative of the mean of WT with respect to an increase in the

effective minimum wage produced by an increase in MIN is:

                      dWT/dMIN =      {f(•)/[l-F()] + f2()/[1-F(.)}2)     ,   (9)
where () denotes the argument has been suppressed.

     Remembering that ER and WR are differences in logs of teen and adult

employment and labor costs reprectively, and treating MINT as MIN — WT, we

can write:

             dET/dMIN =aET.,MINT [l—dWT/dMIN] + [ET/aWT] {dwT/dMINI.          (10)

The partial derivatives in (10) are either the regression coefficients from

(2') under the assumption that adult employment is not directly affected by

changes in MIN, or from (3). Therefore, if we evaluate the effect of an increase

in MIN on the truncated mean of the distribution of teen labor costs, we can

evaluate the net effect of changes in MIN on teen employment.

     We make three alternative assumptions about how changes in the legislated

minimum wage truncate the distribution of teen labor costs:

      (1) All unemployed teens owe that status to the effects of the minimum

     wage, but teens who are out of the labor force are unaffected;

      (2) The fraction truncated is equal to the highest fraction of teens

        (.115) inferred as disemployed in the Meyer—Wise (1981) estimates of

        wage distributions of teens;

         (3) Same as (1), but using the teen labor force, L, as a base rather than

        the teen population, P.

Based on averages from 1954:1 to 1978:IV the fractions truncated under

assumptions (1) and (3) are .069 and .149 respectively. We assume that

cY,   the standard deviation of the untruncated wage distribution, equals 1 or
.5. (The latter figure is roughly in line with the Chiswick—Mincer (1972)

estimate for the truncated distribution for adults, and with Meyer—Wise

(1981) for the untruncated distribution for teens.)

      In Table 7 we examine the employment effect of a youth subniinimum wage

equal to 75 percent of the adult minimum. The calculations ignore scale

effects; only substitution between teen labor and other factors is dealt

with. The estimated impacts of the 75 percent subminimum are not small,

especially if we assume that the average wage of teens would decline as

low—wage teens become employed. We have, though, ignored any changes in

compliance and in the use of student exemptions that might occur.-'

      The estimates in Table 7 can be used with additional assumptions to

gauge the total impact on teen and adult employment of a 75 percent

subminimum. The substitution effects on teens are as listed in that table;

the disemployment effect on adults is:

                         dEA = (3FAjwT)(dWT/dMIN) dMINT.

Assuming that truncation of the teen wage distribution is based on U/P

(.069 of the distribution is truncated), and that a   = .5,   dEA = —.089

percent. This compares to dET = 2.86 percent, shown in Table 7. Making a

conservative assumption about the share of output accruing to teens at the

minimum wage, the scale effect is .161 percent.--' Based on 1979 employment

of 9356 thousand teenagers and 88,961 thousand adults, we infer that a 75

percent subminimum would create 283 thousand jobs for teens and 62 thousand

jobs for adults. Using the same estimates of ET/MINT and dWT/dMIN, but

using o and GYA from Table 6 (implying greater own —and cross—price effects),

the job creation estimates are 523 thousand and —230 thousand respectively,-'

    Different estimates will be produced depending upon assumptions about

dWT/dMIN. However, though the scale effect may be small, the direct effect

on teen employment (through dET/dMINT) is large enough that with reasonable

estimates of substitution possibilities between youths and adults, far more

teen jobs would be created than adult jobs lost.

    Finally, though we cannot draw any direct inferences about how a higher

effective minimum affects the size distribution of income, we can use the

results in Table 5 to calculate the effect of a given increase on the shares

of income of each of the three factors. These are given by:


               S MIN =    l2 dMIN [MINT — WY] + WY} + 12 dMIN             (lla)

               Si MIN =
                          l3      dNIN   [MI     -    +   + 13 dMIN       (llb)

               SiMIN =    1   —
                                  StNIN    —
                                                SK1äMIN               .   (lic)
In Table 8 we list these partial derivatives and some estimates of what

intrasample changes in MIN have done to the estimated factor shares, using (= 1 and

the same three assumptions about the truncation point. The estimates imply

that the gradual increase in the effective minimum wage raised the shares of

capital and youth and lowered adults' share of total factor returns. That this

happened is implicit in our earlier findings that the demand for younger

workers is less than unit elastic, and that younger and older workers are

substitutes.

ment demand and the minimum wage. The more complete measures of labor

costs we have developed uniformly improve the fit of equations describing

relative teen—adult employment and increase the estimated (negative)

response to increases in the effective minimum wage. The employment

elasticities generally remain significant and of roughly the same magnitude

when these equations are respecified to give them a basis in demand theory.

     If one views increases in the effective minimum wage as constraining

firms' choices on factor inputs by restricting the range of employees who

may be hired, one can model a cost function that includes the minimum wage.

We estimate equations implied by such a function for three inputs———workers

14-24, workers 25+, and capital. Higher effective minima have reduced firms'

ability to substitute among groups of workers in response to exogenous

changes in their relative wages. This is"consistent with the notion that, by

restricting employers' choice sets, higher minima add rigidity to the labor

market.

    The most striking finding of this study is the remarkable robustness of

the negative teen employment elasticity in response to higher minimum wages

and expansions of the coverage of the minimum wage, holding output constant.

Regardless of the choice of wage measures or the choice of models, the elasticity

for the private nonfarm sector is on the order of —.1. Though these

minimum wage elasticities do not seem very large, one must remember that they

are estimated over a period that saw a tremendous increase in the effective

minimum wage. Thus the implied effect of expansions of the minimum wage law

on teen employment has been substantial. A youth subminimum wage would have

offset some of these effects, with relatively little displacement of adult workers.

     are based on combining information from the biennial Chamber of Commerce
     series on employee benefits with BLS quarterly series on compensation
     and monthly series on average hourly earnings by sector. Data on the
     user cost of training are constructed using assumptions about the burden
     of cost of specific training and estimates of cross—section regressions
     that include terms for experience and tenure, and thus allow the estimate
     of the effects of firm—specific experience.

     those series only began in 1967, for 1955—1966 we prorated the ratio of
     incomes of full—time, year—round workers, ages 14—24, relative to incomes
     of all full—time, year—round workers, by the usual weekly earnings
     ratio for 1967. Since no data on the incomes of young full—time, year—
     round workers were available for 1954, we arbitrarily assumed that the
     ratio RY was identical in 1954 and 1955.

     the industry and t the quarter. (COSTWKj or ECNTi could be used in place of
     AHEj.) For adults, labor costs are (W—eWT)/(l—e), where W is the average
     labor cost in the industry at time t, WFis the labor cost for youths, and
     and e is the fraction of young workers in the industry at time t.

6.   Welch (1974) used ordinary least squares estimation for the private non—
     farm sector, but took into account contemporaneous correlation of the
     residuals in the equations for the three industries. (He also estimated
     an equation over a composite of all other industries.) Since auto—
     correlation is likely to be the most severe problem in time—series esti-
     mation, the use of the Cochrane—Orcutt procedure is probably the best
     choice if one wishes to go beyond least squares.

7.   For the private nonf arm sector and each of the larger industries
     the time trends in (2) were positive and significant. All the coef—
     ficient estimates on the adult employment variable were negative and
     significant.

 8.   Mincer (1976) found the addition of lagged effective minimum wage
      terms significant, though Welch (1974) did not. Though the sum
      of the terms in an eight—quarter Almon lag structure estimates
      using a quadratic without end—point constraints differed little
      from the coefficients of MINJ in Table 2, the specification did
      lower & slightly except in retail trade.

 9.   Other studies, such as Mincer (1976) and Ragan (1977), mix elements
      of demand and supply models. Only Welch—Cunningham (1978) has a sound
      basis in the theory of factor demand, and that study has problems with
      its attempts to disaggregate teen labor into three subgroups to find
      substitution elasticities within the teen group.


10.   Clearly, there may be some "bunching" of the distribution at the.
      minimum. For our argument to hold, though, we only require that a
      higher minimum cause a greater truncation of the distribution.


 11. To examine whether induced disemployment elsewhere affects employment
      in a specific sector, MINT for the private nonfarm sector was added
      to the equations for each of the three industries. In no case was the
      coefficient on this variable significantly different from zero, nor did
      its addition ever change the coefficient of MINT, in Table 3 by more
      than one standard error.


12. With the introduction of the relative price variable the importance
     of a simultaneous—equations bias may be increased. (Insofar as the
     effective minimum wage variable includes an average wage, it exists
     already in (2) and in equations estimated by others.) To account for
     this (2') for the private nonfarm sector was reestimated using an
     instrumental estimate for WT in the relative price and the MINT variables.
     (The instrumental equation included the numerator of (1), DUMS, and
     teenage and adult population. The coefficient of the minimum wage
     in this equation was .032; its t—statistic was 1.58.) The reestimation of
      (2') yielded a relative price elasticity of —2.41 (t= —2.34), but a
     much lower elasticity on MINT, —.027 (t = —.42).


13. The other coefficients in the equations changed only slightly, and,
     as before, the fits in the equations using ECNT were better than in
     those using ARE.


14. The output measure is gross domestic business product deflated by
     the gross domestic product deflator. These series were from the
     CITIBASE file.


15. Variables based on AHE were also used in estimating (3). As in Section
     II, we found that the fits were slightly inferior, and the estimated
     minimum wage elasticities were slightly lower in absolute value.
16. In the system in which only homotheticity has been imposed, the
     coefficient on MINT, along with it t—statistic, is —.056 (—1.13).


17. We know from Grossman (1980) that increases in the minimum wage
     have only slight effects on wages above the minimum. Insofar as young
     workers have less human capital, this evidence for the assertion that
     attention be directed toward the effect of higher minima on the employ-
     ment of youths corroborates our result.


18. As a check on the validity of using capital stock and user cost series
     together with labor input and price data constructed from an entirely
     different source, it is worth reporting some statistics describing these
     data. The mean shares are .0619, .6263, and .3118 for youths, adults,
     and capital, respectively. Moreover, the mean annual full—time earnings
     seem quite reasonable in light of previous work.


19. Implicit in the calculations of n   and
                                              A based on (7) is the assumption
     that the effective minimum wage sThys uncanged as WY varies.


20. Ashenfelter—Smith (1979) build a model that suggests firms will decrease
     compliance as the effective minimum rises. While they present no direct
     evidence on this, they do show the widespread nature of noncompliance.


21. This is derived by assuming that the share of youths earning at or below
     the minimum is .56 percent, based on the assumption that one—third of
     all teens earn the minimum or less, that their average wage is half that
     of other teens, and that teens' share of output is 3.3 percent.


22. The implied T is calculated as a, (—9.53) times the share of teens
    (.033). This latter is calculated as teens' share of labor earnings
    from Section III times labor's share from Section IV. AT is just cTYA
    (.966) times .033.
