                                          ABSTRACT

We investigate the relationship between GDP per capita, trade costs, demand, and income
inequality between 1996 and 2011. Specifically we apply the aggregate AIDS-based gravity
model as developed in Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) to a panel of 40 countries to generate
a new measure of market potential. We then relate this measure of market potential to country
level GDP per capita finding a significant positive relationship which performs better than CES-
based measures of market potential. The AIDS model allows for non-homotheticities in demand
and the possibility that nations produce goods with higher or lower income elasticities so that
income inequality and GDP per capita matter for the direction of trade. CES-based market
potential measures are typically only a function of overall income and trade costs, but in AIDS
relative incomes and average incomes matter. We also go beyond this partial equilibrium
relationship and explore the welfare effects of a unilateral decline in international trade costs. A
10% decline in import prices induces an average rise in welfare of 2% for importing countries.
This effect is larger for smaller countries and depends in an interesting way on the income
elasticity of demand for source and destination products.

1. Introduction

    Three significant macro-trends in the global economy over the past three decades are

             •   Falling trade costs

             •   Changes in economic geography associated with East Asia making large gains

             •   Increased income inequality within countries and a narrowing of the cross-country
                 distribution of income.

        The first two of these have been the object of myriad studies in the new economic geography
literature. In this view, market access determines jointly the location of economic activity and incomes.
Such a view has been fairly successful in explaining the cross-country variation in income (Redding
and Venables, 2004; Head and Mayer, 2011; Jacks and Novy, 2011). “Market potential”, a trade cost-
adjusted measure of demand for a nation’s output, is consistently found to be a positive and significant
determinant of GDP per capita and location of activity.

        How do within country income inequality and per capita incomes fit into the picture? Previous
research on market potential assumes both of these variables away. The standard Dixit-Stiglitz-
Norman formulation of preferences, widely used in the trade and geography literature, imposes a
representative consumer and homothetic preferences; income inequality and per capita incomes are
irrelevant; only the overall size of markets matters. In a recent exploration, Fajgelbaum and
Khandelwal (2016) lay a foundation for exploring what happens when this assumption is relaxed.
Starting from the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), an expenditure system with a long-tradition
(Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980), Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) derive a gravity equation of trade
that allows for non-homotheticities in consumer demand. Since the gravity model is really an
equilibrium expression for demand for a nation’s output, this is the building block for assessing what
the new economic geography calls market potential.

        In this paper we follow the derivation of Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (FK hereafter) for a
one-sector gravity model allowing for non-homotheticities in demand in the AID system. 1 With this

1Without non-homotheticities, the gravity equation from the flexible demand system would be the homothetic translog
gravity equation studied by Feenstra and Weinstein (2010) or Novy (2012).
                                                         2
gravity equation and a simple Ricardian assumption on the supply side, we are able to derive an
expression for market potential in this demand system. We gather data for a panel of 40 countries for
the years 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 and estimate a single sector version of the non-homothetic gravity
equation with aggregate bilateral trade data. Consistent with the literature (e.g., Hallak, 2010; Hallak
and Schott, 2011, and Feenstra and Romalis, 2014), we find strong and intuitive evidence that richer
countries generally export higher income elastic goods. At the same time, we provide some limited
evidence on the dynamics of these income elasticities. There is significant stability in these elasticities
although China in particular may have seen a rise since 2006.

        Next we proceed to relate market potential to the level and change in income per capita at the
country level. Market potential consists of two components as in the homothetic setup. One term is
related to a nation’s trade costs. The second, and more novel term, involves the interaction between
the supply side (i.e., a nation’s average income elasticity) and world demand. Instead of one non-linear
term featuring these two main components, non-homothetic market potential is additively separable
in destination demand and trade costs. Moreover, world demand for a source country depends not on
the sum of total incomes but on incomes per capita and the within country distributions of income as
well. This last term raises the possibility that growth abroad does not necessarily translate into higher
income at home. Market potential is positively related to foreign market incomes but only when a
country has a positive income elasticity. We aim to quantify the magnitude of these non-homothetic
forces. In this regard we are also able to compare the non-homothetic measure of market potential to
a homothetic (CES-based) measure in terms of goodness of fit in the wage equation relationship. We
find that the non-homothetic market potential measure explains a larger share of the cross-sectional
variation in GDP per capita and in better predicts the level of GDP per capita in a cross-section. Both
models prove similar in terms of predicting medium horizon changes in GDP per capita.

        Finally we explore a welfare calculation building on the main welfare results in FK. We study
a decline in iceberg trade costs for each country in isolation (i.e., a unilateral liberalization) highlighting
the impact of non-homotheticities on welfare. A 10% decline in trade costs in a counterfactual raises
welfare on average by about 2%. Quantitatively, non-homotheticities in the single sector model explain
only a small fraction of aggregate welfare gains. Qualitatively, the impact of non-homotheticities is to
raise the welfare impact when a country has a high income elasticity. Moreover, the effect on welfare
is inversely related to the expenditure share weighted average of estimated foreign income elasticities.

                                                      3
        Our paper is inspired in part by the theoretical growth literature (Matsuyama, 2002) as well as
from contributions in empirical and theoretical trade (Matsuyama, 2000; Fieler, 2011; Markusen, 2013).
The focus of these papers was generally to describe the conditions for demand-led modern economic
growth when the income distribution mattered, or to provide an exploration of the product range
exported, imported and consumed at various levels of income per capita. 2 FK provide an elegant and
innovative solution to the welfare gains from trade when average incomes and the income distribution
matter. A trade view is crucial in this regard since trade shares in expenditure often range between
20% and 30%.

        The market potential approach is broader in the sense that it explores the relationship between
the world income distribution (i.e., equilibrium income per capita) and the economic geography of
demand. In a more ambitious framework of economic growth that accounts for the within country
income distribution, the two variables would be strongly related and jointly determined (Matsuyama,
2002). Our paper supplies a first pass in assessing how important these relationships might be, bearing
in mind their relevance due to the dramatic convergence process and unprecedented rises in within
country income inequality in the past several decades. As far as we are aware, there is no quantitative
empirical exploration of the relationship between market potential and the level of GDP per capita in
the context of a non-homothetic demand system. Our paper also builds on and is motivated by the
success of the earlier literature relating market potential to GDP per capita. Fujita, Krugman and
Venables (1999) provided an elegant theoretical link between factor payments (i.e., wages) and market
potential in the context of a homothetic demand system. Of course, the tradition in economic
geography dates as far back as Harris (1954). Redding and Venables (2005), in the same framework as
Fujita, Krugman and Venables, examined the wage equation empirically and found market potential
to be an economically significant determinant of the cross country variation in income. Recent
research by Head and Mayer (2011) and Jacks and Novy (2016), amongst many others, again working
in the homothetic framework, supports the idea that market potential is a key determinant of cross-
country incomes over the long run.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as following. Section 2 outlines the theoretical
framework based on the model developed by FK; here we show a simple derivation of the wage

bilateral trade includes Choi, Hummels, and Xiang (2009), Eppinger and Felbermayr (2015), and Mitra and Trindade
(2005).

equation relating factor payments to market potential within the FK framework; Section 3 presents
our empirical findings; we replicate the gravity regressions from FK and use these estimates to build
measures of market potential. We go on to relate the cross-national income distribution between 1996
and 2011 to our measure of market potential. Section 3.5 provides a comparison to the homothetic
version of market potential. Section 4 discusses a trade liberalization scenario and the impact on
welfare for a quantitative comparison to results in Section 3. Section 5 concludes.

2. Model
2.1 Gravity


    We follow the international trade setup in FK (2016) which is based on an Almost Ideal Demand
System (AIDS) expenditure system. The AIDS system is an approximation of many different demand
systems that satisfy key economic properties. AIDS features non-homothetic preferences and
product-specific income elasticities. AIDS allows for flexible patterns of substitution and the aggregate
equilibrium expenditure relationship is a function not only of relative prices but also average
expenditure (i.e., per capita income) and the distribution of expenditure (i.e., within country income
inequality in our setup).

    The world consists of a finite number of D destinations (1,…,D) with index d and the same set of
source or exporting countries (1,…,S) indexed by s. We impose an Armington assumption so that
each country produces one product. 3 As in FK, each variety’s demand has its own income elasticity
such that demand for backpacks from China might decrease with income while demand for backpacks
from Denmark could increase with income.

    Suppliers in source country s produce their good under perfect competition at price 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠 . Labor is
the only factor of production and each country has a productivity level 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠 . With perfect competition
and constant returns to scale, the prevailing wage, adjusted for the national-level of productivity is
𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 = 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠 . Heterogeneity across households within country s is due to differing endowments of units




3FK build their model up from the broad sector level and then aggregate up at the country level. The income elasticity
we estimate is the scaled average income elasticity at the country level. Results below are not significantly different when
using the sectoral approach.
                                                             5
of labor, 𝑧𝑧ℎ , so that household h receives an income 𝑥𝑥ℎ = 𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 𝑧𝑧ℎ . Country s then has an average
income 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠 = 𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 𝑧𝑧𝑠𝑠 . The income dispersion in country s is characterized by a Theil index Σ𝑠𝑠 .

      There are international and domestic trade costs such that in order to receive one unit of a product
in country d 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ≥ 1 units must be shipped. We assume throughout that domestic trade costs equal
one. With this assumption, the price per-unit paid in destination d for the product with origin s is
𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠 .

      Working with the expenditure share in country d for the value of imports from origin s it is possible
to formulate a gravity equation of bilateral trade. After imposing some assumptions on the (semi)
elasticities of substitution between products (𝛾𝛾) to simplify the algebra (see expression (21) in FK),
the share in total expenditure 𝑌𝑌𝑑𝑑 of exports in a given sector from country s to country d, 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , in
country d is given by

                         𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠                    𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠                 𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑
                                = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 − 𝛾𝛾 ln �             � + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 �ln �          � + Σ𝑑𝑑 �                 (1)
                          𝑌𝑌𝑑𝑑                      𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 𝑝𝑝                  𝑎𝑎(𝐩𝐩𝑑𝑑 )



                                             1                                        1
where the product of 𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 = exp �𝐷𝐷 ∑𝐷𝐷𝑑𝑑=1 ln(𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 )� and 𝑝𝑝 = exp �𝐷𝐷 ∑𝐷𝐷𝑑𝑑=1 ln(𝑝𝑝𝑑𝑑 )� allows for multilateral
resistance to matter for bilateral trade flows.

      The last term in (1) features the exporter specific income elasticity of its product, 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 , which
determines the partial effect on the expenditure share of a rise in “adjusted real income” (the sum of
                                                                   𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑
real average income of the importing country                                 and the Theil index). The latter component of
                                                                 𝑎𝑎(𝐩𝐩𝑑𝑑 )

adjusted real income is a measure of inequality. Note that 𝑎𝑎(𝐩𝐩𝑑𝑑 ) is a homothetic price index as defined
in FK. We also call attention to the fact that ∑𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠=1 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 = 0. We impose FK’s assumption that the
                        𝑗𝑗
preference parameters 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , for sector j, consist of an exporter fixed effect 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 , a sector fixed effect and
                                                                          𝑗𝑗                     𝑗𝑗
a zero mean, finite variance disturbance at the sector, importer level, 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 �𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗 + 𝜐𝜐𝑑𝑑 � . The
restriction that ∑𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠=1 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 = 1 is also imposed. After aggregating across sectors and imposing market
clearing (the sum of world sales equals supplier income) the bilateral gravity relationship is given by

which show that bilateral factors matter relative to ‘mulitlateral’ forces in the spirit of Anderson and
van Wincoop (2003).

    The property of the demand system that all income elasticities sum to 0 implies some exporters
will have negative income elasticities while others will have positive income elasticities. Countries with
negative income elasticities have inferior goods and will see declining expenditure shares in the
destination as the destination country becomes richer or income becomes more unequally distributed.
Exports from a low income, inferior good producing country would decline as its partner country (or
countries) developed. The reason why the income elasticity has the same impact on trade for changes
in inequality as for changes in average income is because of aggregation. Inequality turns out to be
associated with a higher level of income in the “representative” budget (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980)
in this demand system.

2.2 Market Potential and the Wage Equation


    The gravity equation also depends in a simple way on supply forces. This allows us to find a
relationship between nominal per capita income (i.e., payments to immobile factors of production or
wages in this case) and international demand. The motivation for what has come to be called the
“wage equation” comes from traditional models in the new economic geography in the vein of Fujita,
Krugman, and Venables (1999). These models, based on homothetic demand, produce a tight
equilibrium relationship between payments to the factors of production and “market potential”
referred to as a “wage equation”. In these models, market potential is a function of the economic size
of destination markets, proxied by total income, each destination’s income being weighted by its
distance (i.e., trade costs) to the source country. In such a model, with constant marginal costs and a
representative household, countries have higher prices and wages when demand is high for its output.
This occurs when foreign (and domestic) total income is higher and the destinations are more

                                                          7
proximate. 4 Similar logic applies in the non-homothetic demand system albeit with a different
functional form. We derive an equilibrium “wage equation” in this demand system. The equation
relates income per capita (payments to factors of production) to terms involving foreign demand and
trade costs that are very similar in spirit to the market potential term in standard homothetic models.
However, unlike in a homothetic model, non-homothetic demand implies that the impact of foreign
demand depends on the trade partners’ income elasticities. In addition, foreign demand is related
positively to per capita income and income inequality rather than total income in the homothetic/CES
setup.

    To derive the wage equation, we use the expression for nominal wages 𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 = 𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠 to substitute for
𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠 in equation (1) and the fact that the sum of sales across all destinations, ∑𝑑𝑑 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , must equal total
                                                                                                                            𝑌𝑌
income 𝑌𝑌𝑠𝑠 . 5 Using equation (1), the following relationship between “adjusted wages”, 𝛾𝛾ln(𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝑌𝑌 𝑠𝑠 , in

    It is clear by inspection of (3) that wages are positively related to a difference between destination
income and trade cost terms very similar in spirit to a market potential measure derived from a
homothetic model of demand. In this regard, the expression for market potential for country s in the

4 Proper allowance for general equilibrium forces is allowed via the exponentiated CES price index.
5 Note that the gravity equation which determines 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a function of income of the source country via the supply price
term. Trade deficits and surpluses do not in principle matter when real expenditure is used in the market potential term
since local income in country s is in the model and what we study empirically. However, to achieve global balance
between income and expenditure, shift terms can be included. In practice these effects are likely to be small and
unimportant here.

    The wage equation is useful for studying changes in source country nominal wages given a change
in the export opportunities of an exporter. Were we to estimate this equation using the data, we should
not think of the partial effect of market potential on wages as a general equilibrium effect but rather
a partial equilibrium effect. The wage equation does not account for the general equilibrium effects
on prices and incomes of exogenous changes in technology or trade costs but rather estimates the
equilibrium relationship defined by this particular model. As used and under standard assumptions,
the wage equation can also be used to understand better the forces that shape variation in the global
distribution of (nominal) incomes and possibly even which model best describes the process of
international trade. Higher market potential due to changes in trade costs or destination market
adjusted incomes requires nominal payments to factors to be higher in order to satisfy the general
equilibrium conditions of the international trade model. Generally speaking, the wage equation relation
is not too useful in isolation for studying the general equilibrium impact of a change in market potential
unless such a change is relatively small. It can be useful in verifying the properties of the model, for
comparing different explanations for trade and global income distributions and so forth. We explore
a welfare calculation below which highlights the gains from trade better than the wage equation.

    Nevertheless, wages are related in an interesting and novel way to destination demand shifters
compared to other standard homothetic models such as a CES or homothetic translog model. Income
per capita is always increasing in market potential when market potential is defined as the entire term
in brackets in (3). However, income in country s is not always increasing in destination market incomes
but instead declines when 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 < 0. While richer and more unequal destination markets are associated
with higher adjusted wages for high income elasticity suppliers, foreign market incomes have the opposite
relationship when 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 < 0. This result stems from the Engel curves implicit in the demand system. If a
country s supplies low income elasticity goods, then foreign growth may indeed shift demand away
from that source country This dynamic highlights an open-economy demand channel for economic
growth which is a feature in the literature (e.g., Matsuyama, 2000).

3. Empirical Results


       We proceed by estimating the non-homothetic gravity equation to show that this relationship
provides a good fit for the bilateral export data, to establish that our baseline estimations are in line
with FK’s estimations and to provide estimates of the income elasticities and trade cost parameters.
We then use these parameter estimates to obtain an estimate of market potential. The market potential
term is the key explanatory variable in estimating (3). We then provide some robustness checks and a
simple comparison between how well the non-homothetic market potential measure and a CES-based
measure of market potential predict GDP per capita.

3.1        Data


       Our data consist of a balanced panel of 40 countries for the benchmark years 1996, 2001, 2006,
and 2011. For bilateral trade data we use the 2013 release of the WIOD (Timmer et. al. 2015). This
version of WIOD records gross flows across 35 sectors and between 40 countries. We aggregate final
and intermediate use together. For trade cost proxies like distance, language and shared border we rely
on data from CEPII (Mayer and Zignago, 2011). We use the Penn World Tables to quality adjust
prices (Feenstra and Romalis, 2014). For nominal GDP we used data from the World Bank World
Development Indicators. Real GDP per capita is from the Penn World Tables. Gini coefficients are
obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database version 5.0. 7 We average trade
data with a three year average of trade values centered on the indicated sample years. The exception,
due to data availability is 2011 when we use data from 2009, 2010 and 2011. More recent data from
WIOD are available from 2012 onwards, but the sectors are not easily matched across samples.

3.2        Gravity


       Table 1 shows results of estimating the following gravity equation (4), which is based on equation
(1), for each year in our sample as well as two pooled panel models with respectively country-pair
random effects and country pair fixed effects:

                                                              10

                                𝑌𝑌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑          𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊




Throughout what follows, we impose the following functional form for trade costs 𝜏𝜏𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 =
      𝜌𝜌
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑏𝑏 𝛿𝛿1𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜆𝜆𝛿𝛿2𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝜂𝜂�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 where 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the bilateral distance between countries, 𝛿𝛿1𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is an indicator
equal to 1 when two countries do not share a border, 𝛿𝛿2𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 equals 1 when two countries do not share
a common language, b measures the tariff equivalent of the trade cost when two countries do not
share a border, 𝜆𝜆 measures the tariff equivalent of trade costs when two countries do not share a
border and 𝜂𝜂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a random, unobservable component at the country-pair level. We include domestic
trade flows in all regressions.

     Table 1 shows that distance is negatively and significantly associated with bilateral trade shares,
while not sharing a common language and not sharing a border are associated with higher trade costs
and lower trade shares. We also note that the point estimates on our trade costs are remarkably stable
across time both in terms of their magnitude and their statistical significant in the separate cross-
sections. In the pooled panel models, the coefficient on distance is estimated at one half to one quarter
of the size it attains in the cross-sectional models of columns (1) through (4).The penalty for not
sharing a language is decreased in magnitude by about 30% using pooled data. On the other hand, the
tariff equivalent of not sharing a border increases.

     The gravity regressions in Table 1 also provide estimates of country-level income elasticities as in
FK which we do not directly report. Evidently in columns (1)-(4) identification of these income
elasticities is from cross-sectional variation in demand. Columns (5) and (6) use time series and cross-
sectional variation. Figures 1A-1D plot the univariate regression line for the regression of the
logarithm of GDP per capita on our estimates of 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 . Our results are strongly consistent with those
of FK’s. Both their data and our replication show a strong positive relationship between GDP per
capita and 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 .



8 Since the distance proxy is time-varying in this framework, pair fixed effects do not preclude estimation of the relevant
trade cost parameters on the distance term. The error term involves other terms from the mulitlateral trade costs
function as in FK footnote 28.
                                                                        11
       In several sets of un-reported gravity regressions we are able to find some quantitative changes in
the estimated 𝛽𝛽s. In particular we weighted the gravity regressions by population of the destination.
Here the fit between 𝛽𝛽 and GDP per capita is positive but much tighter. We also allowed for the
square of the adjusted income term Ω𝑑𝑑 along the lines of Banks, Blundell and Lewbel (1997). We
calculated the marginal effect of Ω𝑑𝑑 at each destination’s level of adjusted aggregate income
        𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑
ln �            � + Σ𝑑𝑑 . In this specification the relationship between per capita GDP of the exporter and
    𝑎𝑎(𝐩𝐩𝑑𝑑 )

the income elasticity is negative but not statistically significant. Using importer fixed effects in order
to use within-importer time variation also generates a positive relationship, but the point estimate on
real per capita GDP is not significant.

       In general a strong positive relationship emerges between the log of income per capita and the
estimated 𝛽𝛽s with some notable counter-intuitive outliers like Austria, Belgium, Germany and France
(visible in Figure 1D).These countries estimated 𝛽𝛽s also behave more in line with the expectation that
richer countries have higher income elasticities in the panel gravity regression (columns (5) and (6))
becoming positive or larger. It should be noted that our estimates of country-level total market
potential are sensitive to the sign of the income elasticity. Indeed, using the cross-sectional gravity
estimates, we find that German and French market potentials are on the decline over time. Using the
gravity panel estimates show rising or stable market potentials. In any case, because the relative
rankings are ostensibly not too dis-similar from specification-to-specification so that our wage
regressions are stable—as we will show below. 9

       For two large and important countries in the developing world, we observe interesting results. The
point estimate for China, 𝛽𝛽̂𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , increased and became positive between 1996 and 2011 moving from
-.005 (s.e. = 0.025; 95% C.I. -0.055 to 0.044) to 0.01 (s.e. = .02 ; 95% C.I. -0.03 to .05). For India, the
opposite happened. The point estimate for India, 𝛽𝛽̂𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 , started negative and became more negative
falling from -.028 (s.e. = 0.03 ; 95% C.I. -0.09 to 0.03) to -0.05 (s.e. 0.04; 95% C.I. -0.13 to 0.04)
over the same 15 year period. Again, these estimates have interesting implications for how the

9 One possibility is that much of international trade occurs in intermediates and not in final products. It may be possible
that exports of these products tend to produce estimates of lower income elasticities since many of these countries
offshore assembly and export intermediate goods to low income countries. Competition for such products is lower in
these destinations than in the leading countries leading to rising (unconditional) trade shares with low-income countries.
We replicated FKs sectoral gravity regressions and found similar patterns to those described above in the one sector
model across nearly all sectors and in three aggregate sectors (food, manufacturing, and services). Since our wage
regressions are robust to the various specifications of gravity we do not pursue this issue further.

domestic component of market potential changes, but they do not necessarily have a great impact on
relative market potential measures.

3.3 Wage Equation
    We now turn to estimating the wage equation in (3). Our estimating equation is implemented as
follows:

                      𝑌𝑌𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠                𝑌𝑌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                 𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                               𝜏𝜏̂ 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠                (5)

                      𝑌𝑌𝑊𝑊                  𝑌𝑌𝑊𝑊                 𝑎𝑎(𝐩𝐩𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 )                           𝜏𝜏𝑑𝑑 𝑝𝑝
                                              𝑑𝑑




where ln(𝜏𝜏̂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) = �𝜌𝜌�(ln𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝑏𝑏�𝛿𝛿1𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜆𝜆̂𝛿𝛿2𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �. Additionally, 𝛽𝛽̂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 indicates the estimated income
elasticities from the four cross sectional estimates in Table 1 columns (1)-(4). Alternatively we employ
the estimates from the panel gravity model and drop the time subscripts on these coefficients. Both
variables are “generated” regressors and are time varying but come from cross-sectional estimations.
Given that these regressors are “generated” we bootstrapped the standard errors in un-reported results
and results are strictly qualitatively the same as our reported results. We use nominal GDP per capita
for 𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and then real GDP per capita in our robustness checks.

         As equation (3) shows, it is potentially advantageous to estimate this relationship using panel
data so as to be able to use country fixed effects to proxy long-run cross-country differences in the
productivity parameter. We control for population size throughout to deal with differences in relative
factor endowments. We assume the product preference shocks are constant across exporters and
across time. If these factors are time-varying and correlated with either the trade cost term or the
world income shifter then our estimates may remain biased. We assume these variables are
uncorrelated.

         Table 2 shows our results first in year-by-year cross-sectional regressions and then for two
variations of a panel data approach. All regressions are weighted by population or average population
in the panel fixed effects model. The wage equation shows a positive and statistically significant
relationship in all specifications. In the cross sections, each one standard deviation rise in market
potential (roughly equal to 0.05) is associated with a one half standard deviation rise in the dependent
variable. In columns (5) and (6) which include random effects or country fixed effects these values are
                                                                   13
reduced to about one-fifth or one-third of a standard deviation respectively. The r-squareds are high
in both the cross sections and in the panel fixed effects model at roughly 0.9.

         The positive relationship holds in long-run changes as well. Figure 2A shows the conditional
added variable plot for long-changes in the dependent variable between 1996 and 2011 and the long
change in market potential. We use the values of market potential from the cross-sectional gravity
regressions to create the differences. A strong, positive and statistically significant association between
changes in income and market potential is visible. As we mentioned above, there is some difference
in the estimated betas over time and depending on the gravity model estimated. In particular, the sign
of the income elasticity can change between specifications. In Figure 2B we use the income elasticities
from the panel gravity model. In terms of explaining cross-country variation in adjusted wages, the
effect of this inconsistency is not qualitatively consequential.

         While the relationship in Table 2 bears resemblance to the standard positive relationship seen
in the literature (Redding and Venables, 2004; Head and Mayer, 2011; Jacks and Novy, 2016) there is
a significant difference in our results due to the non-homotheticities captured in the theoretical model.
While trade cost reductions always raise market potential and are associated with a rise in incomes as
long as 𝜙𝜙1 > 0 , for countries with negative income elasticities, higher income in their trading partners
shifts demand away from domestic products and as a consequence this could lead to lower adjusted
wages.

         Changes in market potential are obviously related to time-variation in the country-level point
estimates of the income elasticities. According to our cross sectional estimates, the income component
of market potential for the USA peaked in 2001 and has fallen by one half between 2006 and 2011
while for Japan it has monotonically declined by as much as 30% between 1996 and 2011. In the major
countries of the developing world in our sample, trends are the exact opposite. China has seen a
relentless rise in its destination income component — due partially to the rise in the income elasticity
of its exports. On the other hand, for India this part of market potential has stayed relatively flat in
accordance with its near-constant (and negative) income elasticity of exports.

         As for the trade costs term, the evolution of this term depends heavily on the location of
economic activity since our three proxies for trade costs are time invariant. As factory-Asia has
expanded and China’s global income has risen meteorically, trade weighted trade costs fallen for

                                                    14
countries in Asia. In several countries, the trade cost component increased, implying higher
international trade costs. This is true for the USA, Canada, France, and Germany. Despite Japan’s
proximity to China, its falling world income share has led to a fall in its economic proximity. Korea,
China, India, and Indonesia posted increases in their measured proximity. Amongst this group, China
witnessed the largest increases.

3.4     Robustness and Alternative Specifications


        In Tables 3 through 5 we explore several different robustness checks. In Table 3 we substitute real
GDP per capita for nominal GDP per capita as the dependent variable. Results here are qualitatively similar
to those in Table 2. Table 4 separates out domestic and foreign market potential. When both components of
market potential enter the regression simultaneously, both are significant and positive in most specifications.
The exceptions are in 2011 and in the random effects panel when the point estimate on foreign market
potential is reduced in size and is statistically insignificant. In un-reported regressions, we drop domestic
market potential, a variable likely to suffer from endogeneity or simultaneity bias. In these regressions, the
coefficient on foreign market potential is always significant and of the same magnitude as in Table 2 even in
the random effects specification.

3.5    Comparison of CES and AIDS/Non-Homothetic Market Potential


        We provide one benchmark comparison for the non-Homothetic market potential measure
by making a comparison to market potential generated from a constant elasticity/constant markup
(CES) homothetic demand system. The latter was first systematically estimated from gravity models
based on the homothetic CES setup in Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1999) by Redding and Venables
(2004). Jacks and Novy (2016) provide a new and elegant derivation of market potential in a CES-
homothetic model based on observable trade and income data and a plausible functional form for
trade costs. They have kindly shared their data with us for the years and countries in which our sample
overlaps. Using our notation for subscripts and letting 𝜎𝜎 be the elasticity of substitution across
varieties of products, their measure is given as:

Figures 4 and 5 show scatter plots and a regression line for a simple univariate relationship between
the logarithm of GDP per capita and both 𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 in 2006 the latest year for which we
have an overlapping sample available.

        𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 dominates 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 based on simple measures of regression goodness of fit and
statistical significance. Both measures of market potential are statistically significant. The t-statistic for
𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 is 3.5 while that for 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is 2.60. The R-squared and RMSE for 𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 are 0.43 and 0.97
while for 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 they are 0.12 and 1.18. While the CES model grants Belgium the title of largest market
potential, the non-homothetic model suggests that the USA has the largest market potential which we
believe is overwhelmingly consistent with intuition about relative market sizes and what we know
about the trade costs facing small economies. Both models rank China near the median level of market
potential. A rank correlation test fails to reject the hypothesis that the two measures are significantly
different however.

        Figures 5 and 6 show how model-based predictions of GDP per capita vary between the CES
and the NH models. The predicted values for the logarithm of GDP per capita are plotted versus the
actual levels with a 45-degree line. The predictions from the non-homothetic model lie significantly
closer to the 45-degree-line and therefore provide better predictive power in levels. This result seems
to obtain because at the lower end of the world income distribution the CES model predicts much
higher market potential than the levels of GDP per capita warrant (e.g., China, Indonesia and India)
while Australia and Canada have much lower market potential in the CES-based measure than these
large and poor developing countries. This feature is likely because the CES model fails to take into
account the importance of GDP per capita and the income distribution. The non-homothetic model
penalizes (correctly as far as intuition is concerned) large countries like Indonesia, India, Brazil and to
an extent China for their low levels of income per capita.

        A caveat is due however when we investigate the dynamics of GDP per capita versus changes
in market potential. Here, both models seem roughly equivalent. In Figures 7A-7C we plot the actual

                                                          16
changes in the logarithm of GDP per capita between 1996 and 2006 against changes in both the CES
and the NH measures of total market potential. Without Belgium in the CES model, both models
have nearly the same RMSE (0.24) and R-squared values (0.45). 10 The regression of predicted changes
in income on actual changes in income using the CES model has an R-squared double that of the NH
model (0.42 vs. 0.2) while the RMSE is about equivalent. The coefficient in the CES model is larger
and closer to 1 (0.45, s.e. 0.10, 95% C.I. 0.23 to 0.68) versus that or the NH model (0.23, s.e. 0.07,
95% C.I. 0.08 to 0.37). . Figures 8A-8C show the predicted values of the logarithm of GDP per capita
from these regressions versus the actual values. In sum, the CES model, when excluding the
anomalous case of Belgium does about equally well in predicting medium horizon changes in incomes
as the NH model.

4 Welfare Calculation under Lower International Trade costs: an
  Illustrative example

     Using the techniques established in FK to investigate welfare changes in the AIDS context
(especially equations (32)-(36)), we study the welfare implications of a 10% decline in distance
related trade costs for each importing country. The magnitude of this decline is near the fall in the
average of bilateral trade costs between 1970 and 2000 reported by Jacks, Meissner and Novy (2013).
The objective here is three fold. First we want to investigate the relative magnitude of the
homothetic and the non-homothetic contributions to welfare changes. Second we want to compare
the welfare changes to the reduced form regression results from section 3.2. Finally, we are able to
illustrate a relationship between international trade costs and both the average income elasticity a
country faces from its international trade partners and its own income elasticity.

     FK derive the equivalent variation welfare change in the context of their AIDS model which we
follow exactly. The key relationships are given here, but we refer the reader to the full derivation in
FK (2016). We study a 10% decline in trade costs related to distance between international trade
partners. We investigate only the aggregate welfare effects of a trade shock in a single sector version
of FK. We do not calculate the within country distributional effects studied by FK. As in FK we


10As per theory, we include the world share of expenditure on the right had side when in the AIDS/NH model. Leaving
Belgium out of the sample benefits the CES approach since the CES model creates an outlier out of Belgium by giving it
the largest rise in market potential of all countries.

       Together these expressions provide a full characterization of the marginal impact on welfare of
incremental changes in trade costs. We numerically integrate this system solving for the aggregate
welfare change for each of the 40 countries in our sample. Table 5 shows the overall gains and the
homothetic and non-homothetic contributions in log points (x 100). The average (median) overall
welfare gain is 2.0 (1.9) with a standard deviation of 1.0. Most of the welfare gains are accounted for
by the homothetic component with an average contribution of the homothetic share of 99.6%
(minimum = 95.7%, maximum = 1.03%, std. deviation = 1.3).


11   We recover 𝛾𝛾 by assuming 𝜌𝜌 = 0.177 as in FK.
                                                                          18
    Interestingly the homothetic component over-accounts for welfare changes in 15 out of 40
countries all of which have negative point estimates for their income elasticities and negative
expenditure weighted differences between estimated destination and estimated source income
elasticities defined as ∑𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠=1 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 (𝛽𝛽𝑑𝑑 − 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 ). China is an exception with a positive estimated income
                                                          �𝐻𝐻,𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 0.828, 𝑊𝑊
elasticity of 0.008 and overall welfare gains of 0.8271 (𝑊𝑊                       �𝑁𝑁,𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = −0.00095).

China’s negative weighted differences in income elasticities explains this fact. The countries with the
largest decline in welfare due to non-homotheticities include Belgium, Canada, India and Mexico all
of which have some of the smallest own income elasticities and all of which have negative weighted
income elasticity differences. It should be recalled that in our baseline estimation for 2006 Germany
and France also have negative income elasticities and see similar albeit smaller (in absolute value)
effects related to this. The relationship between weighted differences in the income elasticities and
the non-homothetic welfare component is plotted in Figure 9.

The somewhat non-intuitive result here is that the equivalent variation change in welfare would fall
if importer income elasticity is negative and would rise in the case a foreign good was an inferior
good. This is a natural consequence of the definition of the equivalent variation and the particular
experiment we study. In this case, the fall in the relative price of products sourced from inferior-
good producing nations increases the amount of income needed to be indifferent between
consumption at the old prices and the new prices because these goods are not preferred. Oppositely,
if a country’s own income elasticity is negative then the welfare increase is smaller. The relative price
increase arising from the liberalization which drives consumers away from these inferior goods (i.e.,
the expenditure effect) requires lower compensation.

5 Conclusions

        We have investigated the relationship between trade costs, the location of economic activity
and global income inequality over the last two decades. We apply the AIDS system as developed in
Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016). This model allows for non-homotheticities in demand. The
conceptual advantage to this approach is that it allows for the possibility that nations produce different
types of goods that might be inferior or luxury goods. The approach also allows income inequality and
GDP per capita to matter for the direction of trade.


                                                        19
        We apply the AIDS/gravity approach to a panel of countries and find gravity regression results
ultra-consistent. Non-homothetic gravity provides plausible and highly stable relationships between
directional expenditure shares and common proxies for trade costs. We also leverage the gravity
relationship in the AIDS model to derive a measure of market potential. Market potential relies on
two terms: a trade cost term and a demand shifter. The latter encompasses an interesting interaction
between the level of demand and the structure of domestic production. The most novel finding
conceptually is that greater foreign demand does not necessarily promote higher sales and wages. The
standard positive effect of foreign income on source incomes occurs only when a country’s income
elasticity of exports is positive. On the other hand, for a country with a negative income elasticity
assume consumers’ incomes per capita rise. In this case local income would fall since the products
would lose market share. The negative effect could be offset if inequality were reduced at the same
time. Multiple other combinations of this effect are possible and merit further exploration.

        Finally we explore one welfare calculation in a counterfactual in order to see how the reduced
form equilibrium wage equation regressions compare to a structural welfare calculation. Here we find
that welfare impacts are heterogeneous when we use the model-based approach. However, our average
effect of a rise in one-half of a standard deviation or 0.5 log points from the regressions in Table 2 is
comparable to the average welfare change using model-based counterfactuals. In principle one could
also explore the welfare implications of a change in foreign incomes which will shed light on how
much countries are handicapped by exporting inferior goods.

        Our bottom line is that greater access to foreign consumers via lower trade costs and higher
spending power remain significant determinants of the world income distribution. Nevertheless, the
benefits seem to be conditional on the supply side as much as the demand side. Understanding how
the income elasticities of nations have evolved over time also merits further research. We are currently
experimenting with longer-run historical data to see if a similar approach can be taken. A constraint is
that income inequality measures are scarce in the past. Yet it may be possible to estimate non-
homothetic gravity without this variable and still obtain reasonable point estimates.

large brackets. Adjusted wages equals factor payments (𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠 ) scaled by 𝛾𝛾 plus a country’s share in
world income.

 𝑍𝑍 + 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠 ) and 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 + 𝜈𝜈𝑑𝑑 with ∑𝑠𝑠 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 = 1 and ∑𝑠𝑠 𝜈𝜈𝑠𝑠 = 0 we arrive at expression equivalent to
equation (5). Our baseline assumption for the productivity parameter using panel data is that 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 =
 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠 + 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 where 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠 is an unobservable proxied by a country fixed effect and 𝜖𝜖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a mean zero finite
variance error term.

        Notes: Figures use changes in the CES-MP measure or the AIDS MP measure between 2006 and 1996. See
        text for an explanation of their construction. The y-axis predictions come from univariate regressions of the
        logarithm of GDP per capita on each measure of market potential. Belgium is excluded from this regression
        in Figure 8C.
