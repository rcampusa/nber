                                            ABSTRACT

Almond (2006) argues that in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic lowered socioeconomic
status in adulthood, whereas Brown & Thomas (2018) find that the effect disappears after controlling
for parental characteristics of the 1919 birth cohort. We link microdata from the 1920 and 1930 censuses
to WWII enlistment records and city-level in uenza data. This allows us to adopt an empirical approach
that overcomes the selection concerns raised by Brown & Thomas (2018). Results indicate that in
the absence of the pandemic, the 1919 birth cohort would have been more likely to graduate from
high school, an effect that is largely unaffected by including parental controls and city-specific time
trends. Adding household fixed effects (and thus exploiting variation among brothers) yields similar
but somewhat larger results.

1     Introduction

In a highly influential paper, Almond (2006) argued that the 1918 influenza pandemic
offers a natural experiment for testing Barker’s 1995 hypothesis that in utero exposure
to malnutrition increases susceptibility to heart disease in adulthood. The pandemic
was an unexpected, severe, but ultimately temporary shock. As Almond noted, this
allows the researcher to simply compare the adult outcomes of birth cohorts that
were in utero during the pandemic to the outcomes of adjacent birth cohorts. Results
from this specification indicate that in utero flu exposure not only decreased health
in adulthood but it also lowered educational attainment, income, and socioeconomic
status (SES) (Almond, 2006; Almond & Mazumder, 2005).

    While Almond (2006) is often cited as evidence that early-life health insults can
have lasting effects, recent work by Brown & Thomas (2018) offers an alternative
explanation for these results. Specifically, the authors suggest that Almond’s critical
identifying assumption – that unobserved determinants of human capital vary contin-
uously between birth cohorts – might not hold. As Brown & Thomas note, the 1918
pandemic coincided with the height of World War I (WWI) deployment and WWI
veterans were positively selected from the overall population. Thus, the cohort that
was in utero during the pandemic may have had worse outcomes in adulthood be-
cause they came from low SES families and not because of their exposure to flu while
in utero. Importantly, Brown & Thomas (2018) show that Almond’s core results are
not robust to the inclusion of proxies for parental characteristics as controls.

    We revisit Almond (2006) while taking the criticisms of Brown & Thomas (2018)
seriously. Our efforts are made possible by Ancestry.com’s recent digitization of the
entire 1920 and 1930 federal censuses. These data allow us to construct an individual-
level panel dataset by linking World War II enlistment records back to the census.
This means that we can observe each individual twice: first as a child with their
parents and again as an adult when they enlist.

                                           1
   Linking offers a number of advantages for this empirical setting. First, we do not
have to rely on proxies for parental characteristics since we observe (and subsequently
control for) own parental characteristics such as mother’s and father’s literacy, na-
tivity, age, and occupational income score, as well as whether the family owned or
rented their home, and the number of siblings. Second, and more importantly, linking
allows us to adopt a more credible identification strategy. We assume that an individ-
ual’s location at the time of enumeration is the same as their in utero environment.
This allows us to exploit geographic variation in the intensity of the pandemic as an
additional source of identification, which means that we can include birth year fixed
effects in all of our specifications. These fixed effects account for the general rise in
WWI deployment. Finally, the availability of these full count records also allows us
to construct a large sample of brothers. For this subsample, we can include household
fixed effects, which completely accounts for any parental selection.

   We begin with a series of placebo tests to examine the credibility of our identifica-
tion strategy. In contrast to Almond (2006), whose primary identifying assumption
was that other determinants of human capital varied continuously across cohorts, our
identifying assumption is that other determinants of human capital did not system-
atically vary with the intensity of the pandemic. Taking parental characteristics as
outcome variables indicates that this assumption is likely valid, as we find no statis-
tically significant relationships between any of our 10 measures of parental quality
and intensity of exposure. Turning to long-run outcomes, we find robust evidence
that in utero exposure to the pandemic reduced high school graduation rates. This
is true before and after we control for parental characteristics, when we include city-
specific time trends, and even when we analyze our household fixed effects model.
As for biological outcomes, we find no consistent evidence that in utero exposure to
the pandemic affected heights, weights, or BMI – the only proxies for health that are
available in the enlistment records.

2         Data

2.1        Constructing a linked dataset

This section describes the construction of our linked dataset. We begin by identifying
all male WWII enlistees whose reported year of birth falls between 1909 and 1922.1
Parman (2015b) estimates that about 65 percent of men born between 1913 and 1923
enlisted in WWII, and so the sample is more representative of the male population
than one might initially think.2 The exception to this is that registrants could be
rejected for failing to meet the minimum education or physical standards. This type
of selection should bias against finding evidence that in utero flu exposure impaired
human capital development.3

        Our linking procedure builds upon our previous work (Long & Ferrie, 2013; Beach
et al. , 2016) and can be summarized as follows: we take our set of enlistment records
and cast a wide net to find a set of potential matches in the census immediately
following their birth.4 We then impose a number of requirements to ensure that the
match is reasonable. If there is no match or if there is more than one potential match,
we classify the enlistment record as unable to be linked.
    1
      These records were digitized by the National Archives and Records Administration and are
available at http://aad.archives.gov/aad/fielded-search.jsp?dt=893.
    2
      Failing to link women is common in this literature, e.g. Aizer et al. (2016); Feigenbaum (2015);
Long & Ferrie (2013). This is because women tend to change their name when they marry, and so
without knowing their maiden name it is impossible to find their childhood records.
    3
      A related source of selection is that the most exposed individuals may not survive until obser-
vation. This selection is present for both Almond (2006) and Brown & Thomas (2018) as well. This
selection should also work against finding that in utero exposure impaired human capital develop-
ment if we assume that these individuals would have had worse educational or health outcomes.
    4
      For those reporting a year of birth between 1909 and 1919 this will be the 1920 census. For
those reporting a year of birth between 1920 and 1922 the closest census will be the 1930 census.
The 1920 census was enumerated in January and asks for an individual’s age as of January 1, 1920.
Thus, anyone born on or after January 1, 1920 should not appear in the 1920 census. It is worth
pointing out that our ultimate empirical specification includes birth cohort fixed effects, which will
address differential changes in the linking introduced by the fact that our 1920-1922 cohorts come
from a different census. We prefer to include these cohorts for our baseline analysis because they
received no direct exposure to the pandemic, and so they are our cleanest set of control cohorts. As
a robustness check, we exclude these cohorts and we find nearly identical results.


                                                  3
       We begin by standardizing all given names (e.g., “Ed” and “Eddie” would be
recoded as “Edward”) in both the enlistment records and the census records. A
potential census match is one where the birth state is the same, the race is the same,
the birth year is similar (plus or minus three years), the first initial of the standardized
first names match, and the first initial of the last name matches. We then require
that the raw first and last name strings are reasonably close. Specifically, we require
that the Jaro-Winkler string distance for both the first names and the last names is
greater than or equal to 0.8; a perfect match will have a string distance of 1. We do
not require the names to match exactly for two reasons. First, during this time period
census enumerators went door-to-door and recorded the information that was spoken
to them; thus, the information recorded by the enumerator may represent a common
spelling variant (e.g., “Elliot” and “Elliott”). Second, both the census records and
the enlistment records were handwritten, and so relaxing the “exact name match”
criteria allows us to deal with minor transcription errors.

       A successful enlistment-to-census link is one where there is only one census record
that survives this matching process.5 Note however that the unique record may have
an inconsistently reported birth year. The reason we allow year of birth to vary by
up to three years is to accommodate the fact that the information comes from two
different sources. From the census, we have to infer year of birth from reported age at
the time of enumeration, which likely comes from a parent. The year of birth reported
in the enlistment records, however, comes from the individual. If parents were less

   5
     Recent work by Bailey et al. (2017) has raised concerns about false matches in linking studies.
Our modified linking algorithm (relative to some of our previous work, e.g. Beach et al. (2016))
responds to these concerns in two ways. First, we cast a very wide net to increase the chance that
the true link is in our set of potential matches. Second, if a record has more than one potential
match, rather than try to break that tie by choosing the record with the closest name or closest
age (as was done in our previous work) we simply classify the record as unable to be linked. To
assess the false positive rate with our algorithm we take the full census sample and create a modified
version where we take the original record and modify both the names and ages to incorporate the
types of spelling errors, transcription errors, and misreporting of birth years outlined above and in
Goeken et al. (2017). We then try to link from the original census to the modified census using our
linking algorithm. Our linking algorithm yields a successful match rate of 36.5 percent and a false
positive rate of 1.8 percent. This highlights the conservativeness of our algorithm.


                                                  4
numerate than their children then these numbers may not match. Another practical
consideration is that the 1930 census was enumerated in April and collected age as of
April 1, 1930. Thus, when we link to 1930, our inferred year of birth may be off by
up to one year. Because accurately identifying birth year is essential for identifying
in utero exposure, we further restrict our final linked sample to include only those
whose year of birth matches is consistently reported. This procedure allows us to link
853,141 enlistees to a record in the 1920 or 1930 censuses.



2.2       Measuring in utero flu exposure

With our linked dataset in hand, we now turn our attention to measuring in utero
flu exposure. Ideally we would have individual microdata identifying prenatal flu
exposure (i.e., if and when exposure took place as well as a measure of severity).
These data do not exist. Reliable data on maternal infection rates or morbidity are
also unavailable as influenza morbidity data was not systematically collected prior
to the pandemic. Beginning in 1900, however, annual influenza mortality data were
collected and published in a systematic fashion for registration states and cities.6
Thus, influenza mortality is a natural starting point for assessing in utero exposure.7

       The most important feature of the influenza mortality data series, which was
published alongside other important causes of death on an annual basis by the US
   6
     Registration states and cities are those with laws requiring that mortality statistics be collected.
In contrast to England, which standardized and mandated the reporting of deaths in 1846, the
United States left this decision to state and local governments. Several large cities and states
passed mandatory reporting laws by 1900, and in that year the Census Bureau worked with those
registration areas to establish uniform reporting standards. The result of this was the adoption of a
standardized death certificate and the international classification standard, as well as the distribution
of “The Manual of International Classification of Causes of Death”, which cross referenced terms
appearing in causes of death from 1890 and 1900 reports with the new uniform classification standard.
   7
     Whether influenza mortality tracks influenza morbidity trends reasonably well is a natural ques-
tion. During the fall of 1918, the Public Health Service went door-to-door collecting morbidity and
mortality information for 12 cities. Appendix Figure A.1, which appears in their report, plots weekly
morbidity and mortality rates for five cities during the fall of 1918. The figure indicates the fatality
rate tracks the case rate reasonably well on a weekly basis but with a bit of a lag. Given that we
ultimately draw on annual-level data, this lag is unlikely to be much of a concern.


                                                   5
Census Bureau, is that the underlying data conform to a common reporting standard.
This ensures that we are able to measure flu fatalities with a great degree of precision,
but it does come with one drawback: the data are not comprehensive. Cities and
states were only included in the published reports if the underlying data were deemed
reliable. In 1900 there were 330 registration cities systematically collecting mortality
data, but by 1920 the registration area included 662 cities spanning 41 states.

       While influenza mortality data capture total influenza deaths in 1918, one concern
is that influenza mortality will capture more than just the severity of the pandemic.
For instance, early public health scholars often noted that clean water interventions
lowered mortality from waterborne causes as well as causes that are not typically
thought of as waterborne (e.g., influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia, kidney failure,
and heart failure).8 Relatedly, Clay et al. (2015), document that mortality rates
in 1918 were higher in places with more coal pollution and places with worse water
quality. These relationships are attributable to the fact that air pollution and typhoid
fever compromise an individual’s immune system, making them more susceptible to
influenza. In light of this, observing high influenza mortality rates in 1918 could mean
that a city was hit relatively hard by the pandemic, or that a city had relatively worse
water and air quality, or both. Since air pollution and water quality have also been
shown to impair human capital development, influenza mortality rates may capture
more than in utero flu exposure.9

       Our solution to this problem is as follows. First, we generate a counterfactual
estimate of influenza mortality in 1918. To do so, we transcribe all city-level mortality
statistics spanning 1900-1930 from the annual Mortality Statistics reports. We then
run a series of city-level regressions where we restrict the sample to the 1900-1917
period and regress ln(influenza deaths) on a city-specific linear time trend.10 Taking
   8
     This phenomenon is often referred to as the Mills-Reincke Phenomenon. See Ferrie & Troesken
(2008) for more discussion as well as an empirical test of this theory in Chicago.
   9
     See Sanders (2012) and Isen et al. (2017) on early-life exposure to air pollution and Beach et al.
 (2016) on early-life exposure to typhoid fever.
  10
     We only run these regressions for the 287 cities that appear in every report.


                                                  6
the exponential of the predicted values from this regression yields a prediction of
influenza fatalities in the absence of the pandemic for post-1917 years.11 This allows
us to construct a measure of excess influenza deaths by simply subtracting predicted
influenza deaths in 1918 from actual influenza deaths in 1918.

       This measure of excess deaths gives us the unanticipated increase in influenza
mortality due to the pandemic. Of course, we need to normalize this measure because
excess deaths will be related to city size, and the goal is to have a measure of in
utero exposure to influenza, not in utero exposure to large cities. Our options are
to divide by population or to divide by predicted influenza deaths. Population and
predicted influenza deaths are positively correlated: all else equal, a larger city should
have more predicted influenza deaths. However, dividing by population ignores the
fact that cities of similar sizes may have different underlying disease and pollution
environments. Because of this, normalizing by population will likely overstate flu
intensity for cities with particularly bad health environments. For this reason, and
also because accurate population data are only available in census years, we use
predicted influenza deaths as our denominator. Mechanically this measure is simply
the ratio of the number of excess influenza deaths occurring in 1918 to the number of
expected influenza deaths in 1918, where that expectation captures underlying trends
in population growth and intrinsic differences in disease and pollution environments.

       Appendix Figure A.2 plots the average excess influenza ratio by year. The figure
spans 1900-1917 (the sample period) as well as 1918 through 1930 (our out of sample
predictions).12 There we see the severe and temporary nature of the 1918 pandemic
as well as the overall fit of our model. Excess influenza remains close to zero until
1918, during which approximately 35 influenza deaths occurred for every expected
influenza death. Influenza deaths are higher during than the 1920s than would have

  11
     The natural logarithm ensures that predicted influenza deaths is always greater than zero.
  12
     Alternatively, we could have used data from the 1900-1917 and 1920-1930 years, omitting the
years during which the pandemic occurred. However, if the pandemic had lingering effects on
influenza rates or city population counts, then data from the 1920-1930 period may be endogenous.

Notes: High exposure cities had an excess flu ratio greater than 28.2.



been predicted using the pre-pandemic data, however, even 13 years after 1917, excess
influenza deaths are not far above zero. It appears influenza reached its new steady
state in 1921.

       Figure 1 provides an illustration of the spatial variation in our sample. We plot
separate markers for cities that had above median vs below median exposure to the
pandemic. The median excess flu ratio is 28.2. The key takeaway from Figure 1 is
that there is meaningful sub-state variation in our measure of flu intensity: there are
many situations where neighboring cities had different exposure to the pandemic.13
This level of spatial variation, which has not been exploited in prior studies, will be
particularly useful for examining the long-run effects of the pandemic.

       Appendix Figure A.3 plots a continuous version of this figure.

       Combining our linked dataset with our measure of excess influenza yields a final
sample of 218,662 linked records. The reduction in sample size largely stems from
the fact that many of our linked individuals did not live in a city for which we can
calculate exposure to the pandemic.14 Summary statistics are reported in Appendix
Table A.1. The average years of schooling for our sample is 11.4 with about 54 percent
of our sample completing high school. In terms of family characteristics, the literacy
rates among mothers and fathers were quite high at 94 and 92 percent, respectively.
About 36 percent of families owned their homes and only 4.5 percent of mothers were
in the labor force at the time of enumeration.




3        Empirical Approach

We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the impact of in utero flu
exposure on adult outcomes. Specifically we estimate variations of two regressions.
For the first, we regress:


                yibc = α0 + βb + γc + δ1 [yob = 1919] × Highc + ΓXi0 + ibc                        (1)

where yibc is outcome y of individual i from birth year b in birth city c. The parameters
βb and γc are birth year and birth city fixed effects, respectively. The variable Highc
is equal to one if city c had above median excess influenza in 1918. Our baseline
specification restricts our analysis to a narrow window (cohorts born in 1918, 1919,
or 1920) to better isolate the effect of in utero exposure. The vector Xi includes
additional controls such as race and parental characteristics. For some specifications,
  14
     We are unable to use 597,486 of our original links because we do not have flu data for their birth
city. We throw out an additional 26,556 links because the child is not observed with both parents
at the time of enumeration and we throw out an additional 4,296 links because one or more of the
relevant parental controls is missing. Next we discard an additional 6,141 links because the parental
age at time of birth is implausible (e.g., mother or father’s age at the time of birth is over the age
of 50 or under the age of 18). We discard these observations because we are concerned that the
indicated mother or father is not actually the birth mother or birth father.


                                                  9
we only estimate a treatment effect for the 1919 birth cohort and include birth-city
linear time trends. Standard errors are clustered at the birth city level.

   Figure 2 depicts this identification strategy (and one of our main results). Specif-
ically, we plot the average high school graduate rate by birth cohort for cities that
will ultimately have above and below median exposure to the pandemic. To ease
interpretation, we normalize high school graduation rates at the city-level. The figure
reveals that for the 1909 to 1916 birth cohorts, graduation rates in cities with above
and below median exposure tended to follow a nearly identical trend. Beginning with
the 1917 cohort the average graduation rates start to fall relative to previous trends
for both groups and the effects appear to be much more severe for those born in cities
with above average exposure to the pandemic. While the 1919 cohort experiences the
largest deviation from trend, by 1920 graduation rates appear to return to normal.

   Figure 2 indicates that this difference-in-difference strategy is likely to satisfy the
parallel trends assumption. However, it is worth noting that the slight deviations
in trend for the 1917-1919 cohorts in low exposure cities may be due to early life
pandemic exposure. A large literature has shown that early life exposure to disease
and deprivation also impairs human capital development (Currie & Almond (2011)).
Our regressions, however, treat those deviations as the counterfactual trend that
would have been observed in high exposure cities if the pandemic had never occurred.
To the extent that the stagnation in low exposure (i.e. control) cities is due to the
pandemic, our estimates can be thought of as a lower bound.

   While the previous specification assigns above median excess influenza cities as
the treatment group and below median excess influenza cities as the control group,
our second specification uses continuous variation in treatment status:

                                                     flu1918,c
   yibc = α0 + βb + γc + δ1 [yob = 1919] ×                            + ΓXi0 + ibc .   (2)
                                             E(flu1918,c |yob = 1919)

The variable flu1918,c is excess influenza in 1918 for city c. This variable is divided by

4     Results

Before proceeding to our main results, Table 1 provides additional support for our
identification strategy. Each column corresponds to a different parental characteristic:
father’s age when the child was born, father’s occupational income score, whether the
father is literate, whether the father is foreign born, mother’s age when the child was
born, whether the mother is employed, whether the mother is literate, whether the
mother is foreign born, whether the family owns their home, and number of siblings.
All of these characteristics are available from the census where we observe the child
with his parents. We take each of these characteristics as outcome variables and

                                                                                          11
estimate equations 1 and 2. The coefficients of interest from those specifications are
the interaction between being born in 1919 and pandemic intensity.

   None of the 20 regressions presented in Table 1 are statistically significant and
many of the coefficients are close to zero. This is reassuring as it suggests that the
parental selection concerns raised by Brown & Thomas (2018) are not also systemat-
ically related to the intensity of the pandemic. In other words, an empirical approach
that includes cohort fixed effects and instead relies on variation in pandemic intensity
as a source of variation is likely to lend itself to a causal interpretation.

   Having established the credibility of our identification strategy, we now turn our
focus to long-run outcomes. Our main results are presented in Figure 3. The top
panels consider high school graduation as the outcome of interest while the bottom
panels consider height at the time of enlistment. These are the main economic and
biological outcomes that are available in the enlistment records. The left panels use
the discrete treatment from equation 1 while the right panels use the continuous
exposure from equation 2.

   Within each panel we present results from four specifications. The baseline spec-
ifications correspond directly to equations 1 and 2. The “W/Parental Controls”
specifications add all of the family characteristics that we examined in Table 1. The
“W/City Time Trends” specifications include both the family characteristic controls
and city-specific linear time trends. Finally, the “No 1920” specifications return to
the baseline but omit the 1920 cohort, such that the analysis simply compares the
1919 birth cohort against the 1918 birth cohort. We omit the 1920 cohort for two
reasons. The first is to ease any concerns about the 1920 cohort being observed in the
1930 census while the 1918 and 1919 birth cohorts are observed in the 1920 census.
The second is because omitting the 1920 cohort offers the most conservative test of
the Fetal Origins Hypothesis, as the implicit counterfactual to in utero exposure is
exposure during infancy. Thus, this specification allows us to ask whether in utero
exposure matters more than exposure in the post-natal period.

Each entry is the coefficient obtained from regressing the indicated outcome variable on the defined
measure of flu intensity as well as cohort fixed effects and birth city fixed effects. Each regression
includes 71,026 observations, corresponding to the linked birth cohorts born in 1918, 1919, or 1920.
The above median exposure specifications interact an indicator for being born in 1919 with another
indicator for being born in a city that had above median pandemic exposure (as measured by the
excess influenza rate). The continuous treatment specifications interact each city’s excess influenza
rate with an indicator for being born in 1919. We standardize the excess influenza rate by dividing
by the mean excess influenza rate, such that the coefficient can be interpreted as the pandemic’s
average impact.

Notes: Sample consists of 71,026 individuals when the outcomes are high school completion and
42,424 observations when the outcome is height. Each regression includes cohort fixed effects and
city fixed effects. The “W/Parental Controls” specifications add all of the family characteristics
that we examined in Table 1. The “W/City Time Trends” specifications include both the family
characteristic controls but also add in city-specific linear time trends. High exposure cities had an
excess flu ratio greater than 28.2.




                                                                     14
      The results in Figure 3 are remarkably stable. We consistently find that in utero
exposure decreased the likelihood of completing high school by about 1 to 1.5 per-
centage points. Each of these estimates is statistically significant at roughly the 5%
level. For height, however, we find statistically insignificant effects. Moreover, the
95% confidence interval is not economically meaningful, as it suggests that in utero
exposure may have affected height at the time of enlistment by up to one-tenth of
an inch. Given the lack of statistical and practical significance, we interpret this as
evidence that the pandemic did not meaningfully affect the height of enlistees.



5       Evidence from a wider set of cohorts

The previous section provided results from a narrow band of birth cohorts. As men-
tioned previously, these results are somewhat conservative because one of the two
control cohorts (those born in 1918) are treated in the sense that they were exposed
to the pandemic during infancy. In contrast to the results in the previous section,
which only consider the 1918, 1919, and 1920 birth cohorts, the results in this section
will consider every cohort from 1909 through 1922. The advantage of this expansion
is that it allows us to construct a sufficiently large sample of brothers such that we
can eventually include household fixed effects.

      These results are presented in Table 2. Panel A presents results for high school
graduation, Panel B presents results for total years of schooling, and Panel C presents
results for height. In each panel, the first row models exposure as a simple indicator
for being born in a high exposure city in 1919 and the second row models in utero
exposure by interacting each city’s excess influenza rate with an indicator for being
born in 1919. Column 1 presents our baseline results. In column 2 we add controls for
our parental characteristics (described above), while in column 3 we add city-specific
linear trends. In column 4 we focus on brothers and add household fixed effects.15
 15
      Since the 1909 to 1919 cohorts are observed in the 1920 census and the 1920 to 1922 cohorts


                                                15
    We find robust evidence that the pandemic decreased high school graduation rates
by about 2 percentage points. This result survives the inclusion of household fixed
effects when we model in utero exposure continuously, but the p-value falls just outside
the 10-percent level of significance when those with below median exposure to the
pandemic are considered as part of the control group. For schooling, we find consistent
and negative effects, but we lose statistical significance in the household fixed effects
specification. In the Appendix we show that omitting the 1930 links (the 1920 to
1922 birth cohorts) has little effect on our estimates.

    Turning to biological outcomes, we find no effect on heights when influenza is
measured discretely and, as before, the estimated coefficient is close to zero. When
influenza exposure is measured continuously, the pandemic appears to have increased
heights but this result is not robust to the inclusion of household fixed effects. Even
for the specifications that are statistically significant, however, the estimates are
not economically significant. The estimates suggests that the pandemic may have
increased heights by less than one twentieth of one inch.16 In the appendix we consider
weight and BMI at the time of enlistment and find no evidence that these outcomes
were affected by in utero exposure to the pandemic. When we consider the totality of
these results, we conclude that there is little consistent evidence that the pandemic
impaired health as measured at the time of enlistment. Of course, it is worth pointing
out that these results should be interpreted with the caveat that we are observing
enlistees in their 20s and 30s. Thus, it is possible that these results are driven by the
fact that unfit individuals will not appear in our sample or that many of the health
effects (e.g., heart disease) will not manifest for another 10 to 20 years or more.

are observed in the 1930 census, we won’t observe any of the 1920 to 1922 birth cohorts with their
older brothers born before 1920. To remedy this we go back to census manuscripts and identify
any older brothers that are still in the household in 1930. If any of those older brothers happen
to be successfully linked between the enlistment records and 1920, then we are able to generate a
household identifier that is consistent regardless of whether the brother was born in 1909-1919 (and
thus enumerated in 1920) or born between 1920 and 1922 (and thus enumerated in 1930).
  16
     To put this in perspective, Parman (2015a) relates enlistee height to state and city-level disease
environments and finds that a standard deviation increase in infant mortality rates decreases height
by 0.3 inches, nearly 6 times greater than the effect we find.

the father and mother are foreign born, an indicator for whether the mother was in the labor force
at the time of enumeration, an indicator for whether the family owns their home, and number of

indicator for being born in 1919. We standardize the excess influenza rate by dividing by the mean

6        Discussion

Overall the results in the previous two sections are remarkably consistent. The ability
to include household fixed effects increases our confidence that the previous results
are not due to parental selection but are instead attributable to exposure to the pan-
demic. In short, we conclude that in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic
did impair human capital development. One natural question, however, is why we
find evidence that is consistent with Almond (2006) while Brown & Thomas (2018)
find that Almond’s results are not robust to the inclusion of proxies of parental char-
acteristics as controls.

       There are many differences between our sample and the samples analyzed by
Almond (2006) and Brown & Thomas (2018). We examine a linked sample of males
that resided with both parents at the time of enumeration and ultimately enlisted
in WWII. Moreover, due to our desire to exploit variation in pandemic intensity,
we further require that our individuals resided in a city at the time of enumeration.
Because we examine outcomes at the time of enlistment, our outcome variables are
measured anywhere from 20 to 40 years earlier than in Almond (2006) and Brown &
Thomas (2018).

       In light of these differences, it is perhaps useful to try and draw a closer comparison
between our results and the results that appear in Almond (2006) and Brown &
Thomas (2018). Section VI of Almond (2006) asks whether there is evidence of a
dose response. To do so, he constructs a proxy for state-level maternal infection
rates and runs a series of regressions that are otherwise quite similar to our main
results (i.e. restricting to the 1918, 1919, and 1920 birth cohorts).17 The primary

  17
    Almond defines the maternal infection rate for the 1918, 1919, and 1920 cohorts as follows:
                             M M Rs,1918 −M M Rs,1917                    M M Rs,1919 −M M Rs,1917
M IRs,1918 = 0; M IRs,1919 =     κ−M M Rs,1917        ; and M IRs,1920 =     κ−M M Rs,1917        , where
M IRs,t denotes the maternal infection rate for cohorts born in state s during year t, M M Rs,t
denotes that maternal mortality rate in state s during year t (the year in which the child was in
utero); and κ denotes maternal mortality conditional on influenza infection (1.4%).


                                                   18
limitation of this proxy relative to our preferred proxy is that it only exploits state-
level variation, and thus does not fully exploit geographic variation in pandemic
exposure. A second issue is that this proxy does not incorporate actual influenza
mortality data. Nevertheless, when Brown & Thomas (2018) revisit this analysis they
show that including their proxies for parental characteristics as controls attenuates
Almond’s findings, but notably unlike earlier specifications the inclusion of these
controls does not flip the sign of the coefficient.

   We reconstruct this maternal infection rate proxy, which allows us to draw compar-
isons between our findings and the findings in Almond (2006) and Brown & Thomas
(2018). We present these results graphically in Figure 4. The baseline specification
corresponds to equation 2 in that it includes cohort fixed effects and city fixed effects,
but instead of continuous excess influenza as our treatment we use the maternal in-
fection rate proxy described above. The next specification – “Almond” – corresponds
to Brown & Thomas’s replication of Almond, using the 5% sample from the 1960
census. Column 3 – “W/Parental Controls” – returns to our baseline specification
but includes each of our 10 family background characteristics. Column 4 – “Brown
and Thomas” – corresponds to the estimates that Brown & Thomas produce when
they include their proxies for parental characteristics. As is clear from this figure,
results are consistent across all four specifications: it is not possible to reject equality
for any of these coefficients at standard levels of significance.

   We interpret Figure 4 as suggestive evidence that our findings are not driven by
the differences in samples. Appendix Table A.4 presents additional evidence in favor
of this conclusion. There we apply the maternal infection rate approach to the 1918-
1920 birth cohorts as observed in the 100% files of the 1940 census. The 1940 offers a
unique set of advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the 1940 census is that
we are able to observe all enumerated individuals, which alleviates concerns about
the bias of our linked sample. Further, roughly half of the individuals born between
1918 and 1920 (and born in states for which we can compute the maternal infection

Notes: The baseline specification and “W/Parental Controls” specification analyze 1918, 1919, and
1920 birth cohorts from our linked sample. Sample is further restricted to those residing in a state for
which maternal mortality data are available. Each of these regressions includes cohort fixed effects
and city fixed effects. The “W/Parental Controls” specifications add all of the family characteristics
that we examined in Table 1.This sample includes 53,214 linked individuals. Maternal infection
rate is calculated as in Almond (2006). The “Almond” and “Brown and Thomas” specifications are
recreated from Table 7 of Brown & Thomas (2018).

rate) are observed with both of their parents. This means that the 1940 census offers
a rare opportunity to observe adult outcomes and parental characteristics at the same
time. The fundamental drawback of the 1940 census, however, is that the reference
date for the age question is April 1, 1940, which means that year of birth is measured
much less precisely.

   Appendix Table A.4 presents two sets of results. Panel A examines the impact of
the in utero exposure on high school graduation rates. Column 1 examines the full
census, while column 2 restricts the sample to the set of individuals that still reside
at home. For those individuals, column 3 includes a host of parental controls. In all
three specifications we see that in utero exposure decreased the likelihood that the
individual would graduate high school. The point estimates are roughly half of the
size of our baseline effect in the enlistment sample, perhaps reflecting that we are
measuring in utero exposure with less precision.

   Panel B of Appendix Table A.4 applies the same empirical specification but con-
siders 8 different parental characteristics as outcome variables (whether the individ-
ual’s mother or father graduated high school, mother and father’s age when the child
was born, whether the individual’s mom was foreign born, whether the individual’s
parents were employed, and the father’s occupational income score). Most of the
coefficients are not economically meaningful, and only “mother is foreign born” is
statistically significant at conventional levels. This panel suggests that this empirical
approach is in fact a credible identification strategy.

   In light of these results, it is an open question as to why Brown & Thomas (2018)
find that including proxies for parental controls reverses Almond’s original findings.
One potential explanation may stem from the fact that Brown & Thomas (2018) are
forced to use proxies for parental characteristics, which can be problematic if those
proxies are systematically mismeasured.

    To explore this further, let us consider a simple human capital model where son
i’s educational attainment (yison ) depends on in utero influenza exposure (flui ), his

                                           21
father’s educational attainment (yifather ), and exogenous unobserved characteristics
(i ), which are independent of the other explanatory variables, so that:


                               yison = βflui + γyifather + i .                             (3)


Further assume that as in Brown & Thomas and Almond, flui is an indicator variable
that affects all children from the 1919 birth cohort and otherwise equals zero. Esti-
mation of equation 3 would yield consistent estimates of β if y son , flu , and y father
                                                                      i        i        i

were observable.

    The advantage of our linked data approach is that we are able to observe all three
of these variables. Brown & Thomas, however, do not observe yifather . Instead,
Brown & Thomas observe average parental characteristics for a state-year cell. As-
suming the observed averages correspond to the truth, we can express these parental
characteristics as ȳ father = y father + ν , where ν is the deviation from the mean for
                     s,t        i          i          i
                                               father .18 Since flu is only a function
father i and is by assumption independent of ȳs,t                 i

of t, it follows that νi is also independent of flui . Then estimation of


                               yison = βflui + γ ȳs,t
                                                   father + u
                                                             i                              (4)


yields consistent estimates since ui = −γνi + i , both of which are exogenous to
the explanatory variables. Thus, if parental characteristics are accurately measured,
Brown & Thomas’s inclusion of proxies would successfully account for parental char-
acteristics and return causal estimates of the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic.
                          father is mismeasured. This mismeasurement could be due to

average parental characteristics to be biased downwards for heaped ages and upwards
for non-age heaped ages. Note that Brown & Thomas obtain parental characteristics

The error can be written as ηi = γ(es,t − νi ) + , which is correlated with flui be-
cause those exposed to the pandemic in utero are also assigned lower SES parental
characteristics due to age heaping. This is precisely the bias we aim to overcome.

   While age heaping offers an illustrative example, it is worth noting that Brown &
Thomas discuss the age heaping phenomenon in their paper and they conclude that
age heaping is not an issue. Of course, age heaping is just one potential source of
bias. Brown & Thomas use parental characteristics as measured in 1930 or 1920 as
controls when estimating outcomes in 1960, 1970, or 1980). An alternative source of
bias could be selective mortality (e.g., if low SES children are less likely to survive to
be enumerated in the 1960, 1970, or 1980 censuses). If there is any complementarity
between this mortality phenomenon and exposure to the pandemic, then Brown &
Thomas’s proxies for parental characteristics will again be systematically mismea-
sured. The only way to confidently overcome this problem is to use linked data,
which is not possible for Brown & Thomas since they analyze censuses that are not
yet publicly available.

7      Conclusion

Almond (2006) provides some of the first evidence in economics in favor of the fetal
origins hypothesis by analyzing the 1918 influenza pandemic as a natural experiment.
A key assumption of Almond’s work is that the 1919 birth cohort would have had
similar outcomes to adjacent birth cohorts if the pandemic had never occurred. This
assumption is not obvious since other events coincided with the pandemic, most
notably the height of WWI. Brown & Thomas (2018) argue that, because servicemen
were positively selected from the pool of potential fathers, the 1919 birth cohort had
systematically lower SES parents. After accounting for these differences in parental
characteristics, they find that the long-run effects of the pandemic disappear.

     We estimate the long-run effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic using linked
data and city-level variation in influenza exposure. Using linked data allows us to
accurately observe parental characteristics with minimal measurement error. Thus,
we can directly control for parental differences in the 1919 birth cohort. Second, using
city-level data allows us to more accurately measure the local influenza environment
and provides us with the necessary variation to include birth cohort fixed effects.
Results indicate that the 1918 influenza pandemic reduced educational attainment
and the estimates are similar in magnitude to those in Almond (2006).

8     Appendix

This appendix presents additional figures and tables that were not included in the
primary draft.

    Figure A.1 reproduces a graph from Frost (1920) in order to illustrate that in-
fluenza mortality rates track influenza morbidity rates reasonably well. The slight
lag observed in Figure A.1 is not a concern for us because we use annual rather than
weekly data to construct our measure of excess influenza.

    Figure A.2 plots average excess influenza ratios by year. Note that our sample
period is 1900-1917 whereas the 1918-1930 observations are our out of sample pre-
dictions. Our model fits the data reasonably very well in the pre pandemic period.
The observations in the post pandemic period (1922 and beyond) are noisier, but
still close to zero. Further there is no indication of a post pandemic trend in excess
influenza.

    Figure A.3 depicts the spatial variation of excess influenza. The size of each circle
relates to the magnitude of exposure. While less clean than the discrete figure in
the draft (Figure 1), we continue to see substantial sub-state variation in pandemic
exposure.

1909-1919 birth cohorts or 1930 for the 1920-1922 cohorts. OccScore is the median income for a
particular occupation as measured in 1950. This variable is measured in hundreds of 1950 dollars.

the father and mother are foreign born, an indicator for whether the mother was in the labor force
at the time of enumeration, an indicator for whether the family owns their own home, and number
of siblings. The continuous treatment specifications interact each city’s excess influenza rate with
an indicator for being born in 1919. We standardize the excess influenza rate by dividing by the
mean excess influenza rate, such that the coefficient can be interpreted as the pandemic’s average
impact.
