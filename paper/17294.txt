                                             ABSTRACT

Many theoretical models of labor market search imply a tight link between worker flows (hires and
separations) and job gains and losses at the employer level. Partly motivated by these theories, we
exploit establishment-level data from U.S. sources to study the relationship between worker flows
and job flows in the cross section and over time. We document strong, highly nonlinear relationships
of hiring, quit and layoff rates to employer growth in the cross section. Simple statistical models that
capture these cross-sectional relationships greatly improve our ability to account for fluctuations in
aggregate worker flows. We also evaluate how well various theoretical models and views fit the patterns
in the data. Aggregate fluctuations in layoffs are well captured by micro specifications that impose
a tight cross-sectional link between worker flows and job flows. Aggregate fluctuations in quits are
not. Instead, quit rates rise and fall with booms and recessions across the distribution of establishment
growth rates, but more so at shrinking employers. Finally, we use our preferred statistical models –
in combination with data on the cross-sectional distribution of establishment growth rates – to construct
synthetic JOLTS-type measures of hires, separations, quits and layoffs back to 1990.

1. Introduction

          Many theoretical models of labor market search carry strong implications for the relationship of

hires and separations to job gains and losses at the employer level. Partly motivated by these theories,

we exploit establishment-level data from U.S. sources to study the empirical relationship between

worker flows and job flows in the cross section and over time. The evidence supports a hybrid view that

incorporates aspects of several distinct theories of labor market dynamics. Tracking the cross-sectional

distribution of establishment growth rates, and applying simple models of cross-sectional behavior,

greatly improves our ability to account for aggregate fluctuations in hires, separations, quits and layoffs.

          Previous work has not delivered a thorough and convincing explanation for the relationship

between worker flows and job flows. One difficulty is that worker flow and job flow measures typically

derive from different data sources, and are comparable only at high levels of aggregation. Even then,

standard sources of data on these measures differ in scope, sampling frequency and other respects that

hinder direct comparison. We overcome these difficulties by exploiting micro data from the Job

Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). JOLTS data yield internally consistent measures of

hires, separations, quits, layoffs, job creation and job destruction at the establishment and aggregate

levels.

          To deal with weaknesses in the JOLTS sample design, we rely on the comprehensive Business

Employment Dynamics (BED) to track the cross-sectional distribution of establishment-level growth

rates over time. Specifically, we combine BED data on the establishment growth rate distribution with

JOLTS data for hires, separations, layoffs and quits conditional on establishment growth rates to

measure the aggregate worker flow rates. Combining JOLTS and BED data also enables us to construct

synthetic data on worker flows back to 1990, nearly doubling the time-series length of JOLTS-type

worker flow measures.


                                                      1
        To guide our empirical work, we consider several theoretical models. Models in the spirit of

seminal work by Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) (hereafter MP) imply a tight link between job flows

and worker flows. Our empirical work assesses how closely models with these tight links fit the data.

We also consider empirical specifications motivated by models that stress the role of search on the job,

learning about match quality, firm profitability, and the impact of aggregate conditions on the propensity

to quit. We evaluate alternative specifications in terms of their fit to cross-sectional patterns in the

establishment-level data, their ability to generate the observed movements in aggregate worker flows,

and their marginal explanatory power for aggregate worker flows after conditioning on aggregate

variables.

        Figures 1 and 2 plot our quarterly, seasonally adjusted time series for JOLTS-type worker flow

measures, along with job creation and destruction rates from the BED.1 All rates cover the nonfarm

private sector and are expressed as a percent of employment. We define job creation as the sum of

employment gains at new and expanding establishments as in Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996).

We define job destruction analogously. Figure 1 shows that job destruction and layoffs move together

over time, while quits move counter to both. Job destruction and layoffs exhibit pronounced spikes in

late 2008 and early 2009 and then decline in nearly parallel fashion. Figure 2 shows that job creation

and hires rates decline from 2006, bottom out in 2009Q1, and then partly recover. The hiring rate

moves much more than the job creation rate over this period. Our study explores the micro level sources

of these aggregate movements.

        Looking across establishments, hiring and separation rates exhibit powerful elements of the

“iron-link” behavior implied by MP-style search models. That is, hires are tightly linked to job creation,

1
  To conform to the BED sampling frequency, we cumulate monthly establishment-level JOLTS observations to the quarterly
frequency. We then construct our aggregate worker flow series by combining the cross-sectional relationships of worker
flows to establishment-level growth rates in JOLTS micro data with employment growth rate distributions from the BED.
This approach, described more fully in Section III below, follows Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger and Rucker (2010). Worker
flows prior to 2001Q3 in Figures 1 and 2 are synthetic data, constructed as described in Section V below.

                                                           2
and separations are tightly linked to job destruction. When plotted as functions of establishment-level

growth rates, hiring and separation rates exhibit nonlinear “hockey-stick” shapes. The hires relation is

nearly flat to the left of zero growth (contracting employers) and rises more than one-for-one with

employment growth to the right of zero (expanding employers), with a pronounced kink at zero. The

separations relation is a mirror image of the hires relation. The hockey-stick shape for separations is

starkly at odds with the simplifying assumption adopted in many search models of a uniform separation

rate. Turning to the components of separations, both quits and layoffs rise with job destruction, but

layoffs dominate the adjustment margin for rapidly contracting establishments. We also consider how

the cross-sectional relations vary with aggregate conditions. As it turns out, the cross-sectional layoff

relation is highly stable over time. In contrast, the cross-sectional quit relation varies markedly with

aggregate conditions. Specifically, the quit relation shifts downward when aggregate conditions are

weak, especially at contracting establishments.

       Several theoretical models provide insight into the reasons for departures from an iron-link

relationship between worker flows and job flows. Faberman and Nagypál (2008) consider a model of

on-the-job search that delivers an “abandon-ship” effect at struggling employers. Firms vary in their

idiosyncratic profitability and grow faster when more profitable. Because wages increase with firm

profits in their model, workers at low-profitability firms are more likely to accept an outside offer.

Consequently, quit rates decline with the idiosyncratic component of firm profitability. Barlevy (2002)

considers a model with on-the-job search and a match-specific component of productivity. Because

firms create fewer vacancies when aggregate conditions are weak, employed workers encounter better

matches at a slower pace during recessions. As a result, workers tend to remain longer in poor matches,

which Barlevy refers to as the “sullying” effect of recessions. In sum, Faberman and Nagypál highlight

the role of cross-sectional variation in firm-level circumstances for quit rates, whereas Barlevy



                                                      3
highlights the role of variation over time in aggregate conditions. Our evidence indicates that both

effects are at work.

       In Jovanovic (1979, 1985) and Moscarini (2005), gradual learning about match quality leads to a

separation rate that declines with match tenure. Because more rapid growth involves a higher share of

young matches, these models suggest that separations rise with the growth rate of expanding employers.

Pries and Rogerson (2005) integrate elements of Jovanovic-style learning into an MP model.

Separations occur because of job destruction, as in the MP model, and because of learning effects about

match quality. Thus, the model of Pries and Rogerson generates elements of iron-link behavior in hires

and separations while rationalizing a positive relationship between separations and growth at expanding

employers. The data support this hybrid view of the cross-sectional relationship between hires,

separations and employer growth.

       Motivated by these theoretical ideas, we develop parsimonious statistical models of how worker

flows vary in the cross section, and how the cross-sectional relations move over time. The statistical

models serve three objectives. First, they provide guidance in evaluating, developing and calibrating

theoretical models of labor market flows. Second, they allow us to investigate whether tracking the

cross-sectional growth distribution adds to our understanding of aggregate movements in labor market

flows. Third, they yield a framework for constructing synthetic data on aggregate hires, separations,

quits and layoffs in the period before the advent of JOLTS.

       When we consider specifications that impose time-invariant relations of worker flows to

employer growth rates in the cross section, the statistical models perform reasonably well in tracking the

aggregate movements of hiring and layoff rates. However, the same type of model fails miserably in

tracking the aggregate behavior of quits. Consequently, it also fares poorly in accounting for the




                                                    4
aggregate separations rate. When we allow the worker flow-employer growth relationships to vary with

aggregate conditions, our ability to track aggregate quits and separations improves dramatically.

       Our work in this paper has many antecedents. There is a large body of previous research on job

flows and worker flows. We review research in this area in Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) and Davis,

Faberman and Haltiwanger (2006). Labor market flows and job vacancies play central roles in modern

theories of unemployment based on search and matching models. See, for example, Pissarides (2000),

Rogerson, Shimer and Wright (2005) and Yashiv (2007) for reviews of work in this area. Models that

treat hires as the outcome of a matching function carry implications for the relationship between hires

and vacancies in the cross section and over time. We explore some of those implications in Davis,

Faberman and Haltiwanger (2010).

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section II discusses the conceptual underpinnings that guide our

empirical work. We start with the model of Cooper, Haltiwanger and Willis (2006), which extends the

basic MP model to multi-worker firms. We then consider models that endogenize the worker’s quit

decision, as in Faberman and Nagypál (2008) and Barlevy (2002), and conclude with models of learning

about match quality, such as Jovanovic (1979). Section III describes our data and empirical measures.

Section IV presents our statistical models and investigates how well they account for worker flows in the

cross section and over time. Section V constructs synthetic JOLTS-type data on worker flows, and

Section VI concludes.


2. Conceptual Underpinnings and Theoretical Implications

   In thinking about worker flows and job flows, it is useful to begin with an identity:

                                                eit = eit −1 + hit − l it − q it ,                        (1)

where e it is employment at establishment i in period t and h, l and q denote hires, layoffs and quits.

Separations are the sum of quits and layoffs. Theory provides guidance about how employers use hires,

                                                       5
layoffs and quits to adjust employment and about the factors that lead to worker turnover in excess of

employment changes. In what follows in this section, we first consider search and matching models that

involve an “iron link” between hires and job creation on the one hand and separations and job

destruction on the other. We then consider theories that relax the iron link. Lastly, we discuss aggregate

implications and motivate our empirical specifications.


2.1. Models with an Iron Link

        Every hire reflects a newly created job in the canonical search and matching model of Mortensen

and Pissarides (1994), and every separation reflects a job that vanishes. That is what we mean by an

iron link between worker flows and job flows. One goal of our study is to assess how well this iron link

characterizes the data. However, the basic MP model has no role for multi-worker employers, an

essential aspect of our empirical work. So we borrow from Cooper, Haltiwanger and Willis (2007,

CHW) to illustrate the implications of the iron link in a multi-worker version of MP.2

        Employers in the CHW model face common and idiosyncratic shocks and produce output

according to a strictly concave function of the labor input. When hiring new workers, employers incur

fixed and variable costs of posting vacancies. Workers separate for exogenous reasons, and some

employers layoff additional workers subject to fixed and variable firing costs. Employers choose layoffs

and vacancies – effectively, hires as well – to maximize the present discounted value of profits. Workers

do not search on the job.

        The following law of motion links employment changes and worker flows in CHW:

                                                  eit = (1 − q )eit −1 + η (U t , Vt )v it − l it ,                     (2)




2
 Other recent search-theoretic analyses with multi-worker firms include Elsby and Michaels (2008), Veracierto (2009),
Fujita and Nakajima (2010), Schaal (2010) and Trapeznikova (2010).

                                                              6
where q is the quit rate, η (U t , Vt ) is the job-filling rate, and vit is the number of vacancies posted at the

beginning of the period.3 The job-filling rate derives from a standard matching function with constant

returns to scale in the aggregate numbers of unemployed workers and vacant jobs. Period-t hires for the

employer are hit = η (U t , Vt )v it .

           An employer in the CHW model operates in one of three regions each period, depending on the

aggregate and idiosyncratic shock values: (i) positive vacancies and zero layoffs, (ii) zero vacancies and

positive layoffs, or (iii) an inaction region with zero vacancies, no layoffs and no replacement hiring.

Solving the model yields a stochastic equilibrium path for the cross-sectional distribution of

employment changes, hires, quits and layoffs. The realized path depends in complex ways on the

interaction of the aggregate and idiosyncratic driving forces and the key parameters of the revenue, cost

and matching functions. Aggregate shocks shift the entire cross-sectional distribution of growth rates,

while parameters governing adjustment costs and the variance of idiosyncratic shocks strongly influence

its shape. Model-based outcomes exhibit an iron-link mapping of job flows to hiring, layoffs, and quits.

           Figure 3 depicts the iron link. It shows the relationship of the hiring, layoff, and quit rates to

employer growth rates in the cross section. There is a mass point with no hiring or layoffs at growth rate

− q . To the right of − q , employers post vacancies and hire new workers. Employers in this range

have zero layoffs, and hiring rises one-for-one with increases in employment. To the left of − q ,

employers engage in no hiring and the layoff rate rises one-for-one with the rate at which the employer

contracts.

           Given the iron link relations illustrated in Figure 3, the cross-sectional distribution of

employment growth rates fully determines aggregate hires and layoffs. This feature of the model has

interesting implications. For example, modest recessions that shift the central tendency of the cross-


3
    We use uppercase letters for aggregate quantities and lowercase letters for establishment outcomes.

                                                                7
sectional distribution from positive values to a value near zero produce large drops in aggregate hires

with relatively little increase in aggregate layoffs. In contrast, a deep recession that shifts much of the

mass in the cross-sectional distribution across the kink point in Figure 3 produces a large jump in

layoffs. Thus, the highly nonlinear micro relations in Figure 3 imply differential responses of hires and

layoffs to mild and deep recessions. Below, we treat the aggregate implications of cross-sectional

worker flow relations in a more formal manner.


2.2. Relaxing the Iron Link

       There are several ways to relax the iron link feature of MP-style models. If we exogenously vary

the quit rate in the CHW model, we obtain the implications shown in Figure 4. As the quit rate varies,

the kink point moves and the layoff and hires relations shift accordingly. Specifically, a fall in the quit

rate from q (G 0 ) to q(G1 ) causes the cross-sectional hiring and layoff relations to shift rightward. That

is, the fall in the quit rate creates an environment where employers require fewer hires when expanding

and more layoffs when contracting to achieve a given growth rate. More generally, if the quit rate varies

systematically with labor market slack, then so do the cross-sectional relations for hires and layoffs.

This insight applies in more complex models as well.

       Models with endogenous quit behavior deliver other interesting implications. As discussed in

the introduction, the model of Faberman and Nagypál (2008) implies that quit rates decline with

employer growth rates in the cross section. Workers are more likely to abandon struggling employers

because they pay lower wages and cannot match outside offers from more profitable employers.

Inspecting Figures 3 and 4, it is apparent that a nonlinear quit relation implies nonlinear relations for one

or both of hires and layoffs as well. Somewhat paradoxically, weaker employers face greater needs for

replacement hiring to offset, at least partly, a greater attrition rate. Thus, the model of Faberman and

Nagypál can deliver a negative slope in the hires relation over some range. In the model of Barlevy

                                                      8
(2002), employers post fewer vacancies when aggregate conditions are weak. As a result, poorly

matched employees encounter new job opportunities at a slower rate, and they quit less frequently. This

implication of the Barlevy model provides an explanation for the downward shift in the quit rate in

Figure 4 and the resulting shifts in the layoff and hiring relations.

       Models that feature learning about match quality as in Jovanovic (1979) yield additional insights.

Under weak conditions, these models imply that employment relationships dissolve at a rate that

declines with match duration. A newly hired worker is more likely to quit because he learns a job is not

to his liking, or to be fired because his employer learns he cannot perform. Naturally, the proportion of

new employees tends to rise with an employer’s expansion rate. Thus, learning about match quality can

cause quits and layoffs to rise with the growth rate of employment at expanding employers. Learning

also leads to additional separations at shrinking employers when recent replacement hires do not work

out. More generally, learning about match quality implies that worker flows beget further worker flows,

as stressed by Hall (1995), Pries (2004), and Pries and Rogerson (2005).

       The lesson of this discussion is that the stark relations depicted in Figures 3 and 4 are too simple

to fully capture the patterns in the data. Nevertheless, we think Figures 3 and 4 are useful starting points

for two reasons. First, they provide a straightforward exposition of the links between worker flows and

establishment-level growth in a prominent class of search models. We will investigate how closely the

data conform to the relations exhibited in Figures 3 and 4. Second, our discussion provides guidance for

formulating statistical models that relate worker flows to employer growth rates.


2.3. Implications for Aggregate Outcomes and the Relationship to Cross-Sectional Behavior

       To draw out the aggregate implications of the iron link relation and the other theoretical effects

discussed above, express the aggregate hiring rate as




                                                      9
                                            Ht =   ∑   g
                                                           f t ( g )ht ( g ) ,                                (3)


where ht(g) is the mean hiring rate for establishments with growth rate g at time t, and ft(g) is the

corresponding share of employment with growth rate g at t. This equation implies that movements in

the aggregate hiring rate arise from changes over time in the cross-sectional relationship between hires

and establishment growth rates, shifts in the growth rate distribution, and interactions between the two.

Analogous remarks apply to separations, quits and layoffs. Of course, equation (3) is simply an

accounting identity. Moving beyond the identity requires behavioral models of the micro relationships

between worker flows and employer growth rates.

       Consider, for example, the CHW model with its time-invariant iron link between worker flows

and establishment growth. Substituting the behavioral relations shown in Figure 3 into (3) yields the

following expressions for aggregate rates of hires, layoffs and quits:

                                               H t = ∑ g ft ( g )h ( g ) ,


                                               Lt = ∑ g ft ( g ) l ( g ) , and                          (4)


                                               Qt = ∑ g ft ( g )q = q ∀t .

                                             
In the empirical work below, we fit ,   and        relations using JOLTS micro data pooled over

the 2001 to 2010 period. In doing so, we allow the quit rate to vary with employer growth, and we let

the data freely determine the kink points, if any, in the cross-sectional relations. We also allow for hires

in excess of job creation and separations in excess of job destruction. Even under these relaxed

conditions, equations (4) preserve a key aggregate implication of the iron link: fluctuations in aggregate

worker flows arise entirely from movements in the cross-sectional distribution of establishment growth

rates. We will evaluate how well this implication describes the behavior of aggregate worker flows.




                                                       10
                                                                                              ~
        More generally, the cross-sectional behavioral relations vary over time, and we write ht ( g ) ,

~
lt ( g ) , and q~t for the hiring, layoff and quit relations in period t. Proceeding as before, and replacing

                                         ~          ~
the time-invariant relations in (4) with ht ( g ) , lt ( g ) , and q~t , yields the corresponding aggregate flow

rates. When the cross-sectional behavioral relations vary over time, movements in the establishment-

level growth rate distribution no longer suffice to fully account for fluctuations in aggregate worker

flows. Nevertheless, we can still obtain informative characterizations of the aggregate flows in terms of
                       ~          ~
statistical models for ht ( g ) , lt ( g ) , and q~t . Moreover, we can combine these models with data on ft(g)

to construct synthetic measures of aggregate worker flows outside the period covered by JOLTS data.

        Figure 4 illustrates a case where the cross-sectional relations exhibit iron-link behavior in any

given period, but they shift up and down over time with the aggregate quit rate. In this case, the
                                                      ~
behavioral relation for the hires rate takes the form ht ( g ) =        ,   where X is a vector of

indicators for aggregate labor market conditions and  is a parameter vector that governs the size of the

upward and downward shifts in the cross-sectional hires relations. Analogous remarks apply to the

cross-sectional relations for separations, layoffs and quits. We investigate statistical models of this form

and evaluate their ability to account for the cross-sectional and aggregate behavior of worker flows. We

also investigate more flexible models that allow the shape of the cross-sectional relations to vary

systematically with aggregate conditions.


3. Data and Measurement

        We now turn to the description of the two data sources used and describe the key methodological

concepts for the analysis.

3.1. Data Sources

         This study relies on two micro data sources, Business Employment Dynamics (BED) and the Job

Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), both produced by the BLS. The BED contains

longitudinally linked administrative records for all businesses covered by state unemployment insurance

agencies – virtually a census of nonfarm private business establishments. The data are quarterly and

include employment and payroll for each establishment plus information on industry, location and

whether the establishment belongs to a multi-unit firm. The BLS uses the BED to produce quarterly

statistics on gross job creation and destruction from 1992, although micro data exist back to 1990.4 Our

BED micro data run from 1990Q2 through 2010Q2. Data access restrictions preclude our use of BED

data for Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York,

Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. Time-series data on job creation and destruction rates generated from our

version of the BED closely mimic the published series that cover all states.

         The JOLTS samples about 16,000 establishments each month and includes data on employment

in the pay period covering the 12th of the month. Establishments report hires, quits, layoffs, and other

separations (deaths, retirements, and intra-firm transfers) over the course of the month. For quits, the

establishments identify employees who left voluntarily (excluding retirements and intra-firm transfers).

For layoffs, the establishments identify involuntary separations initiated by the employer.5 The survey

begins in December 2000 and covers the nonfarm economy. Our JOLTS micro data run from January

2001 through June 2010.

  For more details on the BED, see Spletzer et al. (2004). The BLS does not publish job flow statistics for 1990-91 because of
issues related to administrative changes during that period. We follow Faberman (2008b) to address those changes.
5
  The JOLTS survey instructions for layoffs and discharges include the following examples: layoffs with no intent to rehire,
layoffs lasting more than 7 days, discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings, firings or other discharges for
cause, terminations of permanent or short-term employees, terminations of seasonal employees (whether or not they are
expected to return next season). For more details on the JOLTS, see Clark and Hyson (2001), Faberman (2008a) and Davis,
Faberman, Haltiwanger, and Rucker (2010). Details on recent revisions to JOLTS methodology are available at
http://www.bls.gov/jlt/methodologyimprovement.htm.

                                                             12
       To construct quarterly worker flows at the establishment level, we require observations in all

three months of the quarter. Dropping observations that violate this requirement reduces the number of

establishments in our JOLTS sample by about 12 percent. This sample restriction produces slightly

lower aggregate worker flow rates, but it does not alter their cyclical patterns. We also address other

measurement issues related to the JOLTS data: timing differences in the measurement of worker flows

and employment, the construction of sample weights at a quarterly frequency, and imputed worker flow

rates for opening and closing establishments. The latter are covered by the BED but are not captured in

the JOLTS sample frame. The appendix explains in detail how we address these matters. Our final

sample contains over 277,000 establishment-quarter observations.


3.2. The Cross-Sectional Distribution of Establishment Growth Rates

       We compute employment growth as the difference between employment in the third month of

the current quarter and the third month of the previous quarter, and we divide by the simple mean of

current and previous employment to obtain a rate. (We use the same average of current and previous

employment to compute worker flow rates.) This approach yields consistent aggregation and ensures

that all growth rates are bounded, with entry and exit corresponding to values of +2 and -2. Given the

comprehensive nature of the BED, we compute the cross-sectional distribution of employment growth

rates directly from the micro data without need to adjust for sample weights. We focus on employment-

weighted outcomes throughout the paper, unless noted otherwise.

       Figure 5 displays kernel density estimates of the establishment-level growth rate distribution in

2006Q1-2006Q4, a period of expanding aggregate employment, and 2008Q3-2009Q2, a period of sharp

contraction. There is a clear leftward shift of the growth rate distribution from 2006 to the 2008-09

period. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the growth rate distribution in selected expansion and

contraction periods. Establishments with steady employment levels over the quarter account for 13.9 to

                                                    13
16.1 percent of aggregate employment, depending on time period. Establishments that grow or shrink by

more than 10 percent in the quarter account for 31 percent of employment in 1991, 29 percent in 1998-

99, and 26 percent in 2006 and 2008Q3-2009Q2. This evolution towards a more compressed growth

rate distribution is also apparent in the behavior of aggregate worker flows.


3.3. Measuring Aggregate Worker Flows

       To measure aggregate worker flow rates, we combine JOLTS-based estimates of mean worker

flow rates by growth rate bin with BED-based measures of the growth rate distribution. This method

exploits identities of the sort described by equation (3). We use 195 bins that partition the full range of

feasible growth rates, with narrower bins near the mode of zero growth. In defining bins, we allow for

mass points at -200, 0 and 200 percent growth corresponding to exit, no change and entry. Letting wt(g)

denote the mean worker flow rate for bin g in quarter t, we measure aggregate worker flow rates as

                                           Wt =   ∑   g
                                                          f t ( g ) wt ( g ) .                           (5)


       Because our JOLTS sample covers continuing establishments only, we do not have JOLTS-

based worker flow rates for exits and entrants. Thus, we impute worker flow rates for entrants and exits

when implementing (5). See the appendix for details. We prefer the aggregate worker flows computed

according to (5) by combining BED and JOLTS data to the published JOLTS data, because our

approach encompasses worker flows at exits and entrants, and because the BED provides a more

accurate measure of the cross-sectional growth rate density. See Davis, Faberman, Haltiwanger and

Rucker (2010) for additional discussion and analysis on this point.


4. Worker Flows in the Cross Section and Over Time

       Guided by the theoretical discussion in Section II, we specify statistical models of how worker

flows vary with employer growth in the cross section and how the cross-sectional relations move over
                                                     14
time. We fit the models to establishment-level data and asses them in terms of cross-sectional fit, ability

to replicate the time-series behavior of aggregate worker flows, and the marginal explanatory power of

model-implied values for aggregate worker flows after conditioning on business cycle indicators. We

also use the estimated statistical models to evaluate certain implications of the theoretical models.

4.1. Empirical Specifications

       Our first specification treats hires, separations, layoffs, and quits as time-invariant functions of

establishment-level growth rates. Specifically, for each worker flow rate we regress the establishment-

level observations on a vector of dummy variables for the 195 growth rate bins,

                                        wet ( g ) = α ( g ) + ε et ( g )                                    (6)

where e indexes establishments, g indexes growth rate bins, and t indexes quarters. Fitted values in (6)

given by wˆ D ( g ) = αˆ ( g ) describe the average cross-sectional worker flow relations in our JOLTS

sample. This “fixed cross section” specification is consistent with the iron link feature of MP models,

but it is flexible enough to accommodate learning about match quality as in Pries and Rogerson (2005)

and the abandon-ship effect in Faberman and Nagypál (2008). Note that a strict MP-type iron link

implies a perfect fit for (6). We examine R-squared values for fitted versions of (6) to quantify how

closely the data conform to this implication. We also examine the shape of the fitted relationships to

gauge whether and how closely they match the implications of various theoretical models.

       Recall that quit rates, and therefore hiring and separation rates, rise and fall in a pro-cyclical

manner in the model of Barlevy (2002). To accommodate such behavior, our “baseline” specification

relaxes (6) to let the cross-sectional relations shift up and down as functions of business cycle indicators:

                       wet (g) = α (g) + β1Gt+ + β 2Gt− + β3∆Gt + β 4 JFt + ε et (g)                  (7)




                                                          15
                                                       +                  −
where Gt is the growth rate of aggregate employment, Gt = max{0, Gt } , Gt = min{0, Gt } ,

∆Gt = Gt − Gt −1 is an accelerator term, and JFt is the job-finding rate calculated from Current Population

Survey data on unemployment by duration.6

        To let the cross-sectional relations respond to business cycle conditions in more complicated

ways, we extend the baseline specification by adding terms that involve interactions between the cycle

indicators and the establishment-level growth rates. Specifically, we introduce a set of five indicator

variables, I ( g ) , for establishment-level growth rates less than or equal to -10 percent, greater than -10

percent but less than zero, exactly zero, positive but less than 10 percent, and greater than or equal to 10

percent. Thus, our “flexible” specification is given by

           wet ( g ) = α ( g ) + β1Gt+ + β 2Gt− + β 3 ∆Gt + I ( g )δ1Gt + I ( g )δ 2 JFt + ε et ( g ) .          (8)

Specification (8), unlike (7), allows the worker flow response to aggregate conditions to differ among

establishments based on how rapidly they grow or shrink.


4.2. Worker Flows and Employer Growth in the Cross Section

        Figure 6 displays worker flow relations estimated from the fixed cross-section specification (6).

The figure shows clear similarities to the theoretical relations in Figure 3. For example, the hiring

relation exhibits a hockey-stick shape similar to the one implied by MP models. There are also clear

departures from the implications of MP models. First, hires rise more than one-for-one with job creation

to the right of zero. As discussed in Section II, this pattern suggests that a higher incidence of recently

formed matches at more rapidly growing establishments leads to higher rates of learning about match

quality, generating higher separation rates and more need for replacement hires. Second, hires occur at


6
 We use standard methods to calculate the job-finding rate from data on unemployment by duration. For details, see Davis,
Faberman, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2010). We use the published data from Current Employment Statistics to
compute the growth rate of aggregate employment.

                                                                16
all growth rates, another piece of evidence that points to replacement hiring. Third, while there is a

pronounced kink in the hiring relation, it occurs at zero growth rather than the mean quit rate. Finally,

the hires rate declines with establishment growth rates over much of the range to the left of zero. This

pattern is consistent with an abandon-ship effect in which more rapidly declining employers face a

greater need for replacement hiring.

         Many of these same effects appear in the separations relation, which is nearly a mirror image of

the hires relation. For example, separation rates rise with job creation rates to the right of zero, in line

with the view that rapidly growing employers experience high turnover rates among recent hires. To the

left of zero, separations rise more rapidly than job destruction, in line with the abandon-ship effect and a

greater need for replacement hires at more rapidly shrinking employers.

         Turning to the breakdown of separations into quits and layoffs, several other patterns emerge.

Layoffs rise sharply with job destruction, and they dominate the employment adjustment margin among

rapidly shrinking employers. In contrast, quits account for a larger share of separations at

establishments that shrink by less than 20 percent in the quarter – and at growing establishments. In the

appendix, we display a version of Figure 6 that covers a wider range of growth rates. The zoomed-out

version of Figure 6 reveals even more clearly that quit rates top out at about 20 percent per quarter, and

that layoffs are the primary margin of employment adjustment at rapidly contracting establishments.

Quit and layoff rates, like the hiring rate, are smallest at employers with stable employment levels.7

         The patterns in Figure 6 differ from the cross-sectional relationships found by Abowd, Corbel,

and Kramarz (1999) using establishment-level data for France. They find that hiring is the primary

margin of employment adjustment at the establishment level, even for contracting establishments. This


7
  For visual clarity, Figure 6 omits the cross-sectional relation for other separations (deaths, retirements, and intra-firm
transfers). They are very small on average, amounting to about a half percent of employment, and somewhat greater at
rapidly contracting establishments.


                                                                17
interesting point of contrast between their results and ours may reflect differences between France and

the United States in the nature of labor adjustment. The topic warrants investigation in future work.

       Table 2 presents regression R-squared values for several specifications fit to the establishment-

level JOLTS data. A potential concern about our specifications is that the 195-bin partition is too coarse

to adequately approximate the underlying relationships of worker flows to employer growth rates. To

investigate this concern, we augment each specification by adding 192 bin-specific slope terms. (There

is no reason to introduce slope terms for the zero-width bins at -2, 0 and +2.) Comparing the first two

columns in Table 2 reveals, however, that the bin-specific slope terms yield very modest gains in the

regression fit of the fixed cross-section specification. For the sake of simplicity and parsimony, we drop

the bin-specific slope terms in the rest of the paper.

       As discussed above, the strict iron-link feature of MP-type models implies a perfect fit for the

fixed cross-section specification. We do not take this implication literally, because MP models

deliberately abstract from many real-world features that play a role in worker flows. Still, it is

interesting to ask how fully employer growth alone accounts for establishment-level variation in worker

flows. According to Table 2, the fixed cross-section specification accounts for 54 percent of

establishment-level variation in hiring rates and 51 percent for separation rates. It accounts for 47

percent of the variation in layoff rates and 16 percent of quit rate variation. These R-squared values fall

well short of a perfect fit, but we are somewhat surprised by the extent to which the fixed cross-section

model accounts for establishment-level variation in hires, separations and layoffs. In this regard, it is

worth mentioning some of the many factors omitted from the model. In particular, it contains no

controls for industry, employer size or age, wages, job tenure, education and other worker

characteristics, the longer-term growth trajectory of the employer, local labor market conditions, and

aggregate labor market conditions. Despite these omissions, this simple specification accounts for more



                                                         18
than half of the variation in hiring and separation rates across employers. Clearly, the employer growth

rate is a major proximate determinant of worker flows.

       The remaining columns of Table 2 show the gains in fit from introducing cycle indicators and

allowing for interactions between the cycle indicators and establishment-level growth rates. The

baseline specification, which adds cycle indicators only, yields very modest gains in fit. The flexible

specification, which also includes the interaction terms, improves the fit by several percentage points for

each type of worker flow. Evidently, the relationship of worker flow rates to employer growth rates

varies with aggregate labor market conditions. Table 2 also shows that even the flexible specification

accounts for only about a quarter of the cross-sectional variation in establishment-level quit rates.

       The large role for establishment-level variation in quit rates conditional on own growth rate is an

interesting finding, but it need not matter for movements in aggregate quit rates. To see this point,

consider a multi-worker MP model with quit rates that vary exogenously among establishments. In

particular, suppose the idiosyncratic component of the establishment-level quit rate is drawn from a

common, time-invariant distribution. This assumption generates dispersion in worker flow rates among

establishments with the same employment growth rate. Suppose, in addition, that the common

component of quit rates varies with aggregate conditions as in our earlier discussion of Figure 4. Under

these assumptions, there is dispersion in worker flow rates among establishments with the same

employment growth rate, but common factors drive the average shape and location of the cross-sectional

worker flow relations.

       For the analysis that follows, what matters is how well our statistical specifications capture

variation in worker flow rates at the level of growth rates bins crossed with time periods. These bin-

quarter outcomes provide building blocks for aggregation and the construction of our synthetic worker

flow series. To obtain the bin-quarter outcomes, we compute the employment-weighted worker flow



                                                     19
rates for all 195 bins by quarter. To evaluate how well our statistical models capture the bin-quarter

variation in worker flow rates, we estimate analogs of (6)-(8) at the bin-quarter level of aggregation.

       We summarize the main results of our regressions at the bin-quarter level here and report the full

results in the appendix. The fixed cross-section specification accounts for 93 percent of the bin-quarter

variation in the hiring rate and 92 percent for the separation rate. It accounts for 88 percent of the bin-

quarter variation in layoff rates and 65 percent for the quit rate. The baseline and flexible specifications

yield very modest improvements in fit for hires, separations and layoffs. The gains in fit are larger for

the quit rate, with an R-squared value of 69 percent for the flexible specification. The flexible

specification yields modest gains in fit relative to the baseline specification for quits and tiny gains for

hires, separations and layoffs. That is, except perhaps for quit rates, the R-squared metric provides little

evidence that the shapes of the cross-sectional relations vary systematically with the cycle indicators.

The success of our statistical specifications in accounting for bin-quarter variation in worker flow rates

bodes well for their ability to capture the behavior of aggregate worker flows.


4.3. Aggregate Behavior Implied by the Fixed Cross-Section Specification

       We now investigate how well our cross-sectional statistical models account for the behavior of

aggregate worker flows. To start, we compare the actual worker flows to the aggregate flows implied by

the fixed cross-section specification. To generate the implied flows, we replace the   functions in

(5) with wˆ D ( g ) = αˆ ( g ) obtained by fitting the fixed cross-section model to JOLTS data from 2001Q1 to

2010Q2. Plugging in the BED data for   and the wˆ D ( g ) functions yields the model-implied worker

flow rates.




                                                      20
        Figure 7 plots seasonally adjusted versions of the model-implied rates alongside the actual

worker flow rates.8 As seen in the figure, the layoff series implied by the fixed cross-section model

captures much of the time-series variation in the actual layoff rate. The fixed cross-section model fares

less well in replicating the actual hires and separations rate, and it completely fails to replicate the actual

quit rates. In fact, the quit rate series implied by the fixed cross-section model is essentially a flat line

for most of the period. It also predicts a rise in the quit rate during the 2008-09 downturn, which is

nothing like the behavior of actual quit rates in this period.

        Table 3 quantifies the extent to which the fixed cross-section model replicates movements in the

actual worker flow rates. (Like Figure 7, Table 3 includes results for other specifications that we discuss

below). The first column of Table 3 reports the standard deviation of the actual worker flow rates. The

remaining columns in the top panel report the root mean squared value of the difference between the

model-implied and actual rates. For hires, the rate implied by the fixed cross-section model accounts for

36 percent of the time-series variation in the actual hires rate, computed as 100 times [1 –

(0.872/1.366)]. The correlation between the model-implied and actual hiring rate is 0.94. For layoffs,

the model-implied rate captures 41 percent of movements in the actual layoff rate, and the correlation

between the two series is 0.82. The model performs less well in replicating the behavior of the

separations rate, and it captures very little of the time-series variation in the quit rate. We turn next to

the cyclical behavior of the cross-sectional worker flow relations.


4.4. Shifts in the Cross-Sectional Relations over Time

        Before proceeding to the baseline and flexible specifications, we fit the fixed cross-section

specification separately for three periods: 2001Q2 – 2003Q1 (a mild recession followed by a prolonged


8
  We seasonally adjust the model-implied and actual worker flow rates using the Census X-11 procedure. We also drop the
time series observations for 2001Q1 and Q2, because the JOLTS sample is much smaller in these early quarters – about 2,700
observations per quarter as compared to more than 6,300 in other quarters.

                                                           21
“jobless recovery”), 2006Q1 – 2006Q4 (an expansion period), and 2008Q3 – 2009Q2 (a deep

recession). Each period covers four or eight consecutive quarters to ensure that seasonal effects do not

drive the estimation results. For this exercise, we restrict attention to quarterly growth rates from -30 to

30 percent to focus on bins with ample observation counts. Establishments in this growth rate range

account for about 90 percent of aggregate employment.

        Figure 8 displays the results. The layoff relation displays considerable stability over time.

Rapidly shrinking establishments rely more heavily on layoffs (conditional on own growth) during the

severe recession of 2008-09, but the layoff relation is nearly time invariant throughout the rest of the

growth rate range. In other words, there is a strong element of iron-link behavior in the cross-sectional

layoff relation. In marked contrast, the quit relation shifts up and down as aggregate employment

expands and contracts. Conditional on own-establishment growth, the quit rate is several percentage

points lower in 2008-09 than in the other two periods. This pattern holds for the entire growth rate range

and is most pronounced at rapidly shrinking establishments. Moreover, for shrinking establishments

there is a clear ordering of the cross-sectional quit relations over the cycle: quit rates are highest in the

2006 expansion period, somewhat lower in the weak labor market early in the decade, and much lower

in the severe recession of 2008-09. Extending our earlier metaphor, workers abandon ship at higher

rates at more rapidly contracting employers, but they are much more likely to go down with the ship

when stormy seas prevail.

        The separation relation largely inherits the cyclical behavior of the quit relation, although there

are partly offsetting shifts in the underlying quit and layoff relations at rapidly shrinking establishments.

Otherwise, the shifts in the separation relation look smaller only because the vertical scale covers a

larger range. The cross-sectional hiring relation exhibits more stability over time than the separation




                                                      22
relation, but it is less stable than the layoff relation. In particular, employers face less need for

replacement hires in weak labor market conditions, and this effect is stronger at shrinking employers.

Summing up, Figure 8 shows that the cross-sectional relations shift over time in a systematic cyclical

manner. The quit relation, in particular, is highly sensitive to aggregate labor market conditions.


4.5. Results for the Baseline and Flexible Specifications

        To evaluate the performance of the baseline and flexible specifications, we proceed in the same

manner as before with the fixed cross-section specification. That is, we estimate specifications (7) and

(8) over the 2001Q1 to 2010Q2 period, generate model-implied worker flow rates by plugging the

estimated functions into (5), and then compare to the actual worker flow rates. Figure 7 and Table 3

contain the results. As it turns out, the estimation results for the baseline and flexible specification

imply nearly identical worker flow rates. Thus, we omit the worker flow rates implied by the flexible

specification in Figure 7 and focus on rates implied by the simpler baseline specification. See the

appendix for plots of the worker flow rates implied by the flexible specification.

        Figure 7 shows that the baseline specification greatly improves on the fixed cross-section model

in terms of replicating the actual worker flow rates. The improvement is especially dramatic for the quit

rate. The baseline specification captures the large drop in hiring and quit rates during 2008 and 2009 and

the subsequent turnaround in the hiring rate. It also captures the broad swings in the quit rate in the first

seven years of the decade. The baseline specification yields less improvement for the layoff rate,

because shifts in the fixed cross-section specification already account for much of the movements in the

layoff rate. However, the baseline specification captures more of the layoff spike in late 2008 and 2009,

reflecting the shift away from quits and towards layoffs for contracting establishments seen in Figure 8.




                                                      23
By more accurately tracking quits and layoffs, the baseline model replicates a declining and weakly

procyclical total separations rate. 9

         Turning to Table 3, the third and fourth columns show that the baseline and flexible

specifications capture most of the time-series variation in the worker flow rates. The baseline

specification accounts for 74 percent of the time-series variation in the hires rate, computed as 100 times

[1 – (0.375/1.366)], 66 percent for the separations rate, 74 percent for the quit rate, and 59 percent for

the layoff rate. The correlation between actual and model-implied flow rates is high in all cases, 0.92

for quit rate implied by the baseline specification and 0.95 to 0.97 for the other worker flows. The

flexible specification yields modest improvements in fit according to the root mean squared value of the

discrepancy between actual and model-implied rates but no improvements in correlation.

         The results for the baseline specification support for the view that statistical models of the sort

depicted in Figure 4 yield a reasonably accurate accounting of movements in the aggregate worker flow

rates. Put differently, by estimating the shape and cyclical shifts in the cross-sectional worker flow

relations and combining them with the cross-sectional distribution of establishment growth rates, we can

account for most of the movements over time in aggregate worker flow rates. We exploit this finding in

Section V to construct synthetic measures of aggregate worker flow rates before the advent of JOLTS.


4.6. The Marginal Value of Tracking the Cross Section

         Thus far, our aggregate analysis focuses on the extent to which model-implied worker flow rates

replicate actual worker flow rates. We now turn the question around and investigate whether tracking

the cross section improves our understanding of the aggregate worker flow rates. We proceed as

9
  Close inspection of Figure 7 reveals that the worker flow rates implied by the baseline specification exhibit less high-
frequency variation than the actual worker flow rates. In this regard, we remark that the “actual” rates are subject to greater
sampling error than the model-implied rates, because estimation of the actual rates entails no pooling across time periods.
Recall that the JOLTS sample size is fairly modest, and that a small number of establishments at the extremes of the growth
rate distribution account for a disproportionate share of the estimated actual worker flows. Thus, we place little weight on
high-frequency movements of the actual flow rates not captured by the model-implied rates.

                                                               24
follows. First, we regress each aggregate flow rate on several cycle indicators. We use the same cycle

indicators as before: the positive and negative pieces of the aggregate employment growth rate, an

accelerator term, and the job-finding rate. The regression R-squared value serves as our metric of how

successfully the cycle indicators account for time-series movements in the worker flow rates. Second,

we expand the regression specification for each worker flow rate to include the rate implied by the fixed

cross-section specification, i.e., the rate generated by plugging wˆ D ( g ) = αˆ ( g ) into equation (5).

Because this specification involves time-invariant cross-sectional relations, all movements in the model-

implied rates arise from movements in the cross section of establishment growth rates. We use the

incremental R-squared contribution to gauge the marginal value of tracking the cross section.

        Table 4 reports the results. Column 1 shows that the cycle indicators account for most of the

variation in aggregate worker flow rates. R-squared values range from 53 percent for the layoff rate to

93 percent for the quit rate. Colum 2 shows the marginal value of tracking the cross section. The

model-implied worker flow rate is highly statistically significant in all cases, and its inclusion yields

dramatic improvements in fit. The R-squared value jumps from 53 to 88 percent for layoffs, from 65 to

94 percent for separations, and from 81 to 97 percent for hires. The incremental R-squared gain of 3

percentage points for the quit rate corresponds to a reduction in the standard error of the residual by

more than half. Clearly, the cross section contains a great deal of useful information in accounting for

movements in aggregate worker flow rates. We see this result as an important finding, because it says

that economic and statistical models of worker flows in the cross section offer the promise of large

advances in our understanding of aggregate hires, separations, layoffs and quits.

4.7. On the Quit-Layoff Distinction

        As we have stressed, MP-type models imply a tight, time-invariant link between separations and

job destruction. Our results show that such a link exists between layoffs and job destruction but not


                                                        25
between quits and job destruction. Our evidence also shows that much of the variation in aggregate

layoff rates reflects changes over time in the cross-sectional growth rate distribution interacted with a

stable cross-sectional layoff relation. In contrast, movements in the growth rate distribution alone

account for little of the variation in aggregate quit rates. Instead, the main story for quits appears to

involve worker responses to outside labor market conditions.

       These sharply different proximate determinants of quits and layoffs are noteworthy in light of

other research on differences in worker outcomes between quits and layoffs. Using Current Population

Survey data, Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2010) find that about 90 percent of laid-off workers flow into

unemployment as compared to less than 20 percent of workers who quit. Earlier studies by Leighton

and Mincer (1982), Mincer (1986) and McLaughlin (1990) find a similar pattern using other data

sources. Much other research finds that laid-off workers have inferior earnings paths compared to

workers who quit. Elsby Hobijn, and Şahin (2010) also show that higher layoffs account for most of the

rise in unemployment inflows in recessions, confirming many previous studies. Theoretical models that

abstract from the quit-layoff distinction cannot address these empirical regularities.

       We also find that quit rates and separation rates are closely related to employer growth rates in

the cross section, and that the behavior of quits and separations varies strongly with aggregate labor

market conditions. These aspects of our results are at odds with standard simplifying assumptions in

many search models. In particular, many models posit a uniform separation (or quit) rate in the cross

section and abstract from forces that link separations and quits to aggregate conditions. In our view,

relaxing these assumptions is likely to produce better economic models of worker flows and their

connection to unemployment outcomes. Recent theoretical work that endogenizes quits, layoffs and

hiring in search models with multi-worker firms includes Veracierto (2009), Schaal (2010) and

Trapeznikova (2010). Another issue is whether the empirical findings on the quit-layoff distinction can



                                                     26
be accommodated in models with privately efficient separation outcomes. See Hall and Lazear (1984)

and McLaughlin (1990, 1991) on this issue.


5. Synthetic Data on Aggregate Worker Flows

       Our empirical methods and results provide a framework for constructing synthetic data on

worker flows before the advent of JOLTS. The key idea is to combine statistical models for the cross-

sectional worker flow relations with data on the cross-sectional distribution of establishment growth

rates. We employ exactly that approach. Specifically, we use the estimated baseline specification (7)

                   +    −
and data on  , Gt , Gt , ∆ , and JFt to construct the time series of estimated cross-sectional relations

wˆ tB ( g ) . We plug these functions into (5) along with BED data on the cross-sectional distribution of

establishment growth rates to construct data for the pre-JOLTS period. BED micro data are available

from 1990Q2, so our synthetic worker flow series start then. Figures 1 and 2 plot the resulting synthetic

flows through 2001Q2 and actual flows thereafter. We use synthetic rates for the first two quarters of

2001, because the JOLTS sample sizes are much smaller in early 2001.

       As seen in Figure 1, layoff and job destruction rates move together closely. Both series spike

sharply in the 1990-91 recession, exhibit a moderate but prolonged rise in the 2001 recession, and rise

very sharply in 2008-09. The quit rate is strongly procyclical, declining around all three recessions.

Figure 2 shows that hiring and job creation rates also move together. Both series exhibit mild declines

during the 1990-91 recession, a moderate decline during the 2001-03 period, and a precipitous drop

during the 2008-09 recession. The hiring rate exhibits larger swings over the cycle, reflecting a greater

need for replacement hiring during booms when job creation is also high.

       Figures 1 and 2 also show a downward drift in worker and job flow rates in the period covered

by our data. This result indicates that U.S. labor markets became less fluid and dynamic over period



                                                     27
covered by our data, at least as measured by worker flows and job flows. For example, job creation,

hiring and quit rates are higher during the expansion in the second half of the 1990s than the expansion

from 2004 to 2006. It can be difficult to disentangle cyclical and secular movements over a twenty-year

period, but we have documented a downward drift in the pace of labor market flows using other data

sources, some of which extend back in time to the 1970s and 1980s. See Davis et al. (2006) and Davis,

Faberman, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2010).

         We carry out two validation exercises for our synthetic worker flow measures. First, we sort the

micro data into two broad regions to conduct a cross-region validation exercise. Specifically, we fit the

baseline specification to JOLTS data for the Northeast-Mideast region, an aggregate of the standard

Census regions for the Northeast and Midwest. We evaluate the own-region performance of the baseline

specification as before by quantifying how closely the model-implied rates replicate the actual own-

region rates. To conduct the cross-region validation exercise, we combine estimated models based on

data for the Northeast-Midwest region with growth rate distributions for the South-West region to

generate model-implied rates for the South-West region. We then compare the resulting model-implied

rates to the actual rates for the South-West region. In other words, we rely on data for the Northeast-

Midwest region to estimate the statistical model used to generate synthetic data for the South-West

region. We also reverse the roles of the two regions and repeat the same steps.10

         Table 5 presents the results for the own-region comparison between actual and model-implied

rates and for the cross-region validation exercise. The root mean squared values of the difference

between actual and model-implied rates are typically larger when the baseline statistical model is fit



10
  Regional versions of the aggregate variables used to estimate our baseline specification are not readily available, so we use
national aggregates for this purpose. This substitution of national for regional aggregates is likely to degrade the quality of
the resulting model-implied series and cause us to understate the performance of our method for constructing synthetic data.
We also note that in generating the cross-validation series, we remove the mean difference between the own-region and
cross-region model-implied worker flow rate based upon the fixed cross section distribution model.


                                                              28
using data for the other region. In some cases it is much larger. However, even when based on micro

data for the other region, model-implied rates remain highly correlated with actual rates, ranging from

0.79 to 0.96. The appendix shows plots for the full set of region-specific worker flow rates – actual rates

and model-implied rates based on own-region and other-region micro data. It is evident in both regions

that both of the model-implied rates track the actual series reasonably well. This pattern holds

especially for layoffs (which from Table 5 is also the series for which the differences in root mean

squared error are the smallest).

       In our second validation exercise, we compare the behavior of our layoff rate series to three

measures that should, in theory, exhibit similar behavior: the job destruction rate, the inflow rate into

unemployment as measured by Current Population Survey (CPS) data on unemployment by duration,

and initial claims for unemployment insurance (UI) as a percent of covered employment. We focus on

layoffs in this exercise, because conceptually similar series are available from several distinct data

sources. Both the layoff and UI claims series capture involuntary separations of workers from jobs. As

we remarked above, Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin (2010) show that most laid-off workers flow into the CPS

unemployment pool.

       Figure 9 plots our synthetic and actual layoff rate series alongside the other three measures. The

four series exhibit a remarkable degree of co-movement, especially with respect to cyclical fluctuations.

All three series exhibit strong countercyclical behavior and sharp spikes in each of the three recessions

covered by our sample period. The most notable departure is that the two unemployment series show

greater declines during expansions. Nevertheless, Figure 9 supports the view that our synthetic layoff

estimates capture important features of actual layoff behavior outside the JOLTS sample period.

6. Concluding Remarks

       We exploit establishment-level data from the JOLTS and BED data to study the relationship

between worker flows and job flows in the cross section and over time. To put structure on the

empirical analysis, we begin with models that imply a tight link between job flows and worker flows in

the spirit of the seminal work by Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Consistent with these models, we

find powerful, highly nonlinear relationships of worker flows to employer growth rates in the cross

section. The layoff relation, in particular, exhibits considerable stability over time. We also find much

evidence that other economic forces play important roles in the cross-sectional and time-series behavior

of worker flows. These forces include learning about match quality and the need for replacement hires,

on-the-job search, an abandon-ship effect that yields higher quit rates at struggling employers, and

strongly pro-cyclical movements in quit rates even after conditioning on the employer’s growth rate.

       We develop statistical models for evaluating how well various models and views fit the patterns

in the data. Aggregate fluctuations in layoffs are well captured by empirical specifications that impose a

tight cross-sectional link between worker flows and job flows. Aggregate fluctuations in quits are not.

Allowing the cross-sectional relations to vary with aggregate conditions leads to huge improvements in

the ability of the statistical models to account for the aggregate behavior of quits and large

improvements for the other worker flows as well. We also show that the cross section contains

information that greatly improves our ability to account for movements in aggregate worker flow rates.

These finding indicate that economic and statistical models of worker flow behavior in the cross section

can significantly enhance our understanding of aggregate hires, separations, layoffs and quits.

       Aggregate hires are much more volatile than aggregate job creation over time. In a cyclical

downturn, hires fall because of a decline in job creation rates and because quit rates fall sharply. That is,

the strong procyclicality of quits drives a wedge in the aggregate relationship between hires and job


                                                     30
creation. The strong procyclicality of quits also helps reconcile the differences in cyclicality between

job destruction and separations.

       We exploit our statistical models of worker flow behavior in the cross section and historical BED

data to construct synthetic JOLTS-like measures of hires, separations, layoffs and quits back to 1990. In

this way, we nearly double the length of the time series on hires, separations, layoffs and quits available

for analysis in future research. While not the focus of the current analysis, these extended series show a

downward drift over time in the pace of worker flows. Other sources of data also point to secular

declines in the pace of worker flows and job churning activity in the U.S. economy over the past 30

years or more. Investigating the reasons for the secular declines in the pace of job and worker

reallocation activity is an important topic for research.

Sources: Quit and layoff rates (2001Q3 – 2010Q2) are authors’ calculations using JOLTS establishment microdata weighted
to an aggregate value for each quarter using growth rate densities from the BED. Job destruction rates (1990Q2 – 2010Q2)
are authors’ tabulations directly from the BED data. All estimates are seasonally adjusted. All rates are percentages of
employment. Backcasted estimates of the quit and layoff rates are included to the left of the dashed vertical line.

Sources: Layoff rates (2001Q3 – 2010Q2) are authors’ calculations using JOLTS establishment microdata
weighted to an aggregate value for each quarter using growth rate densities from the BED. Prior to 2001Q3
(to the left of the dashed vertical line), layoff rates are a synthetic series based on our baseline statistical
model of worker flows (see text for details). Job destruction rates are authors’ tabulations directly from the
BED data. Unemployment inflow rates are calculated from the CPS. Initial unemployment insurance claims
rates are from published statistics. All estimates are seasonally adjusted. All rates are percentages of
employment.

Notes: Table entries report R-squared values for worker flow rate regressions fit to establishment-level
JOLTS data. The fixed cross-section specification contains dummy variables for 195 growth rate bins.
The augmented version adds 192 slope terms, one for each growth rate bin excluding those for exit, exit
and no employment change. The augmented baseline specification adds four time-varying business cycle
indicators, and the augmented flexible specification also includes terms that allow for interactions between
the cycle indicators and five dummy variables for broad establishment growth rate categories. See text for
details. Regressions are fit by weighted least squares using sample weights and employment weights.

Notes: The cycle indicators are positive and negative pieces of the aggregate employment growth rate, the
change in the growth rate of aggregate employment, and the job-finding rate. The specification used in the
rightmost column also includes the aggregate worker flow rate implied by the fixed cross section model.
The p-value is for the null hypothesis of a zero coefficient on the model-implied worker flow rate. Each
regression has 36 quarterly observations covering the period from 2001Q3 to 2010Q2. See text for
additional details.

Notes: “Own Region” results involve a comparison of regional worker flows to flows generated by fitting
the baseline statistical model to micro data for the same region. “Cross-Region Validation” results involve
a comparison of regional worker flows to flows generated by fitting the baseline statistical model to micro
data for the other region. In conducting the Cross Region Validation exercise, we remove a region fixed
effect for each worker flow rate. Each regional time series measure has 36 quarterly observations covering
the period from 2001Q3 to 2010Q2. See text for additional details.
