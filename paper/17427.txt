The Fiscal Stimulus of 2009-10: Trade Openness, Fiscal Space and Exchange Rate Adjustment
Joshua Aizenman and Yothin Jinjarak
NBER Working Paper No. 17427
September 2011
JEL No. E62,F42,O23

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies the cross-country variation of the fiscal stimulus and the exchange rate adjustment
propagated by the global crisis of 2008-9, identifying the role of economic structure in accounting
for the heterogeneity of response. We find that greater de facto fiscal space prior to the global crisis
and lower trade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009-2010 (where
the de facto fiscal space is the inverse of the average tax-years it would take to repay the public debt).
Lowering the 2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5.94) down
to the average level of the Euro minus the Euro-area peripheral countries (1.97), was associated with
a larger crisis stimulus in 2009-11 of 2.78 GDP percentage points. Joint estimation of fiscal stimuli
and exchange rate depreciations indicates that higher trade openness was associated with a smaller
fiscal stimulus and a higher depreciation rate during the crisis. Overall, the results are in line with the
predictions of the neo-Keynesian open-economy model.
