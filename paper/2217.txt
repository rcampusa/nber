                    Have IRAs Increased U.S. Saving?
               Evidence from Consumer Expenditure Surveys




                               ABSTRACT



     The vast majority of Individual Retirement Account

contributions represent net new saving, based on evidence from the

quarterly Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES). The results are
based on analysis of the relationship between IRA contributions
and other financial asset saving. The data show almost no
substitution of IRAs for other saving. While the core of the
paper is based on cross—section analysis, important use is made of
the CES panel of independent cross-sections that span the period
during which IRAs were introduced. Estimates for the post 1982
period, when IRAs were available to all employees, are based on a
flexible constrained optimization model, with the IRA limit the
principle constraint. The implications of this model for saving
in the absence of the IRA option match very closely the actual
non—IRA financial asset saving behavior prior to 1982. IRA saving
does not show up as other financial asset saving in the pre—IRA

period.

                   HAVE IRAS INCREASED U.S. SAVING?:
              EVIDENCE FROM CONSUMER EXPENDITURE SURVEYS

                                  by
                  Steven F. Ventj and David A. Wise

       Individual retirement
                             accounts (IRA5) have become an
  immensely popular and important form of saving in the United
  States since 1982, when they became available to all
                                                       employees.
 Any employee could Contribute
                                $2000 per year to an IRA account and
 a non—working Spouse of an employee $250. Total
                                                   contributions to
 these tax deferred
                     saving plans were $5 billion in 1981, $28
 billion in 1982, and will be about $45 billion in
                                                    1986 or roughly
 one—fourth of all personal saving. The net saving effect
                                                            of these
 Contributions is the subject of this paper.

      Possibly the most contentious issue in the recent tax
                                                             (1986)
reform discussions was the treatment of IRAs. While the
                                                         earlier
proposals Suggested substantial increases in the former
                                                        limits,
the Senate version of the bill would have eliminated
                                                     the tax
deductibility of all contributions and left the limits
                                                        unchanged.
The final bill leaves the limits as they were but
                                                   phases out the
tax deductibilIty of contributions for families
                                                 earning over
$40,000 and single persons earning over $25,000.

     Two empirical questions played a central role in the
discussions: one was the income levels of IRA users, the
                                                         second
was the net effect of IRAs
                           on saving, the extent to which they
were simply a substitute for other forms of saving. Based
                                                           on the
                               —2—


reports of a few experts, it became the conventional wisdom among
                                                         the
many that the majority of IRA contributions were made by
wealthy. This is factually incorrect; 90 percent of contributions
are made by individuals earning less than $50,000 per year and 70
percent of contributions by families earning less than this
amount. The likelihood of contributing is much greater for high
than low income persons, however.    It also became conventional

wisdom among many that the net saving effect was negligible, again
based on the speculation of a few experts.    The saving effect,

however, is a much more difficult question to answer than the
distribution of contributions by income.     The much publicized

decline in the U.S. saving rate gives particular significance to
this question. Indeed, one of the primary motivations for the
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, that extended the availability

of IRAs to all employees, was to increase saving.
     The approach of the paper is to compare individual IRA
contributions with changes in other forms of saving, in particular
liquid financial assets. To the extent that IRAs are funded by
transfers from previously accumulated assets, or are a substitute
for new saving that would have taken place anyway, other financial

 assets are the most likely source of funds, at least in the short

 run. It is important to keep in mind that the question is not
 where the money was taken from at the time the IRA contribution

 was made. Because most people don't carry $2000 in cash, when
 asked where the money for an iRA contribution came from, they may
 respond that it came from a saving account, for example. But this
                                       —3—

     is not an indication of the net saving effect. Rather the issue
     is what would have happened to the money in the saving
                                                            account had
     it not been used to make the IRA contribution.

             We Concluded in previous work (Venti and Wise [1986a,
  1986bfl, based on data available at that time, that only a very
 small proportion of IRA contributions could have been funded by
 substitution of one form of saving for another. Those data
                                                            were
 from the 1983 Survey of Consumer
                                  Finances (SCF). While that
 survey provided data on IRA contributions, it
                                                    provided only
 qualitative information on associated changes in other financial
 assets, whether they were positive or negative. The analysis in
 this paper is based on Consumer
                                      Expenditure Surveys (CESs) for the
period 1980 through the first quarter of 1984. These data provide
not only accurate information on contributions to IRA accounts,
but also associated dollar changes in other asset balances, such

as conventional saving accounts.       In addition, through independent
quarterly cross sections, they provide aggregate time series
evidence on IRA contributions and
                                  other saving, although there is
no time series data on the same individual that is useful for
                                                              our
purposes.


I.      Background and Dscriptjve Data
        A.     The Incentive Effects of IRAs

        The widespread promotion of IRAs may have been the most
important reason for their use. The advertisement has typically
                                  —4—


emphasized the avoidance of current taxes through IRA

contributions, as well as the importance of prudent planning for

retirement. They are available through almost any bank and
through many other financial institutions.
       Two aspects of IRAs provide a more traditional economic
incentive to save through their use: one is that the contribution
itself is tax deductible, the other is that the interest on the
contribution accumulates tax free, with taxes paid only when funds

are withdrawn from the account. A dollar of current consumption
foregone and deposited in a conventional account would yield
exp[r(l—t)T] after T years at an interest rate r and marginal tax

rate t, if the marginal tax rate does not change with age. A

dollar of foregone consumption placed in an IRA account would
                               exp[rT].   Thus the ratio of the IRA to
yield l/(l-t)exp(rT](l-t) =
the conventional yield would be exp[rtT], increasing with the
interest rate, the marginal tax rate, and the number of years that

the funds are left in the account. For example, at r =      .1,
t =   .3,   and T = 40, the ratio is 3.32. If T = 20 the ratio is
1.82 and at T = 10 it is 1.35, at the same r and t. If $2000 were
placed in an IRA account each year beginning at age 25, the after
tax value of the account by age 65 would be $789,000; placed in a
conventional saving account, the value would be only $320,000.

Some persons may also benefit from lower tax rates when funds are

withdrawn than when they are deposited.
       On the other hand, once money is placed in an IRA account
there is a ten percent penalty for withdrawal before the age of 59
                                     —5—

  and 1/2. In this sense, the IRA is less liquid than
                                                      a
  conventional account. If funds are to be withdrawn before
                                                             age 59
  1/2, whether it would be better to save the money in
                                                       an IRA or a
  conventional account again depends on r, t, and T. The
                                                          yield from
  the two accounts would be the same at T = in
                                                  [(it)/(l-t-l))/rt
  For example, at r   .1 and t =    .3, T is 5.14 years. it is     25.68
  years at r = .02 and t =   .3.   Thus to the extent that these
 considerations are important, the incentive to save
                                                     through IRAs
 because of their higher return should be greater for
                                                      persons in
 higher tax brackets, and the disincentive because they
                                                        are less
 liquid should be less the higher the tax bracket.

      Some persons of course may consider the illiquidity of
                                                             IRAs
 an advantage; it may help to ensure behavior that
                                                   would not
 otherwise be followed. it may be a means of self—control. The
 fact that the opportunity is lost if a contribution is
                                                        not made in
 the current year may serve the same purpose. One
                                                   cannot, as with
 conventional saving, put it off--possibly a self delusion-—untli
the next year.1

     In addition, because of the higher return on IRAs, to achieve
any given level of retirement income
                                     requires less saving if funds
are placed in an IRA account
                             than if they are placed in a




     1One might, for example, have a scheme in which the limit
the current year is added to next year's limit if               for
                                                  a contribution
is not made in the current year. Or, the contribution
cumulate more generally over time if contributions     limit could
during some period.                                are not made
                               —6—


conventional account. For example, again at r = .1 and t =   .3,   to

achieve a million dollars in retirement saving at age 65 would

mean giving up $4,377 per year current consumption, beginning at
                                                       but only
age 25, if saving were through a conventional account,
$1,775 if saving were through an IRA. This "income" effect raises
the possibility that there could in fact be less saving with than

without IRAs.
     The effect of IRAs on saving is the net result of all of

these factors, including their promotion, and it is thus important
                                     that allows each to be
to choose an empirical specification
reflected in the estimation of their saving effects. It may be
tempting to think of IRAs and conventional saving accounts as

equivalent assets, or goods, simply with different prices, in
which case one might think of IRAs as only a price subsidy of
conventional saving with a limit on the quantity that can be had

at the subsidized price. But to the extent that consumers treat
                                            because one is
them as different assets or goods——possiblY
 intended for retirement and the other for short term saving or

because one is less liquid than the other--and to the extent that
 the promotion has influenced their use, this view will not yield

 an adequate representation or forecast of the saving effect of
 IRAs. Indeed, the subsequent analysis indicates quite strongly
 that the two are not treated as equivalent by consumers.


      B.   Descriptive Data
      The Consumer Expenditure Surveys are now conducted every
 thi-ee months with a new cohort of families entering each quarter
                                    —7—

   and with each family
                          surveyed for five consecutive
                                                          quarters.2 For
   the purposes of this
                         analysis, self—employed persons who are not
   eligible for IRAs have been excluded from the
                                                  sample.
        The percent of families that made IRA contributions
                                                             is shown
   in table 1 for the first nine quarters
                                          after all employees became
  eligible. The data are presented for two
                                             periods, five quarters
  in the first and four in the second.
                                         We refer to them as the
  first and second
                    years respectively. The percents pertain to all
  of the respondents in the
                           quarterly surveys for each period taken
  together.3 The percent that contributed
                                          increased substantially
  between the first and second years in each income interval.
                                                                 In
  addition, the percent
                         Contributing increases sharply with income,
  from 3 or 4 percent in the lowest to 50
                                           or 60 percent in the
  highest income interval.
                             Nonetheless, the vast majority of
 contributing families have family incomes less than
                                                       $50,000, 74
 percent in the first and 70
                               percent jfl second year. About 90
 percent of individual
                        contributors have incomes less than this
 amount.

        Overall about 16 percent of the second

 fluctuate widely from quarter to quarter. For this reason the
 percent with an increase has been shown in the table.6 A simple
 regression of the average of other financial saving on average IRA

 contributions, and time, yields essentially a zero coefficient on
 the IRA variable (.076 with a t-ratio of .117) when stocks and

 bonds are excluded.7 Thus despite very large increases in IRA
 contributions over this period, there seems on average to have
been no noticeable reduction in saving in other financial asset
 forms.

      A summary of the saving behavior of IRA contributors compared
to non—contributors is shown in table 3. It shows the percent of
IRA contributors with an increase in other saving compared to the
percent of non—contributors with an increase. The percent with an
increase in other saving is almost invariably higher among
contributors. Thus it is not possible to see in these data a
tradeoff between IRAs and other saving. Rather the data suggest
an individual specific saving effect with those that save in one
form also more likely to save in other forms as well. The
analysis below will show that this is largely explained by
differences in measured variables like age and education, with

little correlation between unmeasured determinants of IRA saving
and saving in other forms.




     6The median is not used because it is almost always zero; a
large number of respondents report no change in asset balances.
     7when stocks and bonds are included the coefficient is .769
with a t-ratio of .706.
                                —10—


     To put in perspective the magnitude of IRA contributions, it
is helpful to have in mind the level of other asset balances. The

median of all financial assets, including stocks and bonds, was
$1125, based on the 1982:1 through 1984:1 panels. The median
excluding stocks and bonds was $1000. Because of an oversight in
the coding of collected data, it is not possible to calculate the
equity value of housing for CES respondents, and thus there is no

measure of nonliquid wealth, which is largely housing. The
approximate level of nonliquid wealth of CES respondents can be
inferred, however, from such data collected in the 1983 Survey of
Consumer Finances. The median level of all financial assets among
respondents to that survey was $1300. The median of total wealth
was $22,900, the large majority of which was housing.8 These data
confirm the low personal saving of American households documented
by others.9 Thus financial asset balances, and even total wealth,
are very low compared to the potential accrual from a $2000 or
more annual IRA contribution.
     If, as table 3 shows, IRA contributors save more in all forms
than non—contributors, one would expect them to have accumulated




     8See Venti and Wise {l986a, l986b]. Although the overall
medians in the SCF and the CESs are approximately the same, the
medians for the 50-100 thousand and the 100 thousand plus income
groups are substantially larger according to the SCF--about
$20,000 and $36,0000 respectively for all financial
assets,including stocks and bonds. We do not know the reason for
the difference in the two surveys, but the sample sizes of high
income families are quite small in both.

                             Table 4 confirms this.
                                                      But even among IRA
   Contributors, other financial
                                 asset balances are relatively low.
   It is clear that
                   most contributors have not been

  II. he Statistical Model

         The spirit of the
                         statistical analysis is to consider the
  relationship between IRA contributions and other
                                                    saving,
  recognizing the effect of the
                                IRA limit, allowing for flexible
 substitution between IRA and other forms of
                                              saving, and Using a
 specification that is commensurate with the cross

sty1ize version of the model to introduce the
                                              main features of
the approach. Then the details of the
                                           estimated model are set
forth.

       In the subsequent analysis, parameters analagous to a and b
are parameterized as functions of individual characteristics like

age. In this sense, the model may be thought of as the reduced
form of a more structural life cycle model. For our purposes,
however, the individual characteristics are used only to predict a

and b for different families.
       To describe the effect of IRAs on saving, having estimated
the parameters of the model, we ask how saving would be affected

                                             on those not constrained
  by the existing limit.  Persons at the limit would increase their
  IRA contributions by one dollar if the limit
                                               were increased by one

 predict a and b be unbiased in the usual

 predictions of a and b themselves be unbiased.

 that the decision
                   function accurately fits individual choices.
 And the extrapolations
                        of individual choices when the limit is
 raised depend on the
                      assumed distribution of the disturbance terms

  desired as well as observed s2 are allowed to be negative. In

  addition, the potential substitution between
                                                    S1 and S2 is allowed
  to be quite flexible and distinct from the substitution between
 either form of saving and current consumption. Given current

 income, a decision function with these characteristics is

 This function has a tree structure with one branch current

 expenditure and the other saving. These two components are
 evaluated in a Cobb—Douglas manner with preference parameter b.
 The two forms of saving are evaluated according to a constant

 elasticity of substitution subfunction.12 The parameter a
 indicates the relative preference for S1 versus S2; if a =
                                                                 .5,
total saving is split equally between the two forms. The

elasticity of substitution between S1 and 2 is 1/(1-k). The
important feature of this functional form is that it allows

greater substitution between the two forms of saving than between
either of these and current consumption.

        It also allows the IRA advantage to be reflected first in a
lower cost of saving in terms of current income, through the

current budget constraint, and in addition through different

preferences for the two assets, possibly reflecting the different

rates of return. Although the illustrations in section I-A show
that the distinction between current cost and return may be an
artificial one in strict economic terms--that the ultimate
difference is one of yield only——Consumers may understand better,

and be influenced to a greater extent, by the current tax saving
than by the tax free compounding of interest, certainly the
promotion of IRAs has tended to highlight the former. In

practice, it is not possible to distinguish the quantitative
effect of one from that of the other. Indeed, in practice it is
                                        precision the effect of the
not possible to distinguish with any
tax rate from the effect of other variables, income in particular.
Nonetheless, both features of IRAs, as well as any effects of

advertising or the contract—like nature of iRA saving provisions,

are allowed to determine individual choices.

In this case, the IRA tax advantage simply creates a kink in the

intertemporal budget constraint describing the relationship
between foregone current consumption and future consumption, and
inframarginal arguments could be used to represent the incentive
effects of IRAs on persons who would in their absence save more
than the IRA limit. This possibility is clearly rejected by the
data, however.
       3.        Other values of k
       Unlike the k = 0 or k = 1 cases, there is no closed form
solution to the constrained s2 function for other values of k. In

this case, the constrained functions, S2*(O) when S < 0 and
S2*(L) when S2 > L, are defined only implicitly by the

relationship

       C.        Parameterization of a and b and Stochastic Specification

       To capture the wide variation in saving behavior among
individuals, a and b are allowed to depend on individual
attributes X. They are also restricted to be between 0 and 1 by

using the form

            b =      F[Xk]
(10)
            a =      F[X]
where F[j is the standard normal distribution function and a and
  are vectors of parameters.
       Finally, we allow the S1 and S2 functions to be shifted by

additive disturbances e1 and e2 respectively. A random preference

  stochastic specification that makes each individual's
                                                        choices
  formally consistent with the decision function (4) is
                                                        obtained if
  a1 and a2 are assumed to be random, with
                                           additive disturbances.
  This specification is not tractable, however,
                                                  when S2 must be
  solved for implicitly.
                          Experience with both forms in Vent! and
  Wise [1986a, 1986b) shows that the results are not
                                                     appreciably
  affected by this choice. The disturbances are
                                                 assumed to be
  distributed bivariate normal with standard deviations

 respectively and correlation r. The disturbance term for the
 constrained S2 equation is obtained as described for

      There are three Possibilities
                                      for the observed values of
 S1: 0, between o and L, and L.    In principle, a continuously
  measured value of S2 is available for each person,
                                                      yielding three
  possible joint outcomes for each observation. In
                                                     practice,
 however, about 40 Percent of
                               the sample reports no non—IRA saving,
 apparently reporting small changes as zero. Thus there is
                                                               a large
 concentration of observations
                                at zero, which is inconsistent with
 the normality assumption. To reflect the fact
                                                 that some of the
 reported zeros are in fact Positive and others
                                                 negative, we
 randomly assign them categorical
                                   values, positive or negative.
This yields three Possible outcomes for
                                          S2: the reported non—zero
value, less than zero, or greater than zero. Thus for
                                                         each of the

  indicated that there was no employer contribution. Under the
  typical defined benefit plan, contributions to pension funds are
  not associated with individual workers, and some respondents in

  such cases may have been unaware of the employer contribution.
 Others may be covered by defined contribution plans with no
 employer contribution.

      As mentioned above, although the CESs provide data on home
 and property values, and on consumer debt, the public use files do
 not report the amount of home mortgages. Thus it is not possible
 to obtain an accurate measure of non—liquid wealth. In its place,

 we use non—liquid assets--defined to include home and property
 values, plus stocks and bonds, minus consumer debt——and a variable
 indicating whether the respondent owns a home but has no mortgage.
 There is no measure for Social

      B    Parameter Esi-imates

     Results are reported for three time periods: (1) 1983:2 to
1984:1, the second year that IRAs were available to all employees;
(2) 1982:1 to 1983:1, the first year of general availability; and
(3) 1980:1 to 1981:4, before IRAs were generally available.15




     15Respondents were asked how much they contributed to an IRA
account during the past 12 months. Contributions for a given tax
year can be made until April 15 of the following year, or, the
entire contribution for a year can be made on January 1 of that
year. Thus part of the contribution reported in surveys conducted
after 1982 could have been for the prior tax year and part for the
current tax year. No matter what the survey quarter, however, the
non—IRA saving always corresponds to the same 12 month period as
the IRA contribution, which could of course be zero.

    The key parameters in determining the effect of a limit

change on saving are a, b, and k, together with the origin
parameters and the residual variances. The substitution parameter
k is the most difficult to estimate. Given the potential for the
other parameters to adjust to fit the data as k varies, the
likelihood function is quite flat with respect to k. The
estimated value is always close to zero, however, and often

slightly negative, indicating an elasticity of substitution
between S1 and S2 of about 1.
      Results with C1   set   equal to c2, are shown in appendix table

1 (for the 1983:2 to 1984:1 period). In this case, the estimated
value of k is —0.15, with a standard error of 0.06. Estimates
with c1 again set equal to c2, but with k set to zero, are shown
in appendix table 2. These results are virtually the same as
those with k estimated. There would appear to be no appreciable
effect from assuming k = 0 instead of the small estimated value.
Simulations based on the two sets of estimates confirm this. Thus
the results discussed below were obtained setting k equal to zero.
     The other parameters are affected somewhat, however, by
allowing the residual variances for the two equations to be
different. The estimated variances are different and both are

quite precisely measured.16 Results with separately estimated
variances but with k set to zero are shown in table 6. We take




     16And, allowing the disturbance variances to be different
changes somewhat the estimated slope parameters, primarily because
of the tradeoff between the two when fitting the data subject to
the IRA limits.

        1.   1983:2 to l984J
          The estimated correlation coefficient is essentially
                                                                zero,
   .01, indicating that unmeasured determinants of IRA
                                                       and non-Ipx
  saving are unrelated. In particular, it is not the
                                                       case that,
  given measured attributes X, persons who make IRA
                                                     contributions
  save less in other financial asset forms.

          The averages of the predicted values of a and b
                                                          provide a
  summary of the results. Recall that b is the proportion of
                                                               the
  marginal dollar of after tax income that individuals
                                                        would like to
  allocate to financial asset saving, both IRA and non-Ip.
                                                              The
 proportion of this amount directed
                                      to IRA saving is a. It is
  important to keep in mind when interpreting these
                                                    parameters that
 they represent rates of increase in the desired
                                                  saving functions.
 Because of the negative
                          origin parameters, desired saving is
 negative for a large portion
                               of the sample and actual saving zero
 or negative, and this would still be true after
                                                  an increase in
  income. And, the IRA limit restricts the realized effect
                                                            of an
 income increase on IRA saving. Thus these marginal
                                                      rates are not
 comparable to estimated marginal
                                   saving rates where there are no
 limit constraints or where the limits have not
                                                 been accounted for
 in estimation. We call them latent increases
                                                to distinguish them
from actual realized dollar
                             increases in saving with income
increases, the usual meaning of
                                 marginal saving rates.
      The mean of the estimated
                                total financial asset marginal
saving rates is .206. The vast
                                 majority of this amount, 92.8
                              —28—


percent, would be allocated to IRAs. Thus there is a strong
                                                              in
preference for IRA versus non—IRA saving. The latent increase
non—IRA saving with a dollar increase in after tax income is only
                                     estimated value of ab. The
1.5 cents, indicated by d2, the mean
latent increase in after tax income devoted to IRA saving is
ab/(l-t)the price of an iRA dollar is less than 1--about 24.6
cents averaged over the sample. These estimates are consistent
with the observation that many IRA contributors had accumulated
                                                            with
very little in non—IRA financial assets, and more generally
the finding that a large proportion of respondents had essentially
no saving at all, other than housing.
      The results are virtually the same if stocks and bonds are

included in the definition of S2.17     Estimates were also obtained

under the assumption that some respondents included IRA balances
with bank saving accounts and other assets used to determine S2,
with little effect on the central conclusions.18


      17In this case, the estimated b is .176, a is .906, r is
      —.01, C1 is 5.91, c2 is 3.52, a1 is —14.49, and a2 is —.06.
      3-8The key questions used in the analysis are reproduced in
 footnote 5. Although it seems unlikely to us that the typical
 respondent would have included "...self-emplOyed retirement plan
 such as Individual Retirement Account •.." with "Savings accounts
 in banks, •..," some may have confused the two.  A simple check
 shows that almost a third of the respondents made IRA
 contributions that were greater than their reported other saving
 balances. In these cases, the IRA was clearly not included with
 other saving, Of persons who reported beginning of year other
 saving balances less than their reported IRA contribution——those
 who would be most likely to have IRA contributions greater than
 end of year other saving balances--almost 70 percent reported
 year—end other saving balances less than their IR contributions.
 obviously, this group did not confuse the two. (The 70 percent
 would not be expected to be 100 percent because persons who make
 IRA contributions are also likely to save in other forms as well.)
 Finally, we assumed that 20 percent of those who had year—end did
 saving balances greater than their reported IRA contributions
                                 —29—


      If the two forms of saving are close substitutes, the
 proportion of marginal income devoted to S2 saving should increase
 when the IRA limit is reached. Evidence on this question is

 provided by estimated values of this proportion for families at
 the IRA limit, before and after the limit is reached, d2 and d2*.
 If there were no limit, these families would on average increase

 non—IRA saving by 3.3 cents with a dollar increase in income.
 After the IRA limit is reached, a dollar increase in income is
 associated with an increase of 4.6 cents in non—IRA saving. The
 difference of 1.3 cents is very small relative to their average
 latent marginal propensity to save in the IRA form, 33.3 cents.
      For comparison with estimates for years prior to the
availability of IRAs, we consider the marginal effect of income on
saving that is implied by these estimates, if there were no IRAs,
that is, if the limit were 0. From equation (7) above, the
marginal effect in this case is (1 -    a)b/(l   -   ab).   Its mean over
persons in the sample, based on the parameter estimates in table
6, is .015. A dollar increase in after tax income would be




include the IRA with other saving balances. The key parameter
estimates were changed very little; the principle effect was to
reduce somewhat the mean estimated S2 saving. The analysis in
Venti and Wise [1986bJ, based on the SCF in which the
interpretation of the other saving response was much more
ambiguous than in the CESs, was done using both interpretations
for all respondents. Considerable sensitivity analysis based on
the two interpretations of the responses to the key questions, as
well as other assumptions, is reported there.
                                —30—


associated with an increase of less than 2 cents in financial

asset saving.19
     Finally, the relationship of individual attributes to the

predicted values of a and b are of some interest, although the
associated coefficients should not be assigned a behavioral
interpretation. Families who have in the past accumulated more
liquid financial assets are indeed more likely than others to
continue saving more in this form, as indicated by the positive
coefficient in the b equation, but liquid assets are in fact
negatively related to the proportion allocated to IRAs. Total
desired saving, as well as the desired proportion in IRAs, are
larger for older persons. The more highly educated also have a
greater propensity to save, suggesting that saving behavior varies
widely in the population, as others have found.2° Larger families
save less.
     2.      1982:1 to 1983:1
     Comparable estimates to those in table 6, but for the first

year that IRAs were generally available, are shown in appendix
table 3. The important difference between the two sets of
estimates is that estimated desired marginal IRA saving increased
from the earlier to the later period, apparently reflecting




     19Although small, the estimate does not seem unrealistic
compared to the aggregate personal saving rate based on national
accounts, which is in the range of 5 percent. And a large portion
of this amount is in company pension plans, that are not included
in the analysis here.

     20See, for example, the survey of King [1985].
 increasing awareness of IRAs and their advantages. The estimated
 total latent marginal saving rate in the earlier period is only
 .120 compared to .206 in the later period; the estimated
 proportion allocated to IRAs is about the same in the two periods,
 .888 versus .928.

      3.   1980:1 to 1981:4

      Before 1982 only persons without private pension plans could
contribute to IRAs and the limit was lower. Only about 3 percent
of the CES respondents contributed in 1980 and 1981. As mentioned
above, the model estimated for the later years provides estimates
of implied saving behavior were IRAs not available. Other saving
S2 is given by the constrained saving function in equation (7),
with the limit L set to zero. In particular, marginal saving is

given by (l-a)b/(l-ab), with a mean of .015.

       To check this prediction, a comparable estimate can be
obtained directly from the data for the pre-1982 years. The only

hindrance to exact comparability is that the earlier data do not
report whether a person had a private pension plan and was thus
ineligible for an IRA in these years. It is clear from the
summary data, however, that IRAs were essentially unused and quite
possibly most people who could have taken advantage of them were
unaware of their availability. Certainly they were not widely
advertised, as they were beginning in 1982. Thus we have
estimated the constrained S2 function for the 1981-1982 period,
                               —32—


assuming that the IRA option was not available at all.2' Because
there is only one equation to estimate, it is not possible to
estimate both a and b as functions of X; instead the marginal term
(l-a)b/(l-ab) is estimated as a single function of X. The results

are shown in table 7. The mean of the predicted marginal saving
terms is .013, compared to .015, the value implied by the full
model. Both of these estimates are consistent with the very low
levels of financial asset balances reported above and with the low

levels of total personal saving, currently in the 4 to 5 percent
range, most of which is comprised of contributions to employer

pension plans.22
       These very low estimates compared to the much larger total
marginal saving term for the later period (b = .206) also suggest
that the IRA saving was not simply replacing other personal
financial asset saving, of which there was very little. If this
were the case, one would expect to see a relationship between
income and saving in this early period that approximates the
relationship for total saving in the post IRA period. It is clear
that IRA saving in the later period does not show up as non-IRA
financial asset saving in the pre-IPA period. Apparently desired
saving was much higher in the later period. The results are
summarized in the tabulation below:




     21-The few persons who made contributions in those years were
deleted from the sample.

Not only are the implied non IRA marginal savings rates based on
the estimated model virtually the same as the actual observed
rates prior to IRA availability, but the estimated intercept terms
a2 are essentially the same as well. According to these
estimates, total desired marginal financial saving increased from
.013 in the pre IRA period to .120 in the first year after their

introduction, to .206 the following year.23

     C.   The Model Fit
     Predicted versus actual percents of the sample with S1 saving
greater than 0 and at L are shown in table 8, together with the

percents with positive S2 saving. In general, the predicted
values match the actual values very closely by income interval.24




     23The estimated intercept in the IRA equation, a1 is much
lower in the first than in the second period, but the efror
variance is higher in the first period as well, 5.82 versus 3.86.
     24To obtain the actual S2 values, the values reported at zero
were randomly assigned to be positive or negative. The percents
actually reported to be greater than zero ranged from 22 percent
in the lowest income interval to 47 percent in the highest,
compared with the range from 47 to 69 after random assignment of
zeros.
                               —34—


In particular, the conditional percents with positive S2 saving,
for persons who are at the IRA limits of 0 and L, are close to the
actual values. If anything, the model overpredicts positive S2
saving among persons at the IRA limit. If the model were not
adequately capturing actual substitution between S1 and S2, it
should underpredict non-IRA saving by those who exceed the IRA
limit. 25


     D. Simulations of the Saving Effect of Proposed and Adopted
            Legislation
     For comparison, the effects of two plans are simulated. The
first is the so—called Treasury I proposal of November 1984 (U.S.
Department of Treasury, 1984) and the second is the recently
adopted 1986 tax reform legislation. The early proposal was to
increase the limit for an employed person from $2000 to $2500 and
the limit for the spouse of an employed person from $250 to $2500.
The new legislation maintains the previous provisions for persons




     25The predicted versus actual average dollar amounts of S
saving are $348 and $366 respectively; S2 values are $261 versus
$226. For persons with S1 = L, the S2 values are $1670 versus
$1873. For those with s1 = 0, the S2 values are $82 versus —$6.
In some cases, the average dollar amounts are affected
substantially by extreme values of S2 saving. We therefore
eliminated the top 5% and the bottom 5% of the reported S2 values
and reestlinated the parameters in table 6. The estimated
parameters change very little. For example, b is .189 instead of
.206 and a is .964 instead of .928. As expected, the estimated
residual variances are smaller; c1 is 4.97 versus 5.82 and c2 is
1.53 versus 3.09. In this case, the predicted and actual average
S1 savings are $262 versus $272 and S2 $188 versus $153. For
those with s1 = L, the S2 values are $552 versus $335. For those
with s1 = 0, the S2 values are $152 versus $121.
                                —35—


 without a private pension plan. For persons covered by a private
 pension, it phases out the tax deduction of contributions by

 single person at incomes between $25,000 and $35,000 and for
 families filing joint returns at incomes between $40,000 and
 $50,000. Returns continue to accrue tax free.
      The initial simulations indicate what would have happened,
according to the model estimates, had these plans been in effect
during the period of estimation, 1983:2 to 1984:1. Simulation of
the effects of the first plan is straightforward. The second is
more complicated for two reasons. First, it depends on private
pension plan coverage, which is apparently underreported in the
CESs, as explained above. Second, for the approximately 10
percent of the tax filers who have private pensions and higher
incomes it eliminates the current tax deduction but not the tax—
free compounding of returns.

      Our model specification incorporates the contribution tax
deduction in the budget constraint, in line with the promotion of
IRAs. The specification also recognizes that the IRA should be
preferred because the return accrues tax free. It does this by
letting the preference parameter a in particular, as well as b,
depend on income, age, and other individual attributes. The
estimated coefficients on these attributes capture not only the
direct effects of the attributes themselves but also any effect of

the marginal tax rate, which, during the period of estimation,
should be predicted well by these personal attributes. The
marginal tax rate determines the relative return advantage of the
                                  —36—


IRA over a conventional account. But we found that it was not

possible to identify with any confidence the marginal tax rate
effect itself, in particular, as distinct from the effect of

income. The estimated effect is very sensitive to the
specification, especially the way that income enters the model.

Similar results are reported in Wise [1984 and 1985] and in Venti
and Wise [1985). King and Leape [1984) report little effect of
the marginal tax rate on asset choice.
     Thus while we have considerable confidence in the simulated
effects of the limit increase proposal, the estimated effects of
the current legislation may be less accurate. We have simply
phased out the lower price, 1 —   t,   for persons with private
pensions and with incomes above the appropriate limits.26 To the
extent that pension coverage is underreported in the CESs, the
contribution reduction is underestimated. Simulations using the
new tax rates in the budget constraint were also performed, but
since the new rates have little effect overall the results are not

reported here.27




     26The IRA price is assumed to be 1 -    t
                                            at $40,000 and to move
linearly to 1 at $50,000 for married persons filing joint returns,
and similarly for single persons with incomes between $25,000 and
$35, 000.

     271n this case, to the extent that the separate effect of the
greater IRA return is important in determining the greater
preference for them, it is not accurately reflected in the
preference parameters since the relationship between tax rates and
other parameters such as income has changed.
                                    —37—

       The simulated effects of the Treasury proposal and of the new
  law are shown in table 9. Predicted saving under the current plan
  is taken as a base for
                         comparison. The Treasury plan would have
  increased iRA saving by 31 percent, with almost no reduction in
 other saving. Persons at the current limit would have increased
 their contributions by about 43 percent. The simulated changes in
 consumption, taxes, and other saving associated with the IRA
 increase are as follows:


                                           Amount   Percent
           Change   in   IRA saving     +$1l99      100.0
           Change   in   other saving      -37       -3.1
           Change   in   consumption      -793      —66.1
           Change   in   taxes            -367      —30.8

 By these estimates, almost two-thirds of the increase in IRA
 saving is funded by reduced consumption and about one—third by
reduced taxes28 If stocks and bonds are included in S2, the
reduction in other saving is 5.7 percent, consumption is reduced
by 64.6 percent, and taxes by 29.7 percent.
     The new law will reduce contributions by an estimated 13

of $40,000 and above. If it is assumed that the reported pension
coverage in the CES is correct for persons with incomes above this

reduction can be obtained by assuming that the upper income
families cannot contribute at all to IRAs if they have a private

pension plan. Under this assumption, the reduction is 19 percent.
With greater pension coverage than the CES reports, more persons
would be restricted by the new law and both of these estimates
would be somewhat larger. None of the simulated effects is
changed much if marginal tax rates from the new bill are assumed.



IV. Summary and Discussion

     The evidence presented here suggests that the vast majority
of IRA saving represents net new saving, not accompanied by a

reduction in other financial asset saving. Thus increases in the
IRA limits such as those proposed in the November 1984 Treasury

plan would lead to substantial increases in IRA saving and very
little reduction in other saving. If the IRA limit were raised,
about two-thirds of the increase in IRA saving would be funded by

a decrease in current consumption and about one—third by reduced
taxes; only a very small proportion would come from other saving.
These conclusions are supported both by descriptive data and by
the formal statistical analysis developed in the paper.
Tabulations from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys show that:
     — The sharp increase in IRA contributions beginning in 1983
     was not accompanied by a reduction in other forms of
     financial asset saving.
     — The financial asset holdings of 1982 and 1983 IRA
     contributors were much lower than would have been accumulated
     had prior saving been even a fraction of the typical IRA
     contribution.
                                  —39—


      — IRA
            contributors are much more likely than non-contributors
      to save in other forms, suggesting that the larger
      accumulated financial asset balances of contributors reflect
      this greater saving propensity.
 The formal analysis indicates that:
      — Individuals
                    show a strong preference for IRA versus other
      forms of saving.
      —
        Controlling for individual attributes like age and income,
      there is essentially no correlation between IRA contributions
      and other financial asset saving.
      —   There s very little substitution of IRA for other
      financial asset saving, consistent with the observation that
      most potential contributors and a large proportion of actual
      contributors had been saving very little before the advent of
      IRAs.

      The model, estimated on post-IRA data, predicts well the
actual relationship between income and financial asset saving
prior to the advent of IRAs. In particular, saving in IRA
accounts does not show up as other financial asset saving prior to
the general availability of IRAs. The cross-section results for
the 1983:2 to 1984:1 period correspond very closely to results

based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances.29

     The analysis, however, does not rule out the long run
substitution of IRAs for non-liquid assets, housing in particular.

Our implicit measure of current consumption includes expenditures

on housing and other durables. While we believe that there is
little possibility for substitution in the short run and thus
little effect on the results here, the substitution possibilities
are greater over time.

    The statistical analysis accounts for the important effects
of the IRA limits and for the effect of the IRA constraint on non-
IRA saving. In addition, it allows for flexible substitution
between IRA and other financial saving. The model also allows the
two forms of saving to be treated by individuals as distinct
goods, but also allows the data to reveal them to be equally

preferred and treated as perfect substitutes. In this case, the
IRA saving of a small proportion of contributors might be thought
of theoretically as inframarginal and thus having no new saving

effect. The data, however, strongly reject this view. One
explanation for this is simply that individuals think of IRA
contributions as saving for retirement and distinct from other
saving that might be intended for more short term purposes.    And

the intensive promotion of IRAs may have greatly increased the
allocation of current income to them and thus the strong

preference for them that is revealed by the data.   Indeed the

strong advertising of IRAs may have reshaped to some extent public
attitudes toward saving for retirement. In this sense, it may be

that an IRA, much like life insurance, is sold not bought.3°
Although the tax advantage of IRAs is surely part of the
explanation for their popularity, the net saving effect that
accompanies IRA contributions invites alternative explanations for

their growth.




     30Such an argument was recently suggested by Summers [1985].

     Saving schemes like IRAs have been available in Canada since

1956 and were greatly expanded and promoted in the early 1970's.
It was at this time that personal saving rates in the U.S. and
Canada, which until that time had been very similar, diverged,
with substantially higher rates in Canada thereafter.   Large
increases in Registered Retirement Saving Plan limits are now
contemplated in Canada. The United Kingdom has recently
established two new tax—deferred saving programs. One, the
Personal Pension Plan is directly patterned after the U.S. IRA,
but is billed as a substitute for firm pension plans. The other,

the Personal Equity Plan, has tax advantages equivalent to the
IRA, but limited to and intended to encourage more widespread
individual investment in the stock market. Similar plans are
available in France and Belgium. Both are reported to have had
substantial net saving effects, but we have seen no formal
analysis of this.

       We adopt a stochastic specification that allows additive
disturbances e1 and e2 associated with S1 and S2 respectively.
They are assumed to be distributed bivariate normal within
standard deviations c1 and c2 and correlation r. The joint
distribution of S1 and S2* is the relevant distribution if IRA
contributions are either zero or at the upper limit. The
disturbance associated with S2*, denoted by e2*, is a linear
function of e1 and e2 so the joint distribution of S1 and S2* is
also bivariate normal. Derivation of e2* and the covariance

paramenters (c2* and r*) of the joint S1, S2* distribution is
straightforward, but tedious.
       There are nine possible outcomes. Define S1 = S1 +
   =
       2   + e2, and S2* = S2* + e2*. With f the unit normal density
function , F the corresponding distribution function, and F2 the
bivariate distribution function, the probabilities associated with
each outcome are given by:


1. s1 =     0 and S2 observed


P1 =   (1/c2)   f(s2—S2*/c2*) {1_F[S1+r*(c1/c2*) (S2_52*)/(c1i1_r*2) ]
                                                         Appendix Page 2

2. S1 observed, 2 observed

P2 =       (2pc1c2ul_r211
       x exp{—1/2(1—r2)[((s1—1)/c1)2 — 2r(s1—S1)(s2—2))/c1c2
       +    ((s2—S2)/c2)2])

3. S1 = L and S2 observed

P3 =       (1/c2*)f((s2—2*)/c2*)   F[(1—L+r* (c1/c2*)(S2_2*))/(c1/1_r*2)]

4. s1=OandS2>O
P4 = F2 [-S1/c1, S2*/c2*; —r*)

5. S1 observed S2 > 0

P5 =       (1/c1) f((S1—1)/c1) F[2 + r(c2/c1)(S1_1)/(c2i1_r2)]

6. s1=LandS2>0
P6 = F2[—(L—S1)/c1, S2*/c2*; r*]


7. s1=OandS2<O
P7 =    F2[-S1/c1,   -S2*/c2*; r*]

8.     S1 observed and 2 < 0

P8 =    (1/c1) f((S1—1)/c1) x(1_F(2+r(c2/c1)(S1_1)/(c2/1_r2fl)

9. s1=LandS2<O
P9 = F2[—(L—S1)/c1, —S2*/c2*; —r*]

The likelihood function is the product of the P over the relevant
subsets of observations.
