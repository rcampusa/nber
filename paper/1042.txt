        This paper reviewsa variety of estimates of the dnd and supply
elasticities of educated labor. It finds that elasticities of substitution
between irore and less educated labor range fran 1.0 to 2.0 and that elas-
ticities of the supply of students to colleges are also on the order of
1.0 to 2.0 while elasticities of supply to specific professions are on
the order of 2.0 to 3.0. With elasticities of this magnithde, wages
and tploynent depend on both supply and dand factors, with shifts of
either schedule influencing both market outcane variables.

              SUPPLY ELASTICITIES FOR UCTED LABOR




        The number of persons choosing to enroll for higher education

overall and in various specialties'has varied greatly over the years.

In the 1960s, enrollment in colleges and universities grew throughout

the world, leveling off and in some cases declining relative to the

relevant age group. Among fields, some expanded at some periods of

time while contracting at others. As Figure 1 shows 'for the U.S. the

supply of new educated labor to various disciplines has shown

remarkable change over time.

        To what extent do these changes represent the response of

persons making education and career decisions to economic incentives?

        The key concept used to answer this question is the elasticity

of the supply of educated labor, -e s-ur-e-&-a-s--t-h-e percentage change in

the number of persons choosing various forms of education per

percentage change in the relevant economic incentive. The magnitudes

of the elasticities depend on the relative number of persons who are

"on the margin" among various alternatives ——     that   is to say, the

number who, at existing pecuniary and nonpecuniary rewards to various

careers, are potentially movable across fields. Since older workers

have often made sizeable investments in their careers in the past, the

responsive "margin" consists largely of the young, who are in the

process of making career choices.

         Whether or not supply elasticities of educated labor are large

or small has long been an issue of concern. In the aftermath of

Sputnik (1956), many doubted whether individual career decisions were

sufficiently flexible to permit free market economies to produce as

large a supply of scientists and engineers as planned economies. The

human capital "revolution" in economic thinking about labor supply also

directed attention to the magnitude of the supply elasticities. One

key assumption of the human capital model is that individuals make

investments in education in response to market incentives, which should

be revealed in significant elasticities of the supply of educated

labor..

          Efforts to estimate elasticities of supply of educated labor

have taken several forms. Some studies have analysed the impact of the

salaries of college workers relative to high school workers on the

proportion of the young enrolled in college; some have focused on the

effect of tuition and scholarship charges on enrollments; while others

have studied the relation between salaries in specific disciplines and

the relative number of young persons choosing to study in those areas.

Several of the studies have used time series data to estimate supply

elasticities, identifying supply behavior from demand behavior by the

fact that, because education takes a number of years, the decision to

study in a field depends on salaries and related market conditions

prior to the individuaYs graduation into the job market. Other

studies have compared the relative number of persons obtaining

different levels or types of education across geographic areas to

salaries in these areas. Another body of literature has concentrated

on the decision of individuals to enroll in higher education and/or the

type of education or institution they choose.

          The various studies have yielded generally consistent results
                                                                  4




regarding the magnitude of the elasticities of supply of educated

labor. They show that the decisions of young persons to enroll in

college and to choose various fields of study are quite responsive to

economic incentives, producing substantial elasticities of supp1y.

They indicate, further, that elasticities of supply to specific fields

tend to be higher, in general, than elasticities of supply to higher

education as a whole. Surveys of students regarding the importance of

salary and career considerations in their educational decisions

buttress these conclusions: a large number take explicit consideration

of monetary factors in decision—making.

             Table 1 summarizes some estimates of the responsiveness of the

overall supply of young persons to higher education. Panel A treats

studies that have focused on the elasticity of supply to salary or wage

incentives while Panel B treats studies that estimate responsiveness to

tuition charges.

             Despite differences in the nature of the studies, the estimates

in Panel A fall into a range of around one to two. The studies for the

U.K.   are   comparable to those for the U.S. The Mattila study, which is

the only one to estimate responses to calculated rates of return rather

than starting or average salaries, yields figures analogous to studies

using these measures of incentives. All told, the various studies

reveal considerable responsiveness, which goes a long way to accounting

for observed swings in the proportion of young persons enrolled in

college in postwar years.

McPherson, tell a similar story. All of the reviewed studies found

that tuition affected enrollment, with a magnitude that roughly

indicates that a $100 change in tuition would alter the proportion

enrolled by perhaps .8 or so percentage points. Translated into an

elasticity of response, the tuition—elasticity of enrollment is about

0.3 (McPherson, p. 181). Since tuition is only a fraction of the

salaries received by students, this low number makes intuitive sense

and is, indeed, consistent with a supply elasticity of the magnitude

found in Panel A.

         Finally, U.S. survey evidence provides additional support for

the notion that students are highly responsive to economic rewards in

decisions to enroll in college. Nearly 80 percent of freshment

surveyed by the American Council of Education in 1977 agreed, for

example that a major reason for going to college was that it would

enable them to get a better job. One—third cited "ability to make

money"   as a very important reason for going to college. While some may
doubt the meaningfulness of these responses, they are consistent with
the   statistical studies cited in Table 1.

         As for elasticities of supply to specific fields of study, a

substantial literature has examined time series fluctuations in

enrollment and degrees, of the type shown in Figure 1. Supply

elasticities have been estimated for a wide variety of professional

specialties. Physics (Freeman, 1976), Economics (L. Hansen, 1980),

Engineering (Freeman, 1976, Sirbu et al, 1978), Law (Freeman, 1976,

Freebairn and Withers, 1979, Pashigan, 1977), in the U.S.; teachers in
                                                                7




the U.K. (Zabaiza, 1979), among other areas. The principal result of

this work is that supply elasticities to various professions are quite

sizeable and, in conjunction with observed wage changes, explain a

large proportion of the changes in degrees and enrollments of the type

shown in Figure 1.

         An important prerequisite for labor supply to be responsive to

economic incentives is that decision—makers be knowledgeable about

market conditions. Surveys of several thousand college students have

shown them to be aware of the ranking of fields by salary, of

differences in lifetime income profiles, and of recent changes in

salaries, providing further support for the high estimated supply

elasticities (Freeman 1971).

         Many studies distinguish between short—run and long—run

elasticities of response. The short—run response is defined as the

percentage   change in one years supply due to a change in economic
incentives; the long run response represents the percentage change in
supply   a number of years in the future assuming the new wage pattern

persists. As a rough generalization, short—run supply elasticities are

typically below 1.00, while long—run elasticities are in the range of

3.0 to 4.0. The long—run responses tend to exceed those estimated for

college enrollments overall, presumably because any given field can

attract persons from other college fields as well as from persons on

the margin between attending college and working.

         There is some evidence that the supply of educated labor to

specialties such as engineering fluctuates according to "cobweb—type"
                                                                8




dynamics in which a large supply in one period depresses wages and

market opportunities, which in turn reduces enrollment and future

supply, thereby raising wages and improving conditions, and so on. The

impact of this market dynamics on suppiy in engineering can be seen in

the swings in enrollment in Figure 1. Estimates of the supply and

demand elasticities in the market do, however, indicate that these

fluctuations are stable and dampened (Freeman, 1976, Freeman and

Hansen, 1982), which means that it takes considerable shocks to set off

supply responses that greatly overshoot the appropriate levels in the

market.

          Overall, it appears that supply elasticities for educated labor

are quite substantial among new entrants to the job market. Because of

the relative stability of the supply of older specialists, relatively

few of whom go back to school to change their fields of specialization,

however, elasticities of total supply are much smaller.

        The elasticity of demand for educated labor measures the

percentage change in the number of workers with specified levels of

education demanded by employers per percentage change in the wage of

these workers, other wages and input prices assumed fixed. It is a

central concept in the analysis of the market for labor skills, as it

represents the responsiveness of employers to price incentives to

employ workers of varying levels of education. When the elasticity of

demand is relatively small (as in case A of figure 1) enormous changes

in wages are needed to induce employers to alter the number of workers

hired. In this case, one can practically ignore responses to wage

changes and analyze demand for labor as if it did not depend on wages.

When the elasticity of demand is moderate, by contrast, the concept is

a critical element in understanding the effect of economic changes on

demand for labor and wages (case B in figure 1). When the elasticity

of demand is near infinite, it is probably not useful to think of

educated labor as a distinct input in production at all, as it is

likely that other inputs are perfectly substitutable for it (case C in

figure 1).

           The magnitude of the elasticity of demand for educated labor

depends critically on the extent to which educated labor is

substitutable for other inputs in production. The ease of

substitutability is generally measured by the elasticity of

substitution, defined as the percentage change in the number of

educated workers relative to the amount of other inputs (say, less

educated workers) per percentage change in the wages of educated

workers relative to the price of other inputs (say, the wages of less

educated labor). Formally, if       measures the number of educated

workers and E0 the number of other inputs and if w1 and w0 are the

respective factor prices, the elasticity of substitution a is

     (1)   a   =
                   E1(%E1/E0)/(%w1Iw0)
where %measures percentage changes. In analyses which treat employer

demand responses at a given level of output, the elasticity of demand

is just a function of elasticities of substitution. When the level of

output varies in response to changes in prices, the elasticity of

demand for educated labor, like other inputs, depends on the elasticity

of demand for the final product as well.

           The elasticity of substitution between more and less educated

workers (or other inputs) has been at the center of analyses of demand

for educated labor for two reasons. First, because the validity of

widely used 'fixed coefficIent' methods for forecasting educational

demands or "needs" and the potential economic worth of educational

planning to meet such demands or "needs" hinges critically on the size

of the elasticity. Standard "fixed coefficient" forecast methods assume
                                                               4




zero elasticities of substitution in order to focus on the impact of

changes in the composition of industries on the demand for educated

labor. The greater are actual elasticities, the less valuable are such

forecasts. Similarly, planning education to meet future labor market

demands is useful only if elasticities of substitution are small; if

the elasticities are large, employers can readily substitute less

educated for more educated labor, so that even accurate planning will

be of little economic value. Second, the elasticity of substitution

between more and less educated labor is important in analyzing the

impact of changes in relative supplies of workers on the distribution

of earnings. When the elasticity is high, large increases in the

supply of graduates relative to nongraduates will have little effect on

their relative wages. When the elasticity of substitution is small,

large increases in the relative supply of graduates will cause sizeable

changes in relative wages and thus will alter the distribution of

earnings.

        Given these issues, it is not surprising that economists have

undertaken empirical studies designed to measure the elasticity of

substitution between more and less educated or skilled workers.

Because the number of workers with varying levels of education is

predetermined in any given year by supply decisions made years earlier

due to the length of training, most analyses actually examine the

inverse of the elasticity of substitution, the elasticity of

complementarity, which measures the percentage change in relative wages

due to percentage changes in relative supplies. While it is
                                                                 )


reasonable to assume that supplies are fixed in analyses that treat
time series data, this assumption is less defensible in comparisons

across geographic regions at a point in time: within a country, the

supply of educated workers to an area can migrate in response to wage

incentives and thus cannot be regarded as ttexogenousll to wage

determinatiofl across countries, differences in supply may reflect

responses to differences in the rewards to education that persist over

time, weakening the assumption that supplies can be taken as

independent of the wages. Accordingly, some studies have also used

simultaneous equations' techniques to estimate the relevant

elasticities of substitution. In these studies demand and supply of

educated labor are estimated conjointly in a system.

           What is the result of these studies? What is currently known

about the elasticity of substitution between more and less educated

labor?

           Table 1 summarizes the findings of the most important empirical

studies.

           Initial   work on elasticities of substitution focused on cross—

sectional data, with most attention given to cross country comparisons.

While the early evidence on U.S.      states   supported

relatively    moderate elasticities (Johnson, Welch) the work of several
analysts led many to believe that the elasticity was rather high,
sufficiently    so to yield practically horizontal demand curves. Bowles

particular,    an elasticity between workers with some college education

and those with 8 to 11 years of school of 202, and smaller but still

sizeable elasticities (6 to 12) between other educational groups. With

a sample of 28 states from the United States, Dougherty obtained a more

moderate but still high estimate of over 8. Psacharopoulos and

Hinchliffe divided the international sample by degree of development,

obtaining an essentially infinite elasticity (implying perfect

substitutability at the relevant wage ratios) in the developed

countries but a more modest value in the less developed countries. As

the relative earnings of graduates remained constant or increased in

the 1950s and 1960s, despite increased supplies of graduates frOm

colleges and universities, these estimates were generally accepted as

being in accord with reality. Some viewed them as casting serious

doubt on the concept of educational bottlenecks as a barrier to

economic growth and on the value of the fixed coefficient model of

labor demand, then being used by the Organization for Economic

Cooperation and Development, among others, to analyse the graduate and

skilled worker labor markets for the purpose of educational planning.

        In the 1970s, concurrent with the observed decline in the

relative earnings of college graduates throughout the developed world,

analysts began to re—examine these results. New estimates based on

better data and models provided a very different picture of the

elasticity of substitution between educated and less—educated labor.

Nobel—laureate Jan Tinbergen amplified the country and state analyses

to take account of the likely simultaneous determination of relative

wages and relative supplies in cross—sections and obtained quite
                                                                8




different results from Bowles and Dougherty using their data sets. His

elasticities ranged from 0.50 to 2.00, which were consistent with the

earlier cross U.S. state work of Welch and Johnson. Freeman used time

series data for the United States to estimate the effect of the growth

in the number of college graduates relative to high school graduates on

their relative earnings and obtained estimated elasticities of a

similar magnitude, ranging from 1.0 to 2.6. Layard and Fallon examined

a large cross—section of countries, with the comparable results shown

in the table. Grant developed estimates in a complete translogarithmic

systems equation which included capital in the analysis and obtained a

value of 1.2. All told, the current evidence suggests a value of the

elasticity of substitution between more and less educated labor in the

range of 1.0 to 2.0. This magnitude is consistent with changes in the

supply of graduate.s altering their relative earnings and does not

invalidate the potential economic worth of educational planning based

on fixed coefficient models.

        A large number of additional studies on substitution among

groups of workers have used occupational disaggregation. While these

results show a wider range than those given for educational groups in

Table 1, the estimates are consistent with elasticities of substitution

between highly educated and less educated workers of 1 — 2.   In the

Hamermesh and Grant review of 20 estimates of elasticities of

substitution between production (blue collar) and nonproduction (white

collar) workers, the mean estimate was 2.3, with half the studies

yielding estimates below 1.0 and half above that value.
                                                             9




        The relationship between capital and more educated or skilled

labor and the relationship between capital and less educated or skilled

labor has also been studied as important elements in the demand for

labor of varying educational qualities. The key hypotheses in this

work had been that capital is less substitutable (more complementary)

for educated than for less educated labor (Griliches). If this is the

case increases in capital raise the demand for educated labor relative

to less educated labor and changes in the price of capital cause

employers to alter employment of the less educated more than employment

of the more educated. The extant evidence appears to support this

hypethesis. Of the twelve studies in the Hamerinesh—Grant review

article, eight show capital to be more easily substituted for blue

collar labor than for white—collar labor, and half indicate that white—

collar labor is actually complementary with capital, so that changes in

the price of capital raise demand for white collar labor rather than

reduce it. The only study to examine labor by education also shows

lower substitutability between the more educated and capital than

between the less educated and capital (Grant).

        With moderate elasticities of substitution between educated and

less educated labor and with relatively small (or even oppositely

signed) elasticities of substitution between more educated labor and

capital, current evidence suggests that the elasticity of demand for

educated labor is of a moderate magnitude. In terms of Figure 1, the

evidence suggests that case B represents actual labor markets. Hence,

analyses of the impact of economic changes or policies on employment or
                                                            10




wages of educated labor cannot ignore the employment response to

changes in wages.
