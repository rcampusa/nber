Transition

                                                ABSTRACT

During the 19th century, the US birthrate fell by half. While previous economic literature has emphasized
demand-side explanations for this decline—that rising land prices and literacy caused a decrease in
demand for children—historians and others have emphasized changes in the supply of technologies
to control fertility, including abortion and birth control. In this paper I exploit the introduction during
the 19th century of state laws governing American women’s access to abortion to measure the effect
of changes in the supply of fertility technologies on the number of children born. I estimate an increase
in the birthrate of 4 to 12% when abortion is restricted, which lies within the ranges of estimates found
for the effect of fertility control supply restrictions on birthrates today. The importance of legal abortion in
reducing 19th-century birthrates helps to account for a previously unexplained portion of the demographic
transition. This paper posits that there has long been a demand, often unmet, for fertility control that
should be considered in future demographic research as well as in policy formulation.

Introduction

       At the start of the 19th century, the US birthrate was among the highest in the

world. During the 1800s, however, the US experienced one of the world’s largest decline

in fertility. Total female fertility dropped from seven children per woman in 1800 to less

than four per woman at the end of the 19th century (Degler 1980). This drop is referred to

as the 19th Century Demographic Transition. Economic and demographic studies have

largely focused on the demand-side for fertility control during this transition. Why were

people demanding smaller families during this time period?

       The demand hypotheses that have found the most support in the literature are the

land availability hypothesis (Degler 1980, Easterlin 1971, 1976a, 1976b, Forster and

Tucker 1972, Haines and Guest 2008, and Yasuba 1962) and the related bequest

hypothesis (Carter et al. 2004, Easterlin, Alter and Condran 1978, Haines 1987, Steckel

1992, Sundstrom and David 1988). There is a negative correlation between child-woman

ratios and population density at the state level (Yasuba 1962) and the county level

(Forster and Tucker 1972). Easterlin presents a sociological hypothesis that the reason

for this correlation is that parents, wanting to divide their property equally between their

heirs, would rather keep their children close than send them West where land was

cheaper, and thus have fewer children (Easterlin 1976a). Haines and Hacker (2006)

argue that parents wanted this proximity as a form of old-age insurance. However, this is

more of a motivation for parents to keep the most productive children nearby than to keep

all of them. In addition, in the tradition of primogeniture that British settlers brought to

the early United States, there was no need to divide up land among heirs (Easterlin



                                             3
1976b). Nonetheless, Steckel (1992) finds that the strongest predictive variables for

fertility were financial institutions and labor market structures, and Carter et al. (2004)

and Sundstrom and David (1988) suggest that the land-availability hypothesis does

poorly in the South is because slaves provided a version of old-age insurance. Carter et

al (2004) presents and excellent analysis of these literatures.

       There is also some support in the literature for the increased education hypothesis

(Degler 1980, Easterlin 1976b, McLaren 1990, Reed 1978). Easterlin (1976b) finds a

small negative correlation between literacy of parents and fertility rates among farm

families, although Carter et al. (2004) find mixed results of literacy and education on

fertility. McLaren (1990) and Degler (1980) report that literate wives had lower fertility

than did illiterate wives married to men of the same class. Education may change

attitudes towards fertility and raise the cost of children by increasing women’s income

potential. A similar hypothesis is the “outside opportunities for women” hypothesis. In

this hypothesis, women are attracted to paid employment at the expense of childbearing.

However, differences in fertility rates are found even between more and less densely

populated rural areas in the 19th century, where education and literacy levels were high

for all women and there were very few employment opportunities outside of the “farm-

wife” role. Therefore these hypotheses cannot entirely explain the decrease in fertility

rates (Easterlin 1976a).

       Other hypotheses that have not found as much support include the child labor

hypothesis and the burden of aged dependents hypothesis. As the US industrialized,

child labor was less useful than it had been in an agricultural economy (Gordon 1976).

Again, examining fertility differences among agricultural areas finds that fertility was



                                              4
actually higher in areas where child labor was less useful (Easterlin 1976a). Therefore

this hypothesis cannot explain the entire decline. Similarly, little evidence has been

found to support the idea that families in newer areas were less likely to be supporting

aging relatives.   Perhaps the most convincing argument against this explanation is

Easterlin’s (1976a) assertion that there were not enough aged persons relative to prime-

aged working adults to account for any differences in fertility.

       Early economics theories also touched on fertility control as a side-effect of

delayed marriage or increased breast-feeding (Degler 1980, Reed 1978, Sanderson 1979,

Wahl 1986). Although these methods may have been in part responsible for some of the

earlier, 18th-century, demographic transition, especially in France, they cannot explain all

of the increase in child spacing or the termination of childbearing within marriage before

a woman’s fertile years had ended.        Easterlin (1976b) provides a summary of the

evidence that marital fertility limitation was more important than delayed marriage in the

19th-century U.S. demographic transition (c.f. Degler 1980, Reed 1978). These and other

hypotheses are discussed in greater detail by Easterlin (1976a, 1976b), and Haines and

Hacker (2006). Similarly, urbanization and industrialization have been cited as sources

of lower fertility, but the drop precedes the greater part of these phenomena, and the drop

in the rural birth rate matched that of the urban birth rate (Degler 1980, Reed 1978).

       Outside of the field of economics, the supply side of fertility control technology

has been explored more thoroughly. Historians, using letters and other print evidence,

have pointed out that there has always been a demand for fertility control (Degler 1980,

Mohr 1978), but the 19th century provided information and access to abortion and birth

control through word of mouth, print literature, lecture tours, and the new catalogue



                                             5
market (Brodie 1994, Mohr 1978, Scott Smith 1973, Smith-Rosenberg 1985, van de

Walle and de Luca 2006). Put in economics terms, transaction costs for fertility control

access had decreased with improved information transfer, product markets, and decreased

transportation costs.

        Why has this supply-side view been substantially ignored by economists?2 Some

argue that there were no birth control or abortion inventions in the 19th century (Degler

1980). Indeed, much of the birth control and abortion technology had been invented in

Roman times or earlier. The only major fertility control invention in the 19th century was

the 1844 vulcanization of rubber, which greatly improved the quality of condoms and

decreased prices. However, just because the technology had been invented does not

mean that it was available to the average American. Innovation and information transfer

played an important role in 19th century fertility, as they did in many spheres during the

second industrial revolution. A parallel can be made to the steam engine, invented during

the time of Archimedes, but not used for practical purposes until the 18th century, and

having its largest effect on the economy when applied to railroads with increasing

refinements in the 19th century.3

        A second reason for this lack of interest in supply-side causes of the demographic

transition is that only recently have economists taken an interest in the effects of birth

control and abortion access on major economic outcomes (cf. Angrist and Evans 2001,

Bailey 2006, Donohue and Levitt 2012, Goldin and Katz 2002, Levine 2004, and others).


2
  But not all economists—David and Sanderson (1986) specifically address the supply-side of 19th century
family limitation and its “quiet percolation” throughout the 19 th century. Haines (1986) and Haines and
Guest (2008) also mention the need for more research on information diffusion about the means to control
fertility.
3
  There is some disagreement among economic historians as to the validity of this analogy. It is true that
many technological advances needed to be made before Archimedes steam engine could be harnessed for
practical use.

                                                     6
Haines (1986) also argues that the availability of 19th century data may also have limited

previous activity in this area.

        Information transfer and innovation can help explain the correlations that have

been found between fertility rates and land prices (which are directly related to

population density), between fertility rates and railroadization (Carter et al. 2004 and the

author’s calculations), and between fertility rates and literacy rates. Higher population

density means that women can communicate different birth control techniques to each

other, and that there is a market to support midwife and abortion services. Places with a

large enough population center might also be included on the lecture circuit, which grew

dramatically over this period (Degler 1980). Population density is also tied to canals and

railroadization, which facilitated the circulation of paper information in the form of

newspapers, advertisements, mail-order services, pamphlets, and books.4 Higher literacy

rates allow people to digest the flow of information.

        This paper focuses on the effects of limiting availability to fertility-control

information, products, and services, specifically those of abortion. It finds that fertility

rates are higher in states and times when access to this technology has been cut off by

state laws restricting abortion. When the costs of obtaining fertility control are higher,

people will not limit their fertility as easily as when costs are lower, even when demand

for fertility control does not change. Therefore, the fertility ratio will be higher in areas

where access to products and information has been cut off by legislative action. This

paper’s estimates that abortion restrictions led to an 4-12% increase in births are

strikingly similar to results on the effects of limited abortion access for modern

populations (cf. Levine et al. 1999, Angrist and Evans 1999).

        The value added to recent discussions of fertility control by the approach of

examining the 19th century is twofold. First, identification of effects is easier—fertility

has been completed, so regressions do not need to censor for potential future children.

Second, laws changed over a long period of time rather than providing, as in the case of

1970s abortion legalization, just a few years of differences between states (in addition,

higher travel costs make contamination between states less of an issue). In a companion

paper (Ananat and Lahey, mimeo), the long period since these law changes means that

full lifecycle effects on the cohorts of children born to women who had more versus less

fertility control can be observed. These effects include not only education, marriage, and

childbearing, but even longevity and mortality.



Background

       Nineteenth-century women seeking to abort often used herbal remedies before

resorting to surgical ones. Some of these herbs, such as cotton root, black or blue cohosh,

rue, or savin, were potentially effective abortifacients, and some herbs made women ill

enough that their bodies aborted on their own (see, for example, Ernst 2002, Madari and

Jacobs 2004). Other herbal remedies were not actually abortifacients, but emenogogues

that did help regulate menstrual cycles and so gave the appearance of being effective

abortifacients. Others were purgatives, causing illness and intestinal problems, or were

harmless but useless. These remedies were widely advertised and available through mail




                                            8
order until changes in the legal environment in the latter part of the 19th century made

them more difficult to obtain (Brodie 1994, King 1992, Smith-Rosenberg 1985).

         As in the early to mid 20th century, membrane rupture through the use of metal

rods (knitting needles and crochet hooks are reported to have been popular) or sharp

sticks was a common surgical method of abortion used by “irregular” abortionists and

women themselves. Once the membrane was ruptured, the body would expel the fetus on

its own. This method was very dangerous and could easily injure the woman’s internal

organs if performed incorrectly (King 1992).

         Dilation and cutterage, though invented in ancient Greece, was only reintroduced

to the Western world in the 1840s; it became prominent among regular physicians

sometime in the 1860s or 1870s (King 1992). This method first dilates the cervix, then

uses surgical tools to scrape fetal tissue out of the uterus. It is still common today, but

must be performed with the appropriate tools. Although thought to be safer and more

effective than membrane rupture when performed by a trained professional, it can still

lead to infection.

         It is not known whether abortion or childbirth was the more dangerous option

during the 19th century (King 1992).5 Observers from that time period have made the

claim in either direction depending on their agenda (King 1992), and scattered statistics

also point in either direction (Degler 1980, Gordon 1976, Mohr 1978, Tribe 1990). The

relative danger may have varied over the time period, as both childbirth technology and



5
  Initial examination of death records provided by Fogel and by Ferrie suggests that reported deaths from
childbirth were several times larger than those from abortion and miscarriage during this time. When
including child bed deaths (a form of sepsis), this fraction is even larger. It should be noted that death by
“abortion” in these early death certificates may mean the same as death by miscarriage (personal
communication Noelle Yetter). However, it is not clear that all deaths from botched abortions would be
coded as such.

                                                       9
abortion technology were changing throughout the century. Increases in hospital birthing

have been shown to have increased maternal mortality in Europe in the 19th century and

the United States in the early 20th century (maternal mortality statistics are not available

for the US before the 20th century) because hospitals introduced more germs than did

home births (Loudon 1993). Hospital births did not really become “safe” until the 1940s

with the invention of sulpha drugs (McLaren 1990, Thomasson and Treber 2008). The

germ theory of disease and the spread of dilation and cutterage may have made surgical

abortions safer, if performed by trained professionals with the appropriate tools.

However, the legal environment that this paper exploits made these safer abortions

difficult to obtain in the second half of the 19th century.

         Doctors began to notice an increase in abortions in the late 1830s and 1840s

(Degler 1980, McLaren 1990). The most famous abortionist, New York City’s Madame

Restell, began her practice in 1838. Abortions early in the century were generally sought

by poor, unmarried women. The increase in professional abortions, however, drew from

the married middle-class (Degler 1980, Mohr 1978, Reagan 1991).                              Two thirds of

abortion cases cited in the medical journals in the second half of the 19th century were of

married women (Mohr 1978). Mohr (1978) and Scott Smith (1971) separately estimated

that there was one abortion for every 25-30 live births in the early 19th century, but one

abortion for every 5-6 live births in the mid to late 19th century.6 Some authors estimate

as many as one abortion for every 4 live births (McFarlane and Meier 2001, McLaren

1990, Tribe 1990). A study by the 1891 Michigan Board of Health cited one abortion for

  David and Sanderson (1986) argue that the 1 in 5 number was caused by a typographical error in the
original source material and should actually be 1 in 50, a number they estimate as much too small because
the rate of natural miscarriage is 1 in 5. However, the rate of natural miscarriage that they obtain is from a
1979 source, after the advent of home pregnancy tests, and thus overestimates the number of miscarriages
likely to be known in the 19th century.

                                                      10
every 3 pregnancies, 70-80% of which were obtained by middle and upper class women,

and a 6 percent mortality rate (Gordon 1976, Smith-Rosenberg 1985). Gordon (1976)

suggests that earlier estimates of the number of abortions were understated and the death

rates overstated because successful abortions were undercounted by contemporaries. On

the other hand, David and Sanderson (1986) argue that these numbers are overestimates

because they underestimate the natural rate of miscarriage. However, Sanderson (1979)

suggests that somewhat under half of all births averted by ever married women were

averted through induced abortion rather than birth control.

       The 19th century U.S. saw many major changes besides declining fertility rates.

Transaction costs were decreasing—in modern parlance, the world was getting “flatter.”

The United States was undergoing an early information revolution: as railroads spread

across the country, mass production and distribution became a reality, and the growth of

printing presses, combined with faster transportation and mass literacy, allowed for more

information transfer (Smith-Rosenberg 1985). The Second Industrial Revolution brought

significant changes in economic organization and modes of production.          All these

changes, however, were gradual, in contrast to the sharp changes that occurred within

states when abortion restrictions were enacted.

History of abortion laws

       Early abortion laws, beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, were some of the first

instances of malpractice laws. They regulated who could legally give abortions and

punished unlawful abortionists, especially if the woman died, but they did not punish

women seeking abortions (Brodie 1994).        Traditionally under British common law,

abortions before “quickening,” when the woman could feel movement, were not



                                            11
considered immoral both because the fetus was generally not thought to be alive at that

point and because proving pregnancy before quickening was difficult (Degler 1980,

Gordon 1976, King 1992). During this time period, many state supreme courts ruled that

abortion before quickening was not a criminal offense (Brodie 1994). Moreover, many

of the early state abortion laws were the result of automatic criminal code revisions and

were not well publicized (Brodie 1994).                 Many others were parts of omnibus laws

protecting consumers from dangerous poisons or protecting women in general (Degler

1980, Lader 1966, Mohr 1978, Polsky 1970).

         In 1860s through 1880s, however, states began to pass more restrictive anti-

abortion laws that outlawed advertisements, closed loopholes, and made women liable for

seeking an abortion. Many of these laws also prohibited abortions before “quickening.”

Unlike previous laws, these laws specifically focused on preventing abortion and were

not part of omnibus law changes as the earlier laws had been (Degler 1980). Although

the courts were often sympathetic to women and abortionists, the publicity and

questioning during a trial could permanently tarnish a reputation and in many cases the

official investigations and court trials amounted to harassment (Reagan 1991).7

         Social Movements Towards Restriction

         There are many theories as to why the more restrictive abortion laws were passed

after the 1860s. The American Medical Association (AMA) was the leading force behind

anti-abortion legislation. The leading theory on the subject, put forth by Mohr (1978) and



7
  Anne McCants (personal communication) suggests that even if anti-abortion laws did not directly affect
ability to procure an abortion (for example, if purported abortifacents do not actually work, or women and
abortionists do not actually fear the laws) they could still increase fertility if men believe that any attempts
to restrict fertility in an environment where such attempts are illegal. In this case, husbands may worry that
having fewer children would be indicative of lower masculinity and would thus increase their reproductive
efforts in order to prevent gaining a negative reputation.

                                                      12
taken up by many others (Brodie 1994, King 1992), is that the fledgling AMA used

abortion as a focal point in its fight to distinguish its doctors from quacks and other

“irregulars.” One argument made by some historians is that the AMA had originally tried

to use prostitution regulation as their core issue but that effort had failed dramatically and

lent strength to their opponents. Abortion better served their purpose (Reed 1978). A

similar but less Machiavellian explanation for the actions of the AMA is that regular

doctors believed that the Hippocratic oath disallowed abortions and did not want others

practicing abortions (and, in addition, possibly stealing patients) if they could not (Mohr

1978). Another, less mainstream, theory of AMA involvement suggests that through

advancing medical technology of the time, doctors had a better understanding of

conception and gestation and viewed fetal growth as a continuous process, rather than

one in which life was infused at “quickening,” or when the mother could first feel

movement (generally around 18-20 weeks) (Degler 1980). Reed (1978) suggests that

physicians saw each abortion as a lost potential paying customer, especially as well-off

middle class women began to be the primary recipients of abortions.

       Some feminist historians emphasize that the leaders in both the anti-abortion and

anti-birth control movements, such as Storer and Comstock, were themselves infertile.

Recent modern evidence that legislators who are also fathers are more likely to favor

abortion rights if they have daughters (Washington 2008) lends plausibility to the

argument that 19th-century views on abortion were affected by such personal

characteristics—that “the personal is political.” A final argument is that since white,

middle class women were practicing family limitation in greater numbers, middle class




                                             13
white men (which included the members of the AMA) were worried about immigrants

and other undesirables populating the country (Smith-Rosenberg 1985).

Data

Abortion Laws

         A number of secondary sources exist describing abortion laws. Contemporary

activists from both sides of the abortion debate provided snapshots of the laws as they

existed at the time (Dennett 1926, Storer 1859, 1868). Additionally, historians have

compiled lists of these laws for various time periods, and legal scholars have discussed

specific laws in depth (Dellapena 2006, Lader 1966, Mohr 1978, Quay 1961). To

identify all state laws regulating abortion, I compiled and compared these secondary

sources.    The original laws were also obtained from the Harvard Law Library’s

microfiche of superceded state statutes and the UCLA law library superceded state

statutes. Additional laws were obtained via Google books and state law librarians.

         In addition to the existence of the law, various characteristics of these laws were

coded.     These include laws regarding: obscene supplies (“articles or instruments of

immoral use,” such as devices, appliances, apparatuses, drugs); obscene information (any

material containing obscene language or images, including information on how to obtain

supplies); and laws specifically outlawing information or actions related to “procuring a

miscarriage” (abortion). For each law, it is noted how what share of possible activities it

restricted: importing; sale; advertisement; distribution (including circulating or printing

information); verbal communication (including “uttering” or giving oral information);

using the postal service; possession; possession with intent to sell or distribute; or

singing. Each law’s severity was also recorded: whether the offense was classified as a



                                             14
misdemeanor or a felony (or left unclassified), as well as the punishment, if specified.

Exemptions include coding for each law whether it contained a clause indicating that it

did not apply to the following: scientific or medical works or books; medical colleges;

practitioners of medicine (which could refer to physicians, nurses, druggists, midwives,

etc.); artists and works of art; or activities for saving the life of the mother.

Fertility rates

        Fertility behavior is observed at the level of state and decade. Ideally, to test the

effect of the introduction of laws on childbearing behavior, there would be individual

birth cohort data by year, i.e., the number of children born in each state in 1850, in 1851,

etc. Cohort size could then be predicted using an indicator for whether there was a law in

place in that state in the year before that cohort was born, when abortion policy would

have been relevant for that cohort. Ideally there would also be information on individual

characteristics of women linked with childbearing, in order to test hypotheses such as

those in the literature on recent fertility control legal innovations that access affected the

behavior of groups (such as teens, or poor women) that had relatively high demand for

fertility control differently from other women.

        Unfortunately, Census information on single years of birth is not available for the

full sample—the Census tables only provide population data by five-year age groups (0-

4, 5-9, etc).     Moreover, historical Census tables do not provide information on

childbearing linked to mothers. Instead, the standard measure of 19th century fertility is

the child:woman ratio, calculated as the ratio of the number of children aged 0-9 to the

number of women of childbearing age, or 15-44 (some authors use ages 20-44 or 20-49).

Child:woman ratios were calculated by state-decade from 1800-1910 using tabulated



                                               15
census data from Haines Census tables in the Historical Statistics of the United States

(Carter et al. 2006), which is Census data cleaned by Haines (many earlier studies used a

version of the data presented by Kuznets). For the 1880 census, I replaced the Haines

data with collapsed cells from the IPUMs 100% sample.8 The sample contains white

women aged 15-44 (using the Yasuba interpolation for 40-44 year olds from data for 30-

39, 40-49 and 50-59 year olds9)—see Figure 1. This measure captures fertility rate and

spacing between children; it is also highly correlated with total fertility (Haines and

Hacker 2006).        More thorough discussions of the benefits and limitations of these

measures can be found in Easterlin (1976a), Haines and Hacker (2006) and Yasuba

(1966).10



Methodology

         To examine the impact of abortion restrictions on the number of children born, I

exploit the quasi-experiment provided by the variation across states in the timing of

passage of laws prohibiting abortion (shown in Figure 2).11 Analysis is limited to 1850

and later for several reasons. First, many states did not exist before 1850 and did not

have state law books. Second, as discussed above, there is reason to believe that there are

actually two phenomena occurring in the 19th century: an increase of technology and

information transfer in the first half of the century, and a legal brake on this flow in the


8
  Approximately half of the cells do not differ between the two datasets, most of those that do differ at the
100s place, several differ at the 1000s place, and three cells (Arkansas women age 10-14, Indiana women
age 15-19, and Missouri women age 20-24) differ at the 10000s place. The results are very similar using
the 1880 Haines census tables (generally changes only occur at the third decimal place on coefficients if at
all).
9
  The interpolation formula is (A+8B-C)/16, where A is the 30-39 cohort, B is 40-49, and C is 50-59.
10
   IPUMs cell sizes for 1850-1870 are too small to be representative of the population needed.
11
   States in the chart that are not included in the regressions (because of late state-hood and/or lack of
population data) are: Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Utah.

                                                     16
second half. Whereas early abortion laws tended to focus on malpractice and may have

actually made abortions safer for the women seeking them, later laws made abortions

more dangerous and difficult to obtain. States that did not exist before 1890 were also

excluded. (Most of the states gaining statehood between 1850 and 1890 had law and

population information collected while territories).                 The Dakotas are also excluded

because population information is not collected for the separate states in the early

decades.12

         Because only the entire number of children born over the ten years prior to each

Census (i.e., those aged 0 to 9) is observable, the relationship between a law passed in a

given year and the number of children born the next year cannot be identified. To

capture the fact that a law passed between Censuses affected only those pregnancies that

began afterward, a measure of for how much of a decade there was a valid law in place is

defined. This measure captures the share of the decade for which the law was relevant to

childbearing. This variable is lagged one year, because abortions in year 0 cause a

change in births in year 1.

         For a law to be relevant to the cohorts of children aged 0 to 9 in 1880, the law

must have been passed in the period 1870-1879. A law passed in 1876 was relevant to

those children born in 1877, 1878, and 1879—that is, it was relevant for roughly 30% of

the children who were aged 0 to 9 in 1880. Therefore such a law is coded as 0.3 for the

decade ending in 1880. A law passed in 1870 or earlier was coded with an indicator

value of 1.0 for the decade ending in 1880. If a state did not have a law for any of the



12
  Population information is available for West Virginia, and I double checked the state ratio in Carter et al.
(2006) with county-level data. WV laws are coded as the same as those in VA prior to the split until WV
updated its law sometime after the split.

                                                     17
period 1870-1879, the indicator has a value of 0 for the decade ending in 1880. Details

of the laws, such as restrictions, were coded by decade in a similar fashion.

The empirical specification is as follows:

          (1)          Fds = β1 havelawds + δd + δs + d*δs + eds

where Fds represents alternative measures of ten-year fertility in decade d in state s, and

havelawds is a continuous indicator variable ranging in value from 0 to 1 that reflects the

share of the decade for which a state has a law restricting abortion. State-specific (δs) and

decade-specific (δd) fixed effects are included to capture longstanding differences in

fertility patterns across states over time as well as aggregate patterns of changing fertility

preferences over time. In some specifications I also allow the state-specific differences to

trend over time by including an interaction between δs and decade d.                In some

specifications, I include d2*δs, the square of the state-specific time trend. The main

specification is unweighted to study the effect of the experiment, other specification

checks were weighted by total population to provide information for back of the envelope

calculations on the overall effect of the changes or women age 15-44 as a specification

check. The coefficient β1 measures the difference in ten-year fertility between states for

which a law was in effect for the entire decade (havelawds =1) and states for which a law

was never in effect in that decade (havelawds =0). In some specifications Fds is measured

as the level of the child:woman ratio, and in others as the log of that ratio. When using

the ratio itself, β1 represents an estimate of the change in the number of children born per

woman; when using the logged ratio, β1 represents the percent change in childbearing.



Results



                                             18
       The results of OLS estimates of equation (1) are shown in Table 1, Panel I. Log

and level regressions give similar results. Estimates suggest that laws restricting abortion

led to an increase of between 106 and 137 children born over a decade per 1000 women,

or a 9% to 12% increase in the number of children per woman from a base of about 1100

on average. These results are statistically significant at conventional levels in most

specifications, depending on decisions about weighting. The preferred specification is

that in column (4), with a full set of state and year fixed effects and state trends,

suggesting a 12% increase. Including state-specific time trends generally increases the

estimated strength and significance of the relationship between legal restrictions and birth

rates, suggesting that it is important to include controls for secular trends.

       The second panel of Table 1 estimates the overall affect of these laws on the

population of the United States. Unlike Panel I, which tests the effect of the natural

experiment, Panel II includes weights by total population, giving more power to the

actions of larger states. The point estimates for these results are somewhat smaller and

less significant, particularly when state trends are included in the estimation. These

results suggest that the laws increased the national child/woman ratio by 4 to 12%.

       Table 2 tests the different aspects of these laws that may have strengthened or

weakened the effects of the laws. The effect of a medical exemption signed as expected

and not significant, however it increases the effect of having an abortion law on fertility

to an increase of 15%. This variable indicates that an abortion is legal if there is a

therapeutic exception to save the life of the mother or child or that physicians and

medical texts are exempt from the law. Controlling for laws that allow for a crime to be

committed only if the fetus dies also strengthens the impact of the have law variable to



                                              19
13%. With this exception, a woman can seek an abortion or a practitioner can perform

one without being prosecuted. Since early abortions with abortifacients are difficult to

detect as abortions, the law essentially allows early abortions prior to quickening as had

been allowed by common law. Holding the female at fault increases fertility, but not

significantly so and controlling for female fault does not affect the effect of having a law.

However, this results should be interpreted with caution as only a few laws deem the

female at fault. Prohibiting sale, ads, and mailing of abortion information does not seem

to affect fertility beyond the effect of the original law.13 Classifying abortion as a felony

seems to have no impact on the law; this lack could be because judges and juries were

generally sympathetic to abortion cases in terms of finding fault and sentencing, but the

true penalty for those accused came from the publicity associated with the trial (Reagan

1991).14

         One controversy in the literature is on the effects of the legality of abortion prior

to quickening. Mohr (1978) holds that the change in legality of abortions prior to

quickening is important and makes the laws more restrictive. Later and openly pro-life

scholars (e.g. Dellapenna 2006, Olansky 1995) disagree, arguing that abortion before

quickening was always prohibited. King (1992), in contrast to either faction, takes a

more pragmatic view and argues that physicians could not determine pregnancy prior to

quickening. Columns (7) and (8) in Table 2 examine the effect of laws restricting

abortion prior to quickening and find no effect of these law characteristics. This null

13
   Disallowing any information about abortions has similar results. It may be that the availability of
effective early abortifacents was limited and that the majority of the action of these laws is occurring with
later term abortions. However, I do not want to put too much weight on this conclusion.
14
   Coefficients are remarkably similar when all characteristics are included in the same regression; the
effect of having a law increases to 16% with all characteristics included. Other law characteristics
discussed in the literature but not presented here include poison and instrument prohibitions. These do not
seem to have much of an impact, probably because the majority of laws include poison and instrument
prohibitions so there is not much variation in these restrictions.

                                                     20
result suggests that how quickening was treated was not that important in the 19th

century.

         Another Mohr hypothesis that can be examined is the relationship between AMA

strength and passage of anti-abortion legislation. Figure 3a provides a scatter-plot with

the date of a physician licensing law (Marks 2009) on the X-axis and year of first anti-

abortion law on the Y-axis. The thought would be that an upward slope would indicate a

positive relationship between physician political power and passage of anti-abortion laws.

There appears to be no such effect. Figure 3b uses a different measure of physician

power, the year that the first medical school was passed (US Bureau of Education

1898).15 Here there is an upward trend suggesting that the relationship is worth looking

into. Table 3 shows the standard regression including whether or not a state has a

physician licensing law in columns (1) and (2) or a medical school in columns (3) and

(4). The lack of effect of physician licensing law is borne out in the first two columns.

Column (3) suggests that having a medical school may impact the effect of an anti-

abortion law, however, that effect goes away once state specific time trends are

controlled for as in column (4). Thus physician strength does not seem to be related to

passage of anti-abortion legislation. However, the measures of physician strength are

crude and better measures may find an effect.




15
  Year medical school was passed includes regular and eclectic schools and does not include homeopathic
and postgraduate. Dates of first medical school after 1898 were taken from later editions of The Report of
the Commissioner of Education Made to the Secretary of Education and from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_the_United_States , confirmed on each medical
school’s webpage as the earliest. Later editions of The Report of the Commissioner of Education have
different definitions of what is counted as a medical school, but we use the 1898 definition for all schools
prior to 1898. The results are very similar using different definitions.

                                                     21
         Laws restricting abortion are positively correlated (correlation is .47) with those

restricting birth control.16 Putting the two types of fertility restriction laws together as in

Table 4, controlling for birth control laws does not seem to change the effect of having an

abortion law. Different methods of measuring birth control laws also do not seem to

affect the effect of an abortion law.

         If, rather than childbearing patterns changing in reaction to laws, in fact the

passage of laws reflected legislative reaction to changes in childbearing, then these

estimates could not be interpreted as the effects of changes in access to fertility control.

The falsification check shown in Table 5 tests for this possibility; I attempt to predict the

passage of a law in the next decade using the child to woman ratio in the current decade.

These tests find no consistent or statistically significant relationship between fertility and

subsequent passage of a law in any specification, as shown in column (1). There is also

no evidence for an effect of the percent immigrant, the female-male ratio, or the percent

of the population lost in the Civil War on the probability that a law was passed in the next

decade, as demonstrated in columns (2)-(4) respectively.17

         Another worry is that these laws prohibiting abortion are merely symptomatic of

changes in social mores that themselves affect fertility. Therefore I collected information

on legislation that prevented obscene singing, something that should be correlated with

social mores, but presumably would not affect fertility directly. I also used data from

(Eskridge 2009) on state laws banning public indecency and public exhibition which



16
   I collected laws restricting birth control from primary sources and compared them to those collected by
Bailey (2010). However, the passage of these laws is predicted by previous fertility rates and thus the laws
do not exogenously predict current fertility.
17
   Pretending the law was introduced 10 or 20 years earlier in results available from the author also
decreases the magnitude and significance of the coefficient (eventually flipping the sign), further
suggesting that the laws are not endogenous to fertility.

                                                    22
should be similarly correlated with social mores but should not directly affect fertility. 18

Table 6 shows that all of these laws have a negative rather than a positive effect on

ln(fertility) in specifications without a state-specific time trend included. Indecency laws

are significant at the 5% level in column (1) but this significance disappears and the sign

flips once a state specific time trend is accounted for. Exhibition laws show a similar

sign flip from column (3) to (4). Obscene singing laws remain negative and insignificant

in both column (5) and (6).

        Finally, Table 7 provides additional specification checks. The magnitudes of the

coefficient of havelaw are smaller when weighted by the number of women age 15-44 as

in column (1). Percent black in a state does not affect the coefficient of havelaw in

column (2). Although a south dummy is positive and significant, it does not change the

coefficient of havelaw once state dummies and state trends are also controlled for as in

column (3). Clustering by state, column (4), or by state*year, column (5), does not affect

the results. Results are also nearly identical when fertility is measured with children age

0-9/ women age 20-44 or when measured with children age 0-4/women age 15-44 as in

columns (6) and (7). The coefficient is somewhat larger when the sample is limited to

1860-1910 rather than 1850-1910, despite the larger sample size, as in column (8).



Discussion and Conclusion

        These estimates are highly consistent with research on recent (1970s-era) changes

in legal access to abortion and birth control, which find effects from 5% for the overall

population to 15% for groups that are particularly likely to want to decrease childbearing


18
  Eskridge (2009) also included laws on indecent liberties, enticement, contributing to sexual delinquency,
and schoolyard loitering but these laws tended to be passed later than anti-abortion laws.

                                                    23
(e.g. poor women, teenagers) (Ananat and Hungerman 2006, Levine et al. 1999).            The

consistency of the birthrate response to restrictions on fertility control is remarkable

particularly because of the lower efficacy and higher risks associated with 19th-century

methods of abortion. These results suggest that demand for increased fertility control has

been persistent since the 19th century, rather than being a recent social development

driven merely by shifting gender roles or increased labor market opportunities.       How

much lower would fertility have been in the absence of these laws? A back of the

envelope calculation, shown in Table 8, suggests that in the absence of abortion laws,

fertility would have been 5.23% lower without abortion laws in 1900 and 5.72% lower in

1910 and 13.81% lower in 1920.

         The flow and eventual cutting off of information and product availability for

fertility control did have real effects on fertility rates in the 19th century United States.

Using laws restricting abortion as a source of variation in availability, reducing the

availability of abortion increased fertility rates in the 19th century. These estimates of the

effects of abortion access are similar to those found in more recent times, and suggest that

when studying the 19th century U.S. demographic transition, explanations based on

supply factors cannot be neglected relative to those based on demand.

Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. Column (1) is weighted by the number of women age 15-44 in a
state*year. Regressions include state and year fixed effects and state-specific time trends. The dependent variable in
columns (1)-(5) and (8) is the log ratio of children age 0-9/ women age 15-44. Years included in columns (1)-(7) are
1850-1910 and states include all states extant before 1890 excluding the Dakotas for which population information is
available. There are 291 observations for columns (1)-(7) and 255 observations for column (8).
