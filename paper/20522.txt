                                             ABSTRACT

We study the impacts on remittances of offering migrants temporary discounts on remittance transaction
fees. We randomly assigned migrants from El Salvador and Guatemala 10-week remittance transaction
fee discounts, and assess impacts using administrative transaction data and a post-experiment survey.
Temporary discounts lead to substantial increases in the number of transactions and total amount remitted
during the discount period. Surprisingly, these increases persist up to 20 weeks after expiration of
the discount. We find no evidence that the discounts cause migrants to shift remittances from other
remittance channels, or to send remittances on behalf of other migrants. These findings are consistent
with naïveté on the part of migrants regarding remittance recipients’ reference-dependent preferences.

1. Introduction
        International remittances sent to the developing world have become an important focus of
development policy over the last two decades. 1 Remittances to developing countries amounted to
$401 billion in 2012, a number that far exceeded official development assistance (World Bank
2013). The interest in remittances has also been driven by a growing number of studies that
document positive impacts of remittances on a number of measures of well-being in recipient
households, including education, health, housing, poverty, entrepreneurship, and responsiveness
to negative shocks (Ambler et al. forthcoming; Cox-Edwards and Ureta 2003; Adams 2004; Yang
and Martinez 2005; Yang 2006; Woodruff and Zenteno 2007; Yang and Choi 2007; Yang 2008a;
Yang 2008b; Adams and Cuecuecha 2010; Theoharides 2013). This research suggests that further
increasing remittances could play an important role in achieving development goals.
        Despite this policy interest in increasing remittances, much less is known about how
migrants make decisions about the remittances they send. In this paper we study an important
component of every remittance sent through the formal financial system: the fee charged by the
money transmission institution for the service they provide, the reduction of which is a common
policy recommendation. 2 Remittance fees are generally charged as a flat fee up to a certain amount.
In our context of Central Americans remitting from the United States, some of the lowest fee
corridors, these fees are usually $8 to $10 for remittances up to $1,000 or $1,500, but the costs can
vary widely by market. Fees can therefore represent a high percentage of the overall remittance,
especially for migrants sending smaller amounts. Understanding how these fees impact decisions
is important for the design of policies that seek to lower them. For example, migrants could keep
any fee reduction for themselves, or they could add it to the remittance they send home, resulting
in minimal increases in remittances at most. Alternatively, behavioral models allow for situations
where discounts may have large and persistent impacts on total remittances. However, very little
research exists investigating how exactly remittance fees impact the decisions that migrants make
about remittances. 3

  Clemens and Ogden (2013) identify the cost of remittances (in the form of subsidies or taxes) as one of the most
important areas in research into remittances and development.



                                                        1
       Three existing studies address the impact of the cost of remittances on remittance flows.
Freund and Spatafora (2006) use cross-country data to show that remittance fees are negatively
correlated with total remittances at the country level. Gibson, McKenzie, and Rohorua (2006) find
that, in response to a hypothetical survey question, migrants report that they would send more in
remittances if fees were lowered. These studies provide initial evidence that remittance fees are an
important determinant in remittance decisions, but have some important shortcomings. Cross
country regressions may suffer from omitted variable bias and reverse causality, and while
hypothetical evidence is suggestive, it is not clear how well the hypothetical responses will
correlate with actual remittance decisions.
       Aycinena, Martinez, and Yang (2010) provide field experimental evidence on the impact
of remittance fees on remittances. They randomly assign Salvadoran migrants discounts on
remittance fees at a partner institution. The randomized experiment allows for the causal
identification of the impact of the remittance prices, and, importantly, the paper measures actual,
as opposed to hypothetical, remittance flows. They find that a $1 reduction in the price of a
remittance leads to a $25 monthly increase in remittance payments. However, the study has certain
limitations. Most participants were not baseline customers of the partner institution, limiting the
ability to observe full remittance behavior and raising concerns that the effects might be driven by
switching remittance companies or sending remittances for others. Additionally, data is not
available for the period after the discounts expired, so the authors cannot observe longer term
effects on remittance behavior after discount expiration. Because the impacts of the randomized
price are large and carry important policy implications, it is important to verify these results in a
setting where these limitations are addressed.
       This paper reports the results of a randomized experiment designed to measure the causal
impact on remittances of temporary discounts on remittance fees. We partner with a money transfer
company (Viamericas Corporation) and recruit migrants from El Salvador and Guatemala to
participate at their agent locations. All participants are existing customers of Viamericas at
baseline. Half of the participating migrants are randomly chosen to receive a $3.01 discount for 10
weeks for remittances sent at that Viamericas location. The discount is limited to remittances sent
to the person previously identified by the migrant as their primary remittance recipient (PRR). This
restriction is designed to reduce the probability that migrants will use the discount to send
remittances for others, thereby artificially increasing the amount of remittances sent. As part of a




                                                 2
larger project addressing the impact of remittances on education, half of the migrants are also
randomly allocated to receive information on returns to schooling in their home country.
         We then examine impacts of these treatments by looking at remittance transactions and
amounts in Viamericas administrative data, a data source that reduces measurement error in the
remittance data. We have access to the transaction data for participants before, during, and after
the discount period allowing us to examine the longer term impacts of these price discounts. This
transaction data is complemented with an endline survey that provides insight into use of other
remittance channels and asks participants whether they used the discount to remit for others.
         We find that, during the 10-week discount validity period, the discount has a statistically
significant positive impact on the number of separate remittance transactions made by study
participants. This effect is large in magnitude, amounting to 0.56 additional remittances, or a
19.0% increase over the 3.44 remittances sent by the control group during the same 10-week
period. There is no large or statistically significant impact on the dollar amount transferred per
remittance, so the discount has a positive and statistically significant impact on the total money
amount of remittances as well, specified as the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST) of
total dollars sent. 4
         A discount-induced increase in the number of remittance transactions and in the total
remittances by value during the discount period is not surprising in itself, and might simply be due
to migrants inter-temporally shifting a planned later remittance transaction to occur earlier, so as
to take advantage of the discount. If this were the case, we would expect to see a corresponding
reduction in remittance transactions and total remittance amounts after the expiration of the
discount. This would show up in the analysis as negative treatment effects on these dependent
variables, in magnitudes similar to those found during the discount period (in absolute value).
         As it turns out, this is not the case. We find that treatment effects on number of remittance
transactions and on the IHST of the total value of remittances remain positive in periods after
discount expiration. Effects are large in magnitude and statistically significantly different from
zero up to 20 weeks after discount expiration (up to twice the length of the original discount
period). 5



4
  Estimated impacts on the log(1+dollars sent in remittances) are very similar. Impacts on dollars of remittances sent
are also positive, but are quite imprecise due to the presence of large outliers.
5
  The education information treatment has no impact on remittance behavior.



                                                          3
         Additional analyses indicate that these results represent true increases in remittances. The
increases are concentrated among remittances sent to the primary remittance recipient, but these
increases are much larger than any reductions in remittances sent to other recipients. Migrants are
existing Viamericas customers and report minimal remittances sent through other channels both at
baseline and endline. Importantly, there is no impact of the treatment on remittances sent through
other channels reported in the endline survey. Finally, questions in the endline survey designed to
address the concern that migrants might send remittances for others in order to take advantage of
the discount show no consistent pattern related to treatment that might be driving the results.
         These large and persistent effects of the discount treatment are puzzling when viewed
through the lens of standard economic models. However, they are consistent with behavioral
models with reference dependence and status quo bias, such as Tversky and Kahneman (1991),
Masatlioglu and Ok (2005), and Masatlioglu and Ok (2014). We discuss our results in light of
these models in our conclusion.


2. Project design
         Given the difficulty of identifying the causal effect of remittance prices on remittance
behavior using observational or hypothetical data, we work with a money transfer company and
randomly assign price discounts to some of their customers. The random assignment of discounts
allows us to causally identify the impact of lower prices on remittance behavior. We partner with
Viamericas Corporation, an international money transfer company that provides remittance
sending services from the United States to a large number of countries across the world with a
concentration in the Latin American and Caribbean market. Fees vary across markets, but the cost
of sending a remittance less than $1,000 from the Washington, DC area is generally a flat fee of
$8. 6 Although Viamericas offers online and phone services, the vast majority of their transactions
are made in person through a network of independent agents in the United States. Viamericas
agents are independent businesses (usually small stores of some type) that collect the money from
the person sending the remittance and keep a portion of the fee as a commission for that service.
The remittance is then paid out at a Viamericas affiliated location chosen by the sender, usually a
bank or supermarket.


6
  In the year prior to our intervention, the fee paid by participants in this study was exactly $8 for 96% of
transactions under $1,000.



                                                            4
         Study participants were recruited at five Viamericas agent locations in the suburbs of
Washington, DC. Despite working in five locations, due to wide variations in the numbers of
Viamericas customers in each store more than 80% of our sample comes from just two of these
agents. Potential participants were approached by survey staff after sending a remittance and
invited to participate in the study conditional on meeting three screening criteria. Participants must
have been born in either Guatemala or El Salvador, must have just sent a remittance through
Viamericas, 7 and must have sent that remittance to the person that they consider to be their primary
remittance recipient (PRR). Recruitment in this way ensures that the study population is made up
of existing Viamericas customers. All migrants who agreed to participate received a $5 credit to
be spent at the agent location but which could not be used for remittance fees. 8
         Migrants who were eligible and agreed to participate first completed a short baseline survey
that collected basic demographic information about the migrant and their primary remittance
recipient, and information about remittances sent by the migrant. Following the survey, the
surveyor administered the randomly assigned treatment(s). Randomization was done at the
individual level and was stratified by agent location and in groups of 32 surveys to ensure that
treatments were balanced over time. Each survey was labeled with an ID number and pre-assigned
treatment status before being sent into the field and surveyors used the surveys in the order in
which they received them. Treatment materials were placed in an envelope attached to each survey
and surveyors did not know which treatment they would be administering until they opened the
envelope at the end of the survey. There were two types of treatments which were cross
randomized in a 2x2 design.
Price discounts
         Migrants in this treatment group received a discount of $3.01 off the remittance fee for
remittances sent to their primary remittance recipient through Viamericas at the agent location
where they were recruited. 9 The discount was valid for 10 weeks and there was no limit on the
number of transactions. Migrants received a plastic discount card and surveyors wrote the name
of the PRR and the expiration date on the card. In order to redeem the discount, migrants had to


7
  In many cases Viamericas agents also offer remittance services with other money transfer companies.
8
  The way in which this was implemented varied by location. Some chose to give out $5 phone cards, while others
offered more flexibility. Regardless, this credit was mostly used to purchase phone cards.
9
  The discount was $3.01 (rather than $3.00) in order to facilitate finding and analyzing the discounted transactions
in the Viamericas management information system.

present the card to the teller. We can verify in the transaction data that very few discounts were
applied to remittances sent to other recipients or after the intended expiration date. 10
Education information
            Migrants in this treatment group were given an informational sheet entitled “Why should I
send remittances for education?” The information focused on the low rates of secondary and
tertiary school completion in their home countries and described the earnings differentials between
those who had completed primary, secondary and tertiary schooling. Separate sheets were created
for Guatemala and El Salvador. The surveyor went over the information in the sheet with the
migrant and the migrant was given the flyer to take home. This education information treatment
was included in the project design because this study is part of a larger project that focused on
understanding new ways to promote using remittances for education. Although the results for this
intervention will be presented, this paper will largely focus on the impacts and implications of the
price discounts.
            These treatments were cross randomized, so migrants were randomly assigned to four
groups: T0 – Control, T1 – Education information only, T2 – Discount and education information,
and T3 – Discount only. Survey work began in late December 2012 and concluded in mid-April
2013. The last discount expired 10 weeks later in late June 2013. 946 migrants were surveyed in
total. 11
            Participating migrants were also contacted by phone for an endline survey. The goal of the
endline survey was to capture remittance behavior during the 10 week discount period and
consequently an effort was made to contact all subjects as close as possible to the day after the
expiration of their discount. In the case of the control group, the contact occurred relative to the
day that their discount would have expired had they been in the discount group (10 weeks



10
   Participating stores were reimbursed by the project for the discounts and additionally received a $1 incentive for
each discount that was correctly applied. All participating agents also received a one-time payment to compensate
for staff training and other time costs of participating in the project.
11
   The length and detail of the baseline survey were limited by the recruitment strategy of intercepting participants
immediately after they had sent a remittance, when most participants were not available to participate in a longer
survey. In the days following this initial interaction participants were contacted by phone to complete another survey
that contained more detailed information about their relationship with their family and a set of experimental
questions that are the subject of a separate paper. 72% of these additional baseline surveys were completed. A subset
of family members in El Salvador and Guatemala were additionally interviewed by phone about remittances and
their relationship with the migrant. Because some store owners only agreed to participate on the condition that the
research staff would not contact family members, only 18% of family members were interviewed. These surveys of
family members in the home country are not used in the analysis presented in this paper.

following their recruitment into the study.) The survey staff was largely successful in performing
these interviews as scheduled: the median number of days between expiration and interview is
two. The completion rate for the follow-up survey was 71%.
Viamericas data
       A key contribution of this study is that, in addition to survey measures of remittances at
baseline and endline, we have access to administrative data on remittances sent by our participants
through our partner money transmission operator (Viamericas) during the 10 weeks of our study
as well as before and after. When migrants agreed to participate in the study the surveyors collected
the transaction number of the remittance they had just sent. This number allowed Viamericas to
identify the participant in their database and provide the research team with the participant’s
transaction history. We examine administrative data for 50 weeks after the baseline survey
interaction (40 weeks post discount) for all study participants. This includes transactions for all
recipients, not just the PRR, and allows us to identify to whom the remittance was sent, how much
it was for, the fee that was paid, and whether or not a discount was applied.
Threats to identification of the price effect
       Although the randomized design of this project ensures the identification of a causal effect,
other factors can threaten the interpretation of the effect of the price treatment. Because the goal
of the study is to understand the impact of the discount in remittance fees the project was designed
to overcome these potential threats. First, because the analysis will rely heavily on transaction data
from Viamericas, the analysis may overestimate an impact of the discount by not considering that
migrants may have reduced remittances sent through other companies and increased those sent
with Viamericas to take advantage of the discount. We address this possibility in two ways. First,
we limit participation in the study to existing Viamericas customers. Second, in both the baseline
and follow-up survey we ask detailed questions about what companies migrants are using to send
the remittances they report, allowing us to directly document shifting from other companies to
Viamericas.
       A second threat to the interpretation of the discount effect is that migrants may send
remittances for other people in their network. As long as the migrant physically performs the
transaction (even if someone else has provided the funds), the discount can be applied. For this
reason we limit the use of the discount card to remittances sent to the migrant’s pre-identified
primary remittance recipient, therefore making it difficult for others to benefit unless they also




                                                  7
wish to send a remittance to the participating migrant’s primary recipient. 12 A related issue is that
funds could be sent to the PRR either by the participating migrant or by others through the migrant
to the PRR with the intention that the PRR would then distribute them to their intended recipients.
This would also tend to overstate the impact of the discount. To address this possibility, we ask a
set of questions in the follow up survey specifically designed to understand whether or not this
behavior is occurring.
         A final issue that may affect our estimates is that migrants may choose to shift their
remittance behavior across time. In other words, they may send more remittances during the
discount period to take advantage of the lower price, inter-temporally substituting remittances that
they would have sent after the discount period ended. Again, this would tend to overstate the
impact of the remittance discounts. However, because we have access to Viamericas transaction
data after the discounts have ended, we are able to explicitly test for this inter-temporal
substitution.


3. Sample and balance tests
         As described in the previous section, study participants are migrants from Guatemala or El
Salvador who have sent remittances through our partner company (Viamericas) at one of their
participating agent locations in the suburbs of Washington, DC. The principal analyses in this
paper will be performed on migrants who were interviewed at baseline using Viamericas
administrative transaction data. We were able to match 941 of the 946 surveyed migrants to the
Viamericas transaction data. Because we were able to match over 99% of the surveyed migrants,
the matched sample will form our main analysis sample. Figure 1 shows how they are broken down
in the different treatments. We conduct some analyses using the endline survey conducted by
phone approximately 10 weeks after the initial baseline survey. There are 665 migrants in the
endline sample which is a completion rate of 71%. The endline survey contains information about
the migrant’s remittance behavior during the discount period and primarily allows us to check for
remittances sent through other remittance companies.
         Baseline summary statistics for the full sample are presented in Table 1. Data comes both
from the baseline survey and from the Viamericas transaction data for the 12 months prior to


12
  Stores were not reimbursed for discounts given to recipients other than those identified as the PRR, therefore
giving them a strong incentive to comply with this restriction.



                                                          8
enrollment in the study. 28% of migrants are female and their average age is 34. 76% of the sample
is from Guatemala and the migrants have been in the United States for an average of 9 years. 77%
of the named primary remittance recipients are female and these recipients are migrants’ parents
(38%), spouses (24%), siblings (15%), and children (7%). The migrants in this sample are heavy
remitters, reporting that they remit, on average, 35% of their income to 1.7 households in their
home country. Data on remittance amounts is available from both the self-reported survey data
and the administrative data. The self-reported remittance amounts are somewhat higher than the
administrative amounts. Although this may be partly due to the self-reported data including
remittances from other channels, migrants were screened into the sample on the basis of being
Viamericas customers and report sending very few remittances through other channels. Migrants
report sending, on average, approximately 19 remittances through Viamericas in the year before
the survey, and only one through other agencies. The discrepancies are more likely due to
measurement error in the self-reporting of remittances. 13,14 According to the transaction data,
migrants sent, on average, $5,188 in remittances the year before the survey. $3,125 went to the
identified PRR and $2,064 went to other recipients. 15
         Because this is a randomized experiment it is important to verify that the randomization
was successful in producing groups with similar characteristics. This ensures that treatment effects
are indeed an impact of the treatments and not due to underlying differences between the groups.
Table 2 shows means of variables by treatment group in both the baseline survey data and the
transaction data and p-values for F-tests of whether the means in each treatment group are equal
to the control group and whether all four groups are jointly equal to each other. Across variables
the sample is very well balanced with no more significant differences than would be expected by
chance.


4. Results

13
   An additional possibility is that migrants report remittances that may have been sent under a different name, for
example through their spouse. While migrants consider those remittances in the total amount they report, the
transaction data would miss those transactions.
14
   Discrepancies between self-reported remittance data and administrative data have been previously documented by
Akee and Kapur (2012) and Aycinena, Martinez and Yang (2010).
15
   There is also a discrepancy between the transaction data and the self-reported data in the percentage of remittances
going to the primary recipient, with the self-reported data having a much higher percentage. This is possibly due to
the fact that migrants may send remittances to different individual recipients in the same household for a variety of
reasons (for example, who is available to pick the money up). Migrants may consider these funds as all going to the
primary recipient, but the transaction data will register the remittances as being sent different people.



                                                          9
A. Estimation:
        Because this is a randomized experiment, treatment effects can be causally identified using
a simple estimation strategy. As a reminder from the previous section, the four different groups
are referred to as follows:
    •   T0: Pure control group
    •   T1: Education information only
    •   T2: Discounts and information
    •   T3: Discounts only

The main results in this paper are estimated using the following equation:
                      𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑇𝑇3𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑇𝑇2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑇𝑇1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1)
where 𝑖𝑖 indexes each individual migrant and 𝑗𝑗 indexes each stratification cell of 32 surveys. The
outcomes consist of a number of different variables relating to use of remittance discounts, number
of remittances sent, and total amounts of remittances. 𝑇𝑇3𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑇𝑇2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and 𝑇𝑇1𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are indicator variables
for each of the treatment groups and the corresponding coefficient is therefore the difference in the

B. Results using transaction data
        We now present the results of estimating equation 1 using the Viamericas transaction data.
Because the discount period lasted for 10 weeks, for most outcomes we present the results in five
different 10 week periods: the 10 week discount period (the 10 weeks following recruitment into
the study), and the periods 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, and 31 to 40 weeks after the discount expired.
For those migrants who received an offer of a price discount (groups T2 and T3) these time periods
correspond to the 10 weeks they were eligible to use their discount card and the 10 week periods
following the expiration of that discount.
        When considering the impact of the price discount on behavior, it is first important to verify
that migrants actually made use of the discount, because if they did not, we should not expect the
discount to have a large impact on behavior. It is also important to verify that the discount program
was applied in accordance to project rules. Table 3 presents these results. Panel 1 presents results




                                                             10
for transactions to all recipients, panel 2 for only those transactions sent to the PRR, and panel 3
for transactions sent to other recipients. Each panel also provides p-values for the equality of the
different treatment effects to each other and a test for whether coefficients on T2 and T3 (the two
groups that received price discounts) are jointly equal to zero.
         Columns 1 through 3 of Table 3 examine use of the discount during the discount period.
Column 1 looks at the impact of the treatment on the mean discount used (only for those who sent
a remittance), column 2 at the impact on the total discount amount over the 10 weeks, and column
3 on the number of times the discount was used. The discount variables are expressed as negative
numbers, so the project discount would show up in the transaction data as -3.01. Therefore we
would expect the treatment effects in columns 1 and 2 (mean and total discount amounts) to be
negative.
         The results show that the discount card worked largely as intended. Migrants in both T2
and T3 are much more likely to have utilized the discounts than migrants in the control group or
in T1, who should not have had access to the discount cards. Additionally, the coefficients in panel
2 for transactions sent to the PRR are much larger than those in panel 3 for transactions sent to
other recipients. Recall that the discount card was valid only for remittances sent to the PRR. These
results show that while it appears there was some slippage (use to other recipients is not zero),
overall the discounts were applied as intended.
         Migrants in T2 and T3 use the discount at a similar rate, using an average of about 1.5
discounts and saving approximately $4.50 over the course of the discount period. Although
migrants do make use of the discounts, it does not appear that they used the discount in every
possible transaction. The mean discount in transactions to the PRR among those migrants who
remitted to their PRR during the discount period (column 1) is approximately $1.50 in both T2 and
T3. Because the discount was $3.01, this indicates that not all migrants utilized their discount
cards.
         Columns 4 through 6 of Table 3 present the same analyses for the first 10 week period after
the discount expired. Because the discount was no longer valid during this period, we should not
see an impact of the treatment on discount use if the project was implemented as intended. Indeed,
the results show that few discounts were applied after the discount period and those that were
applied were not applied differentially by treatment group.




                                                  11
        Now that we have verified that migrants do indeed make use of the discount cards, we can
turn to the central question of this paper: whether or not this price reduction had an impact on
remittance behavior. Because the discount lowers the price of each transaction, the first step is to
analyze whether or not this discount affected the number of transactions sent by the migrant. Table
4 presents these results. All transactions are in panel 1, transactions to the PRR are in panel 2, and
transactions to other recipients are in panel 3. Columns 1 through 5 show the results for number
of transactions sent during the discount period and in each of the subsequent four 10 week periods
respectively. Overall, it appears that the discount did motivate migrants to send more transactions
during the discount period. Migrants in the discount only group (T3) sent about 0.56 more
remittances than migrants in the control group, a 19.0% increase. The coefficient on the discount
plus information group is also positive, but smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant.
Panel 2 shows that this increase in number of transactions is attributable to an increase in
transactions to the PRR. Migrants in both T2 and T3 make statistically significantly more
transactions to the PRR than do migrants in the control group. Migrants in T2 send 0.41 more
transactions, a 22% increase, and migrants in T3 send 0.69 more transactions, a 36% increase.
        The stronger impacts on transactions to the PRR than for overall transactions suggests that
there may be some switching away from other recipients to the PRR because only the PRR is
eligible for the discount. 16 In panel 3, the coefficients on transactions to other recipients are
negative for both T2 and T3, but they are small compared to the effects for the PRR and not
statistically significant. Overall, although there may be some amount of switching, it does not
outweigh an overall increase in transactions caused by the discount offer. Additionally, there is no
impact of the information treatment (T1) on any of these outcomes.
        Columns 2 through 5 examine the impact of the discount in four 10 week periods after the
expiration of the discount. Examining the time period after the expiration of the discount allows
us to verify that the documented increase in transactions is a true increase and not just evidence of
inter-temporal substitution by the migrants in order to take advantage of discount. If there is indeed
inter-temporal substitution occurring, we would expect to see negative impacts of the treatments
in the weeks following the expiration of the discounts. Conversely, discount use may have also led




16
  One would especially expect to see switching behavior if migrants sometimes send to different members of the
same household, however it is not possible to group recipients by household in the transaction data.



                                                       12
to sustained increases in transactions after the period expired and this analysis will also allow us
determine whether or not that has occurred.
        There is no evidence that the number of transactions fell after the discount period ended
(panel 1). In fact, transactions continue to be higher in T3 relative to the control group in the first
10 week after period. Migrants in T3 send 0.5 more transactions in the first 10 weeks after the
discounts expire, an effect that is significant at the 10% level. The coefficient in the second 10
weeks after the discount is also positive, but smaller and no longer statistically significant. The
effect has faded completely by the third and fourth post periods. The discount only treatment
appears to have led to increases in transactions that persisted well past the expiration of the
discount. Interestingly, in the after periods there is no evidence of switching between recipients
(panels 2 and 3).
        A visual representation of the results for total transactions over time is presented in Figure
2. Panel 2a shows total transactions in 2 week bins relative to the treatment period for all recipients,
panel 2b for transactions to the PRR, and panel 2c for transactions to other recipients. These figures
contain data for the 10 weeks before the treatment period, the 10 weeks of the discount period, and
the 40 weeks after. For ease of visualization, the figures show the transaction averages only for the
control group (T0) and the discount only treatment group (T3). The two-week period in which
migrants were recruited is excluded from the graph for presentational purposes (by design, all
migrants sent a remittance the day they were recruited, so there is a large spike in remittances in
the recruitment period.)
        In all three panels, the treatment and control groups follow the same trend in the pre-
treatment period. During the discount period, the T3 line is well above the T0 line in both panels
2a and 2b. This trend continues after the discount period has ended and fades away by about 16
weeks following the expiration of the discount. Consistent with the regression results, Panel 2c
shows that there is perhaps a slight decrease in transactions to other recipients during the discount
period, but both before and after there is little difference between the control group and T3.
        The results thus far indicate that the discount treatment caused migrants to send more
remittance transactions both to their PRR and overall. The next question of interest is then whether
or not this increase in transactions resulted in an overall increase in the amount of funds remitted
by the migrant, or whether the migrants simply took advantage of the discount to send more
transactions in smaller amounts. To answer this question we can examine the impacts of the




                                                  13
discount both on mean transaction size and total remittances sent. Table 5 presents the results for
mean transaction size for all recipients in panel 1, the PRR in panel 2, and all others in panel 3.
Column 1 presents the results for the discount period and columns 2 through 5 for the four after
periods. Because the dependent variable for these regressions is mean transaction amount, the
sample for each regression is those migrants who sent a remittance to the indicated recipient during
each period. Given that treatment influences whether or not a migrant sent a remittance at all (and
therefore inclusion in this sample), the results for mean transaction amount should be interpreted
with caution.
           Overall there is very little evidence that the discount resulted in a change in the mean
transaction amount. The coefficients for T3 in all three panels during the discount period are
negative, but the standard errors are very large. Additionally, there is no consistent pattern in
coefficients across time periods. Despite increases in the number of transactions in first 10 week
period following the discount, the coefficients in column 2 of Table 5 are either positive or close
to zero. However, again these results are not statistically significant.
           An analysis of total amount sent by the migrant avoids issues of sample selection. Table 6
examines this question by looking at total remittances in the Viamericas transaction data sent by
the migrant to all recipients, the PRR, and other recipients. Again we look at transactions made
during the discount period and in the four 10 week periods after the discount expired. Because the
total remittance variable has a number of very high outliers, we focus on the inverse hyperbolic
sine transformation of total remittances, a specification very similar to log transformation that
reduces the influence of outliers but which is not undefined at zero. 17
           The results for remittances sent to all recipients, the PRR, and other recipients are in panels
1, 2, and 3 respectively. The coefficient in panel 1 on the discount only treatment for remittances
to all recipients is positive and statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that, at least in
T3, the discount treatment is causing migrants to send home more in total remittances. The
coefficients on remittances to the PRR are positive and those to others are negative, but neither are
statistically significant. The negative coefficients on the remittances to others is again suggestive
of some degree of switching between recipients, but not enough to counteract an overall increase
in remittances sent during the discount period.



17
     The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation is defined as log(yi+(yi2+1)1/2).



                                                             14
         Next, in columns 2 through 5 we examine whether this increase in remittances persists after
the discount period has ended, as it did for the number of transactions. The results show that the
increased remittance levels do persist after the discount period has ended for those migrants in the
discount only group. There is an increase in overall remittances in both of the first two post periods,
statistically significant at the 10% level, but this effect fades away and is no longer detectable in
the third and fourth post-discount periods. Mirroring the results for number of transactions in Table
4, there no evidence of switching between recipients in the first two after periods. The effect is
concentrated among the PRRs (panel 2) but the coefficients on the discount only treatment for
other recipients (panel 3) are actually positive (though not statistically significant).
         Across time periods for overall remittances and remittances to the PRR in Table 6, the
coefficients for T2 (discount and information) are generally positive but not statistically
significant, while the coefficients for other recipients are negative. These results are somewhat
suggestive that the discount and information treatment increased remittances, but the effect is small
relative to the discount only treatment. At the same time, while the coefficients for the information
only treatment group (T1) are mostly positive, they are never statistically significant. For
remittances to the PRR in particular, the estimates are very close to zero. Therefore it does not
seem that the education information actually encouraged migrants to send more home. Given this,
the relative lack of impact for the discount and information (T2) treatment is somewhat surprising.
One possibility is that the information on education made migrants more concerned about whether
the remittances they were sending would be properly used by recipients. A “decoy effect” of this
sort could have dampened the effect of the discount. In an experiment on promoting savings by
migrants in their home country, Ashraf et al (forthcoming) find patterns consistent with a decoy
effect among migrants from El Salvador: demand for a particular savings product that improves
migrant control over savings is higher when it is offered alongside another product whose
marketing emphasizes the importance of migrant control over remittance uses. 18
         Table 7 presents the same results as Table 6, but the dependent variable is remittances in
dollars, truncated at the 95th percentile of the distribution. Given the nature of the distribution of
the remittance variable, our preferred specification is the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation



18
  Decoy effects, or shifts in preference for a certain option when presented with another option that might be
thought to be irrelevant, have been found in other studies as well, such as Laran et al (2011) and Chatterjee and Rose
(2012).



                                                         15
(Table 6) but we show these results for completeness. During the discount period, T3 results in
large increases in remittances to the PRR and decreases for other recipients. The combined effect
is positive, but small and not statistically significant. In the first two post-discount periods there
are similarly large (and statistically significant) increases in remittances to the PRR, but no
corresponding decrease to other recipients. The overall coefficients in panel 1 are therefore large
and positive, though they are not statistically significant. Again, the impact of T3 tapers off through
the third and fourth post-discount periods. Except for the overall impact during the discount period,
these dollar results match the pattern of the results in Table 6, although they are less precise.
       Overall, the results from the transaction data show that the discount treatments increased
the number of transactions sent by migrants, and additionally increased the total amount sent.
These results mirror those in Aycinena, Martinez, and Yang (2010) who find that total remittances
increase by much more than the amount of the discount that was offered. Going beyond the results
in Aycinena, Martinez, and Yang (2010), we additionally find that the effects of the discounts
continue to persist beyond the 10 week discount. Remittances remain higher in the discount groups
for 20 weeks after recipients are no longer eligible to receive discounts.
C. Results using endline survey data
       The benefit of working with Viamericas transaction data is that we have access to rich and
accurate data on transactions that is not prone to the same type of measurement error as is
remittance data collected in surveys. However, the major limitation of the transaction data is that
it only contains records of transactions sent through Viamericas, and migrants have access to a
wide range of companies, sometimes located in the same physical location, through which they
can send remittances. A major concern for the validity of our results would then be that migrants
in the discount groups may simply be choosing to send remittances through Viamericas because
of the discount that they would have otherwise sent through another company. Because migrants
in the control group have no such motivation, this behavior could account for the treatment effects
that we see.
       The most important way in which we address this problem is that we require all migrants
to be customers of Viamericas at baseline. Because migrants tend to use the same remittance




                                                  16
company as much as possible, 19 we can expect that most of the migrants would have used
Viamericas even in the absence of the discount. Baseline survey reports confirm that most
participants are loyal Viamericas customers. Migrants report sending, on average, approximately
19 remittances through Viamericas in the year before the survey and only one through other
companies. However, we can also use endline survey data, collected right after the discounts
expired, to examine whether migrants report using different remittance channels.
        71% of migrants in the full sample were successfully surveyed at endline. Before
examining the results, it is important to examine whether or not completion of that survey was
related to treatment. Table 8 presents the impact of the treatments on attrition in column 1.
Unfortunately, the endline sample suffers from a significant amount of attrition that is differential
by treatment group, with migrants in both T2 and T3 being significantly less likely to complete
the endline survey than migrants in the control group. The effects are large: 12 percentage points
for T2 and 9 percentage points for T3. Given this level of differential attrition, we consider the
results from the transaction data to be our main results, and will present results from the endline
survey only to provide some evidence on the question of whether or not migrants are switching
between companies. However, in Appendix Table A1 we replicate Table 6 using the transaction
data in the sample that completed the endline survey. Although the magnitudes vary and precision
suffers due to the reduced sample, the pattern of results is very similar, suggesting that the bias in
the results from the differential attrition may be minimal. In Appendix Table A2 we additionally
show that the endline sample is balanced on baseline characteristics despite the differential
attrition. Furthermore, Table 8 also examines whether attrition is correlated with baseline values
of the key outcome variables, namely number of transactions and amount remitted. Columns 2 and
3 of Table 8 show these correlations for the 365 days prior to recruitment and the 10 weeks prior
to recruitment respectively using the transaction data. There is no evidence that attrition is related
to baseline remittances, and additionally there is no evidence that attrition is related to a set of
baseline characteristics collected during the baseline survey (results not shown).
        Table 9 presents the results for remittance amounts from the endline survey data. Panel 1
shows results for the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation and panel 2 shows results in dollars



19
  Both sender and recipient information are saved in the agent computer, making subsequent transactions easier.
Different companies also may have different payout points for the cash pickup. Trust is also an important
component for migrants sending large amounts of money.



                                                        17
truncated at the 95th percentile. The survey data allows us to analyze remittances sent to the PRR
and other recipients through Viamericas and through other channels. On the endline survey
migrants were asked to list every remittance they sent during the 10 week discount period and the
company that they used to send it. Overall the results from the endline survey are strong, and even
more indicative of an increase in remittances than the transaction data. However, because of the
attrition to the endline survey, we do not want to focus on these results, instead only using this data
to look for evidence of switching between remittance companies. Columns 7, 8, and 9 report results
for remittances sent through other channels. There is no evidence using either the inverse
hyperbolic sine transformation or the remittance amount in dollars that there is a decrease in
remittances sent through other channels in the two discount treatment groups. The coefficients for
both T2 and T3 are small for all specifications and are never statistically significant.
       The endline survey also contained a number of questions that were intended to measure
whether or not any impacts of the discount treatments were true changes in remittances. Table 10
presents the results of analyzing the answers to those questions. One concern is that because the
discount was only valid for the PRR migrants might send remittances to the PRR for the PRR to
distribute to others. We have already seen in the transaction data that while there may be some
switching from other recipients to the PRR, it does not account for the entire increase in
remittances. Two questions on the survey examine this specifically, asking the migrant whether
they have asked the PRR to distribute remittances within their household (column 1) or outside of
their household (column 2). There is no evidence that migrants in the discount treatments were
more likely to do this than migrants in the control group.
       A related concern is that others in the United States may ask the migrant to send remittances
to the PRR either for the PRR themselves or for the PRR to distribute to others in order to take
advantage of the discount. A series of questions examines this issue. Specifically, we ask whether
someone in the migrant’s household has sent a remittance to the PRR (column 3), whether someone
outside of the household has sent a remittance to the PRR (column 4), whether the migrant has
sent remittances to others to be given to the PRR (column 5), whether anyone has given the migrant
money to send to the PRR (column 6), and whether anyone has given the migrant money to send
to the PRR so that they will distribute it to other people (column 7). Overall, these questions do
not provide much evidence that people are sending remittances through the migrant to take
advantage of the discount. There are only two significant coefficients for the discount only group




                                                  18
(T3) and one of those (column 4) suggests that more people have actually sent remittances to the
PRR. If people were asking the migrant to send remittances for them, that coefficient should be
negative for the discount group. The significant coefficient in column 3 is potentially indicative of
a problem. However, overall there are very few positive responses to the questions in columns 3
through 7 and it seems unlikely that any issue they represent could be driving the increase in
remittances.


5. Discussion and Conclusion
       This study examines the impact of short-term discounts for remittance fees on remittance
behavior. Migrants from Guatemala and El Salvador who were existing customers of our partner
organization were randomly chosen to receive $3.01 off remittance fees that were around $8 for
remittances up to $1,000 in value. The treatment had large impacts on remittances, increasing both
the number of transactions and the total amount sent. The treatment effect persists for 20 weeks
after the discount expires before fading out. The results are consistent with the large impacts of
remittance prices on remittances found by Aycinena, Martinez, and Yang (2010), while for the
first time using data from the post-treatment period to show persistence in the impact of the
discount.
       While our results are difficult to explain in the context of standard fully rational economic
models, they are consistent with behavioral models with reference dependence and status quo bias,
such as Tversky and Kahneman (1991), Masatlioglu and Ok (2005), and Masatlioglu and Ok
(2014). Remittance recipients may have reference-dependent preferences with respect to the
amount of remittances they expect to receive from migrants per time period (e.g., in terms of
dollars of remittances received per month). When remittances received shift over time, recipients’
reference points may adjust accordingly to some degree. It is possible that migrants may not fully
anticipate shifts in recipients’ reference points with respect to remittances received. In response to
the temporary discounts we offered, migrants increased the number (and total money amount) of
remittances sent during the discount period, and perhaps intended for these increases to be offset
by reductions in remittances immediately after the discounts ended. In other words, migrants may
have intended to inter-temporally substitute, shifting a later remittance into the discount period to
take advantage of the discount.




                                                 19
         These increases in remittances during the 10 week discount period may have led remittance
recipients to raise their reference points for per-period remittance receipts, with these higher
reference points persisting into the post-discount period. In the post-discount period, recipients
would then expect to continue receiving higher remittance amounts, and use their bargaining
power in their relationship with migrants to induce this. 20 The migrant therefore could not
immediately reduce remittances to their pre-discount levels, but instead would do so only
gradually. This is the pattern we see in our results. It is worth emphasizing that this explanation
requires not only reference-dependence on the part of remittance recipients, but also at least partial
naïveté on the part of migrants with respect to recipient reference-dependence. If migrants fully
understood in advance the process by which recipients’ reference points for remittances were set,
they would anticipate the shift in reference point and likely refrain from responding to the
discounts in the first place.
         From a policy standpoint, our results suggest that temporary discounts can have large
impacts on remittance behavior, and may be an important means of stimulating remittances in the
short term. 21 This type of policy could be useful when a temporary increase in remittances would
be beneficial to the home country, for example in response to negative shocks such as natural
disasters or acute economic downturns. However, our results also suggest that the migrant response
may have been large specifically because the discount was temporary, and therefore this study may
not reveal much about the impact of permanent price reductions. It may be that the temporary
discount had large impacts because the migrants intended to make inter-temporal substitutions,
and subsequently found that they were unable to quickly reduce remittance payments post
discount. Permanent reductions would presumably not induce this intent to substitute across time.
Further research would be needed to understand how a permanent price reduction would affect
remittance behavior.

   That said, it may not be possible to repeatedly exploit migrants’ partial naïveté with temporary discounts. Once
migrants realize that raising remittances leads to shifts in recipients’ reference points, they may cease responding to
future temporary discounts. Whether migrants do learn about remittance-recipient reference dependence is an
empirical matter that should be investigated in future work.

Notes for Figure 3: X-axis variables are the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of total remittances sent
calculated using Viamericas transaction data during the 10 week discount period (Panel A) and in the four 10 week
periods following the expiration of the discount (Panels B through E). The inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of
a variable x is defined as log(x+(x2+1)1/2).
