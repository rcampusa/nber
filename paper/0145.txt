      A common theme which runs through much of the investment literature Is

 that private incentives may lead to sub—optimal levels of investment activity.'

 The idea has been extended casually to consideration of human capital invest-

 ment as well. It is sometimes contended that decisions, made by parents,

 have adverse effects on their offspring, which could be prevented if inter-

 generational contracts could be struck. If so, a case can be made for govern-

ment intervention or subsidization programs to alleviate these intergenerational

externalities. Specifically, the sub—optimal investment in offspring human

capital may take such obvious forms as poor clothing, too little health care,

or too few resources devoted to the child's education.2 Less obvious exer—

nalities may   result when   parents underinvest in themselves because they fail

to consider spill—over benefits to their children. Parental schooling, for

example, may affect the child's ability (or desire) to learn. Dietary patterns

established by parents for themselves may influence the child's eating habits

and affect his health. More directly, healthy parents are less likely to

transmit diseases to their offspring. This paper will examine the effects

of these intergenerational externalities in greater detail,

     Models of human capital formation have not 'been scarce in recent years.

Starting with Ben—Porath (1967), a number of one—generation models have been

forthcoming.3 Although the literature most specific to human capital has tend-

ed to ignore intergenerational aspects4, there is no dirth of theory which

deals specifically with multi—generational questions in other contexts. Models

of the sort presented by Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965) and most recently

by Barro (1974) and Becker (1974) have considered intergenerational savings

and consumption behavior and related issues. It seems natural, therefore,

that these questions be extended to comprise human capital as well, especially
                                      2




given the amount of public attention devoted to schooling, health, food,

and housing subsidization programs.

     Before proceeding formally, it is useful to consider the way by which

the intergenerational externality is actualized. If parental decisions affect

the child's welfare, children should be willing to pay their parents to

follow optimal investment schedules. That is, the child should be willing

to compensate parents to obtain an amount of human capital which exceeds the

parent's own   wealth—maximizing level (but has spill—overs to their children),
or to invest directly in the children even though they will not directly

capture the returns to this investment. The problem, it is generally sug-

gested, is that the parent has no certainty that his child will repay him.

This is not quite correct, however, in the present institutional setting.

Since the child is under parental jurisdiction and support during the first

few years of his life, the parent has a good deal of discretion over the

amount of resources the child receives. The parent could simply arrange to

transfer a smaller amount to the child than he otherwise would, reffecting

the cost of super—optimal investment. If the child were able to borrow on

his future Income, he would be perfectly willing to go along with his father's

scheme since he would have higher wealth and a consumption set which is every-

where dominant. This notion has its origins In Coase (1960) and more directly

in Becker (1974). If borrowing is difficult for young children, as must be

the case, it would seem that the separation principle becomes inappropriate

and that neither father nor child would prefer to first maximize the child's

wealth and then his utility, subject to maximum wealth. The separation

principle cannot be dismissed so easily, however. In the context of the family,

the child can "borrow" from his father. Consider for simplicity, a three phase
                                       3




 world ——   childhood, adulthood, and retirement. Let X be the amount of
 resources used by the child in period zero which consists of his current

 consumption plus the wealth—tximizjng level of investment in human capital.

 Let Y be defined as the expected present value of repayment from the child

 to the parent. X Y is then the father's expected cost of a "loan" to

 the child. The father will be willing to bear cost X — Y     if the child's

 utility enters his utility function in such a way that the equilibrium father!

 child transfer is greater than or equal to X — Y.    If so, the father will

 "perfect" the capital market for the child and no externality will be present.

 Transfers from father to child may involve borrowing on the father's part.

Higher borrowing costs to the father therefore make it more likely that X — Y

will exceed the equilibrium transfer.

       Externalities are more likely to show up then where borrowing costs are

high, where the probability of repayment is low (making Y low), and where

the level of parentally optimal parent—child transfers are low.   Thus, for
a   given X — Y,   poor children are more likely to suffer externalities than

wealthy ones because the parent—child transfers are lower as the result of

income effects. One might also expect externalities to be more important in

geographically mobile societies since distance may reduce the probability of

repayment. Finally, externalities are likely to be a greater problem during

periods when liquidity difficulties are most serious.

      It might well be argued that the family is itself an institution which

reduces the extent of the externality problem. If social pressures make it

sufficiently costly to "default" on one's parent (by not repaying him in old

age), no resources would have to be witheld from the child to finance the
                                         4




investment. Repayment at the "market rate of interest" becomes more likely.

      In what follows, a formal model is presented which makes explicit the

nature of deviations between privately and socially optimal levels of human

capital investment. The first part of the discussion will consider externali-

ties which arise because the amount of parental human capital affects the

child's ability to produce his own human capital. Although this type of

externality seems intuitively less common than externalities which take the

form of direct parental underinvestment in children, it turns out that the

latter can be viewed as a specific application of the former. Thus, discus-

sion follows from general to specific.

      In the last two sections, an empirical model of schooling externalities

is formulated and estimated. There, schooling as an efficient means of "up-

ward mobility" and income redistribution is examined. Estimates of the opti-

mal externality correcting schooling subsidy are provided.


A General Model:

      The problem for society is to maximize the discounted value of wealth

over all generations (since society can act as a guarantor on intergeneration-

al transfers).5 The present value of the first generation's income stream

can be written as6



(1)        P1 =    1T [R111(t) —   C(Ül(T),Ho(r))JerTdT


where H1(r) is the stock of the parent's human capital in year T and

C() is the human capital cost function. R is the rental rate on a unit

of human capital, and can be thought of as the amount by which the market or
                                              5



 home productivity flow to the individual is augmented by the additional unit

 of human capital. It does not include spillover effects to other's produc-

 tivity, but is simply the internal benefit. C depends on the rate at which

 the father acquires human capital as well as the stock of the grandparent's

human capital in period r.         It is this latter effect through which intergen-

erational externalities operate. One can treat the externality between gen-

erations as one which reduces educational costs to children when parental

education increases. We assume that there is no direct effect of grandparent's

and previous generations' human capital stock on the child's cost function.

The cost function also makes the standard assumption of neutrality with
                                   7
respect to own human capital.           Thus, it is reasonable that C1 > 0,   C2 <   0,
C11 >   0,   C22    0 and C(OH1) 0. If B is the length of a generation
and one child is born each B years, then the second generation's wealth in

period zero dollars is

      The problem of maximizing wealth over all generations can then be written

as

or

                                            for i1, 2,...,


      Note that the structure of the system is quasi—recursive. Each state

variable depends directly only upon the stock of human capital inherited from

the previous generation, on the costs and within generation return to invest-

ment, and on the cost—savings to children which result from parental invest-

ment (the C2 term on the left side of (5)). The C12 term on the right

side of (5) reflects the fact that the grandfather's ability to affect costs

of investment to the father depends upon the rate at which the father invests.

Thus, when the father alters his level of investment, he must consider the

effect of this change on cost—saving which results from his parent's investment
                                           7




 (and the subsequent change in the grandfather's plan as the result of it).

 Additionally, since C2 on the left side of (5) depends upon the child's

 rate of investment which in turn depends in part upon cost saving to the

 grandchild and so on, all generations are linked. If one makes the special

 assumption that C12         0, the system becomes truly recursive. If C12 = 0,

 C2 is independent of the child's investment behavior so that the fact that

 children take grandchildren into account becomes irrelevant. That is, when

 the father's ability to save investment resources utilized by his child is

independent of the child's level of investment, the father can totally

ignore the child's actions. Furthermore, cost saving in the current genera-

tion as the result of the previous generation's investment becomes independent

of the level of current investment, i.e., C12 drops out. More will be

said on this below.

      Consider the socially optimal path of human capital accumulation for the

first generation. From (5), write


                        —l                         —rB          .

Since C11 >   0,   H1 < 0     when [•}    is   positive. If il were positive, this

would imply H1       0 and H1            I.e.,   H1 > 0     implies that it is optimal

to disinvest. This makes sense. If R —           C2 < rC1   + C12H0, the flow cost

to investment in human capital exceeds the flow return to the individual plus

the flow value of reduced cost to his child)0 The individual is better off

onverting his stock of human capital into cash and earning the market rate

on the physical asset. (If disinvestment cannot occur, his optimal strategy

is to invest zero.)
                                             8



      It is now easily seen that investment in human capital by the first

generation is everywhere greater when the social optimization rather than

the private optimization rule is followed. If the first generation chooses

human capital paths to maximize own wealth and no intergenerational transfer

occurs, the problem simply becomes one of maximizing P                in equation (1)

subject to

The Euler equation for this maximization is



(7)          R =     C11 (H1 ,H0)H1 — C12(L1 ,H0)H0 + rC1 (H1 ,H0)



so that



(8)          1(r)            :1        [R + C12(H1,110)H0 —   rC1(H11H0)]
                        C11 (H1 ,H0)


The difference between (6) and (8) is —C2e .                   Since this term is positive,

1i(T) <   H(r)       for all T (where the superscripts denote social and private

optimal paths). This implies that 5(t) > Her) V T                    T and that H(i) > H'(r)

for 0 < T          T.11 Thus, investment in human capital at each point in time is

larger for social than for private optimization.
                                      Q




      If   investment were to be increased at time T = 0    on the promise that

 it would be repaid at a later date, it must be the case that the first genera-

 tion is still alive during repayment in order to avoid the necessity of in-

 terpersonal utility comparisons. This implies a change in the interest rate

 which could cause an over— or understatement of the true difference between

 the social and private optimum. I.e., since the amount of current investment

 and savings is likely to change, r will change. The following diagram makes

 this clear:



 r
                                       S3(r)


                                               S0(r)

                                                               S2(r)

                                Figure 1



What has happened is that the economy has discovered an unexploited invest-

ment opportunity with a rate of return higher than r.      (This takes the form

of sub—optimal human capital investment.) If everything else were the same,

total investment would increase from I to I, and the interest rate

would rise from r0 to r1 inducing individuals to take their consumption
                                    10



later in life. This increase in r would tend to choke off some of the

increased investment in human capital so that estimated differences between

social and private optima are overstated.

      The society as a whole, however, has experienced an increase in real

wealth as the investment schedule shifted from 10 to I. This causes a

shift in S0, the direction of which is determined by relative wealth elas-

ticities of present vs. future consumption. If the wealth effect on savings

is sufficiently positive, the interest rate could actually fall (as with

S2(r)). Here the social—private difference is understated. At the other

extreme, S3(r), the wealth effect induces so large a switch to current con-

sumption that total investment and savings actually falls to 13. It must

be the case, however, that investment in human capital has increased since

this is how the increased wealth was generated. (That is, a higher yield

investment replaces a lower yield one). Again, r rises so the deviation

is overstated.

      With a bit of manipulation, estimates of the magnitude of the difference

between private and social optima can be obtained. Start with the following

simplifying assumptions: Let C12 = 0      and assume that C11 is a constant.

This implies that C1 = C11 H(r). Subtracting equation (8) from equation (6)

then yields

  This is a Second—order linear differential equation.
                                                                       Suppose that the cost—

  reducing externality effect is some fraction, p, of the Internalized,

 within generation return so that —C2e' pR where C2 is evaluated at

 its equilibrium level. The solution to (10) is then given by



 (11)       X(T)     Alert + A2 ÷



 where   A1 and A2 are constants determined by two Initial conditions.

 Since H(0)        HS(O) =      0,    X(0) = 0,        and since IIS(T) =   }I(T)   =   0,   k(T) = 0.

 Using these initial conditions, one obtains



           A1 + A2 =      X(0) =      0

so that (10) becomes

This term is meaningless without perspective. It is therefore useful to

evaluate H(T) and to calculate X(r)/H(T).                       Substituting the assumptions
into (8), one obtains

Thus (13) is written as

                                   cli

which   is, again, a second—order differential equation. The solution to (14)

is given by

(15)
                                         r11

B1 and B2 are obtained from the initial conditions that H(O) = 0       and

H(T) = 0.     Equation (15) then becomes


                                       r(t—T)    —rT
(16)        H(T) =                 — e        + e
                      r11                r        r




Thus,



              X(r) HS(T)_ H(T) =
(17)
            11(t)           H(-r)

or


                    = (1 + p) H(t)



This says that if pR of the return to investment in human capital is passed

on to the child and is not captured by the investor, the privately optimal
                                        13




 stock of human capital will deviate from the socially optimal stock by

 exactly that proportion, p. Furthermore, this is true at all points in

 time as well as for the highest attained levels of human capital H(T)

 and HS(T). If it can be argued that p is not trivial, (say, 10%), there

will be a substantial potential difference between social and private optima.

Nor is the nature of the externality restricted to intergenerational forms.

Nothing in equations (9) through (17) required any parent—child linkage.

If —C2e and the corresponding pR are thought of as the within—genera-

tion spillover effect of human capital (the benefits that peers receive from

having higher H(r) friends), the argument still applies. Any estimate of

p still provides an estimate of the deviation between private and social

optima, irrespective of whether its causes are inter— or intragenerational.

       An estimate of the size of transfer necessary to induce an individual

to move to the socially optimal level of investment can also be easily ob-

tained. If the individual received R + pR rental on his human capital

rather than simply R, he would move to the social rather than private op—

timum. Thus, the required subsidy in period i     is

(18)       F = pR(H8(r))   =   pR(l + p)(H(T))


so that the present value of the lifetime transfer is



(19)       F =   1T pR(l + p)HP(T)e_rTdT



Substituting from (16),
                                          14




             F = pR2(l-fp)                 e_2t_T)          e_ T+T)
(20)                          1T [Te_rt                 +             ]dT



Thus,


(21)         F =   pR2(1+p) [re_rT(e_rT — 1 - T
                   r C11
                                                  -   l/r) + 1]

If     T = 60,   r =   .1 and p = .1,


(22)         F = (108.06)    —
                             Cli

R and C11        are both determined exogenously (the former being market determin—
ed,    the latter being technologically determined), but are in theory, estimable)2

It is clear that as C11 falls toward zero, the required transfer rises.

This makes sense. As the marginal cost of investment rises less steeply,

the difference between HS(T) and H'(r) increases (although its proportion

to H(T) does not) so that the required subsidy becomes larger.


       So far, two extreme cases have been discussed. In the first case, the

parent is assumed to take all generations into account (he maximizes S) and

in the second case, he takes only himself into account when compiling his

life—time investment strategy. An intermediate case is now considered.

Suppose that the parent ignors all future generations beyond his direct

offspring. He takes only his child into account. Assume further that all

generations are similar so that the child only considers his child and so

forth. The question is whether or not the optimal path in this situation
                                                       15



 differs from paths obtained when S is maximized. Under the assumption

 that C12 =    0,    it is clear that the two—generation problem is the same as

 maximizing S. Here, all the Euler equations in (5) are two—generational.

 The individual's investment depends only upon an exogenously given stock of

 parental human capital and his own level of investment. Nothing is affected

 by his child's investment level, so whether ornot the child takes grandchil—

 ren into account becomes irrelevant.

        Even when C12 # 0,        it turns out that the two—period maximization is

 the same as the multi—period problem as long as each child also performs the

two—period maximization problem. The reasoning is straightforward. The two—

period problem is

       The solution to each of the subsidiary constraints generates a system

of Euler equations of the form



              R —                     =     c11(ñ ,H             —                    + rC1(H1,H1_1)

                                                for i =        1,2,... ,

       The distinction between this system and the one in (4) is that in each

problem all non—present period state variables are treated as exogenous.

However, since the system must still be solved simultaneously, all equations

are linked as they are in (4). In other words, the fact that the parent

cares about his child forces him also to care about his child's actions.

Since the child consideres the grandchild, the parent is linked to future

generations exactly as if he took them explicitly into account. This would

not be the case if the parent's stock of human capital affected the grandchild's

cost function, but the parent took only the child into account. Then, a term

equal to _C2(Hi+2,Hj)e2, present in the Euler equations for maximization

of S, would be absent in each Euler equation corresponding to maximization

of        +

     The preceding few paragraphs make one point: If individuals maximize

wealth over as many generations as are directly affected by their own in-

vestment, private decisions will be socially optimal. One should not infer

from this, however, that the intergenerational externality has been rendered

ineffective. It is clear that two—generational transfers do occur. However,

for reasons already discussed, there may still be impediments to free trans-

fer of funds from the child to the parent. The fact that ote observes trans-

fers from child to parent and from parent to child is in no way sufficient

to establish that the means exist for intergenerational payment for parental

schooling.13


Direct Underinvestment:

     Let us now consider intergenerational externalities which manifest

themselves as direct underinvestment in the child. This second type of

externality, it will be seen, is easily treated within the above framework.

The question of direct underinvestment is not an entirely new one. In an

interesting paper, Ishikawa (1975) discusses the problem, as specific to

education, in a family context. He suggests that if parents are selfish,

they underinvest in the child because they only consider his earnings

until the time of the child's "independence." The child may make adjustments

after independence, but this Is necessarily worse than optimal investment

undertaken throughout the entire lifetime. This story is somewhat unrealis-

tic, however, and results in a perhaps misleading conclusion (underinvstinent

in education). It seems better to think of transfers from the child to

parent as being a function of the child's net income, which can be affected

by investment in human capital or by direct monetary transfers from the parent.

The previous model can be modified to consider this question.
                                     18




       Let H(r) be individual j's privately optimal plan for individual

l's human capital stock (j =   i   in the case of the individual's own private

optimum). Let M(T), the expected present value of transfer from child to

parent, be a function of the child's discounted income,14



(25)       M(T + B)   f(RH2(r + B)ert)



This M(T + B) should be thought of as the present value of "repayment"

that results from income earned in period (r + B). (If the child were

able to immediately "repay" his parent, he might just as well finance his

own investment directly.) It is assumed here that the parent bears the full

cost of the child's investment. This assumption is more than necessary,

but not completely superfluous. If the child commanded his own resources,

he would obtain human capital up to the wealth maximizing level, irrespective

of parental actions. Parental subsidies would be regarded as lump sum trans-

fers and would in no way change optimal human capital paths because it

would not alter the child's marginal cost of investment. Nor would exceeding

the wealth—maximizing level of human capital ever be worthwhile from the

parent's point of view. A lump sum cash transfer would be preferable to both

parties. Thus, it must be assumed that the child faces a liquidity constraint,

which prevents him from unilaterally achieving wealth maximization. For sim-

plicity, and without loss of generality, this is assumed to occur at zero

dollars, the child is unable to finance any of his own investment. Further,

for simplicity, assume C2 = 0.     The "selfish" parent will then maximize

If f' > 1,       H1(T + B) =   H(T   + B), but the former never will exceed the

latter. The reason is that both child and parent would prefer direct cash

transfers from the latter to the former rather than investment in the child's

human capital beyond the wealth—maximizing level)6 f' should be interpret-

ed as the child's marginal propensity to transfer resources to his parent.

Since the income elasticity of child—to—parent transfers equals
                                                                     T
where ST (< 1) is the share of the child's wealth spent on parental trans-

fers, f' will exceed 1 only if child—to—parent transfers are sufficiently

luxurious. Yet nothing rules this out a priori so that even the "selfish"

parent may invest optimally for his child.

       To the extent that sub—optimal investment occurs, one might expect

situations to arise which reduce the magnitude of the problem. Again, the

family might be exactly that sort of institution. If generation 2 invests

optimally for generation 3 because generation 1 did so for generation 2,

reliance on transfers from child to parent become less necessary. Social

stigmas associated with failure to invest optimally in one's child can be

thought of as an enforcement mechanism in this scheme to insure efficient

intergenerational resource allocation.

An Empirical Methodology:

        In this section, a technique is sketched by which the size of the

father—child externality can be estimated. Let us confine our discussion

to the externality which results in underinvestment by the parent in his

own education because he ignores spillovers to his child. It is this

manifestation of the externality that relates to questions of intergenera-

tional upward mobility. It is no secret that there is a positive correla-

tion between an individual's income and his parents' educational attainments.

If an externality exists in that parents do not invest enough in their own

education,    their children may be "doomed" to a life of poverty. Lip ser-

vice at least, is paid to this factor as a justification of subsidized

schooling, especially to disadvantaged groups. It is therefore important

to consider the size of the "upward mobility" externality.

        The formulation above states that the perceived rental rate is R

while the actual social rate is R + pR. Define one year of education as

H = 1    and assume that P, the present value of the flow of the private

rental rate over the lifetime is the same for all units of education. The

prices, P, can vary across individuals depending upon their productivity

at school. If individuals invest in education at H = 1      per year then

write the cost of education function for individual I as



(31)        Cost E K1(E, Xñ = 1)



where E is number of years of schooling and X is a vector of personal

characteristics, one of which is the parent's level of education. On the

margin the perceived marginal return to a unit of education, P, must
                                        22



equal the marginal cost so that



(32)       P = K(E,     XIñ = 1)



If the cost function is monotonic in E, equation (32) can be inverted with

respect to E, so in equilibrium,



(33)       E = K11(P, xñ = 1)


The difference between socially and privately optimal levels of E is then

approximately



(34)       cE =   Ki(P,   xIñ =
                                   dP




where dP = p*P,       i.e., the difference between social and private returns.

Note that p*P is not the total amount of intergenerational spillover, but

merely the amount that the parent chooses to ignore. So


                        aKl'(P,XIH = 1)
(35)       ES —   E                       (p*P)




Estimation:

       To obtain estimates of Q* and thereby infer ES —     E,   it is necessary

first to determine the cost function, K(E, Xñ =      1),   (henceforth written as

K(E,X)). Data from the Michigan Income Dynamics Study (1966—1974) will be
                                        23




used for this purpose. This study contains information on the education,

family background expenditure patterns and earnings of .ihout 5500 individuals.

For this analysis, a subsample of 1455 individuals was selected to meet the

following criteria: First, all were male heads of households above 30 years

of age (to insure that their highest level of schooling attained reflected

lifetime schooling). Second, information on relevant background variables

and current wage rates was available.

       Given these data, It is necessary to choose a functional form for ihe

cost function. Following the method developed in Lazear (1976a), a Cobb-

Douglas function should be sufficiently general for the purpose. Thus, let



(36)       K(E,X) = nEYNóAOMLexp(AS +        t + vY + Z + aD + irV)


where E is the highest grade of schooling completed by the individual

        F is the highest grade of schooling completed by the father

        N is the highest grade of schooling completed by the      mother
        N is the number of siblings

        A is the individual's age (a vintage effect)

        S is a dummy set equal to one if the individual was raised in the South

        D is a dummy set equal to one for whites

        L Is a dummy set equal to one if the individual was raised on .i farm

        Y is a dummy for being Jewish

        V is a dummy for being Catholic

        Z Is a dummy for having a foreign born mother.
                                             24




Taking the log of both sides of (36) produces



(37) in K(E,X) =         in    + y in E + in F + 6 in N + 0 in A + c in M + AS

                         + aD +     + vY + Z + itV



so that given data on K(E,X) for each individual, OLS identifies r,                      ,,
6,   8, c, A, a, i, F, and 7r.         With these estimates, and attained E, P may
be calculated for each individual. Since in equilibrium P =                  K1   (E,X) where
E is the attained and therefore privately optimal level of schooling an

estimate of P is obtained as



(38)        P yE1N6AOMCexp(S +             UL +   vY + FZ + aD + rrV)


P is determined by inserting the actual values of the attained level of

                                                                        =
education and of endowment variables into (38). Then                        K(P,X)       is

        In   order to estimate ES —   E,    all that is needed is information on

 left—hand—variable of equation (36) (the cost of a given level of schooling

 for an individual with attributes X), and an estimate of p*. Estimates of

 the first can be obtained by employing a transformation of foregone earnings.

The method is described in detail in Lazear (1976a) and will only be sketched

here. The method is to estimate what the wage rate would have been during

the jth year of school based upon endowment characteristics and accumulated

schooling to that point. The wage rate multiplied by the hours of school

then provides an estimate of the foregone earnings component of schooling.

Direct costs are assumed to be zero through grade 12 and then one—half of

foregone earnings thereafter. The result is that

                   + a9Y + a10V + a11Z + a12D + a13DM + a1D•F



where           is the individual's wage rate in 1972. The results of that

estimation by OLS and contained in table 1. W* is then defined as

                   + a8L + a9Y + a10V + a11Z + a12D + a13D•M + aD•F



Now all variables are specified so that the parameters of equation (37) may

be estimated. The results are contained in Table

       From estimation of (36), all the relevant parameters have been obtained

to solve for ES —     E      except for p*. It should be recalled that p*P is

the unaccounted for proportion of the return to education that is captured

by the individual's child, rather than by the individual himself. Thus,

p*P Is not the total spillover to the following generation. However, since

       p where pP is the total intergenerational spillover, an upper bound

to the difference between ES —        E   is given by           (pP)   .   Estimates

of pP can be obtained. Estimation of equation (40) reveals a significant

effect of parental education on an individual's wage rate. If the relation-

ship is in fact a causal one (rather than merely reflecting unobserved ability

differences), and if the effect of parental education on work is the same as

where 8760 is the number of hours in a year. Using the estimates, pP and

(pP)' are $168 and $219 respectively for white individuals. Thus, at most,

the difference between ES and E evaluated at the point of means is



(44)        ES —       KIP,X) (pP) = (.00168)(168)      = .282 years for white fathers

and

(45)        ES —   E     (.00168)(219) = .369 for white mothers.

If the parent takes none of the spill—over into account, he will underinvest

in his own   education   by at most one—third year. A few comments are in order.

       First, this calculation has taken as given current levels of educational

subsidy. The estimation of the socially optimal level of education assumes

that current subsidies occur for reasons which do not include, but are addi-

tive to intergenerational spillovers. Even under this assumption which' yields

the largest possible estimate of additional efficient schooling, the efficient

amount is less than one—third of a year.

       Second, the calculation is for the "average" white individual, It might

be interesting to consider groups of individuals who normally acquire fewer

years of schooling than the population as a whole. Non—whites and individuals

from low income households immediately come to mind. Since schooling subsidies

are often directed at these groups (especially with respect to higher educa-

tion), it is useful to consider them separately.

       By segmenting the sample, the calculation performed in (44) can be re-

peated for blacks and low income individuals. For blacks, equation (14)

yields estimates of pP and (pP)' of $693 and $184 respectively. (Note

that color interacts with the F and M effects.) Using these estimates
                                          29




and the conditional mean values of the endowment variables for black indivi-

duals, one obtains



(46)        ES —   E    (.0033)(693) = 2.297 years for black fathers and

and

(47)        ES —   E    (.0033)(184) =   .610 years for black mothers.


       A question was included on the survey that asked whether or not the

individual was from a poor home. The variable of questionable interest for

two reasons. First, about 45% of the sample replied that they did in fact

come from poor families. Second, the variable did not interact significantly

with either F or M in the wage equation. Nevertheless, it is informative

to segment the sample to see whether E5 —       E     for poor whites is similar to

ES —       for. blacks. Again, for whites (pP) and (pP)' are $168 and $219
respectively. So for poor white males,



(48)           —   E    (.00244)(l68) = .409 years



and for poor white females,



(49)        ES —   E    (.00244)(219) = .534 years



       For Ierichtt white males,




(50)        ES —   E'   (.00l556)(168) = .261 years
                                           30




and for rich white females,



(51)       ES — E1'       (.001556)(219)    .341 years



       Thus, maximum estimates of the deviation between social and private

optimal levels of schooling for "poor" whites resemble those for rich

whites much more than those for blacks. The primary reason is that costs

of schooling differ so substantially between blacks and whites as the result

of differential foregone earnings.

       One additional caveat is in order. An implicit assumption in the

above analysis is that parental education is a private rather than a public

good. That is, education used to further the productivity of one child can-

not then be used again to affect a second one. This makes sense if one thinks

of the benefits from education as being realizable only when combined with

parental time. If, on the other hand, education is a pure public good, the

spillover to the next generation would approximately equal



            N        f90 aw72   (8760) e
                30       3F


where N Is the number of children (this calculation ignores the fact that

children are usually born at different times). The truth probably lies

somewhere in the middle; education is neither a purely public nor purely
                 18
private good.

       Let us recap. This section started by asking, what is the value of and

desired level of subsidization associated with the "upward mobility" external—

ity produced by education. Specifically, how much of a case can be made for
                                     31




 subsidized schooling on the grounds that it is an efficient way to improve

 the long—run standard of living of low income individuals. A lump—sum trans-

 fer of income to the poor has the advantage that the recipient's own utility

 is maximized in this manner. However, it has the disadvantage that it does

 not correct intergenerational inefficiencies generated by education spillover

 effects. An alternative is to tax the present generation and invest these

 resources. On the margin this returns rate r which could then be trans-

 ferred to the future generation if desired. This is the justification for

discounting spillovers to children at rate r: it is the opportunity cost

of those funds to them as well as to individuals currently alive.

     To this point, the findings are that no additional subsidy of any size

to white individuals is warranted. However, the upper bound of ES —      E
f or black males is substantial. It suggested that these blacks underinvest

in own education by as much as 2.3 years because they fail to consider spill—

over effects. Thus, if the average black male's marginal years of schooling

were subsidized by $693 per year in present value terms or $4192 in age 18

dollars, the required subsidy of (2.3)($4l92) = $9641 would induce a move

to the socially optimal level of schooling. This number is based upon the

assumption that none of the spillover is accounted for by the parent and

that education is a purely private good.


Summary and Conclusion:

     This paper considers intergenerational externalities produced either

when parental human capital affects an individual's human capital cost

function or when parental decisions about direct investment in a child fail
                                    32




to account for the total benefits of that investment. The model is presented

in terms jf general human capital stocks, but the analysis can be made specific

to apply to schooling, health care, "productive" recreation, on—the—job train-

ing, and so forth. The following points are made:

     1) In the absence of impediments to borrowing by young children, no

intergenerational externality could be effective. Parents could withold

resources from their young children as payment for privately super—optimal

investment undertaken by the parent on the child's behalf. Both parent and

child would be better off as the latter could borrow freely on his higher

future income to finance smooth lifetime consumption.

     2) If intergeneration transfers cannot occur and parental utility

calculations totally ignore the offspring's wealth, the fact that parental

human capital affects an individual's human capital cost function will result

in a deviation between private and socially optimal levels of investment.

If R is the internalized (rental) return to a human capital and pR is

the inter— or intragenerational spillover, the privately optimal stock of

human capital will, at each point in time, be 1/(1 +    p)   of the socially

optimal stock. Furthermore, the subsidy necessary to correct the underinvest—

ment varies directly with R and p and inversely with C11          (the steepness

of the marginal cost of H).

     3) It is only necessary that the present generation maximize wealth

over as many generations as are directly affected by its investment. The

recursive nature of decisions guarantees that the social optimum will be

reached if this rule is followed. Thus, in the context of a family, if a

father cares sufficiently about his own offspring, he will invest optimally
                                    33




with respect to all future generations even though they enter his utility

functions nor transfer any resources to him.

     4) If the parent receives transfers from his child in accordance with

the child's wealth, the socially optimal level of the child's human capital

will exceed the parent's privately optimal level if the child's propensity

to transfer is less than one. The private optimum equals and does not exceed

the social optimum when this propensity Is greater than one. All of the

relevant parameters are empirically obtainable.

     5) Estimates of the difference between social and private optimal

levels of schooling reveal that for the mean individual, an upper bound of

.282 years of underinvestnient occurs. If some intergenerational spillovers

are taken into account by the investor, the magnitude will be smaller. The

distribution of underinvestment is important. One finds that low income

individuals and especially black males are more likely to underinvest in

their education from a social point of view than are whites and Individuals

from wealthier homes. An educational subsidy of about $9600 would be required

to induce the average black male to move to the socially optimal level of

schooling if he currently takes none of the intergenerational spillover

into account. To the extent that education has public good attributes, the

optimal subsidy is understated by these estimates. There does seem to be a

case for educational subsidies to the poor in order to efficiently achieve

"upward mobility."

    1Stigler (1968), Scherer (1970) and Hirschleifer (1971), for example,

consider optimal levels of technological innovations.

          number of studies have examined the effect of parental income on the

ability to obtain education. Jencks (1972), et. al., Bowles (1972) and a

preliminary paper by Parsons (1974) are just a few.

    3See, for example, Rosen (1972), Rosen (1973), Haley (1973), and Heckman

(1974).

    4lshikawa (1974) is an exception and will be discussed below.

    5wealth—maximization is a weak criterion. In the context of this paper,

only intertemporal efficiency is considered. It is the fact that generations

overlap that allows us to concern ourselves with wealth rather than utility

maximization. Since fathers are retired when sons are working, repayment

can occur during this stage and both generations will agree that their posi-

tion has been improved. This requires that consumption be delayed, and a

change in the equilibrium interest rate will therefore result. More is said

on this below.

    6The notation is similar to that in Rosen (1973). The model assumes

f or simplicity that there is only one parent and one child. Also, at this

point, the assumption that there are no intragenerational externalities is

maintained. This will be relaxed below.

    7Lazear (1975) finds support for the assumption that own human capital

is neutral while parental human capital affects human capital returns to a

greater extent than costs. In the context of this model, this implies C2 < 0.
 See Brown (1976), Heckman (1974) and Lazear (1976) for more detailed dis-

 cussion of the neutrality question.

and so forth for each H..

H(T —       c)   <   0.   This implies that 11(T) is negatively sloped everywhere, but

at T. Since H(0) = 0,                 H(T) <   0       for T > 0.
   '°Note the distinction between flow returns and costs to a unit of human

capital and to a unit of investment. On the margin, the cost of additional

H must equal the marginal returns. This is the logic of the Euler equation.

However, the total within period returns to the increased stock of human

capital may clearly exceed total costs as the result of inframarginal rents

on H.

        is sufficient to show that given f(x), g(x), the conditions f(O) =

g(O),   f'(T) =       f'(T),       and f"(x) <   g"(x)   together imply that f'(x) >       g'(x)
for 0 x <         T    and f(x) > g(x)         for 0 < x     T.     This is easily seen:

Since f"(x) <         g"(x)    for all x,



             T—'       f"(x)clx <            g"(x)dx              for c >   o



Thus,



             f'(T)    —   f'(T—c) < g'(T) — g'(T—c)


Since



             f'(T) =      g'(T),     f'(T—) > g'(T—e)      so that f'(x) >      g'(x)

                                                 for x < T



Similarly,   since f'(x) >           g'(x)   for x < T



             •C   f'(x)dx      >
                                   fE: g'(x)dx
Since f(O) = g(O),   f(t) >   g(c)   for t > 0.

   12See Lazear (1975), for estimates of R and the parameters of the

parameters of a non—quadratic cost function.

   13Potential exists for ascertaining whether or not the parent takes

children into account in his investment plan. If, other things constant,

parents with children obtain higher levels of education than those without

(say, unmarried adults), it can be argued that some parental investment

occurs on the child's behalf.

   141n work currently in progress, I am investigating the relationship

between child—to—parent transfers and demographic variables as parental

wealth, child's wealth, number of siblings, level of child's schooling,

marital status, race, etc.

   15The proof is identical to that in footnote 9 and need not be repeated

here.

        fact, as long as f' > 1,     the parent will keep transferring dollars

to his child because the present value of the return to the parent exceeds

the cost. In order for transfers to stop short of exhausting total

parental resources, f' must eventually sink below 1.

   171n fact, the concept of deviations from socially optimal investment

levels can be usefully extended to other family problems as well. In cur-

rent work, I define "child—neglect" as existing when less than the socially

optimal amount of parent—to—child transfers (for health, housing, education...)

occurs. Thus, a wealthy child may in a real sense be "neglected" to a great-

er extent than one in much poorer condition on an absolute scale.
   18Even if parental education were purely public, ES —    would be less

than N times previous estimates. The reason is that the convex.nature

of the cost function means that           dP   overstates dE by more as
dP increases.
