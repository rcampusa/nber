                                            ABSTRACT

We incorporate demand-side considerations in trade in a systematic but straightforward way. We

do so by focusing on the role of inequality in the determination of trade flows and patterns. With

nonhomothetic preferences, when countries are similar in all respects but asset inequality, we find

that trade is driven by specialization in consumption, not production. These assumptions allow us

to generate some interesting international spillover effects of redistributive policies. We also look

at the effects of combining inequality and endowment differences on trade flows, and see that this

has implications for “the mystery of the missing trade.” We then study a model of monopolistic

competition, and find a novel V-shaped relationship between the ratio of inter-industry to intra-

industry trade and a country’s inequality. Finally, we look at how international differences in factor

endowments affect this relationship between the ratio of inter- to- intra-industry trade and inequality.

Our theory formalizes as well as modifies Linder’s conjecture about the relationship between

intraindustry trade and the extent of similarity between trading partners.

1        Introduction

International trade thinking has been dominated in the past few decades by supply-side

theories, which place their focus squarely on diﬀerences in factor endowments or diﬀerences

in production technologies across countries.1 This theoretical bias stands in contrast to a

number of empirical studies, which find that demand diﬀerences also matter for the deter-

mination of trade. The reason for the theoretical bias stems, in our view, from the diﬃculty

in saying something systematic about how diﬀerences in consumption impact trade. For

instance, assuming at the very outset diﬀerences in tastes across countries may make the

analysis trivial, and a formal model redundant.

        In this paper, we incorporate demand-side considerations in a systematic but straight-

forward way, by focusing on the role of inequality in the determination of trade flows and

patterns. As we shall see, inequality has intuitive consequences for international trade that

provide empirically verifiable hypotheses. Another reason to concentrate on the impact of

inequality on trade is its virtual absence from previous theoretical work.

        The intuition for our model can be simply explained. When preferences are assumed to be

nonhomothetic (in such a way that income expansion paths are actually curved), aggregate

demand for each good depends not only on aggregate income, but also on the distribution of

that income.2 But if income distribution is a determinant of aggregate demand, then it must

    1
     The few exceptions to this rule only seem to confirm it. See the paper by Markusen (1986), in which
he considers nonhomothetic tastes as part of the explanation for the volume of trade, but calls his approach
“eclectic.”
   2
      With linear income expansion paths, preferences are nonhomothetic if the expansion paths do not pass
through the origin. An example of this case (in which preferences are called quasi-homothetic) can be found
in the aforementioned paper by Markusen (1986). The linearity of the income-expansion path excludes a
role for income distribution. For our purposes, then, we assume that the income-expansion paths are strictly
curved.

be a determinant of trade, which is nothing but the excess demand vector for the economy.

More specifically, consider a model with two goods: manufactures are a “luxury,” and food

is a “necessity,” in the sense that, as consumers become richer, they allocate larger shares

of their budgets to manufactures. There are two countries: the East and the West, with

the East having a more equitable distribution of income than the West. The two countries

are assumed to have the same factor endowments and technology, and therefore their supply

schedules are identical. However, the demand for food is lower in the West, because the

rich are richer in the West and therefore they demand disproportionately less food. When

the two countries open to trade, the world price lies between the two autarky prices, which

causes the East to import food and to export manufactures.

   Note that in this simple inter-industry model we get the exact opposite of the standard

reason for trade. Given common world prices and identical technology and endowments, the

two countries (assumed for simplicity to be the same size) produce the same quantities of

food and manufactures. But given their diﬀerent inequality levels, they consume the two

goods in diﬀerent proportions. Therefore, the gains from trade are due to specialization in

consumption, not in production.

   In this paper, by considering the impact of demand on trade, we also revisit some earlier

insights from trade theory - while at the same time extending them and making them more

precise. We emphasize especially the work of Linder (1961), who used demand-side consid-

erations to explain the large volume of intra-industry trade between developed countries.

Linder began by assuming that consumers earning similar incomes have similar demands. If

firms respond first to consumers in their own country, firms in each of the developed countries



                                              2
end up producing goods adapted to the tastes not only of their own consumers, but also of

the consumers in all other developed countries, thus enhancing intra-industry trade among

such countries.

   Of course, Krugman (1979), Helpman (1981) and Helpman and Krugman (1985) also oﬀer

an explanation for intra-industry trade, and they do rely on demand-side considerations, in

that they assume a taste for variety on the part of consumers. However, as Markusen (1986)

in his seminal paper points out, Helpman and Krugman’s work omits Linder’s important

intuition that consumers earning similar incomes consume similar baskets of goods. This

intuition, which is sometimes called the Linder hypothesis, can only be understood using

a model with nonhomothetic preferences, which is precisely the driving assumption in this

paper.

   The relevance of using nonhomothetic preferences in trade models can only be evaluated

in the context of the existing empirical evidence. Thursby and Thursby (1987) find that

countries with similar per capita incomes trade more. They explicitly consider the similarity

in per capita incomes to be a measure for similarity in tastes, and therefore to be a test

variable for Linder’s hypothesis. Hunter and Markusen (1988) estimate a linear expenditure

system for aggregate demand across thirty four countries and eleven industries and find that

tastes deviate from homotheticity in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, Hunter’s

(1991) counter-factual exercise suggests that net trade volumes would increase by as much as

a quarter if tastes were homothetic. In a diﬀerent approach, Tchamourliyski (2002) extends

Anderson and van Wincoop’s (2003) model of gravity and trade costs to allow for nonhomo-

thetic tastes, and estimates it for bilateral trade data in 1996. He rejects at any conventional



                                               3
significance level the hypothesis that tastes are homothetic. None of the aforementioned

papers looks for income distribution as a determinant of trade, the empirical support for

which has been provided by Francois and Kaplan (1996) and more recently by Dalgin, Mitra

and Trindade (2003).3

       We begin our analysis in the next section with a simple Heckscher-Ohlin framework.

Contrary to standard trade models, which usually assume “disembodied” capital and labor,

we explicitly assume an ownership structure for the factors of production. For given factor

rewards, this determines an income distribution, which in turn aﬀects the pattern of con-

sumption in the aggregate. Thus, our paper shares Grossman and Maggi’s (2000) concern

with the distribution of factor endowments, while being quite diﬀerent due to our emphasis

on the demand-side consequences of such a distribution. It is interesting to note that, in

autarky, two countries with the same aggregate endowments but diﬀerent asset distribution

have diﬀerent product (and therefore factor) prices. With the additional assumption that

the necessity (food) is the labor-intensive good,4 we find that trade leads to incomplete

convergence in income distribution: it reduces inequality in the more unequal country and

increases it in the more equal country.

       We also obtain what constitutes to us a novel eﬀect in the literature: the international

transmission of redistributive policies. Suppose that one of the countries enacts a policy of

asset (or income) redistribution from the poor to the rich, thereby increasing the inequality

   3
    Using Japanese regional data, Davis et al (1997) lend support to the hypothesis of homothetic tastes.
However, as they point out, theirs is only a consistency test. Their results can alternatively be explained if
income distributions and incomes per capita do not vary suﬃciently across Japanese regions to “reveal” the
nonhomotheticity in tastes.
   4
    This assumption implies that poorer countries specialize in necessities, a finding that is empirically
supported by Dalgin, Mitra and Trindade (2003).




                                                      4
within the country. In the standard model this has no impact on world product or factor

prices, and therefore has no impact on the distribution of income in the other country. When

we recognize the nonhomothetic nature of preferences, however, we see that the redistributive

policy, which raises the demand for manufactures, reduces the world wage rate and raises the

return on capital, thereby resulting in a more unequal distribution of income in all countries.

       Although we begin by allowing no diﬀerences in factor proportions across countries, we

subsequently ask how their introduction aﬀects the results. If both relative endowments and

inequality are diﬀerent across the two countries, it is possible that the predicted volume

of trade is smaller than under a model with homothetic tastes. This outcome arises when

the capital abundant country is also more unequal and the impact of nonhomotheticity on

demand is not large enough to reverse the pattern of trade.5

       We study in section 3 a model of intra-industry trade. This provides a tighter link between

nonhomothetic tastes, demand, and Linder’s hypothesis. Holding the West’s asset inequality

constant, and increasing the East’s, we show that the volume of intra-industry trade increases,

while the ratio of inter-to intra-industry trade decreases, eventually achieving zero when the

East is as unequal as the West. If we increase the inequality in the East beyond that in the

West, then both the ratio of inter-to intra-industry trade and the volume of inter-industry

trade increase. One of the reasons that this result is interesting is that it formalizes, and at

the same time amends, Linder’s intuition. While Linder argued that there should be more

intra-industry trade between similar countries, we find that it is really the proportion of

   5
     A much more complete analysis of the implications of nonhomothetic tastes for the “missing trade”
can be found in Chung (2000). Note that he abstracts from distributional considerations by assuming quasi-
homothetic preferences. In our paper, the result on missing trade is a by-product of the overall theory of
inequality and trade. However, it is important insofar as it lends further support to the use of inequality in
trade theory.


                                                      5
intra-industry in overall trade that is high between similar countries, while the measure of

similarity should be not only the similarity of incomes per capita, but also the similarity in

distribution. We provide further precision to Linder’s conjecture by looking simultaneously at

the role of international diﬀerences in inequality and factor endowments in the determination

of inter- versus intra-industry trade.

   A few recent theoretical papers incorporate nonhomothetic preferences into their analysis

and, as expected, they are similar to our paper in some respects. There are quite a few

important diﬀerences as well. We already mentioned Markusen (1986) and Chung (2000),

both of whom are mainly interested in explaining the volume of trade, the latter in the

context of Trefler’s (1995) results on the “missing trade.” We also discuss the assumption of

homotheticity as a possible cause for over-estimating the predicted volume of trade, but we

add income distribution and especially focus on it as a possible determinant of the pattern and

volume of trade. Income distribution is excluded by the assumption of quasi-homotheticity in

both Markusen and Chung. Ramezzana (2002) also studies the impact of per capita income

on world trade, but restricts his analysis to the case where there is perfect equality within

each country.

   A few theoretical contributions have explored, just as we do here, the link between non-

homothetic preferences, income distribution, and aggregate demand. A first strand does so

in the context of general equilibrium closed economy models, and is most concerned with the

process of industrialization. Examples of this are Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1989), and

Krishna and Yavas (2001). The second segment deals with open economy models where the

income distribution is exogenously given. See for instance Matsuyama’s (2000) Ricardian



                                              6
model. In his framework it is not possible to ask our question of the impact of one country’s

redistributive policy on another country’s distribution. Furthermore, Matsuyama is mainly

interested in examining the asymmetric impact of population and productivity growth on

the terms of trade between developed and developing countries.6

    One further diﬀerence between our work and all the papers mentioned above is that,

to the extent of our knowledge, no other work considers nonhomothetic preferences and

asset distribution within a model of monopolistic competition, increasing returns and intra-

industry trade.

    One additional contribution is that we study the eﬀect of asset inequality on factor

prices, both in the presence and in the absence of international trade. Thus, what is really

novel in this paper, besides the study of distributional diﬀerences as a basis for comparative

advantage and trade, is the direct and indirect eﬀects (through the impact on factor prices)

of asset inequality on income inequality.



2     A Two by Two Model

A. Production and consumption

    There are two goods, food (F ) and manufactures (M ). There are also two factors of pro-

   6
     Johnson (1959) is another theoretical paper that attempts to capture the impact of inequality on aggregate
demand and trade flows. In his model, there are two classes of consumers, namely capitalists and workers,
with diﬀerent marginal propensities to consume any given good, the diﬀerence in propensities not being
formally modeled. Under these conditions, trade impacts aggregate demand through its impact on factor
rewards, which in turn aﬀect the relative weights given to the tastes of the two groups in deriving national
demand. Johnson argues that a country’s oﬀer curve may as a consequence have backward bending portions,
giving rise to possible multiplicity and/or instability of equilibria. Our paper goes beyond Johnson’s work in
several dimensions: we model the importance of distribution based specifically on nonhomothetic tastes; in
the context of the perfectly competitive model (the only one that Johnson studied), we apply the model to
missing trade, to the international transmission of redistributive policies, and to the comparative statics of
changing the degree of asset inequality (fixed in Johnson); most importantly, we also examine a model with
imperfect competition.

duction, capital and labor. In this section, we assume that the production functions for food

and manufactures exhibit constant returns to scale. We further assume that manufactures

are the capital intensive good and that there are no factor intensity reversals.

      Since these are the assumptions of the standard 2x2 model, it is not surprising that we

reproduce the results from that model. In particular, we will be interested in how factor

prices change with goods prices. We begin with the zero-profit conditions:



                                    pF = cF (w, r),       pM = cM (w, r),                        (1)

where cF and cM represent the unit costs of food and manufactures, pF and pM are their

prices, w is the wage, and r is the rental price of capital.

      Total diﬀerentiation of equation (1), use of Shepard’s lemma, and some transformation,

yield:7

for θiK . In the expression above, |θ| = θF L − θML = θMK − θF K > 0, the last inequality

following from the assumption that manufactures are capital-intensive. We now assume that

food is the numeraire good (and therefore pbF = 0). Denoting the price of manufactures by

p, for pb > 0, equation (2) implies:

which is the Stolper-Samuelson eﬀect.

   We model any individual j’s consumption of food and manufactures, respectively, in the

following way:
                                                                                 ¡      ¢

                   CFj (p, I j )                   j
                                   = [1 − φ p, I ]I ,      j    j
                                                               CM (p, I j )   =              ,
                                                                                    p

where I j is her income and φ(p, I j ) is the share of income that she spends on manufactures.

We model the nonhomotheticity in tastes explicitly by assuming that this share is a function

of income. The central case in our analysis will be the one in which the capital-intensive

good (manufactures) is also the luxury. That is, we assume that φ is an increasing function

of I j . Figure 1 depicts a typical income expansion path, in the case where ∂φ/∂I j > 0, for

all I j > 0. The reverse case can easily be analyzed without any diﬃculty.

   The economy consists of two groups of people, each of mass one: the rich (R) and the

                                                                              L
poor (P). Both groups possess equal amounts of labor,                         2   each, but the shares of R and

                                                                                           1
P in the economy’s capital stock are σ and 1− σ respectively, with                         2   ≤ σ ≤ 1. Thus asset

                                            1
inequality increases with σ. If σ =         2 (σ   = 1), there is perfect asset equality (inequality).

Incomes of groups R and P are given by:

   Total consumption of manufactures can be written as CM = CM    M           i

    B. Changes in income caused by changes in price

    Given this paper’s focus on inequality, a natural question to pose is how the incomes of

the rich and of the poor change, as goods prices change. Diﬀerentiating equation (4), we

obtain:

                 rσK                                                                              wL/2
where η R
        K =       IR
                       is the share of capital income in the total income of the rich, and ηR
                                                                                            L =    IR

is the share of labor income (analogous definitions apply to the poor). Substituting from

equation (3), and using θF L = 1 − θF K and η R     R
                                              K + η L = 1 (and repeating the procedure for

I P ), we get:



                                    ηR − θF K                  ηP − θF K
                              IbR = K         pb,        IbP = K         pb.                       (5)
                                   θMK − θF K                 θMK − θF K

Consider now a shock to prices, such that pb > 0. The following Lemma shows what happens

to the incomes of the two groups.


      Lemma 1. Suppose that pb > 0. Then there are two cutoﬀ values for σ, defined

      as:
                                       1 KM /LM            1 KF /LF
                                σR =            , σP = 1 −          .
                                       2 K/L               2 K/L

      The assumption that manufactures is the capital intensive good immediately im-

      plies that σ R , σ P > 12 . The following implications hold:




      (i)   1
            2   < σ < σ R ⇒ 0 < IbR < pb.



                                                    10
     (ii) σ R < σ < 1 ⇒ 0 < pb < IbR .

     (iii)   1
             2   < σ < σ P ⇒ 0 < IbP < pb.

     (iv) σ P < σ < 1 <⇒ IbP < 0 < pb.

     (v) IbR > IbP .

     Proof. We shall only show the first two conditions, as the remaining ones are

     analogously proved. First note that equation (5) implies that the condition IbR >

     0 is equivalent to ηR
                         K > θ F K , given that θ MK − θ F K > 0. After substituting

                                                                      rσK             rKF
     from the definitions of ηR
                              K and θ F K this is equivalent to    rσK+wL/2     >   rKF +wLF   .

                                                   L             1 KF /LF
     Further manipulation yields σKLF > KF         2,   or σ >   2 K/L      , which is always
                                                                                 KF /LF
     true, because (assuming both goods are produced in equilibrium)              K/L     < 1

     and σ > 12 . Therefore, IbR > 0 is true always. The condition IbR > pb, in turn,

                                                                    L
     is equivalent to η R
                        K > θ MK .      This yields σKLM > KM       2,   or σ > σ R . which

     completes the proof of conditions (i) and (ii) above.


   In words, Lemma 1 says that as inequality increases (σ goes up), the rich become more

identified with capital, while the poor become more identified with labor (see equation 4).

Therefore a “Stolper-Samuelson-like” result obtains for high levels of inequality: IbP < 0 <

pb < IbR . For lower levels of inequality, the real incomes of both groups measured in food

units rise, while they fall when measured in units of manufactures. Thus, a suﬃcient amount

of inequality is required for the two groups to have diﬀerent preference orderings over goods

prices or terms of trade, a conclusion that may have applications for political economy.




                                              11
   C. Closed economy equilibrium

   We begin our analysis of the equilibrium in a closed economy by showing two properties

of the total consumption of manufactures. First, assume that inequality increases, through a

redistribution of assets from the poor to the rich. All else equal, it is intuitive that aggregate

demand for manufactures should increase. The rich increase their demand, and the poor

decrease it, but the former dominates, because the rich’s marginal demand for manufactures

is higher than the poor’s.

   Next, consider an increase in the price of manufactures. Note that, besides the normal

substitution and income eﬀects, price impacts consumption in two additional ways: first,

through the extra income eﬀect of the income redistribution itself (since I changes with p);

and second, through the separate impact of income on consumers’ consumption mixes. The

first eﬀect is due to our assumption of an ownership structure for the factors of production.

The second eﬀect is due to our assumption of nonhomothetic tastes. It can be shown that a

suﬃcient condition for total consumption in manufactures to go down with its price is that

these two eﬀects be suﬃciently small. In other words, we require that our assumptions do

not overturn the standard results from trade theory, but simply add to them. Lemma 2

establishes the two properties of the demand for manufactures.


      Lemma 2. At any given price, total consumption of manufactures increases

                                                            ∂CM
      with an increase in the inequality, that is,           ∂σ   > 0. Furthermore, suppose that

                                        p dφ          p dI J
      the following condition holds:    φ dp     +   I J dp
                                                                < 1 (J = R, P), for any price p

                               dI J         dφ         ∂φ        ∂φ dI J
      and income I J , where    dp    and   dp   (=    ∂p   +   ∂I J dp
                                                                           ) are total derivatives with

      respect to p. Then, total consumption in manufactures decreases with the price


                                                     12
                                     dCM
       of manufactures, that is,      dp   < 0.

                                                            ∂CM
       Proof: We can use Figure 1 to show that               ∂σ   > 0. Note that for both groups

       (J = R, P), as income goes up, relative consumption of manufactures must

       increase. More formally,



                                     J            ·                      ¸
                                ∂ CM      ∂               φ(p, I J )
                                        = J                                > 0,
                               ∂I J CFJ  ∂I           p (1 − φ(p, I J ))
                  ∂φ
       because   ∂I J
                        > 0, by assumption that manufactures are the luxury good. This

       implies that the income expansion path is convex. We assume that it is strictly

       convex, as shown in the figure. When σ increases by ∆σ, the changes in the

       incomes of the rich and the poor are: ∆I R = −∆I P = rK∆σ. The figure depicts

       the initial budget constraints for the rich (the solid line marked I R ) and for the

       poor (the solid line marked I P ). The dashed lines are the budget constraints

                                                                        R + ∆C P > 0,
       after the increase in σ. It is then geometrically obvious that ∆CM     M

                   ∂CM
       therefore    ∂σ   > 0. This leaves out the possibility of an income expansion path

       that is not strictly convex, that is, that has some linear sections. In that case,

       all that we need to assume is that the budget lines of the rich and the poor cross

       diﬀerent linear sections of the income expansion path, and the result follows.8

       Suppose now that the suﬃcient condition holds. It is straightforward to show that
                    µ              ¶
                      φ(p,I J )I J
       it implies d        p         /dp < 0, for any income and price, thereby guaranteeing

   8
      The case of quasi-homothetic preferences that dominates the previous literature happens for example if
there is a minimum subsistence level of food, with Cobb-Douglas preferences above that minimum. Consumers
have consumption expansion paths with the shape of “launching ramps”: horizontal from the origin, thereafter
a straight line at some slope up. If all consumers are in the inclined portion, a small income redistribution
does not change aggregate consumption, and inequality does not play a role. We exclude such a possibility
here.


                                                      13
         that an increase in price makes all consumers decrease their consumption of

         manufactures. Thus aggregate consumption goes down.9


       The suﬃcient condition in lemma 2 can be violated, if the eﬀects studied in this model

are “too” strong, a theoretical possibility on which we do not focus.10

       Figure 2 depicts the markets for manufactures in two countries: the East and the West.

The East has a more equal asset distribution than the West (σ E < σ W ), the two countries

being otherwise identical. The curve labeled CW (YW ) represents total demand (supply) for

manufactures in the West, with analogous curves for the East.11

       The two countries have identical factor endowments, therefore, if there is trade, it cannot

be due to Heckscher-Ohlin eﬀects. In particular, the two supply curves are identical. The

CW curves take into account both the direct eﬀect of a change in p on consumption, as well

as the impact of p on nominal income. From now on we assume the suﬃcient condition of

lemma 2, and draw the demand curves as downward sloping.

               dCM
       Since    dσ   > 0, the demand curve for the East lies below that of the West. In autarky,

   9
     The relationship between consumption of manufactures (and food) and the distribution of either assets
or income is not specific to our simple modeling of inequality. For example, our model generalizes to a
uniform discrete distribution of assets, and therefore of income. In such a case, arrange the N individuals in
an economy in ascending order of their incomes. We can increase inequality (holding the mean and therefore
aggregate income constant) by redistributing equal amounts from individual 1 to individual N, 2 to N - 1, 3
to N - 2 and so on. Given the assumed curvature of the income expansion path, as described above, we obtain
the same relationship between consumption of manufactures and inequality as in lemma 2.

     Assume utility U = (F − F0 )β M 1−β . It is Cobb-Douglas, except for the minimum subsistence level
F0 in food. Assume that I¡R > F0 ¢> I P , so that the poor

that Ib /b

          p I / I − F0 > 1 (which violates our suﬃcient condition), meaning that the rich increase their
demand of manufactures as p increases. Since the poor cannot decrease their consumption of manufactures
below zero, this implies that aggregate consumption of manufactures goes up with price.
  11
     CW is the same as CM , but for one country (the West) only. To avoid clutter, we omit the subscript M,
but do write the subscripts W and E to denote the West and the East, respectively.



                                                     14
therefore, pW > pE and CW > CE . Since r increases and w decreases with p (see equation

3), we have wW < wE and rW > rE . In other words, the wage is higher in the more equal

country, while the rental price is higher in the more unequal country. If we think of capital

to be human capital, then a more unequal asset distribution leads to a higher ratio of skilled

to unskilled wages, i.e., to higher wage inequality.

       Let us define income inequality, σ I , as the share of the income of the rich in total income:
         rσK+w(L/2) 12
σI =       rK+wL .      It is easy to see that:
                                                                      
                       dσ I       rK          ∂σ I          ∂σ I         dp
                            =            +        w0 (p) +      r0 (p)    > 0.
                       dσ      rK + wL        ∂w (−)        ∂r (+) dσ
                                        (+)           (−)              (+)               (+)

                      rK
The first term,     rK+wL ,     is the standard eﬀect of an increase in asset inequality on income

inequality, which is also present under homothetic preferences. The second term is a con-

sequence of nonhomotheticity, and it represents the additional adverse eﬀect on income in-

equality of the increase in the rental price and the reduction in wages, when asset inequality

goes up.13 Thus, we have the following proposition:

Proposition 1 With nonhomothetic preferences, if the luxury good is capital intensive, the
autarky wage rate decreases with asset inequality, while the rental price increases. This
implies that the eﬀect of an increase in asset inequality on income inequality is magnified by
the change in the relative factor rewards.



       D. Open economy equilibrium

       Suppose now that the two countries open up to free trade in goods. In figure 2, define

                                                                 YW +YE
the curve Y as the average supply (that is, Y =                     2   )   and curve C as the average demand

  12
      This measure relates in a monotonic way to more conventional measures of inequality. For example, it
is straightforward to show that the Gini index equals σI − 1/2, and that the ratio of the incomes of the top
income quintile to the bottom income quintile equals σI /(1 − σI ).
  13                   ∂σ I             ∂σ I                                     1        σ−1/2
    The inequalities    ∂r    ≥ 0 and   ∂w     ≤ 0 can be seen by writing σI =   2   +   1+wL/rK ,   and by recalling that
σ ≥ 1/2.


                                                            15
         CW +CE
(C =        2   ).   Since the the two countries’ supply curves coincide, they coincide with the

average supply. Free trade price and quantity are given by the intersection of the world

average supply with the world average demand: pF T and CF T .14 After opening up to trade,

manufactures become cheaper in the more unequal country (the West), and more expensive

in the more equal country (the East). At the common world price pF T , the West exports the

labor intensive good (food) and imports the capital intensive good (manufactures). Thus,

the West becomes a net importer of capital services and a net exporter of labor services.

Moreover, since the wage rate decreases and the rental rate increases with the relative price

of manufactures, the wage rate rises (falls), while the rental rate falls (rises), in the West

(East) to converge to common world levels. Income inequality goes down in the more unequal

country and rises in the more equal country. Thus, there is convergence in income inequality,

although it is only partial, since asset inequality diﬀers across the two countries. This gives

us the following proposition:

Proposition 2 With nonhomothetic preferences, if the luxury good is capital intensive, free
trade between two countries that diﬀer only in their asset inequality results in an increase
(decrease) in the wage rate, a reduction (increase) in the rental and a reduction (increase)
in income inequality in the more (less) unequal country. The more (less) unequal country is
an importer of the luxury good (necessity) and a net importer of capital (labor) services.


       Again, we emphasize that the only reason to trade (and for there to be gains from trade)

is the diﬀerence in the asset inequalities of the two countries, since everything else (factor

endowments, technology, and tastes) is the same.

  14
     Equilibrium in the market for manufactures insures equilibrium in the market for food, through Walras’
law and the fact that all prices are strictly positive.




                                                    16
   E. Transmission of inequality under free trade

   Suppose that one of the two countries implements a redistributive tax policy. For instance,

a tax cut that eﬀectively redistributes income from the poor to the rich will shift that

country’s (and therefore the world’s) C curve to the right. pF T goes up and so w falls and

r rises. Therefore, income inequality rises in the whole world, while in the country with the

tax cut it rises more than what it would in the presence of constant factor prices (as would be

the case under homothetic preferences). Similarly, an exogenous increase in asset inequality

in one country will increase income inequality in both countries. Thus income inequality in

the two countries is positively correlated.

   We see then that fiscal policy can have an impact on trade patterns and can have terms

of trade eﬀects, something that is clearly absent under homothetic preferences. This leads

to the interesting conclusion that fiscal policy can be a way of protecting one of the two

industries. We summarize this discussion in the following proposition.

Proposition 3 With nonhomothetic preferences, if the luxury good is capital intensive, free
trade between two countries results in the international transmission of shocks to income
inequality that happen through changes in asset inequality in one country.



   F. Diﬀerent factor proportions

   The focus so far has been on the impact of income inequality on trade, abstracting from

supply determinants of comparative advantage. Thus, we defined a generalized comparative

advantage, determined by diﬀerences in income distribution.

   However, it turns out to be instructive to consider the interaction between our model

and the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model. To that purpose, we now assume that the two

countries have diﬀerent factor proportions. As we shall see, we obtain surprising results,

                                              17
with a bearing on factor content studies. In particular, the next proposition shows that an

economist that does not take demand eﬀects into account must make one of two possible

mistakes: either she will get the direction of trade wrong; or she will over- or under-predict

the volume of trade, leading her in the first case to conclude that there is “missing trade.”

Proposition 4 When the diﬀerence in demand due to nonhomothetic tastes is not taken
into account, and the world average demand (in terms of expenditure share) is assumed to
be each country’s demand schedule, then:
    I. If the more unequal country is the capital abundant country (the “Northern” case),
either of two errors will occur:
    (i) The predicted direction of trade is the reverse of the actual direction of trade.
    (ii) The predicted volume of trade is larger than the actual volume of trade.
    II. If the more unequal country is also the labor abundant country (the “Southern” case),
the following error will occur, if the diﬀerence in per-capita incomes between the two countries
is suﬃciently small:
    (iii) The predicted volume of trade is smaller than the actual volume of trade.15


       Figure 3 illustrates what we call the “Northern” case of proposition 4, in which the more

unequal country (the West) is also the capital abundant country (compare, say, the US

with Europe).16 Here, we draw the supply and demand curves in terms of GDP shares. In

other words, while the demand curve shows the share in GDP of consumption expenditure

on manufactures (and is denoted by sC
                                    i , i = E, W ), the supply curve shows the share of

manufacture output in overall GDP (and is denoted by sPi , i = E, W ). Note that the sC
                                                                                      W

must lie to the right of sC
                          E : the West’s share of consumption in manufactures must be higher,

given its higher inequality and higher GDP per capita. Given that the West is more capital

abundant, its production of manufactures as a share (sPW ) of its GDP must also lie to the

  15
      The reason why this “case of excessive trade” is not quite as well-known as its cousin, the “case of the
missing trade,” may have to do with the fact that labor abundant countries that are very unequal tend to be
less developed countries, and they trade relatively little.
  16
     Note that in this section we allow for diﬀerences in the sizes of the overall population of the two countries
and assume aggregate capital and labor endowments in two countries to be such that the West is more
capital-abundant and has a higher per-capita GDP than the East.


                                                       18
right of the East’s (sPE ).

       Consider panel 3a. The world value of the output of manufactures as a share of world

GDP is sP . It is a GDP-weighted average of sPW and sPE and so lies between the two.

We denote the world price by PF T , as before. Given the world price, the volumes and

directions of trade are uniquely determined (shown as tW GDPW /p = −tE GDPE /p).17 Note

also that the GDP of each country, given its factor endowments, is only a function of the

world relative price of manufactures. To show the direction of trade, each vector points

from production to consumption, such that a vector pointing to the right indicates imports.

Compare the direction of trade with a prediction based on homothetic tastes. An empiricist

who assumes homothetic preferences constrains the world and country-specific expenditure

shares on manufactures to be identical when countries face the same world price. This is

precisely what factor content studies do: they assume that all countries’ consumption levels of

each good are proportional to world consumption (the constant of proportionality being the

ratio of country GDP to world GDP) and predict trade based solely on diﬀerences in factor

endowments. But if that is the case, our empiricist would assume curve sC for both countries’

shares of consumption in manufactures. Thus, she would predict a reverse pattern of trade

(shown as τ W GDPW /p = −τ E GDPE /p, where Greek letters will denote the predictions

based on homothetic tastes), thereby committing error (i). Note that we are assuming that

the empiricist can only observe the current level of world production of each of the two goods

(assumed to be equal to world consumption) and the current world price.

       In sum, when the diﬀerence in the supply schedules of the two countries is minimal,

  17
     Note that the formula above clearly means that, generally, tW will not equal tE (and τ W and τ E , defined
later, will not equal each other) in absolute value unless the two countries have the same aggregate GDP.



                                                      19
predicating the pattern of trade on supply alone leads to a wrong ranking of the autarky

prices of the two countries, and thus to the wrong direction of trade. The true autarky prices

are marked pW and pE , for the West and the East respectively, while the prices based on

homothetic tastes are marked π W and π E , respectively.

    The opposite situation is considered in panel 3b, where the diﬀerence in the two countries’

supplies dominates the diﬀerence in demand. Here, the correct ranking of the autarky prices

obtains. However, the reader can easily convince himself that forcing each country’s demand

schedule to coincide with the world demand (in terms of GDP shares) will always result in

an overestimate of the volume of trade: thus, while tW and tE point in the same direction

as τ W and τ E , it must be that |τ W | > |tW | and |τ E | > |tE |. Therefore, a researcher would

in this case avoid error (i) only at the cost of incurring error (ii).

    Similarly, we can analyze error (iii) in case (II) mentioned in proposition 4 above.


3    A Model with Inter- and Intra-Industry Trade

A. Model set-up and autarkic equilibrium

    We now modify the model from the previous section to introduce monopolistic com-

petition, product diﬀerentiation and increasing returns to scale. As we shall see, this will

provide precision to Linder’s hypothesis about the link between demand similarities and

intra-industry trade.

    We assume that, within the manufacturing sector, a number of varieties are produced

and consumers exhibit a “love for variety.” More specifically, an individual’s utility function
                          µ³                 ´ ε      ¶
                            Pn           ε−1  ε−1
is written in the form: U     i=1 (dMi )  ε       , dF , where dMi stands for the individual’s


consumption of the ith variety of manufactures; n is the number of varieties consumed; ε


                                                20
is the elasticity of substitution between diﬀerent varieties; and dF is consumption of food.
                                                          ³P             ε−1
                                                                             ´ ε
                                                              n               ε−1
Here the sub-utility function pertaining to manufactures,     i=1 (dMi )  ε       is of the Dixit-

Spence-Stiglitz form.

       As before, we specify that the individual’s budget share of manufactures is an increas-

ing function of income. However, we now write a group’s (rich or poor) expenditure on
                                    ¡      ¢
manufactures as share of income as φ P, I J , where the “price index” P is defined as
        ¡Pn     1−
                     ¢ 1−1
P =        i=1 pi            , pi being the price of variety i.18

       Let µM (w, r) denote the marginal cost of producing any variety of manufactures. We

assume that there is a fixed cost with the same capital intensity as the marginal cost and

can thus be denoted by αµM (w, r), for some α > 0.19 We shall as before assume that

manufactures are the capital intensive good, and that there are no factor intensity reversals.

       From now on, we use the symmetry among varieties to assume the equilibrium result

that all varieties have the same price and are produced in identical quantities. The total cost

of producing a representative variety equals αµM (w, r) + µM (w, r)xM , where xM is output.

Thus the average cost is given by

                                                      αµM (w, r)
                                   cM (w, r, xM ) =              + µM (w, r).
                                                        xM

As before, we denote the average cost of food by cF (w, r).

  18
      That φ is a function of the price index only (and not separately of the price of each variety) can be
seen from a two-stage optimization.
                                  ¡       It
                                          Pis  a standard    result that a consumer with second-stage budget φI for
                                             n        1−ε ¢
manufactures consumes dM i = p−ε     i  /    i=1 (pi )      φI of variety i. Introducing these demands into the utility
function, yields, after some transformation, U = U (φI/P, (1 − φ)I). It is apparent that, when optimizing
this indirect utility for φ in the first stage, the consumer obtains a solution that is a function of P and I only.
  19
     Equivalently, as in Ethier (1982), we could think of this as a two-step technology: first, “factor bundles”
are produced using capital and labor with a constant-returns-to-scale technology; second, the factor bundles
are used to produce output in a linear fashion. In this version, µM (w, r) is the cost of the marginal factor
bundle input. Furthermore, the technology specifies that α times this marginal factor bundle input is used
up at the beginning of production, resulting in the fixed cost αµM (w, r). In other words, output is linear in
factor bundles, with a positive horizontal intercept and a positive slope.


                                                          21
    Profit maximization equates marginal revenue to marginal cost:

where p stands for the price of a representative variety, and we use the well-known approx-

imation (exact in the limit of infinite varieties) that the elasticity of substitution between

varieties (ε) is the elasticity of demand for each one.20

    Free entry in manufactures implies that price equals average cost:


                                            p = cM (w, r, xM ).                                            (6)


    The last three equations imply:
                                        ·     ¸ ·      ¸−1
                                            1      α
                                         1−    =     +1    ,
                                            ε     xM

which in turn gives us:

                                              x∗M = (ε − 1)α.

Thus, the equilibrium output of each variety is completely determined by the parameters ε

and α.

    There is also a zero-profit condition for food:


                                               cF (w, r) = 1.                                              (7)



    Note that the zero profit equations (6) and (7) essentially reproduce their counterparts

in the previous section (equation 1). In particular, the dependence of equation (6) on xM

can be ignored, since xM is fixed by the parameters of the model. We can therefore recover

 20
    This approximation holds in our setting as well due to the separability of the utility function in food and
manufactures, which in turn allows for two-stage budgeting.

the derivation of the Stolper-Samuelson results from the previous section (equation 3). The

crucial step in that derivation was Shepard’s lemma, which does not require constant returns

to scale.

   We can now write the resource constraints for the economy:

                     LM (w(p), r(p))      LF (w(p), r(p))
                                     CM +                 CF                    = 1,
                           L                    L

                                                                                                  (8)

                    KM (w(p), r(p))      KF (w(p), r(p))
                                    CM +                 CF                     = 1,
                         K                    K

where we recall that L and K denote the economy’s labor and capital endowments; LF ,

KF are unit labor and capital inputs in food; while Ci denotes total consumption (and

production) of good i. Here, LM and KM are the unit factor inputs in the typical variety

of manufactures at xM = x∗M . As we shall see, equation (8) defines a relationship between p

and n.

   We obtain another relationship between p and n, based on demand. Noting that, in the

                          p
symmetric case, P =       1    , we can write:
                      n   −1

where the first equality defines DM (p, n, σ), the total demand for one variety of manufactures.

   The next lemma establishes under which circumstances equation (8) defines a direct

relation, and equation (9) defines an inverse relation, between p and n.


      Lemma 3. Equation (8) defines an increasing relation between p and n. Equa-




                                                         23
      tion (9) defines a decreasing relation between p and n21 if the following two

      conditions hold for any I J , p and n:

            P dφ        P dI J
      (i)   φ dP   +   I J dP
                                 < 1 (for fixed n).

                ∂φ
      (ii) − Pφ ∂P < ε − 1.

      Proof: We first show that, given fixed parameters in the model, equation (8)

      is a relationship only between p and n. Note that the total consumption of
                                                 Pn
      manufactures is given by CM =               i=1 DM    = n x∗M , where x∗M is fully determined

      by α and ε. We assume as before that equations (6) and (7) can be inverted

      to yield w and r as a function of p. Therefore, the only endogenous variables

      in equation (8) are p, n and CF . Using (in principle) one of the equations to

      substitute CF out, we would get a relationship between p and n. To show that this

      is an increasing relationship between p and n, we first write the total derivatives

      of the unit factor inputs with respect to price:

                                 dLi       ∂Li         ∂Li
                                       =       w´(p) +     r´(p) > 0,
                                 dp        ∂w (−)      ∂r (+)
                                           (−)         (+)



                             dKi           ∂Ki         ∂Ki
                                       =       w´(p) +     r´(p) < 0, i = M, F
                              dp           ∂w (−)       ∂r (+)
                                           (+)          (−)

      Suppose that p increases in equation (8). This increases the Li ’s and decreases

      the Ki ’s, forcing CM and CF to adjust to recover equality. Note that, in the

      resource constraint for labor (top line), the weight on CM is a relatively small

      number, while the weight on CF is a relatively large number, compared to the

  21
     This is the same condition in Helpman and Krugman (1985) that says that the combinations of p and n
are such that the share of food in spending is equal to its share in gross domestic product.


                                                       24
      weights on CM and CF in the constraint for capital (bottom line). Therefore, the

      only way to decrease the top line, while increasing the bottom line, is to increase

      CM = n x∗M and decrease CF .22 Since x∗M is determined by α and ε, the increase

      in p leads to an increase in the number of varieties n.

      We can analogously see that equation (9) is a relationship only between the two

      endogenous variables: p and n. Next, we show that condition (i) implies that

      the middle term decreases with p, at constant n. A suﬃcient condition is that

      it does so for any consumer (rich or poor). Rewrite the demand of the rich as
      φ(P,I R )I R
       P nε/(ε−1)
                   ,   and let us increase p without changing n. We need to show that
      φ(P,I R )I R
          P            decreases (and analogously for the poor). This is formally analogous

      to lemma 2, and therefore it is not surprising that the suﬃcient condition (whose

      more rigorous proof is straightforward) also looks formally the same, except that

      it has P instead of p.

      Therefore, to establish that equation (9) defines a decreasing relation between p

      and n, it suﬃces to prove that the middle term decreases with n, at constant

      p. Again, it will be suﬃcient that it does so for any consumer. For the rich, for
                                      µ µ            ¶ ¶
                                    ∂        p     R
      example, it is suﬃcient that ∂n φ       1 ,I    /n < 0. It is straightforward to

      show that this condition is implied by condition (ii).


    The intuition for the suﬃcient conditions in lemma 3 is as follows. First, we expect that

  22
     For a more analytical proof, it suﬃces to multiply the top and bottom line of equations (8) by L and
K, respectively, then to total diﬀerentiate the resulting expressions with respect to p, which after use of
Cramer’s rule and simplification yields: (KM LF − KF LM )dCM /dp = −CF LF dKF /dp − CM LF dKM /dp +
CF KF dLF /dp + CM KF dLM /dp, which is a positive expression, given how the Ki ’s and Li ’s change with p.
Since KM LF − KF LM > 0, by virtue of manufactures being the capital-intensive good, dCM /dp > 0.



                                                    25
when the price of manufactures goes up (at fixed n), demand for them goes down. Condition

(i) in the lemma ensures this, and it plays a role analogous to the condition in lemma 2.

   On the other hand, if the number of varieties increases (at fixed p), we also expect the

demand for each variety to decrease, which is guaranteed by condition (ii). It is possible,

however, that consumers increase their consumption of each variety as n goes up, if the

following two conditions hold. First, consumers’ response to the decrease in the price index

                                    ∂φ
needs to be very strong, that is,   ∂P   needs to be negative and large. Note that P decreases as

n increases, which by itself makes consumers increase consumption of all varieties combined.

Second, the elasticity of substitution between varieties needs to be very small (ε very close

to 1), which makes consumers less inclined to substitute away from the original varieties, as

n increases. These conditions would tend to generate the unintuitive result that as n goes

up, consumers demand more of each variety. They also tend to violate suﬃcient condition

(ii) in the lemma, which therefore is there simply to rule out this unintuitive possibility.

   In sum, as before, the suﬃcient conditions in the previous lemma ensure that the dis-

tributional and demand considerations in this paper are not so strong as to overturn the

standard results, but simply add to them.

   The relationship established by the resource constraints (equation 8) is captured by the

R curve in figure 4, while the D curve depicts the relationship based on demand (equation

9). The point of intersection between the R and the D curves gives us the equilibrium p∗

and n∗ .

   An increase in the inequality parameter σ increases demand for manufactures (that is,




                                                  26
the middle term in equation 9) for given p and n.23 This means that for a given p, a larger

n is needed for markets to clear, shifting the D curve to the right (to D’). As a result of this

increase in inequality, the equilibrium p∗ and n∗ are higher, and Stolper-Samuelson eﬀects

lead to an increase in the rental price r and a reduction in the wage w, which as in the

previous section further worsens income inequality.


       B. Trade when countries diﬀer only in inequality

       Next, we look at the eﬀect of the integration of two identical economies with the same

factor endowments, preferences and inequality. This doubles the size of the economy. Both

capital and labor are doubled, which in turn implies that for any given p the number of

varieties n consistent with full employment of factors is double of its original value (see

equation 8, and recall that CM = nx∗M ). Thus, the R curve shifts to the right in such a

way that n doubles for any given p. When preferences are homothetic, and more specifically

Cobb-Douglas in manufactures and food, the total expenditure on all varieties for a given

price of the representative variety does not depend on the number of varieties. In that case,

n corresponding to each p on the new D curve would be double of that on the old D curve.

However, with nonhomothetic preferences, we can show that the number of varieties n on

the new D curve more than doubles.24

       We depict in figure 5 the integrated world economy, in which we again allow only inequal-

  23
                                                                   £ ¡              ¢¤
     With fixed p and n, P is fixed, and the expression φ(P, I J )/ p 1 − φ(P, I J ) , which is the ratio of
manufactures to food consumption for type J = R, P, can only change as I J changes with σ . We can use
the proof of lemma 2 to show that when σ increases, demand for manufactures increases with σ.
  24
     When we integrate two identical economies, DM (p, n, σ) in equation (9) doubles at fixed p and n, as the
numerator now has two extra terms identical to the two terms shown. At fixed p, suppose that n doubles.
DM (p, n, σ) goes down, as guaranteed by the proof of lemma 3, but by less than one half. (If the numerator
were constant, DM (p, n, σ) would decrease in half. However the numerator does go up with n.) Therefore n
must increase by more than double, to bring DM (p, n, σ) further down, and equate it with x∗M .



                                                     27
ity to diﬀer between the two countries. Because of lower inequality in the East, the East’s D

curve (labeled D(E)) lies to the left of the West’s (labeled D(W)). On the other had, the two

countries’ R curves (labeled R(E) and R(W), respectively) are the same. Next we draw the

D and R curves for an East with twice the size (labeled 2E) and a West with twice the size

(labeled 2W). As discussed above, when we double the size of the economies, the D curves

more than double, while the R curves are exactly doubled. The combined D and R curves

for the integrated world composed of a West and an East are given by D(W+E), which lies

between D(2W) and D(2E), and R(W+E)=R(2W)=R(2E), respectively.

   In the figure, the number of varieties n∗ more than doubles, compared to the autarky

level for the East, while it is less than double for the West. It is easy to see that an increase

in asset inequality in any one of the two countries shifts the D(W+E) to the right, thereby

increasing p. The rental r increases and w decreases, increasing the overall income inequality

in both countries, as in the previous section. The number of varieties produced in both

countries goes up.

                              E nW of manufactures, and imports D W nE . We will let the
   The West exports a volume DM                                  M

                                                  E is the total demand for one variety, as
superscripts denote either country. For example, DM

defined by equation (9), but from consumers in the East only. nE is the number of varieties

produced in the East. Thus, n = nE + nW , and DM
                                               E + D W = x∗ . Taking into account that
                                                    M     M

nE = nW = n/2 (since the two countries’ R curves are the same and both countries face the

same price of a representative variety), the total flow of trade in manufactures can therefore

be written:

                                        M f g = nx∗M /2.



                                               28
This increases with the inequality of either country (as n increases both with σ E and σ W ).

       When the West is a net importer of manufactures (which is the case when the West

is more unequal but has the same factor endowments as the East), inter-industry trade

          W nE − D E nW ), in units of M . Again taking into account that in this case
equals 2(DM       M

nE = nW = n/2, this equals:
                                               ¡ W       ¢
                                        Inter = 2DM − x∗M n.

              ¡ W       ¢
By assumption, 2DM − x∗M > 0, with the equality sign holding when σ E = σ W , since in

                                                                                1
that case the two countries are identical. In the relevant range                2   ≤ σ E ≤ σ W ≤ 1, the

                                                           W and n increase with σ W .25 The
volume of inter-industry trade increases with σ W , since DM

relationship between this volume and σ E is ambiguous, since while n increases with σ E , DM
                                                                                           W


decreases.

       The volume of intra-industry trade is simply twice the West’s exports in manufactures

and can thus be written as

                                                       E
                                              Intra = DM n.


This is the part of trade that is balanced within the manufacturing sector. Clearly, both

 E and n increase with σ E . Therefore, the volume of intra-industry trade increases with
DM

the inequality of the less unequal country. With respect to σ W , DM
                                                                   E is decreasing but n


is increasing, and therefore the impact of the inequality of the more unequal country on

intra-industry trade is ambiguous.

  25
     Recall that DM W
                      + DME
                             = x∗M where x∗M is already completely determined by α and ε. When we change
 W                                     W                                     E
σ , it is best to check the change in DM  indirectly, through the change in DM , since in that case inequality
                                                 dDMW      ¡ E      ¢¡      W
                                                                              ¢ ¡ E          ¢¡         ¢
does not change in the East. Thus, we can write dσW = − ∂DM /∂p dp/dσ           − ∂DM /∂n dn/dσ W > 0.
                                                                    (−)                     (−)
In other words, demand for one variety in the East goes down because of higher number of varieties and higher
prices, while the increase in σW insures that demand in the West goes up.



                                                     29
   In spite of the ambiguities noted above for both inter- and intra-industry trade, we find

that there is no ambiguity in their ratio, which we write as:



                                  ¡ W       ¢
                     Inter/Intra = 2DM         E
                                       − x∗M /DM    W
                                                 = DM   E
                                                      /DM − 1.                            (10)


   This is clearly increasing with respect to σ W and is decreasing with σ E , assuming σ E <

σW .

   From this analysis, we can describe trade between any two countries A and B that

are identical in all respects other than inequality, with the aid of figure 6. Measuring the

inequality of country A along the horizontal axis, and holding B’s inequality constant, the

volume of intra-industry trade is increasing in σ A until σ A = σ B , beyond which the curve

can take any shape. The volume of inter-industry trade reaches a minimum of zero when

σ A = σ B , and increases once σ A crosses that point. When σ A < σ B , we can argue by

continuity that inter-industry trade must decrease with σ A in the neighborhood of σ B , but

outside that neighborhood it can take any shape, as shown. We also see that the ratio of inter-

industry to intra-industry trade (and therefore to total trade) has a V-shaped relationship

with inequality, reaching a minimum when the two trading partners have the same inequality.

Thus intra-industry trade as a proportion of total trade is high when the trading partners

are similar in this respect.

   The following proposition summarizes the discussion above.

Proposition 5 Countries that are the same in all respects, but diﬀer in their levels of asset
inequality, engage in both inter- and intra-industry trade when they open up. An increase in
any country’s asset inequality always leads to an increase in the volume of trade in varieties
within the manufacturing sector, and to an increase in the relative price of a representative
variety (and thus to an increase in the rental price and a reduction in the wage). Inter-
industry trade increases with a country’s inequality, as long as it is greater than the partner


                                              30
country’s inequality; while intra-industry trade increases with a country’s inequality, as long
as it is less than the partner country’s inequality. The ratio of inter-industry to intra-industry
trade has a V-shaped relationship with respect to a country’s inequality, reaching a minimum
of zero when it equals its trading partner’s inequality, in which case all trade is intra-industry.
Intra-industry trade as a proportion of total trade is high when trading partners are very
similar in their asset inequality.




   C. Trade when countries diﬀer both in factor endowments and inequality

   We now look at trade between two countries that diﬀer from each other both in inequality

and factor endowments. We assume the West to be more unequal as well as more capital-

abundant than the East. Our expressions for inter- and intra-industry trade now become

the following:

                           ¯ W E        ¯
                 Inter = 2 ¯DM      E W¯
                               n − DM                    W E
                                      n , Intra = 2 Min[DM      E W
                                                           n , DM n ].


Note that depending on the result of the opposing eﬀects of higher inequality and higher

capital abundance, the West can be a net exporter or importer of manufactures and therefore,

the ratio of inter- to intra-industry trade in this case is given by

                              W E     E W              W E    E W
             Inter/Intra = [(DM n )/(DM n )] − 1 when DM n ≥ DM n

                                 E W     W E              W E    E W
                            = [(DM n )/(DM n )] − 1 when DM n < DM n .


                                                                        W /D E is increasing
It is easy to see, as in the case of identical factor endowments, that DM   M

with respect to σ W , and decreasing with σ E . If we assume that the two countries have the

same endowments of labor but the West has more capital than the East, it is straightforward

to obtain from the solution to the resource-constraint equations that

                                    nE   kE − kF (p)
                                       =             < 1,
                                    nW   kW − kF (p)

                                                31
where k i (i = E, W ) is the ratio of capital to labor endowment in country i. kF is the capital-

labor ratio used in the production of food and it is the same for the two countries, due to

the common relative price that they face under free trade. Thus, we have
                     ³ E´
                   ∂ nnW       kF´(p)(kE − kW ) ∂p
                            =                        > 0, for i = E, W.
                     ∂σ i       (kW − kF (p))2 ∂σ i

In words, an increase of inequality anywhere induces an increase in total number of varieties

n = nE + nW . Since nE < nW , the proportional increase is larger for nE .

                                                                     W nE ≥ D E nW ,
   Thus when the West is a net importer of manufactures, i.e., when DM       M

the ratio of inter- to intra-industry trade is clearly increasing in the inequality of the West.

However, in this case, the eﬀect with respect to the inequality of the East turns out to be

ambiguous. If the eﬀect on relative demand per variety (DM W /D E ) dominates the eﬀect on
                                                                M
                                ³ E´
the relative output of varieties nnW in the two countries, we clearly recover the V-shaped

curve we saw above. Given that the latter eﬀect is zero in the identical factor endowment case,

we should expect by continuity that, for suﬃciently small relative endowment diﬀerences,

the former eﬀect dominates and the V-shaped relationship again obtains. This is confirmed

by our simulations described below.
                                                                   ·³                       ´    ε    ¸1/2
                                                                     Pn               ε−1       ε−1
   We assume for the simulations a utility function given by U =         i=1 (dMi )
                                                                                       ε                     +

log dF , where we pick ε = 3. Furthermore, we make α = 2 in the cost function for manu-

factures, that is, the first two units produced are thrown away. The average variable cost is

constant and is based on a Cobb-Douglas production with output elasticities with respect to

capital and labor equal to 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Food is produced under constant returns

to scale using a Cobb-Douglas production function with output elasticities with respect to

labor and capital of 0.5 each. The labor endowments in each country are held at 1000 units

                                               32
throughout.

    As seen in figure 7 (lower left panel), the ratio of inter- to intra- industry trade is again

V-shaped with respect to country B’s inequality, holding constant the capital stocks of the

two countries and inequality in country A (whose values are shown). Increasing country B’s

capital stock shifts the entire curve to the right. This means that if we concentrate just

on the downward sloping branch (or exclusively on the upward sloping branch) of the V, a

given value of the inter/intra ratio for a higher value of country B’s capital stock requires

a higher level of B’s inequality. This can be seen directly by plotting the inter/intra ratio

as it changes with KB at fixed values of σ B , which is shown on the lower right panel. The

relationship is again V-shaped and the entire graph shifts to the right as a result of increases

in σ B .

    This positive relationship between KB and σ B for given inter/intra ratio is shown in the

top panel of the figure. It plots the level sets corresponding to a three-dimensional plot of the

inter/intra ratio with respect to σ B on the horizontal axis and KB on the vertical axis. Level

sets that are further away from the inequality and capital-endowment combination of country

A (σ A , KA ) show increasing amounts of inter-industry trade. Thus, the three-dimensional

plot would be a valley stretching from the Southwest to the Northeast. The intuition behind

the upward sloping level sets is simple: while consumption of manufactures relative to food

increases with inequality (at a given price), production of manufactures relative to food is

positively dependent on capital abundance (also at a given price). Moreover, inter-industry

trade is positively related to the divergence between the two and therefore to maintain a

constant level of intra-industry trade relative to overall trade, some measure of this divergence



                                               33
should be maintained. This, in turn, requires that as inequality increases, capital abundance

must increase. Finally, note that for each value of the inter/intra ratio there are two level

sets, one to right of the point representing country A and another to its left. In one case,

country A is the net exporter of manufactures and in the other case, it is the net importer.

    Another interesting aspect of the simulations, which can be easily seen from figure 7,

is that a pair of countries with larger diﬀerences in factor endowments can have a smaller

ratio of inter-industry to overall trade than a country pair which is more similar in factor

endowments than the first. Furthermore, in the extreme case at the bottom of the valley

(that is, on the level curve that passes through σ A , KA ), two countries with diﬀerent factor

endowments do not have any inter-industry trade at all.


4    Implications for Trade Theory and Future Research

We incorporate demand-side considerations into the theory of international trade, by focus-

ing on the role of inequality in the determination of trade flows and patterns. This requires

a model with nonhomothetic preferences, and we begin this concluding section by summa-

rizing how the standard 2 x 2 model of international trade is amended when preferences are

nonhomothetic.

    Inequality as a determinant of trade. When all else is equal (namely factor endowments

and technology), countries trade, and gain from trading, if their degrees of inequality are

diﬀerent. We get the exact opposite of the standard reason for trade: the gains from trade

are due to specialization in consumption, not in production.

    Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. When all else is the same, the most equal country exports

the luxury, and imports the necessity. If the luxury good is capital-intensive, then the most


                                              34
equal country exports capital services. When there are diﬀerences in factor endowments,

diﬀerences in inequality (and therefore diﬀerences in demand) interact with the standard

Heckscher-Ohlin diﬀerences in supply, to define a generalized comparative advantage.

   International transmission of redistributive policies. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem can

be used to prove a new result: a redistributive policy in one country has, through demand

eﬀects and their impact on factor prices, an eﬀect in the same direction in the other country.

   Missing trade. The interaction between demand-eﬀects (the impact of inequality on

comparative advantage) and supply-eﬀects (the impact of factor endowments on comparative

advantage) may lead to over- or under-predictions in the volume of trade.

   In the second model in this paper, we change the nature of “manufactures” to being dif-

ferentiated and produced under increasing returns and monopolistic competition. Perhaps

the most novel result is the V-shaped relationship between the ratio of inter- to intra-industry

trade and a country’s inequality. This ratio reaches a minimum of zero when the two coun-

tries’ inequality levels are the same (in which case all trade is intra-industry). Thus we can

restate Linder’s proposition more precisely and accurately than Linder himself: Intra-industry

trade as a proportion of total trade is increasing in the similarity of trading countries, with

“similarity” defined to include similarity in asset distribution. We provide further precision

to Linder’s conjecture by looking simultaneously at the role of international diﬀerences in

inequality and factor endowments in the determination of inter- versus intra-industry trade.

   We mention briefly some implications of this paper for future research.

   First, and most obviously, the assertion that inequality is a determinant of trade is an

empirically verifiable hypothesis. Such an empirical application is a project already under



                                              35
way (see Dalgin, Mitra and Trindade 2003). An additional application would be to check

the role of inequality more specifically on inter- versus intra-industry trade.

       Second, our results may have a bearing on the trade and wages literature, and specifically

on the factor content approach. With the assumption that luxuries are the capital-intensive

good, the most unequal country (the West) tends to import capital services. If the factor

content of trade were perfectly measured, this would not be a problem. However, one needs

to realize that what constitutes an “industry” is always the result of the aggregation of

more finely-defined industries. Assume complete specialization among these sub-industries,

such that some are exportables, and some are importables, in the West. Because the former

tend to be more labor-intensive, when one uses the input-output matrix to estimate the labor

input for the aggregate industry in the West, one over-estimates the labor content of imports,

and under-estimates their capital-content.26 A careful empirical analysis of the impact of

international trade on wages that takes demand eﬀects into account - of which the story

above is only an example - is still lacking.

       Third, a dynamic version of our model may generate interesting results. Take Mani’s

(2001) paper, which also uses the working assumptions that tastes are nonhomothetic and

necessities are (low-skilled) labor intensive. In her model, an initial high level of inequality

reduces the demand for (low-skilled) labor, thereby perpetuating the inequality level. Con-

versely, an initial lower level of inequality may produce a virtuous cycle that further reduces

the inequality. In the context of an open economy model, one result is that one country’s

redistributive policies may have a permanent impact on the inequality in its trading partner.

  26
     An analogous, and more detailed, reasoning may be found in Davis and Weinstein (2001), on which this
discussion was inspired.



                                                   36
Furthermore, any changes in factor rewards change the relative incentives for factor accumu-

lation, with potentially important consequences for (standard) comparative advantage, and

for the composition of trade.27

      Fourth, we already noted, based on the results in lemma 1, that the rich and the poor

in one country may have the same or diﬀerent preference orderings over the terms of trade,

depending on the level of inequality. This may have implications for political economy. If,

for instance, the preference orderings of the rich and the poor in the West are diﬀerent, but

they are the same in the East, the two countries may have diﬀerent negotiating power in an

international setting.

      One last application may be for taxation policy.28 When both capital and labor are

taxed, there are two ways to enact a regressive distribution policy. The first is the policy

assumed in the main text: a transfer of assets from the poor to the rich, or, equivalently, a

transfer of income. The second would be a lower tax on capital, and a higher tax on labor,

which impacts the relative income of the rich and the poor through factor rewards. The

question then is whether the rich or the poor prefer one or the other mechanism. In the open

economy, one could ask the same question of the rich and the poor in the other country.
