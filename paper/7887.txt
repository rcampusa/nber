I.      Introduction
     Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of
information technology (IT) in service organizations. As this phenomenon is often cited
as a driver of both economy-wide productivity growth and changes in wage inequality, a
wide range of public policies depend on the productivity impact of IT and on the channels
through which IT affects productivity (Summers, 2000).
     Unfortunately, the benefits arising from the use of IT in service organizations have
been notoriously difficult to measure, for several interrelated reasons (Griliches, 1994;
Bresnahan and Gordon, 1997). First, IT often provides benefits through improvements in
timeliness (for example, IT provides quick access to individual account information as
well as information about products offered by an organization) and precision (products or
information provided by the organization may be customized to individuals). While such
quality improvements may be reflected indirectly in economic quantities such as rising
wages or increased willingness-to-pay for services (factors which may be confounded
with price inflation in the context of productivity measurement), few studies provide
direct evidence about the role of IT in increasing service sector productivity.
     Second, IT is a ‚Äúgeneral purpose‚Äù technology, and the productivity benefits from IT
vary enormously, according to the specific application and the characteristics of the
adopting organization (David, 1990; Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Helpman and
Trajtenberg, 1998). Without detailed data about the types and uses of IT, studies of the
effects of IT must aggregate over applications where IT has widely different costs and
benefits, making it difficult to draw policy conclusions.1 Even when detailed data is
available, productivity estimates based on cross-sectional variation in IT use may be
difficult to interpret. For example, organizations employing higher levels of IT may be
those who receive higher returns from adopting IT or are otherwise more productive for
reasons unobserved to the econometrician, resulting in an overestimate of the average
benefits arising from IT adoption (Dinardo and Pischke, 1997; Athey and Stern, 1998).
     Third, a variety of theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that IT adoption rarely
occurs without related, potentially complementary changes in job design and human



1
 For example, see Brynjolffson and Hitt (1997), Black and Lynch (1998), and Abowd and Kramarz (1999),
who confront several challenges in aggregating heterogenous types of IT in their study of the impact of IT
on wages and measured productivity growth.


                                                      1
resource practices.2 Indeed, ‚Äúskill-biased technical change‚Äù is a popular explanation for
observed changes in the wage structure;3 to evaluate the salience of this theory in a
specific application, we must establish whether the benefits to potentially skill-enhancing
design changes are increasing in IT adoption. Ignoring organizational design not only
omits a substantive and policy-relevant contributor to productivity but may also lead to
several complex biases in the productivity estimates of the separate impact of IT.4
     This paper attempts to overcome some of these challenges by examining a specific
application of IT. We conduct an empirical analysis of IT adoption and job design in
public emergency response systems, commonly referred to as 911 centers. We combine
an original survey of IT and job design in 911 centers with a unique dataset of ambulance
trips resulting from emergency phone calls, and we use the data to analyze the impact of
technology and job design on patient outcomes.5 This application has several desirable
features: (i) the form and use of IT and job design are identifiable and comparable across
different 911 centers; (ii) the productivity benefits from this service can be measured in
terms of patient health outcomes; (iii) we observe 39 changes in technology and job
design during our sample period, allowing us to compare the productivity of 911 centers
before and after adoption; and (iv) our sample period includes the middle of the diffusion
process, likely reducing the selectivity associated with the adopting population.
     In 911 centers, call-takers receive emergency telephone calls, establish each caller‚Äôs
location, and dispatch emergency personnel. Three distinct levels of technology are used
in 911 centers. With the lowest level, (‚ÄúNo 911‚Äù), citizens can only access emergency


2
  For example, Milgrom and Roberts (1990) provide a theoretical analysis of complementarity between
information technology and organizational design, while David (1991) suggests that complementarity
between IT and organizational design is a primary reason why the measured productivity benefits to IT
were so low throughout the 1970s and 1980s. See also Bresnahan and Greenstein (1997), who find that
newer types of IT are adopted more slowly by firms with higher adjustment costs; Brynjolfsson and Hitt
(1997), who empirically analyze the relationship between IT and organizational design in a cross-section of
firms; and MacDuffie (1995), Pil and MacDuffie (1996), Hwang and Weil (1996), Ichniowski, Shaw, and
Prennushi (1997), and Levy et al (2000) who provide empirical evidence about the relationship between
organizational design and (typically IT-intensive) production technology in the context of specific
manufacturing industries.
3
   A number of recent papers address this hypothesis, including Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994),
Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1998), Bresnahan (1997), Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987), Kreuger (1993), and
Bartel and Sicherman (1999).
4
  See Athey and Stern (1998) for a theoretical analysis of these biases and Bartel (1997) for a discussion of
the difficulties inherent in evaluating training program productivity, even within a single organization.
5
  Athey and Stern (2000) perform preliminary cross-sectional analysis using these data, focusing only on
technology; this paper provides a much more comprehensive analysis, and further considers the effects on
health outcomes of changes in both IT and job design over time.

services by locating and calling the 7-digit telephone number for the appropriate
emergency provider. An intermediate level of technology permits access to emergency
services by calling 9-1-1 (‚ÄúBasic 911‚Äù). The highest level of technology, Enhanced 911
(‚ÄúE911‚Äù), uses IT to automatically link digital identification from incoming telephone
calls to a database containing address and location information. Job design also varies
across 911 centers. Some centers use Emergency Medical Dispatching (EMD), in which
the call-taker follows a structured protocol to gather medical information, dispatches
ambulances according to the priority of the incident, and provides pre-arrival medical
instructions (such as instructions for CPR or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation).
     Our analysis exploits a unique dataset consisting of ambulance records associated
with (nearly) all ambulance rides resulting in emergency hospital admissions in the state
of Pennsylvania for the years of 1994 and 1996.                   In 1991, Pennsylvania enacted
legislation facilitating the adoption of both 911 technology and EMD in county 911
centers. During the period of our sample, about half of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania
adopt either a more advanced form of 911 technology or EMD, or both.6 The dataset
includes information about the location of the emergency (disaggregated to the level of
over 2000 minor civil divisions (MCD)), as well as each patient‚Äôs health status (e.g.,
blood pressure, respiration rate, pulse, and suspected illness) as recorded by ambulance
attendants upon arrival at the scene of the emergency.                  Further, the data provide
information about subsequent patient outcomes, including diagnoses, billing information
such as total charges, (short-term) mortality, and discharge information. To highlight the
impact of IT on the timeliness of service provision, we focus on cardiac emergency calls,
a group where timeliness is especially important.7
     By reducing the time between the onset of cardiac symptoms and medical
intervention, technology and EMD choices should affect patient outcomes. To assess
this, we examine the effect of technology and EMD on indicators of intermediate health
status, such as patient blood pressure, upon ambulance arrival. We further calculate a
‚Äúintermediate health index‚Äù (scaled in terms of the probability of survival) that
summarizes the health status of the patient across multiple medical indicators at the time



6
 Approximately a third of the sample adopts prior to 1994 and nearly all counties have adopted by 2000.
7
  In focusing on cardiac emergencies, we follow a number of recent studies about medical care output and
productivity measurement, such as McClellan and Newhouse (1997) and Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse
(1998). See also Triplett (1999).


                                                     3
of ambulance arrival.8 Since health status is sensitive to response time in the case of
cardiac emergencies, the use of this measure allows us to infer the impact of IT and EMD
through increased timeliness in emergency response. In addition to employing these
measures of health as recorded at the scene of an emergency, we also analyze subsequent
patient outcomes such as mortality and total hospital charges.
     Using these measures, we evaluate the gains realized by counties who adopt during
the time of our sample (in terms of improvements from the pre-adoption levels) and
compare these gains to the productivity trend experienced by all the counties in
Pennsylvania. To account for heterogeneity within counties in terms of infrastructure,
availability and quality of ambulance services, and geography, we include either detailed
controls or fixed effects for each of the (on average) 30 MCDs within each county. Our
approach can thus be thought of as a ‚Äúdifferences-in-differences‚Äù estimator measuring the
average effect of the 39 county-level 911 changes in technology or EMD observed during
our sample.       We further employ a variety of approaches to control and test for
heterogeneity across counties in terms of the marginal benefits to adopting these practices
and the productivity time trend.
     Our first set of results establish that the adoption of E911 is associated with
significant improvement in the intermediate health index. Relative to a baseline survival
rate of 96.2%, we find that E911 adoption leads to a 1% increase in the predicted survival
rate. This finding is robust to the use of alternative intermediate health status measures,
controlling for EMD adoption (for which we find no measured impact), and employing
different comparison groups to estimate the time trend.
     Second, we provide evidence that the adoption of E911 can be directly linked to
patient outcomes in the hospital, such as mortality and total charges. Of course, these
hospital outcome measures are dependent on a large number of intervening (unobserved)
factors as well as on the underlying health of patients, and so the relationship between
E911 and hospital outcomes is less precisely measured. Our estimates suggest that E911
increases short-term survival rates by about 1%. Finally, we use these estimates to
calculate the cost-effectiveness of IT in emergency response systems. Even though the
adoption of IT in 911 centers is aimed at a much wider set of emergencies than the


8
 This measure has a non-trivial association with subsequent mortality and is derived from a careful review
of the medical literature identifying the relationship between health outcomes and timely response, as
discussed in Section IV.

cardiac cases analyzed here (including police, fire, and all other medical emergencies), we
find that the benefits to be derived from E911 for cardiac patients alone may cover a
substantial fraction of adoption costs.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss the
institutional details of the pre-hospital emergency response system, describing the
adoption process and motivating our empirical approach.                    Section III describes an
economic model of emergency health care production and develops an econometric
model to guide our estimation strategy. After a discussion of the data in Section IV, in
Section V we compare the characteristics of counties that adopt higher levels of 911
technology during 1994-1996 with counties that adopt before or after our sample period.
Section VI presents productivity results. Section VII concludes.

II. Information Technology, Job Design and the Productivity of the Pre-Hospital
Emergency Response System
II.A.     Emergency Response Systems: An Overview

        An Emergency Response System, or 911 system, is a public service providing a
standardized and integrated method for local communities to respond to emergencies.
Until the late 1960‚Äôs, emergencies were reported to a telephone operator (whose training
and equipment was not specialized to emergencies) or to individual service agencies (so
that callers needed to locate the telephone number for the appropriate agency). This
system often provided inappropriate responses to emergencies (Gibson, 1977; Siler,
1988). Following a model developed in Europe after World War II, the first 911 systems
were introduced into the U.S. in 1968. These systems are almost always public.9
        While the scope and details of systems may vary, emergency response systems
typically operate according to the following standard procedure:
‚ô¶ An individual experiencing an emergency calls a local ‚Äúemergency‚Äù number, either
    911 or a designated seven-digit number.
‚ô¶ The call is answered by a call-taker, who evaluates the caller‚Äôs emergency and gathers
    necessary information (including the location and severity of the incident).
‚ô¶ The call-taker communicates with service agencies for emergency dispatch.

9
  There are a few examples where localities privatize the emergency response system. Indeed, one county
(Northampton) attempted to do this in Pennsylvania after our sample period, but this arrangement resulted
in an excessively costly system and ended with a protracted lawsuit.

‚ô¶ In some systems, the call-taker may provide additional instructions to the caller.
     In some ways, emergency response systems provide benefits that are quite different
from most private service organizations.10 But there are important similarities as well. In
particular, 911 systems resemble ‚Äúhelp desks‚Äù or customer service divisions of
corporations, where the help desk industry includes over 100,000 organizations
employing over 3 million people.11                  Indeed, industry sources12 describe the main
objectives of help desks as follows: (a) timely response by organizations to customers; (b)
provision of precise information or services, tailored to the customer‚Äôs needs; and (c)
effective allocation of scarce organizational resources in responding to customer
questions and concerns. In recent years, IT adoption has led to drastic changes in the
organization and functioning of help desks across many industries. In particular, as in
E911, IT is often used for caller identification and access to customer databases.
     Consider the objectives of timeliness, precision, and resource allocation in the
context of emergency health care. Timeliness is particularly crucial for cardiac patients:
indeed, the first component of the ‚Äúchain of survival‚Äù advocated by the American Heart
Association is early access to emergency medical services. Numerous (typically small-
sample) clinical studies suggest that the timeliness of administering medical procedures
such as CPR and defibrillation has large effects on mortality rates from an out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest.13 Until quite recently, defibrillation ‚Äì electrical shock therapy to ‚Äúreset‚Äù
the electrical activity of the heart in the case of ventricular fibrillation (irregularity) ‚Äì
required equipment which was only available on specially equipped Advanced Life
Support (ALS) ambulances, and only a trained paramedic could provide the treatment. If
paramedics and ALS ambulances are costly, there will be benefits to gathering precise
information about the nature of each emergency, so that the resources will be available
for time-sensitive emergencies and will be allocated quickly in those cases. There are

   The timeliness of response to criminal, fire, and medical emergencies can have large effects on outcomes
that may affect many individuals. Further, emergency response systems lower the cost to bystanders of
providing the public good of reporting emergencies. The use of a uniform number, 911, eliminates the need
for citizens to learn the appropriate emergency response number in every locality they visit. Finally, there
are efficiency gains to centralizing dispatching services, so that the closest available ambulance can be used.

   For example, Larsen et al (1993) find that the probability of survival falls (from a level of .33) at the rate
of .023 per minute that CPR is delayed, .011 per minute that defibrillation is delayed, and .021 per minute
that an Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulance response with a paramedic is delayed. See also Lewis et
al, 1982; Cummins et al, 1992; Bonnin, Pepe, and Clark, 1993; and Tresch, Thakur, and Hoffman, 1989.

other, indirect benefits to precision as well. For example, there are potentially large costs
(such as traffic accidents) associated with an unnecessary ‚Äúlights-and-siren‚Äù response, as
documented in a number of studies in emergency medicine (Gibson, 1977; Smith, 1988;
Brown and Sindelar, 1993).
II.B.   The Role of Information Technology and Job Design

    In contrast to many other applications where the choices about IT and job design are
difficult to compare across organizations, pre-hospital emergency response systems faced
a well-defined set of choices in the 1990s. As described in the introduction, emergency
response systems could choose between three different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of IT (No-911, Basic 911,
and E911), and they could choose to implement EMD. While there are some sources of
heterogeneity within these categories, industry participants in the 1990s recognized these
as the primary alternatives.
    No-911 systems are typically decentralized, often at the level of a municipality, and
the individual service agencies are less likely to use specialized call-taking personnel. In
this regard, No-911 can be thought of as both a technological and an organizational
choice; we use the word technology for simplicity.
    To implement a Basic 911 system, an emergency response system must install
dedicated telecommunications services for emergency callers. Basic 911 technology
reduces the time between the first awareness of a medical emergency and contact with an
emergency agency. As well, the adoption of Basic 911 often involves centralization of
emergency response (at the county rather than municipal level), increasing the efficiency
of emergency dispatching through specialization. One potential cost to centralization is
that call-takers may not be familiar with distant areas, resulting in potential efficiency and
precision losses. All Pennsylvania call-takers in Basic (or Enhanced) 911 centers must,
by law, receive a minimal level of (fairly) standardized training. Basic 911 may also
facilitate the adoption of several related technologies, such as Automatic Number
Identification and automatic call recording.
    E911 was introduced during the 1980s, and the technology is marketed to emergency
response systems by a number of vendors, including several large telecommunication
companies (such as the Bell companies, Sprint, and GTE). To implement the Automatic
Location Identification features (‚ÄúALI‚Äù) of E911, counties must first develop a system of
addressing which provides unique street addresses to every residence (which often do not
exist in rural areas) and develop a map of the county with all of these addresses. The


                                                7
databases include precise information about the location of a telephone in a building or
public place, and they can also include information about individual health issues or
disabilities.
     There are a number of benefits to E911 technology. First, even when the caller
knows the location and directions precisely, it takes time to communicate this
information, and mistakes are easy to make with callers who are experiencing panic or
fear. The location information is especially useful for callers who are children, adults
who do not speak English or are unable to speak, or for cases where people do not know
their exact address or directions (the address may be ambiguous in rural areas, or they
may be away from home). Furthermore, when address information is communicated
instantaneously, the call taker has more time to gather information about the severity of
the emergency and provide pre-arrival instructions to the caller. Finally, this system
mitigates some of the costs of centralizing the call centers, since detailed geographic
knowledge of an area is not essential.
     An additional benefit associated with E911 may be in facilitating ambulance
dispatch. The mapping system associated with E911 can be used to coordinate with
ambulance dispatchers and identify the nearest ambulance.                   Further, E911 adoption
lowers the costs of closely related technologies, such as computer-aided dispatch. In
another example, E911 technology facilitates the provision of private emergency response
services marketed to the elderly and high-risk citizens.14
     Alongside these technology choices, emergency response systems also face a distinct
choice about job design. For medical emergencies, the low-skill job design involves
relatively unstructured call-taking, whereby the call-taker‚Äôs main responsibility is to
provide address information to ambulances. Alternatively, with EMD, call-takers use
emergency-specific ‚Äúprotocols,‚Äù summarized on a set of cards, which guide call-takers
through the process of eliciting more detailed information and providing specific
emergency medical instructions in response. The call-taker will also provide instructions
for preparing the site for ambulance arrival. These interventions have the direct benefit of
reducing the time until key medical procedures are performed. EMD may also provide
benefits in terms of precision by allowing call-takers to more accurately assess the nature


14
  For example, in some E911 counties in Pennsylvania, subscribers can access an emergency response with
wireless technology (e.g., an emergency button). These services exploit the technological features of the
E911 system to access location information directly.


                                                      8
and severity of emergencies, and so increase the likelihood of dispatching appropriate
equipment.15 Finally, distressed callers may avoid rash decisions or simply feel better if
they receive specific instructions from a knowledgeable person.
     The returns to choices about job design and technology may be interrelated. One
hypothesis is that E911 and EMD are complementary. For example, E911 automates the
collection of location information, allowing for more intensive and effective use of the
EMD protocols.          Similarly, if higher-skilled workers are required to operate the
computers, they may also be better able to implement EMD protocols. A finding of
complementarity would support the hypothesis of skill-biased technical change.16
However, an alternative hypothesis is that E911 and EMD are substitutes. Both E911 and
EMD systematize the call-taking process. EMD training may eliminate many of the
inefficiencies associated with information gathering by providing a structured protocol for
interacting with the caller.            Further, EMD allows call-takers to recognize true
emergencies very quickly, giving them top priority. A different theory, also consistent
with substitution, is that E911 automates the call-taking job, so that lower-skilled workers
can perform it. Similarly, we might also suppose that training to use the computer system
‚Äúcrowds out‚Äù time and attention for EMD training. The ambiguity present in even such a
narrow application highlights the fact that in general, it will be difficult for policy-makers
to assess a priori whether computer technology is de-skilling or pro-skilling. One goal of
this paper is to shed light on this question in a specific example.
II.C. Adoption of IT and Job Design: The Pennsylvania 1991 Public Safety Emergency
Telephone Program

     To evaluate the returns to technology and EMD, we examine the effects of these
policies on health status outcomes in Pennsylvania in the mid-1990s. One possible
approach to evaluating the benefits of these policies is to use cross-sectional analyses.
However, this approach is subject to familiar biases: for example, E911 may be adopted
more aggressively by larger counties, and county size may be correlated with the average


15
   Indeed, the stated goal of EMD is to ‚Äúensure that each caller is given the right help, in the right way, at
the right time,‚Äù (Clawson and Dernocoeur, 1998). For example, until recently, a stroke was not considered
a time-sensitive event, and EMD protocols typically called for an ambulance to be dispatched in non-
emergency mode (without lights and siren), reducing the risk of traffic accidents. Further, ALS ambulances
and paramedics can be conserved to be available for true emergencies.
16
   Athey and Stern (1999) analyze adoption patterns of 911 in a national cross-section, and they show that
the hours of training required are positively correlated with higher levels of technology, consistent with the
hypothesis that advanced levels of technology are associated with more highly skilled workers.


                                                        9
health status of individuals in the counties. An obvious alternative is to exploit time-
series variation in the level of IT and/or EMD provided by individual counties. However,
even when analyzing within-county changes, potential bias can arise if either the type of
change experienced by a county or the date of that change is related to the unobserved
incremental returns to the change. For example, the counties that switch between two
particular systems may have especially high idiosyncratic benefits to doing so, relative to
adopting a different system; further, counties with higher returns may adopt sooner.
Although we cannot circumvent these problems altogether, the time period we chose to
study has several features that make it more likely that the counties that switch regimes in
our sample have returns that are close to the average level of returns.
     In late 1991, Pennsylvania passed the Public Safety Emergency Telephone Program
(‚ÄúPSETP‚Äù).       PSETP reduced the administrative costs and political impediments to
adopting both Basic 911 and E911 at the county level.17 Further, the Act substantially
reduced the monetary costs of adoption, in two distinct ways. First, the Act authorized
each county in Pennsylvania to implement a telephone tax on its residents to pay for 911
services (between $0.75 and $1.50 a resident depending on the size of the county).
Second, the Act divided the State into several EMS regions and authorized and
encouraged regional EMS coordinators to increase the level of training and skill
investment in 911 centers throughout the state.
     As of the beginning of 1993, only five counties throughout the state had implemented
both E911 and EMD; by the late 1990s, both were fairly pervasive (only one county in the
state still does not have either Basic 911 or E911 in 2000, and EMD is implemented in
over 75% of Pennsylvania‚Äôs counties). Moreover, as discussed in more detail in Section


17
   The Authorizing legislation is explicit about its goals: ‚ÄúThe act is designed to provide a toll-free
telephone number 9-1-1 for individuals within this Commonwealth to gain rapid, direct access to emergency
aid. The number shall be provided with the objective of reducing response time to situations requiring law
enforcement, fire, medical, rescue or other emergency service. The authority and responsibility for the
creation and implementation of a plan establishing, operating and maintaining adequate facilities for
answering emergency calls and dispatching a proper response to a caller‚Äôs needs shall be vested in the
county government. County governments are encouraged to develop and implement a 9-1-1 emergency
communication system that will meet the specific needs of the county and take maximum advantage of the
integration of communications equipment and personnel to minimize costs and effect a more rapid response
to emergency situations. County governments are encouraged to develop enhanced 9-1-1 system plans to
the greatest extent possible. The development of county plans that limit the number of PSAPs and dispatch
centers to the minimum necessary to meet the guideline requirements and to minimize costs to the public
shall be encouraged.‚Äù See the web site of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency at
www.state.pa.us/PA_Exec/PEMA/programs/911/chang120.htm and www.pema.pa.state.us.


                                                      10
V, the period between the beginning of 1994 and 1996 was a crucial adoption period;
over half of all counties switched either their level of technology, adopted EMD, or both,
during this period. Many of the counties who do not switch during the 1994-1996 period
either adopted in the 1991-1993 period or in the 1997-1998 period. Thus, even if the
timing of adoption relates systematically to unobserved returns, it may still be useful to
estimate the average return to adoption for counties in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of the distribution of
adoption times. Further, our results may shed light on the effects of adopting a state-wide
policy, for states with a distribution of counties similar to the middle of the distribution in
Pennsylvania.
     Since there is no central source of information about 911 and EMD adoption, we
surveyed the counties directly, conducting interviews with 911 system managers as well
as a variety of industry participants. We also examined industry publications. Although
there are some regularities in the adoption patterns of counties (documented in Section
V), our interviews supported the hypotheses that PSETP played an important role in
facilitating adoption, but that the timing of adoption was largely unrelated to the
perceived health benefits. Consider the steps required to adopt E911 (for more detail, see
Pivetta (1995)). First, counties must assign new addresses to a substantial fraction of
county residents, create new maps, and develop a computerized database. This process is
very labor-intensive, and it usually takes more than a year to complete. Moreover, re-
addressing requires coordination with local post offices and public utilities, and it further
must be approved by each municipality in a county. Prior to the passage of PSETP,
municipalities were unwilling to undertake such expenditures themselves and the county
had no specific authority to act. Furthermore, the telephone equipment, address database,
and the system of call-taker workstations must be procured and installed.
     While systematic data about the start-up costs of E911 is unavailable, based on
several cases, we estimate that a typical county has a budgeted startup cost of between $1
million and $4 million.18 Results from our prior work (Athey and Stern, 1999, 2000)
suggest that nationally, levels of 911 technology are systematically related to certain

18
   For example, consider Berks County, Pennsylvania, whose 1990 population was 336,000. Berks County
reports that the capital start-up costs of its E911 system were approximately $3 million, while annual
operating costs were over $2.3 million. Its budget comes primarily from a tax on telephone lines ($.97 per
line each month) as authorized by PSETP. The Berks County 911 program employs nine call-takers, two
administrators, a programmer for its computer-aided dispatching software, and an administrative assistant,
which is slightly larger than the average call center in the state according to our interviews in March 2000.
For further information, see the Berks County, PA 911 web site at http://www.readingpa.com/911/.)


                                                       11
county characteristics. In particular, the observed patterns suggest that (fixed) adoption
costs play an important role in determining 911 levels.19
     Our interviews suggest that a number factors contributed to the timing of adoption for
Pennsylvania counties.          In several cases, there were unexpected delays in receiving
approval from townships for the new address assignments.20 In other cases, individual
municipalities or local police departments attempted to block 911 adoption, so that they
could retain local control (and presumably employment) of call-takers. Finally, scale
economies seemed to play a central role in determining the very first and very last
adopters, outside our sample period,21 but size and other demographic factors were less
important in determining the order of adoption for the remaining counties.
     In terms of EMD adoption, several EMD vendors responded to the statewide training
initiatives, which were implemented at the level of the EMS region, by focusing
marketing efforts on one EMS region at a time. For example, more than half of the
counties in Regions 1 and 4 adopted EMD relatively early in our sample period, although
these two regions have otherwise quite different characteristics.22
     Finally, in our survey and in interviews with 911 system managers, we explored the
possibility that other changes in the 911 system, or the health care infrastructure, might
confound our analysis of technology adoption and EMD. One potential concern is that
counties changed their ambulance system during the sample. However, we found that
each of the following elements of the ambulance system changed for at most one county
during our sample: the number of assigned ambulances, the ambulance composition (ALS



19
   Athey and Stern (1999, 2000) performed cross-sectional analyses of 911 technology using a national
sample of about 800 911 systems in 1995 with county-wide coverage. We found that higher levels of 911
technology were associated with a larger scale (measured in terms of call volume or overall population),
consistent with the theory that fixed costs play an important role in adoption. Higher technology was also
positively correlated with higher population density, despite the fact that we might hypothesize higher
returns in rural areas, where addressing is less systematic (the costs of adoption are higher as well,
potentially reconciling this finding). Per-capita income did not play a significant role, but political factors,
such as voting patterns, did impact adoption.
20
   Such delays often involved negotiations between the municipalities and counties on peripheral issues.
For example, one respondent reported that E911 adoption was delayed over negotiations with a
municipality over the provision of state police for highway patrol.
21
   One respondent in a smaller county justified slow adoption by suggesting, ‚ÄúWhen someone has an
emergency, they know to call me! They know the number.‚Äù
22
   Region 1 is Southwest Pennsylvania (including areas surrounding Pittsburgh), while Region 4 is north-
central; these areas are very different from one another (relative to the variation in our sample) in terms of
geography and demographics, as Region 4 is less densely populated.


                                                         12
or BLS), and the ownership or organization of the system.23 A second concern is that 911
systems might have changed their overall organization at the same time that E911 was
adopted, making it difficult to separate out the role of technology.                      Indeed, while
centralization or the opening of a completely new facility is quite common among the
adoptors of Basic (five counties report that the switch from No 911 to Basic was
coincident with additional centralization), only four out of twenty-three E911 adoptors
report a centralization change during the sample period. Finally, we did not find evidence
that the call center management changed at the same time that E911 was implemented. In
the cases where a new ‚Äú911 Coordinator‚Äù was hired for the E911 system, the individual
typically began working at least six months before the E911 system went into effect.

III. The Empirical Framework
III.A. The Production Function for Health Status

     We use measures of the health status of cardiac patients to assess the productivity of
911 technology and EMD. Consider first 911 technology, where we focus on two distinct
questions. The first concerns the direct relationship between IT and response time.
When health status is used purely as a measure of timeliness, we focus on intermediate
health status measures that are observed at ambulance arrival (measures that should
deteriorate over time), without necessarily relating these measures to eventual outcomes
(although we do use survival rates to scale the measures). The second question concerns
the welfare benefits to 911 systems in terms of longer-term health outcomes. Though
these benefits accrue as a direct result of improvements in timeliness, timeliness may not
be critical for the group of patients who will die anyway.                    Further, the effects of
timeliness may be difficult to measure for patients likely to survive: the benefits may not
be apparent immediately, and longer-run outcomes are confounded by a variety of
intervening treatments.
     Guided by these concerns, we develop a simple model motivating our empirical
approach. A patient‚Äôs health status is determined by a variety of components, including
blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. Let hl denote the status of component l, l=1,..,L,


23
   While there is tremendous heterogeneity in terms of whether ambulances are public or private and in
terms of how concentrated ownership is, we found no examples of a county that switched its underlying
organization during our sample period and that also changed its 911 technology and/or EMD. As an
additional robustness check, in our empirical analysis, we calculate and control for the number of distinct
ambulances that served an MCD each quarter.


                                                      13
and let h=(h1,..,hL). The patient‚Äôs true health status is H(h). At time œÑ =0, a patient
experiences an incident involving cardiac distress. The initial severity of this incident
(taking into account the patient‚Äôs underlying health status) is determined by Œæ , where
higher values correspond to better health. The ambulance arrives at time œÑ = œÑ A . The
status of component l at time œÑ is given by hl( œÑ , œÑ A , Œæ ). Faster response time weakly
improves health status: for œÑ > œÑ A , h is nonincreasing in ambulance arrival time œÑ A ,
while hl is unaffected by œÑ A for œÑ ‚â§ œÑ A . If hl is nonincreasing in œÑ in the relevant range,
then hl( œÑ A , œÑ A , Œæ ), the status at ambulance arrival, is nonincreasing in œÑ A : when the
ambulance arrives more quickly, the patient is observed in a healthier state. While œÑ A is
unobserved within our dataset, if a 911 center adopts a technology such as E911 which is
both uncorrelated with initial severity ( Œæ ) and reduces œÑ A , then, all else equal,
E[hl( œÑ A , œÑ A , Œæ )] will be higher in counties with E911.24

     Now consider the welfare effects of 911 technology. Define the reduced-form health
status function H ( œÑ , œÑ A , Œæ ) = H(h( œÑ , œÑ A , Œæ )). Fix some time œÑ F (e.g. 48 hours after the
incident occurs). For simplicity, suppose that the value of a patient‚Äôs health status at time
œÑ F , H ( œÑ F , œÑ A , Œæ ), is a sufficient statistic for the patient‚Äôs long-term outcome. Normalize
 H so that if H ( œÑ , œÑ A , Œæ ) ‚â§0, the patient dies.
     Figure A plots H as a function of œÑ for different values of Œæ and œÑ A . The shaded
areas represent the overall health benefit to patients from faster ambulance response time.
Ideally, we would measure the welfare effect of faster response time by taking an average
(potentially weighted by the implied quality of life) of these health benefits. However,
we do not have accurate measures of health status at œÑ F . Thus, consider approximating
the welfare effect by measuring the change in the probability of survival until œÑ F .
Observe that in the figure, there are three groups of patients. For the first group, the
initial health level Œæ H is so large that, for all œÑ A in the relevant range, H ( œÑ F , œÑ A , Œæ H )>0.
For the third group, the initial health level Œæ L is so small that, for all œÑ A ,
H ( œÑ F , œÑ A , Œæ )=0. For the middle group, œÑ A affects whether or not the patient is alive at
              L

time œÑ .
       F



     The probability of survival until œÑ F is probably a conservative estimate of the
benefits of reduced response time because reduced response time improves the long-term
health outcomes of the patients who survive and because the measure assigns zero benefit

24
   As discussed below, since our empirical approach is based on changes in 911 technology rather than
cross-sectional comparisons, this assumption is stronger than required.


                                                    14
to prolonging life for patients who die before œÑ F ; however, the measure does not account
for the fact that some patients may die shortly after œÑ F . In practice, we use six-hour and
forty-eight hour mortality; the health care literature suggests that mortality rates decline
sharply over the first few hours following the incident.25 Finally, note that in practice, the
measure is confounded by the myriad interventions and treatments which occur after the
ambulance arrives, each associated with additional uncertainty.                     Thus, in evaluating
welfare benefits, it may be useful to take into account our first measure, the effect of
E911 on health status at ambulance arrival. As we noted in Section II.A, the clinical
emergency medicine literature has documented the longer-term health benefits of early
response.
     Finally, consider assessing the benefits of EMD using these measures. One benefit
of EMD is to conserve resources for true emergencies; since cardiac symptoms are high
priority, EMD may (indirectly) reduce response time. Second, EMD may have direct
health benefits, beginning at some time œÑ ‚àà (0,œÑ A ) . Although we may detect these
benefits at the time of ambulance arrival, the overall benefits of EMD probably continue
to accrue over time (similar to the effects of reducing œÑ A ). Thus, the probability of
survival until œÑ F may incorporate a greater fraction of the effect of EMD.
III.B. The Estimation Strategy

     This section formalizes our approach to estimating the effects of technology and
training on health outcomes, and it interprets the required econometric assumptions in
terms of our application. Consider the following notation, where Roman variables are
observed and Greek variables are unobserved:
     Notation      Interpretation
     (t,i,j,k)     Date t, county i ‚àà {1,.., I } , MCD j ‚àà {1,.., J i } , patient k ‚àà {1,.., K ij } .

  See, e.g., Herlitz et al (1995). We also caution that for some patients, increased short-term survival may
lead to high medical expenditures; see Meltzer (1997).

    In our sample, some counties maintain the same level of technology and training
throughout the time period, while others switch during the time period. The following
notation is used to keep track of which counties switch and the type of switching
(counties experience up to three systems in our sample, but for simplicity, here we
introduce notation for two systems only).
    Notation                       Interpretation
       sti                         Indicators for technology-EMD systems (county i, date t).
    Ai, Bi                         Technology-EMD systems experienced by county i, in order of date.
    Ri                             ‚ÄúSwitching type‚Äù of county i (the (Ai,Bi ) pair).
       di                          Switching date of county i (set arbitrarily high for non-switchers).

Using this notation, a patient‚Äôs health outcome can be written:
               yit, j ,k = f (sti , d t , xti , j ,k , z ti , j , Œæ it, j ,k , œá it ,œà it, j ) .

    Our estimation approach is based on ‚Äúdifferences-in-differences.‚Äù                              Consider the
assumptions that validate this approach. First, we decompose county quality into a time-
varying component and a fixed component, and assume that the time-varying component
is additive and constant across counties:
(A1)          œá it = ¬µi + ŒΩ t .

    In Section VI.B.4, we relax this assumption by allowing the time trend to vary with
observable characteristics of the county or MCD. A more subtle possibility is that the
time trend differs across counties, and this is correlated with the level of 911 system
chosen by the county. An indirect test of this hypothesis is that the time trend differs
across 911 systems, among the non-switching counties; we test this in Section VI.B.4.
    Now consider the relationship between the unobservables and the 911 system. Some
counties may have higher levels of response times (due to features such as geography and
infrastructure), and these may be correlated with the 911 system (for example, some
counties face political constraints that affect the provision of other public goods, and
these goods affect the average response time in the county. We allow for this possibility;
however, we assume that the incremental returns to adopting different 911 systems are




                                                                                             16
the same across counties and MCDs (i.e. E911 saves 30 seconds in every county), and
further, f is additively separable in œá it and œà i , j . Formally:

(A2)     yit, j ,k = f (sti , d t , xti , j ,k , z it , j , Œæit, j ,k ) + œà i , j + œá it

      Without (A2), our approach will identify the average returns among counties that
change their 911 systems during the sample period (which, we argue, may not be very
different from the population average in our application). Next, consider restrictions on
unobserved patient severity. We allow for the case where the 911 level or the switching
regime is correlated the average health of patients in a county; however, we assume that
any changes in patient health over time are unrelated to the switching regime. Formally:
(A3)     Œæ it, j ,k is independent of Ri and di conditional on (ci , z ti , j , xti , j ,k ) .

      Because higher levels of technology and training are more common later in the
sample, it is critical that we control for calendar time. The time trend is identified in our
sample without parametric restrictions, in part because our sample includes ‚Äúnon-
switching‚Äù counties:
(A4)     For some counties i, sti does not change with t.

      The switching dates for the counties in our sample vary continuously, so that (A4) is
not strictly necessary, but conceptually (A4) highlights the idea that the non-switching
counties serve as a ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù for the improvements over time that counties would
experience in the absence of adoption of technology or EMD.
      If unobserved county quality is correlated with the county‚Äôs system, a cross-sectional
regression will not give consistent estimates of Œ± . An obvious alternative is to use
county fixed effects. Under conditions (A1)-(A4), the average effect of changes in sti on
 yit, j ,k are identified. We refer to assumption (A1)-(A4) as ‚Äúthe assumptions of the fixed
effect model.‚Äù For estimation, we impose a linear functional form for f . The following
estimating equation is stated in terms of differences, where ‚àÜi represents the difference
between a variable and its mean value in county i, and Œ∫ i is a constant for county i:
(E)      ‚àÜ i yit, j ,k = Œ∫ i + (Œ± Bi ‚àí Œ± Ai )1{t > d i } + ‚àÜi xti , j ,k Œ≤ + ‚àÜi z ti , j Œ≥ + Œ¥ t + ‚àÜ iŒæ it, j ,k

      The functional form incorporates the implicit assumption that the benefits of
different 911 systems are constant across counties. Of course, it is possible to include and




                                                                                    17
test for interactions with observable exogenous variables.26 Another implicit restriction
of this baseline model is that there are no learning effects, which we address Section
VI.B.1 by allowing Œ± to vary with the time from the adoption date.
III.C. Hypothesis Tests

     We use the model of Section III.B for three objectives: (i) to test hypotheses about
the returns to adopting technology and training; (ii) to test assumption (A2); (iii) to test
hypotheses about the nature of the interaction between 911 technology and training.
     Number the possible systems experienced by the county using two digits, where the
first is the level of technology and the second is the EMD level. For example, 00
indicates no 911 and no EMD, 10 indicates basic 911 and no EMD, 11 indicates basic
911 and EMD, 20 indicates E911 and no EMD, etc. Suppose for the moment that no
counties have EMD. Then, the returns to technology adoption are given by the contrasts
‚àÜŒ±10 ‚â° Œ±10 ‚àí Œ± 00 and ‚àÜŒ± 20 ‚â° Œ± 20 ‚àí Œ± 00 . These contrasts are identified directly from the
estimating equation (E).
     As well, we test (A2). Recall that our sample contains three groups of counties that
switch technology: counties switch from no 911 to basic 911, from no 911 to E911, and
from basic 911 to E911. Observe that the contrast ‚àÜŒ±10 is identified by estimating (E)
using the first group (with a control group of counties that do not switch); similarly, the
second group identifies ‚àÜŒ± 20 , and the third group identifies Œ± 20 ‚àí Œ±10 ‚â° ‚àÜŒ± 20 ‚àí ‚àÜŒ±10 .
Thus, the model is over-identified with respect to the parameters of interest.                       This
suggests an initial test of the model: relax and test the cross-equation restriction on the
benefits to switching in each group of counties implied by (A2). To do so, we let ŒªB _ A
represent the contrast parameter in a county that experiences a shift from system A to
system B; the contrast parameters can be estimated using county fixed effects, analogous
to (E). Since ŒªÃÇ10 _ 00 provides an estimate of ‚àÜŒ±10 , ŒªÃÇ20 _ 00 provides an estimate of ‚àÜŒ± 20 ,
and ŒªÃÇ20 _10 provides an estimate of ‚àÜŒ± 20 ‚àí ‚àÜŒ±10 , we can simply test the hypothesis that
ŒªÀÜ20 _ 00 ‚àí ŒªÀÜ10 _ 00 = ŒªÀÜ20 _10 . Under the alternative hypothesis that different groups have
different incremental returns, and these unobserved returns are correlated with the 911




26
   More generally, the model is still identified if unobserved variables interact with the 911 switching
regime and date, so long as these variables are independent of the switching regime and date conditional on
the other observables (for example, for the case of unobserved severity, under (A3)).


                                                      18
switching regime or date, we will find ŒªÀÜ20 _ 00 ‚àí ŒªÀÜ10 _ 00 = ŒªÀÜ20 _10 only if the selection biases
that arise for each regime are exactly offsetting.27
      Next, consider the problem of identifying interaction effects between technology and
training. Recall that by definition, technology and training are complements in increasing
IHS, if and only if Œ± 21 ‚àí Œ±11 ‚â• Œ± 20 ‚àí Œ±10 , Œ± 21 ‚àí Œ± 01 ‚â• Œ± 20 ‚àí Œ± 00 , and Œ±11 ‚àí Œ± 01 ‚â• Œ±10 ‚àí Œ± 00 .
Since each term in these inequalities involves a contrast, all of the parameters required to
test for complementarity are identified from our fixed-effects model. However, despite
the fact that our identification strategy is based on within-county changes, the
identification of an interaction effect exploits both cross-sectional and time-series
variation. To see this, observe that each county in our sample experiences only two or
three systems, while each inequality involves the returns to four different systems.
Despite this, the assumptions of our fixed-effects model are sufficient to identify
estimates of the interaction effects among training and technology. Recall that (A2) rules
out unobserved incremental returns to the 911 systems (more generally, any such
unobserved incremental returns should be independent of the switching regime and date).
In that case, it is valid to compare the estimated contrast parameters across counties.

IV.      The Data
IV.A. Data Sources

      To explore the impact of IT and skill-oriented job design on health care outcomes
from the pre-hospital emergency response system, we exploit (and build upon) an unusual
dataset assembled by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Emergency Medical
Services Office (‚ÄúPA EMS‚Äù). The PA EMS dataset records detailed information for all
emergency incidents in Pennsylvania for which (a) an ambulance responded to the
emergency; (b) the dispatch resulted in a hospital admission; and (c) the ambulance
record and the hospital record, which are not directly linked at the time of hospital
admission, could be matched based on patient and incident identifying information in
both records. In a given year, the PA EMS dataset consists of over 100,000 ambulance




27
   A second alternative hypothesis is that the returns to adoption depend on the path taken (i.e. adopting
EMD first, then E911, leads to different results than proceeding in the opposite order). While we cannot
distinguish between these two hypotheses statistically, our interviews with industry participants and reading
of the industry literature lead us to believe that such path-dependence hypothesis is not likely in this
application. Thus, we focus our interpretations on the first alternative.


                                                       19
rides matched to hospital admissions (out of an annual total of approximately 1.7 million
hospital admissions in Pennsylvania). For each patient, we observe the following:
         ‚Ä¢        Incident location (the MCD) and time of day;
         ‚Ä¢        The timing and nature of emergency response (e.g., the time between
                  dispatch and arrival at the incident scene, whether the response was in
                  ‚Äúlights-and-siren‚Äù mode, the vehicle number of the ambulance, and the
                  certification level of attendants);
         ‚Ä¢        Health indicators upon the arrival of EMS workers at the incident scene
                  (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and suspected illness);
         ‚Ä¢        Post-incident arrival emergency procedures and transport (e.g., whether
                  transport to hospital is in ‚Äúlights-and-siren‚Äù mode, what treatments were
                  provided enroute to the hospital);
         ‚Ä¢        A (confidential) code for the hospital to which the patient is transported;
         ‚Ä¢        Diagnostic information at the time of hospital admission;
         ‚Ä¢        Hospital discharge and billing information (whether the admission results
                  in a fatality, charges disaggregated by type and procedure, insurance status
                  of the patient, and patient billing zip code).
     We focus the bulk of our analysis on the relationship between intermediate health
status, as measured at the incident scene, and the level of IT and EMD in the county in
which the incident occurs. To accomplish this, the PA EMS dataset is supplemented with
additional data providing information about the pre-hospital emergency response
infrastructure in each county throughout time, and demographics associated with the
county and MCD where the incident occurs.
     Specifically, we supplement the PA EMS dataset with data gathered from a
retrospective survey conducted by the authors in March, 2000 and confirmed in a follow-
up survey in July, 2000 (See Appendix C for the full ‚ÄúMIT 911 Survey‚Äù). For each
county-level emergency response agency in Pennsylvania, we identified an individual
(typically, the 911 coordinator) with knowledge of the history of technology and EMD
adoption within the county.            In nearly all cases, respondents were able to provide
information about adoption dates within a confidence interval of at most a month or so
(most were able to provide an exact ‚Äúday‚Äù in which a particular technology or training
program was ‚Äúturned on‚Äù).28               The survey results therefore provide both the 911

28
  The initiation of either a higher level of 911 technology or EMD seems to have been a pivotal event in the
history of most call centers (for a particularly riveting account, see, www.ccia.com/~lawco911/index.html);
typically, respondents provided detailed descriptions of the factors that delayed adoption (mostly political in
nature) and the perceived benefits associated with adoption.


                                                        20
technology and EMD levels associated with a given county at a given point in time in our
sample period.
     In addition, we incorporate additional data (at the zip code, MCD, hospital, and
county levels) as available from various Census Bureau publications (City and County
DataBook, Census of Governments, Gazetteer), as well as daily weather data available
from the National Climatic Data Center.
IV.B. Sample Selection

     We refine the dataset to focus on a population that allows us to highlight the
relationships between 911 technology, EMD and health care outcomes. First, we select
only patients with diagnoses of cardiac conditions (such as acute myocardial infarction,
cardiac dysrhythmias, and heart failure), for whom timeliness is particularly important.
Further, to ensure comparability across the two years and keep only ambulance rides most
likely dispatched from a 911 call center, we eliminate observations satisfying one or
more of the following criteria (our core results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of
any single group):
        ‚Ä¢        All emergencies which do not require ‚Äúlights-and-sirens‚Äù on both the
                 outgoing dispatch call and during the ambulance transport to the hospital;
        ‚Ä¢        All patients less than 20 years old and all pregnancies;
        ‚Ä¢        Transports from one medical facility to another;
        ‚Ä¢        Incidents in the two large metropolitan areas of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia
                 and Pittsburgh;29
        ‚Ä¢        Incidents where response time to the incident scene, time at the incident
                 scene, or time from the scene to the hospital is greater than one hour;
        ‚Ä¢        Incidents where less than $50 of hospital charges are incurred.
     After eliminating observations for which either the incident county is missing or one
of the key health status measures is missing, our final dataset consists of 16,725
observations, about evenly divided between 1994 and 1996.




29
   Our choice to exclude Philadelphia and Pittsburgh is motivated by the fact that (a) neither of these
municipalities experienced adoption during our sample period (and so their inclusion would only affect the
composition of the control group) and (b) it may be possible that the productivity trend in extremely dense
urban areas is significantly different than that experienced by light urban, suburban, or rural areas.


                                                      21
IV.C. Variables and Summary Statistics

     This section introduces our health status outcome measures, the emergency response
system measures, and the demographic characteristics of the sample. Table 1 provides
variable names and definitions; Table 2 reports summary statistics.

IV.C.1.     Health Status Outcome Measures

     Our analysis employs a number of different health outcome measures available from
the PA EMS dataset, which vary along two dimensions. First, our health outcome
measures differ with respect to when they are measured relative to the onset of the
emergency incident.        Following our discussion in Section III, we refer to measures
observed at the time of ambulance arrival as measures of intermediate health status, while
measures observed after hospital admission, such as mortality and hospital charges, are
referred to as hospital measures. Second, some of our measures are ‚Äúraw‚Äù indicators of
factors such as blood pressure and mortality; others are constructed, including ‚Äúhealth
indices‚Äù that aggregate the raw intermediate health status measures.
Raw Patient Health Outcome Measures
     Our raw measures of intermediate health status, recorded at the incident scene,
include systolic blood pressure (BLOOD PRESSURE), the rate of respiration
(RESPIRATION), pulse rate (PULSE), and the Glasgow coma score (GLASGOW).30
Each of these measures are consistently and unambiguously recorded in our dataset for
both sample years, and they reflect distinct components of health for cardiac patients.31
     In addition to raw measures recorded at the incident scene, we also observe several
hospital stay characteristics, including the time and date of admission and discharge, the
discharge status, and the total charges accrued by the patient. Since these data are
available only for the first hospital to which the patient is admitted, we use the hospital


30
   While the first three measures should be relatively self-explantory, the Glasgow Coma score (also
referred to as the Glasgow trauma score) is somewhat more specialized to emergency medicine. This score
ranges from 3-15 (with increasing scores indicating lower severity) and reflects patient alterness and
responsiveness along three dimensions: eye response, verbal response and motor response. For example, if
a patient exhibits no eye opening together with no verbal or motor response, the patient would receive a
score of 3, suggesting life-threatening conditions (see www.trauma.org).
31
   The PA EMS data also records several other measures which we do not exploit here, including EKG
indications and indicators of various pre-hospital treatments (defibrillation, CPR, and medications). Many
of these treatments are only available on ALS ambulances, and so may not have been available to all
patients. Because our policies of interest may affect ALS ambulance allocation, the availability of these
treatments may not be exogenous.


                                                      22
outcome data with caution. Specifically, if (a) the patient is transferred from the initial
admitting hospital to a more advanced hospital with cardiac facilities or (b) the patient if
discharged and readmitted in a short amount of time, our data will record these patients as
discharged to hospital and home, respectively, and will not provide information about
their future health outcomes.32 For this reason, in calculating hospital measures, we
restrict attention to ‚Äúmedium-term‚Äù survival: 6 HR SURVIVAL (mean = .99) and 48 HR
SURVIVAL (mean = .962). We expect that the effects of pre-hospital care may be most
pronounced during the initial hours following an incident (see, e.g., Herlitz et al (1995)),
and that such medium-term measures likely reduce the censoring biases described
above.33 Further, though recognizing the long list of caveats associated with its usage
(see Berndt, et al, 1998), we also incorporate incurred inpatient charges (TOTAL
CHARGES). Similar to previous studies which have analyzed hospital charges (e.g.,
McClellan and Newhouse, 1997), we find that the distribution of charges is extremely
skewed, with average charges just below $14,000 and a standard deviation of almost
$17,700.
Calculated Patient Health Outcome Measures
     To analyze the relationship between health status and 911 technology and job design,
we convert the raw health outcome measures described so far into a set of indices of
patient health, building on our discussion in Section III. The index (a) accounts for non-
linearities or non-monotonicities (as identified by the clinical emergency medical
literature) in the relationship between the raw measures and patient health; (b) aggregates
the individual measures into a single index which distinguishes among patients more
finely; and (c) provides an explicit link between health measures recorded at the incident
scene and patient mortality.
     The clinical emergency medical literature includes a large body of research devoted
to developing useful ‚Äúscores‚Äù of patient health based on various intermediate health status
measures. These scores are used to guide medical decision-making and to provide




32
   Indeed, in our sample, patients are about 10 times more likely to transfer if their admitting hospital does
not have facilities such as cardiac catheterization laboratories or open-heart surgery facilities. We have
completed some preliminary exploration disentangling different types of hospital discharges, discussed
further in Table 8B.
33
   Only .7% of our sample transfers to another hospital within 6 hours, while 5.3% transfers within 48 hours.


                                                        23
objective benchmarking tools for comparing different hospitals and health care systems.34
For any given scoring method, one or more health measures are categorized into ranges,
with each range being assigned a number; the score is a weighted average of these score
components. Since we have been unable to identify a single ‚Äúbest‚Äù scoring system for our
specific patient group (all cardiac diagnoses, with vital statistics measured upon
ambulance arrival), our approach is to construct several measures modeled after leading
scores designed for critical care assessment, but where our score is based on four raw
measures of intermediate health status included in our dataset.35
     We begin by creating two indicator variables based on whether a patient is in the
‚Äúlow-risk‚Äù region in terms of a single health measure: LOW-RISK BLOOD PRESSURE
(equal to 1 if systolic blood pressure is greater than 90) and LOW-RISK PULSE (equal to
1 if the pulse rate is greater than 40). While these measures are correlated with each
other, they are distinct: the correlation coefficient is only .34, and LOW RISK BP
includes more patients (the sample mean is less than .9).36
     Second, we calculate two measures of intermediate health status, HINDEX1 and
HINDEX2. In HINDEX1, we first create a set of categories for each of our four raw
health measures based on (a) the critical cut-off points for BLOOD PRESSURE,
RESPIRATION, and GLASGOW suggested by one leading scoring system (called the
Revised Trauma Score (RTS) system) and (b) employ a cut-off for PULSE used in
several alternative scoring systems.37 We then perform a probit regression of 48 HOUR
SURVIVAL on the full set of these categorical variables (reported in Appendix A).38


34
   A fair assessment of this extremely voluminous literature and the debates about the efficacy of different
scoring methods cannot be undertaken here. However, see The Medical Algorithms Project, developed by
John R. Svirbely, M.D., & M.G.Sriram, Ph.D., at www.medal.org for a survey and further references.
35
   Scores at specific diagnoses such as cardiac emergency tend to be designed for use once the patient has
arrived at the hospital; as well, while our dataset is composed of all cardiac emergencies, several scores are
tailored to more narrow indications such as cardiac arrest.
36
   We also have experimented with alternative cut-off points for these measures as well as alternative ‚Äúlow-
risk‚Äù measures using GLASGOW and RESPIRATION. For example, we used the categories suggested by
the Simplified Applied Physiology Score (SAPS) (LeGall et al, 1984, 1993); however, as with many other
scores we found, we cannot apply SAPS directly because it requires indicators of health that we do not
observe. Overall, our results are robust to variation in the specific type of health measure used in the
analysis.
37
   PULSE is not included among the measures in the RTS system. However, we found this measure to be
correlated with mortality, and alternative scoring systems did in fact use PULSE, so we chose to include it
in our analysis.
38
    Overall, the results from this mortality regression are sensible from the perspective of the clinical
literature. While there is of course a high degree of multicollinearity among the indicators, key indicators
are significant predictors of survival (e.g., CAT4(GLASGOW), CAT4(BLOOD PRESSURE) and LOW


                                                        24
HINDEX1 is calculated as the predicted value of 48 HOUR SURVIVAL from this
regression (its mean is equal to .962, equal to the sample survival probability).
     As a robustness check, we compare our results about HINDEX1 to those derived
using the RTS directly (this score is based on BLOOD PRESSURE, RESPIRATION, and
GLASGOW); although this score is not designed for cardiac patients, it has the advantage
that our data includes all of the elements required for the score.39 To make the RTS
interpretable within our sample, we first perform a probit regression of 48 HOUR
SURVIVAL on RTS (reported as well in Appendix A) and then calculate HINDEX2 as
the predicted survival probability from that regression. Thus, HINDEX2 is simply a
monotonic transformation of the RTS, scaled by the relationship between survival and
this score within our sample.
     Both HINDEX1 and HINDEX2 can be interpreted as the 48-hour survival probability
of a patient, conditional on (a) their health status at the time of the arrival of an
ambulance and (b) the patient receiving an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù level of care subsequent to the
arrival of an ambulance. Not surprisingly, given their construction, these two measures
are highly correlated with each other (.9623).
     Finally, in terms of calculating subsequent health outcome measures, we combine
our information about mortality with TOTAL CHARGES to create an indicator variable
for a POOR OUTCOME. This measure is equal to 1 if the patient dies prior to being
discharged from the hospital or if TOTAL CHARGES exceed $20,000.

IV.C.2      County-Level Emergency Response System Measures

     We divide the information technology of counties into three tiers: NO 911, BASIC
911, and E911.40 By the end of the sample 47 out of 65 counties have adopted the E911



RISK PULSE). As well, the negative coefficient on CAT3(RESPIRATION) accords with the clinical
literature‚Äôs contention that the respiration cut-off is nonmonotonic (survival is predicted to be lower for
extremely low respiration (such as in CAT1) and extremely high respiration rates (such as in CAT3). As
well, the overall explanatory power of the regression is reasonable (pseudo r-squared = .2)
39
   However, one disadvantage of the RTS is that it is designed primarily for trauma patients and so places a
relatiely high weight on GLASGOW, which accounts for patients with head trauma not affecting other vital
signs. As such, this precise measure may not be as appropriate for cardiac patients. It should be
emphasized, however, that while the use of a skewed weighting scheme may lead to a noisy measure of
health, it should not create a bias in favor of finding an impact from 911 technology and job design.
40
   In order to be classified as BASIC on a particular date, a county had to have established a dedicated 911
telecommunications service for emergency callers in their counties; in most cases, this was also associated
with ANI technology as well. In order to be classified as E911 on a particular date, a county had to have


                                                       25
technology (and comprise 78% of the observation patient-level sample). On the other
hand, 19 counties begin the sample with NO 911 (of which 5 shift to BASIC and 7 shift
to E911 between the beginning of 1994 and the end of 1996), comprising 25% of the
patient-level sample. Finally, out of the 20 counties which begin the sample at the
BASIC level, 13 of these counties adopt E911 during the sample period; along with the
counties that move from NO 911 to BASIC 911, 17% of the total sample is observed
using the BASIC technology.
     We code the job design of a given county with a dummy variable for EMD.41 Out of
43 counties that did not have EMD at the beginning of 1994, 21 of these counties adopt
EMD during the 1994-1996 sample period; the patient sample is just about evenly
divided between emergencies under EMD and those which occur without EMD.

IV.C.3     Patient Characteristics and Incident Location Demographics

     While our estimation strategy relies primarily on a differences-in-differences
approach with fixed effects for each MCD, we also employ a number of additional
controls for patient health quality and emergency infrastructure heterogeneity using
observed individual patient characteristics and incident location demographics. In terms
of patient characteristics, we observe the sex, age, and health insurance type of the
patient, and we infer their home zip codes from the zip code used for health care billing
purposes (recall that many emergencies occur in locations other than the primary
residence of the victim). Perhaps not surprisingly, the mean age of cardiac emergency
patients is relatively old (70.3) with the consequence that over two-thirds of all patients
are covered by Medicare (and less than one percent are reported as self-insured). Using
the patient billing zip code, we incorporate several zip code-specific measures available
from the U.S. Census (each of these variables is denoted with the prefix ZIP_).42
     In addition, we calculate several incident location demographics measures. These
variables differ both in terms of their level of aggregation (at the MCD level, we use the
prefix M_, while at the county level we use the prefix C_) as well as whether there is


implemented an Automatic Location Identification technology and more than 50% of the county‚Äôs addresses
needed to be successfully addressed and available to the ALI system.
41
   In order for a county to have adopted EMD by a given date, EMD training and certification must be
mandatory at the call center and one of the approved EMD protocols must be in use at the call center for
medical emergencies.
42
   For zip codes for which demographic information was not available, we use a dummy variable indicating
tht the zip code data was missing.


                                                     26
variation across time within a given geographic region.43 At both the county and MCD
level, we include a number of (relatively standard) demographics reflecting size, wealth,
and density (POPULATION, DENSITY, and PERCAP INCOME), the distribution of
which we explore in some more detail in the next section when we consider the potential
selectivity of adoption during our sample period.44 We also included daily weather data
from readings at over one hundred Pennsylvania weather stations, where each MCD is
matched with the closest weather station.
     As well, we construct additional incident location measures directly from the PA
EMS dataset. For each county and MCD, we calculate the TOTAL PATIENTS observed
in the data (i.e., the total number of emergency incidents (cardiac and otherwise) which
occur in that county or MCD during the sample period are for which an ambulance record
has been matched with a hospital admission record). Similarly, we calculate the number
of distinct ambulances serving each county or MCD, constructing both the aggregate
number (TOTAL # AMBULANCES) and the number specifically equipped with ALS
capabilities (TOTAL # ALS AMBULANCES). Further, for each MCD incident location,
we calculate the minimum distance between the geographic center of that MCD and (a)
the closest hospital (MIN HOSPITAL DISTANCE) and (a) the closest hospital with a
cardiac catheritization lab (MIN CCLAB HOSPITAL DISTANCE).45                                Finally, we
calculate time-varying incident demographics from the PA EMS dataset including
MONTHLY PATIENTS at both the MCD and COUNTY level (a measure of the number
of recorded rides in a month in an MCD) and QUARTERLY AMBULANCES, which
equals the number of distinct ambulances serving an individual county or MCD in a given
quarter.

V.      Differences Between Pre-Sample, Within-Sample, and Post-Sample Adoptors
     As discussed in Section IV, our estimation strategy evaluates the change in patient
health outcome measures in response to the adoption of 911 technology, controlling for
observable characteristics as well as the productivity time trend common to all counties
within Pennsylvania.        To validate this approach, it is important to understand how




43
   Of course, once we use fixed effects at a given level of aggregation in a regression, we can only employ
the time-varying incident location demographic variables at that level of aggregation.
44
   For MCD or county characteristics for which data is missing, we use a missing value dummy variable.
45
   We calculate these distances using the addresses in the AHA Hospital Survey for 1994 and 1996.


                                                      27
counties who adopt 911 technology within our sample period differ from those who
maintain constant levels of 911 technology within our sample.46
     Our sample offers several features that enable us to analyze the sources of differences
between switching and non-switching counties within our sample.                          First, the non-
switchers in our dataset can be usefully divided into two groups: those who adopt either
Basic or E911 technology prior to 1994 (pre-sample adoptors) and those who adopt 911
technology after 1996 (post-sample adoptors).47 Each of the three groups--within sample
adoptors, pre-sample adopters, and post-sample adopters--contains one third of the
counties. Second, there are three distinct types of switching behavior: No 911  Basic
911, No 911  E911, and Basic 911  E911.
     Table 3 presents county-level average characteristics along several dimensions of
potential heterogeneity, dividing the counties into six different ‚Äúregimes,‚Äù according to
their pre-sample technology and their adoption behavior between 1994 and 1996.48 First,
we compare the population, per capita income, and density of counties according to the
switching behavior. Counties who have adopted E911 prior to 1994 tend to have larger
populations, per capita incomes, and density.49 Beyond this distinction, there is no easily
discernible pattern among the counties. Indeed, except for the pre-sample adoptors of
E911, none of the regime-specific means are significantly different from the remainder of
the sample.50 Figure B illustrates the distribution of county population and per-capita
income by regime, showing that except for a small concentration of pre-sample E911
adoptors at the highest ranges, each regime includes counties with a wide range of
characteristics. We defer a comparison of the relative health of these different groups


46
   We also analyze the productivity of EMD; however, since we are unable to document a productivity
effect from EMD in the context of cardiac emergency health care, we focus here on technology rather than
job design in evaluting diffusion and the potential for selectivity. It should be noted, however, that pre-
sample EMD adoptors, within-sample EMD adoptors, and post-sample EMD adoptors display similar
observable characteristics.
47
   By June, 2000, all but one county in Pennsylavnia has adopted some form of 911 technology.
48
   The means in Table 3 weight each county equally; in contrast, Table 2 weights each patient equally,
implicitly placing higher overall weight on counties with a greater number of observed emergency incidents.
Also see the map in Appendix B for the timing and geographic dispersion of adoption across counties.
49
   For each of these means comparisons, we use the 5% significance level. It is useful to note, however, that
both Philadelphia and the near suburbs of Pittsburgh (two of the densest and most populous areas in
Pennsylvania) are post-sample adoptors. However, we exclude these counties for our analysis (which
would have only contributed to the control group) as we believe that the productivity of 911 technology and
EMD are likely different in these highly urbanized areas.
50
   It is useful to note, however, that among the switching population, the No 911  Basic group is both less
populous and less dense than the other two groups of adoptors.


                                                       28
until Section VI.B.3.      To address the potential concern that some pre-sample E911
adoptors are not a valid ‚Äúcontrol group‚Äù for our within-sample adoptors, we verify below
that our empirical results are robust to the exclusion of pre-sample E911 adoptors with
extreme characteristics.

VI.     Empirical Results
      Our empirical analysis proceeds in several steps, following the approach outlined in
Section III. Tables 4 and 5 present evidence about the productivity of 911 technology and
job design for intermediate health status, as measured at ambulance arrival. We then
explore several extensions, including the importance of post-adoption learning, the
possibility of interaction effects between 911 technology and job design, and the
relationship between 911 technology adoption and alternative theories of technological
diffusion. Further, we present evidence about the robustness of the results to potential
sources of bias and selectivity.         Finally, in Table 8, we analyze hospital outcome
measures, including short-term mortality and incurred hospital charges. Our main result,
robust across alternative empirical specifications, is the existence of a positive
relationship between E911 adoption and improved health care outcomes. Counties that
adopt E911 (either by itself or in conjunction with EMD) experience a significant
improvement in pre-hospital emergency response productivity, in terms of intermediate
health status as well as hospital outcomes.
VI.A. The Effects of 911 Technology and Job Design on Health Status

      As motivated in Section III.A, we begin our analysis with a single measure of health
status at ambulance arrival. Table 4 focuses on LOW RISK BLOOD PRESSURE. In the
first column, we report a simple cross-sectional OLS regression that relates the 911
technology and job design variables to this measure; not only is there no statistical
relationship between the effects of these variables,51 but the coefficients are extremely
small (and, for E911 and EMD, the point estimates are negative). The second column
employs the differences-in-differences strategy: we include a fixed effect for each county
in the sample along with an overall productivity time trend (using quarterly dummy
variables). We find a large and statistically significant relationship between E911 and



51
  Except where noted, all regressions report Huber-White standard errors; however, the key results are
robust to various clustering schemes, including county/month and mcd/month clustering (See Table 7).


                                                    29
LOW RISK BLOOD PRESSURE.52 Relative to a baseline where just over 10% of the
sample experiences a negative outcome (LOW RISK BLOOD PRESSURE = 0), the
adoption of E911 decreases this probability to just over 6%. Further, we can reject the
hypothesis that E911 offers no incremental productivity benefit over BASIC 911. This
finding is strengthened when we incorporate MCD fixed effects in (4-3),53 and additional
patient characteristic and time-varying incident location heterogeneity controls (beyond
MCD fixed effects) in (4-4). With the inclusion of these controls, the estimated effect of
E911 increases almost 20% and remains at a similar level of statistical significance. At
face value, the parameter estimate in (4-4) predicts that the probability of experiencing
blood pressure below 90 is cut in half in those counties who adopt E911 during our
sample period.
     The inclusion of the nearly 2000 MCD fixed effects significantly improves the
overall fit; in a specification test, the restriction imposed by the county-level fixed effect
model is rejected in favor of models including MCD fixed effects. As well, observe that
Table (4-4) includes a variety of controls that may mitigate the role of potentially
confounding factors. For example, we control for changes over time in the ambulance
infrastructure as well as the overall call volume experienced in the county. We also
control for daily weather at the local level, which might otherwise introduce correlation
among neighboring localities in a given time period, and could potentially confound the
time trend. Except where noted, the remainder of our empirical work on intermediate
health status employs the MCD fixed effects specification with the same set of controls.54
     The results in Table 4 are provocative; however, the LOW RISK BLOOD
PRESSURE measure is but one of several raw measures of intermediate health status.
Table 5 presents several regressions employing the same specification as in (4-4) but with


52
   Rather than employing a linear time trend, we estimate eight quarter dummies to allow for nonlinearity in
the time trend, perhaps due to the seasonality of health outcomes (and associated variation in emergency
response timeliness). It is useful to note, however, that the significance of the E911 coefficient does not
depend on the inclusion of this time trend in any form. Indeed, excluding the time trend but including
county-level or MCD fixed effects increases the size and significance of the coefficients.
53
   Recall that in Pennsylvania, MCDs are entirely contained in counties.
54
   It should be noted that relatively few of the patient characteristics and incident location demographics are
separately significant (though they are jointly significant). Notably, MALE is associated with a lower
probability of LOW RISK BLOOD PRESSURE and there is a significant negative relationship between the
percentage of black residents in a patient‚Äôs billing zip code and LOW RISK BLOOD PRESSSURE.
Interestingly, in contrast to the strong association with E911, other time-varying measures of incident
location heterogeneity (such as those related to the volume of ambulance activity as well as rain and
snowfall) are neither individually nor jointly significant.


                                                        30
alternative measures of intermediate health status (LOW RISK PULSE, HINDEX1 and
HINDEX2). Recall from Section IV.C.1 that HINDEX1 and HINDEX2 are equal to the
predicted probability of survival based on regressions of 48-hour survival on the
individual health status measures. Similar to (4-4), E911 is associated with a statistically
significant and quantitatively important effect on the LOW RISK PULSE dummy.
Relative to a .93 baseline probability of LOW RISK PULSE, E911 increases the
probability to more than .96.
    For both HINDEX measures, the specifications we report use the log-odds ratio as
                                             HINDEX i
our dependent variable ( LL HINDEX i = ln(             ) ).55   As in the earlier
                                           1 ‚àí HINDEXi
specifications, E911 is associated with a substantial increase in the expected level of each
of the health indices. In terms of the change in the probability of survival as given by our
indices, we calculate that E911 is associated with an increase in the predicted survival
probability according to HINDEX1 and HINDEX2 of .0051 and .0045, respectively.56 As
well, for all of the specifications in Table 5, both the BASIC and EMD dummies are
insignificant. The specifications include the quarterly dummy time trend, time-of-day,
incident location, and patient characteristic controls; a joint F-test for each parameter
group is included in the lower half of the table.
     Because the distributions of both HINDEX measures are concentrated near 1, and are
never less than .54, the log-odds specification still results in a skewed distribution. To
better understand the role of the functional form assumption, we also explored linear and
log-linear specifications. We find that these alternative specifications lead to greater
estimated effects of E911: for both indices, we find that E911 increases HINDEXi by at
least .0095, and the coefficients are significant at the 5% level.57




55
   By standard arguments, the log-odds transformation ensures that the domain of the dependent variable
varies freely between (‚àí‚àû, ‚àû) and that the shape of the underlying health distribution accords with the
patterns found in the biostatistics and physiology literatures (Dawson-Sanders and Trapp, 1994).
56
   This tranlates into a 13% and 11% decrease in the .038 baseline rate of mortality. Of course, these
elasticity calculations are much smaller in terms of the probability of survival and so we attempt to interpret
most of our results in terms of their predicted impact on the absolute percentage point change in the
probability of survival.
57
   In particular, the estimated coefficients (and associated standard errors) for HINDEX1 are .0095 (.0041)
in the linear specification and .0112 (.0050) when ln(HINDEX1) is the dependent variable. In the latter
case, the estimate translates into an increase in HINDEX1 of .0107. In each case, we reject the hypothesis
that BASIC=EN911 at the 1% level. The results for HINDEX2 are very similar.


                                                        31
     Finally, we perform the specification test suggested in Section III.C: we estimate a
less restrictive model, with separate coefficients for the returns to switching from No 911
to E911 ( Œª20 _ 00 ), the returns to switching from Basic 911 to E911 ( Œª20 _10 ), and the returns
to switching from No 911 to Basic 911 ( Œª10 _ 00 ). Our point estimates (with standard
errors in parentheses) are ŒªÃÇ20 _ 00 =.092 (.052), ŒªÃÇ20 _10 =.138 (.050), and ŒªÃÇ10 _ 00 =.057 (.070).
Although these estimates suggest that the returns to switching from No 911 to E911 are
‚Äútoo small‚Äù relative to the sum of the returns to the other two switches, we cannot reject
the hypothesis ŒªÀÜ10 _ 00 + ŒªÀÜ20 _10 = ŒªÀÜ20 _ 00 , consistent with our assumption that the returns to
technology adoption are similar for different counties. Furthermore, although the point
estimate of Œª20 _ 00 should be larger than the one for Œª20 _10 , the difference between the two
estimates is not statistically significant.
     Before proceeding, we pause briefly to interpret our finding that Basic 911 and EMD
do not have measurable effects on intermediate health status. The contrasting findings for
Basic 911 and E911 are consistent with the theory that much of the time delay in
dispatching emergency services is incurred in establishing a caller‚Äôs exact location; then,
Basic 911 may even slow down dispatch, especially in its early stages when call-takers
are not familiar with more distant geographic areas.58 Our results about EMD are at this
stage less conclusive, because the discussion in Section III.C suggests that the benefits of
EMD may continue to accrue after ambulance arrival. Below, we examine the role of
EMD for other outcomes. However, our results suggest that EMD does not lead to large
improvements in timeliness for cardiac emergencies (for example, through improved
allocation of paramedics or ALS ambulances).59
VI.B. Extensions

VI.B.1      Post-Adoption Learning

     In this section, we analyze how the effects of E911 vary with the time before and
after a county‚Äôs adoption date. We are motivated by two concerns. First, as a robustness
check, we would like to confirm that the productivity benefit from E911 does not arise


58
   Of course, Basic 911 may bring benefits in other areas of emergency service, for example in applications
such as fire and police where there is a greater public goods problem in reporting emergencies.
59
   In our sample of cardiac patients, 75% of ambulances had paramedic attendants, indicating that
paramedics may indeed be a scarce resource; however, EMD adoption did not significantly increase the
likelihood that a patient received a paramedic. Pennsylvania law required a paramedic to be present for any
ALS treatment, such as defibrillation, EKG, or the use of an IV to administer fluid or medication.


                                                      32
from a time trend that begins prior to adoption. Further, we would like to evaluate
whether counties improve their performance over time as call-takers and E911 managers
master the new technology, and as dispatching becomes more synchronized with the
information provided by the location database.
     We address these issues in Figure C, where we plot the coefficients from a regression
with the same structure as (5-2), but where we include dummy variables for each of the 9
quarters prior to and after the adoption of E911 by a county. We pool together all
counties that adopt E911, and we use the non-switching counties as a control group.60
     Though not definitive (the confidence intervals for each of these parameters are
relatively wide), the results are encouraging. The coefficients associated with all of the
quarters prior to adoption are below all but the first coefficient associated with
productivity after adoption, and there is no discernible trend in the pre-adoption
coefficients in the quarters just prior to adoption. As well, there is some evidence for
learning; the quarterly coefficients rise in each of the first four quarters after adoption,
and the only coefficient below the pre-adoption coefficients is the quarter immediately
following adoption. Together, these findings reinforce our initial inference that the
adoption of E911 is associated with an increase in cardiac emergency response
productivity and that this benefit persists after learning takes place within the adopting
911 center. Further, our results suggest that our estimates in Tables 4 and 5 may
underestimate the overall benefits to E911, because counties that adopt relatively late in
the sample may not have realized their full productivity gains by the end of 1996.

VI.B.2      911 Technology and Job Design Interaction Effects

     Our discussion in Section II highlighted the potential importance of interaction
effects between IT and job design: does the adoption of more advanced IT increase the
returns to skill-oriented job design?            Table 6A addresses this question through the
estimation of a model similar to (5-2), but where we include five dummy variables for
each of the five separately identified 911 technology/EMD combinations (NO 911*NO
EMD is the omitted category). Given that 911 technology has three levels, we can test

60
   Because adoption dates differ across counties, each coefficient in the figure may be estimated from a
different group of counties; for example, a county that adopted in June, 1994 will not contribute to the
estimates of productivity 3 or more quarters before adoption, while a county that adopted in July, 1996 will
not contribute to the estimates of productivity 3 or more quarters after adoption. Finally, because we do not
have outcome data for 1995, each of these counties will have a four-quarter gap in the coefficients to which
they contribute.


                                                       33
multiple hypotheses about the returns to 911 technology and the nature of the interaction
between 911 technology and EMD. First, consistent with our earlier results, the single
organizational element found to have a significant impact in isolation is E911 (we reject
equality with either NO 911 or BASIC 911). Second, we perform several distinct tests
about the nature of the interaction between 911 technology and EMD (depending on
whether we choose to focus on complementarity between EMD and (a) None  Basic
adoption; (b) None  E911 adoption; (c) Basic  E911 adoption or (d) a joint test of the
restrictions implied by each of the above).61
     In contrast to theories emphasizing complementarity between IT and skill-oriented
job design (or theories that focus on the de-skilling aspects of computerization), we
cannot reject the hypothesis of no interaction effects between 911 technology and EMD.62
In other words, while the results concerning the productivity impact of E911 are robust to
accounting for interactions with EMD, we can offer no evidence for the presence of either
complementarity or substitutability between IT and job design in improving short-term
incident location health outcomes. Since many of the benefits of EMD may not yet have
been realized when the ambulance arrives (recall Figure A), this result is perhaps not too
surprising; yet, similar results obtain when studying in-hospital mortality. Thus, our
results suggest that E911 is neither strongly pro-skilling nor de-skilling.

VI.B.3      Nature of E911 Technology Diffusion

     A central prediction of many theories of technology diffusion is that the sequence of
adoption will reflect declining marginal productivity of adoption (Griliches, 1957;
Rogers, 1983). Indeed, it is precisely this insight which often motivates concern that
measuring the productivity benefits associated with the adoption may be upward-biased if
the estimate reflects the benefits realized by adoptors rather than the average potential
adoptor in the sample. Although our survey evidence suggests that the perceived health
benefits of E911 adoption played little role in determining the precise order of adoption,
we still must consider the possibility of selection. One advantage of our application is


61
  We also conducted the specification test suggested in Section III.C, allowing each different type of switch
in 911 system to have a separate coefficient, and testing the restrictions implied by (A2). We cannot reject
the hypothesis that the parametric restrictions we imposed are valid, so we maintain them for our analysis of
interaction effects. Further, we repeated the analysis using HINDEX1 and ln(HINDEX1) as the dependent
variable. The results are similar.
62 The absence of interaction effects between 911 technology and EMD is confirmed in variety of
specifications and using our alternative incident location health status measures.


                                                       34
that we observe the middle years of a diffusion process, so that even under this theory of
selection, the sample we consider should be drawn from the middle of the distribution of
returns (of course, we know little about the shape of this distribution).         A second
advantage is that we can observe the productivity and characteristics of counties that
previously adopted and those who have not yet adopted, in addition to the productivity
before and after adoption for counties that switch during our sample period. Although
this information can not provide definitive answers to questions about selectivity, it can
potentially rule out some particularly simple alternative theories.
    We begin by estimating a separate conditional mean of HINDEX1 for each of the
nine technology ‚Äúswitching regimes‚Äù possible for counties in this sample. Specifically,
we estimate separate coefficients for each of the three groups of counties maintaining a
single technology level throughout the sample (the non-switchers). In addition, for each
population of adoptors (None Basic, None  E911, and Basic  E911), we estimate a
separate productivity coefficient for the pre-adoption and post-adoption phase in the data
(leading to an additional six coefficients).     To ease interpretation, we use a linear
functional form, de-mean all of the control variables, and suppress the constant. Thus,
each coefficient can be interpreted as the conditional expectation of HINDEX1 for a
patient (with average characteristics) within that specific regime (recall that the overall
survival probability is .962).
    We report several parametric restriction tests in the bottom half of Table 6B,
including (a) the differences between within-sample switchers and the non-switchers with
whom they share a technology level before they switch (i.e., do No 911  E911 adoptors
have a different level of productivity than the group of No 911 non-switchers during the
period when both have No 911 technology?); (b) the differences between within-sample
switchers and the non-switchers with whom they share a technology level after they
switch (i.e., do No 911  E911 adoptors have a different level of productivity than
counties who adopt E911 prior to the beginning of the sample period?); and (c) the
differences between within-sample switchers during their pre-adoption and post-adoption
phase (i.e., what is the difference in productivity for No 911  E911 adoptors between
their No 911 and E911 phases?).
    Several results stand out. First, consistent with our earlier productivity results, there
is a boost in the survival probability associated with the adoption of E911, whether or not
the adopting county maintains a No 911 or Basic 911 technology at the beginning of the


                                               35
sample period. However, while both of these contrasts are significant at the 10% level,
only the Basic  E911 contrast is individually significant at the 1% level. Second,
though they are not significantly different than each other, the non-switching E911 (who
adopted E911 prior to 1994) have a lower predicted survival probability than both No 911
and Basic non-switchers. According to a theory where E911 is associated with at least
some returns for the pre-1994 adoptors, this suggests that the population of early adoptors
have particularly poor health outcomes. Third, the two groups of within-sample E911
adoptors are estimated to have the lowest (over all groups) survival probabilities prior to
their adoption of E911. However, rather than simply converging to the mean of the
population, both the No 911  E911 and Basic  E911 counties ‚Äúleapfrog‚Äù over the
survival probabilities of all the groups of non-switchers. In other words, while both of
these groups of adoptors begin with lower survival probabilities than non-switching
counties who share their technology at the beginning of the period (though only one of
these contrasts is significant), both are (marginally) significantly better than the non-
switching counties who share their technology at then end of the period (the early
adoptors of E911).
    To represent this diffusion process graphically, we plot the results from a modified
version of this regression in Figure D. In particular, we repeat the analysis of Table 6B,
except that we group No 911 and Basic into a single category for simplicity; and, we
distinguish between counties that adopted E911 in 1991 or before (so that planning for
E911 must have begun long before PSETP provided incentives for adoption) and counties
that adopted in the 1992-1993 period. The solid triangles in the Figure represent the
coefficients on the dummy variables for counties that adopted E911 in the specified time
interval, before they adopted E911.      The solid diamonds represent the coefficients
corresponding to counties that adopted E911 in the specified time interval, after they
adopted. For counties that adopt prior to 1994, we only observe health status after
adoption; for counties that adopt after 1996, we only observe health status before
adoption. The difference between the post-adoption and pre-adoption coefficients for the
1994-1996 adopters is simply our estimate of the effect of E911. Finally, under the
assumptions of our fixed-effect model, the benefit to E911 is constant across counties.
The outlined points on the figure represent the survival rates that we would attribute to
those counties, using our estimate of the benefit to E911.




                                              36
    In interpreting the estimate for the earliest E911 adopters, recall from our discussion
in Section IV that this group includes a few counties with particularly poor levels of
HINDEX1 that drive down the average. Similarly, the estimate for the latest E911
adopters includes a few of the very smallest counties, who adopted most recently (if at
all) and also have unusually good levels of HINDEX1. Our assumption that the returns to
E911 are constant across counties are less likely to hold for these unusual counties.
    Our findings shed light on the salience of alternative theories about the process of
technological diffusion. The adoptors are neither simply associated with poor health
status both prior to and after adoption (which suggests a selectivity bias or mean
reversion), nor do these counties experience superior productivity both before and after
adoption (which would be consistent with a positive correlation between E911 adoption
during our sample period and superior health care infrastructure or more efficient 911
managers). Second, nothing in our results is inconsistent with the simple adoption story
where early adopters have low levels of productivity, together with high returns. Under
that interpretation, our estimates of the welfare effects of E911 would be too small; if
early adopters experience higher incremental returns, these returns would accrue to the
large fraction (over 50%) of Pennsylvania‚Äôs population (excluding Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh) who had E911 prior to 1994.
    Of course, we cannot rule out alternative theories of selectivity that would lead to
lower-than-average returns to E911 during 1994-1996. In a final exercise intended to
shed light on this issue, we examined how the returns to E911 adoption vary across
counties with different characteristics, within the 1994-1996 period.        We found no
statistically significant effect of demographics such as population. We also explored how
the returns vary with the adopting county‚Äôs level of HINDEX1 at the beginning of the
sample. Although the interaction was not statistically significant at the 10% level, the
point estimates are inconsistent with the hypothesis that healthier counties have higher
returns to adoption.

VI.B.4    Alternative Time Trends, Clustered Standard Errors, and Sample Limitations

    Our final set of extensions evaluate the sensitivity of the relationship between health
status outcomes measured at the incident scene and the adoption of E911 to the
assumptions underlining the differences-in-differences estimation strategy.        Table 7
reports our main robustness checks; however, these are a small subset of the avenues we



                                               37
have explored, and so we discuss both the results in Table 7 as well as ancillary
(unreported) results which shed further light on the robustness of our findings.
    First, in Table 7A, we relax the assumption that all of the different populations in the
data experience a common time trend.         Heterogeneity in the trend experienced by
different populations is particularly important if one is concerned about the potential for
selectivity in the population of adoptors (see, e.g., Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999). For
example, it may be possible that the population adopting during our sample is simply
associated with a higher overall time trend than the full population. To address this
concern, we present two specific alternatives. First, in (7A-1), we assign different time
trends based on each county‚Äôs initial technology level. Similar to earlier specifications,
we use quarterly dummy variables. In (7A-2), we include time trends (once again in
terms of quarterly dummy variables) for ‚Äúhigh-density‚Äù counties and MCDs.                To
accomplish this, we separate the sample into counties (and MCDs) with high or low
densities (relative to the median density), and the ‚Äúhigh-density county‚Äù dummy and
‚Äúhigh-density MCD‚Äù variables are each interacted with each of the quarter dummies. For
both of these specifications, the single 911 technology and job design variable which
remains significant is E911 (the coefficient also remains similar to earlier estimates). As
well, both the initial-technology and density-specific time trends are not significantly
different from the baseline time trend.     In addition to these specifications, we also
explored a variety of other time trends based on the county‚Äôs final technology level (the
converse of (7A-1)), on county and MCD characteristics such as population and per
capita income, and using monthly rather than quarterly dummies. In each of these cases,
the 911 coefficient remains significant and similar in magnitude while the alternative time
trends themselves remain insignificant.
    In Table 7B, we further explore the robustness of our results to alternative
econometric assumptions. First, we allow for clustering in computing the standard errors.
While the richness of our data and the use of fixed effects for each MCD makes it likely
that there is a low level of spurious correlation within an MCD for specific time periods
(i.e., there are no ‚Äúcontagion‚Äù effects in cardiac emergencies, and the use of weather
controls reduces the likelihood of correlation of the error due to traffic or environmental
conditions), it is still useful to confirm that within-region correlation for specific
increments of time does not reduce the magnitude or significance of our earlier results.
Therefore, in (7B-1), we report the results from a regression which includes county-level



                                               38
fixed effects and allows for clustering across observations within a quarter and county.
The coefficient on E911 remains similar and significant. As well, we explored several
alternative clustering schemes, including, among other things, (a) MCD/month level
clustering with MCD fixed effects, (b) County/month level clustering with MCD fixed
effects, and (c) MCD/quarter level clustering with county-level fixed effects. In each
case, the coefficient on E911 remains significant with similar t-statistics, and neither the
Basic nor EMD coefficient becomes significant.
    Finally, in our county-level comparison in Section IV, we found that, on average,
counties who adopt E911 prior to our sample tend to either be larger counties or counties
with relatively low survival probabilities (both in terms of the HINDEX measures as well
as realized mortality rates). We suggested that these patterns may reflect the underlying
economics of technological diffusion ‚Äì counties with particularly unhealthy populations
or who have the opportunity to exploit scale economies may tend to adopt earlier.
Although the fact that these early adoptors do not switch during our sample frame likely
reduces the selectivity bias in our estimation, they may still contribute to the time trend
(and potentially other coefficients as well). Accordingly, Table (7B-2) excludes all
counties with populations greater than 300,000 (this eliminates 9 counties) and all
counties for whom the 48-hour survival rate is below 95% (eliminating another 10
counties). The core E911 result is robust to the exclusion of these counties, as well as to
several other variants.
    Summarizing, we conclude that our main result relating health status measured at the
scene of emergencies to the adoption of IT remains robust even after accounting for the
most likely alternative sources of correlation, such as heterogeneity in the time trend
across counties, correlation within a county within specific time periods, and potential
dependence upon a few large or low-survival probability counties for which the returns to
E911 may be particularly high.
VI.C. Mortality, Hospital Inpatient Charges, and Hospital Transfers

    Our final empirical exercise examines the effects of technology and EMD on patient
outcomes after hospital admission; these outcome measures were described in some detail
in Section IV.C.1. As Section III.A suggests, these measures are useful because they can
be related to the welfare benefits of the policy variables. However, we reiterate the
caveats outlined in Section IV about these outcome measures; in addition to the well-



                                               39
known difficulties in interpreting the prices charged by hospitals, our outcome measures
reflect only the first hospital visit after the ambulance ride.
     Consider first Table 8A, which reports results about survival.             We modify our
specification somewhat from our earlier analysis of intermediate health status, motivated
by the fact that hospital outcome measures will include the effects of a patient‚Äôs in-
hospital experience. Because patients in our sample have access to widely different
hospitals, this may introduce substantial heterogeneity. To account for this, we include
hospital fixed effects in our preferred specifications. This approach may also account for
the fact that different hospitals may transfer patients according to different criteria, as
discussed in Section IV.C.1. However, our sample size (together with the extremely low
probability of short-term mortality) imposes limits on the number of control variables we
can include. Table 8A reports results with county-level fixed effects, as well as county
and hospital fixed effects. If we include both MCD and hospital fixed effects, the
magnitudes of the coefficients remain similar, but the standard errors grow larger. We
use a linear probability model; the results are similar with probit estimation.
     Although the estimated effects of E911 on survival are less precisely estimated than
those for HINDEX, they are similar (indeed, somewhat larger) in magnitude. We find
that E911 adoption is associated with an increase of 6 HOUR SURVIVAL rate of .009,
from a baseline of .990. While this increase in the survival probability likely impacts
those patients with predicted survival probabilities of less than .99 (due to other
characteristics), these estimates do suggest that E911 adoption eliminates a substantial
portion of the (very short term) mortality risk.
     The estimates for 48 HOUR SURVIVAL are similar, though quantitatively larger.
Observe further that the baseline mortality rate is higher, and a proportional increase in
the standard errors make the results only marginally significant.63 To interpret these
results in light of our earlier findings, recall that HINDEX1 is calculated as the predicted
value for 48 HOUR SURVIVAL based on the health status measurements observed at the
incident scene. If the adoption of E911 is uncorrelated with factors affecting patient
survival after ambulance arrival, the magnitudes of the estimates in Table 8A should be
similar to the estimates (scaled in terms of changing survival probabilities) obtained


63
  When hospital fixed effects are included, the p-value drops to .11 (from p = .07). However, the
coefficeint magnitudes are fairly robust; inclusion of both MCD and hospital fixed effects does not
noticeably change the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients.


                                                   40
earlier. While similar, these (noisy) estimates of the mortality impact are in fact even
higher than those associated with the HINDEX variables.64 Thus, timely ambulance
response appears to have lasting effects; for example, our findings are inconsistent with
the hypothesis that subsequent medical intervention somehow mitigates the effects of
slower ambulance response.
      Another potential benefit of improvements in the emergency response system may be
a decrease in the need for expensive medical care. Thus, our final analysis examines the
impact of the emergency response system on the realized TOTAL CHARGES of patients.
The results are dramatic. The adoption of either BASIC or E911 is associated with
approximately a 15% reduction in average total charges on a per patient basis (the
average charges are just under $14,000). Moreover, if one combines both medium-term
mortality and a measure indicating a high level of charges (POOR OUTCOME equals
one if the patient dies or exceeds $20,000 in CHARGES), the change in the likelihood of
POOR OUTCOME is significant and ranges between .04 and .06.
      Finally, consider our findings about the effects of EMD adoption. Although it may
not be surprising that EMD has little effect on intermediate health status, our discussion
in Section III.A suggests hospital outcome measures might provide better estimates of
EMD‚Äôs benefits. However, we do not find any significant benefit of EMD, and indeed
the point estimates for the effect of EMD are negative. Thus, we conclude that the
average benefits of EMD adoption for cardiac patients are at best small, especially in
comparison to the effects of E911 (of course, EMD is substantially less expensive). In
future work, it might be possible to explore the effects of EMD on other patient
populations, or to examine other potential benefits of EMD, such as the allocation of ALS
ambulances and paramedics according to patient severity or the reduced use of the
‚Äúlights-and-siren‚Äù emergency response.

VI.     Implications and Conclusions
      The main contribution of this paper is to document that health care outcomes
improve following the adoption of E911. However, to interpret these results from the
perspective of social welfare, we must compare the costs and benefits of adoption.
Several difficulties arise in performing such a comparison. First, and perhaps most


64
   To draw a direct comparison, it may be more useful to consider the results about HINDEX1 derived from
a linear specification, where we estimate that E911 is associated with an increase in HINDEX1 of .0095.


                                                     41
importantly, emergency cardiac response is a small portion of the overall volume of calls
handled by 911 centers. Within medical emergencies, cardiac emergencies make up less
than one-fifth of all emergencies, and, at least in one Pennsylvania county for which
statistics are available, ambulance incidents make up 33% of all dispatched calls (just a
little over 50% are police and the remainder are associated with fire). Second, while we
can relate the benefits for an average-sized county to an average cost system, we do not
have the information to estimate the optimal adoption date, because quality is increasing
and price is declining over time.
    Nonetheless, it still may be useful to compare a rough estimate of adoption costs to
an estimate of the benefit of E911 for cardiac emergencies. The average population of
Pennsylvania counties is 272,000 and based on industry sources, we estimate that initial
adoption costs are approximately $2 million. The technology should last at least five to
seven years; furthermore, subsequent upgrades to the technology may be less costly than
the initial adoption. E911 also increases operating costs somewhat. Taking all of these
factors into account, a rough estimate of the annualized cost is $400,000. Our estimates
of the effect of E911 adoption on the 48-hour survival probability range from .005 to .017
(including both our results for intermediate health status as measured by HINDEX1 and
the direct effect of E911 on mortality). Since the average number of patients per county
in our sample is 129 per year, if we value the patient‚Äôs improvement in health at
$100,000, our estimates of the benefits to E911 range from $64,500 to $219,000. This
implies that the benefits to E911 for cardiac patients alone defray a substantial portion of
the adoption costs. Taking into account the fact that cardiac emergencies comprise only a
small fraction of all 911 calls, it seems likely that E911 adoption increases social welfare
for the average county.
    In conclusion, we observe that our analysis in this paper highlights a more general
issue about productivity measurement in the service sector. In contrast to studies that
attempt to evaluate the gains from IT by aggregating across a wide variety of
heterogeneous establishments and applications of IT, our approach has been to identify a
specific application and to tailor both the measurement of IT and the productivity analysis
to fit the application. While such an approach may not be feasible for every application,
such estimates provide an alternative perspective both as to the size of the benefits from
IT and the types of output measures (e.g., measures specifically responsive to timeliness)
which may form the basis for more consistent productivity estimation in the service



                                               42
sector. The development and evaluation of such measures seems a promising area for
further research.

Notes: The points on the figure represent the coefficients on dummy variables for each group of counties in
a regression that is the same as the one reported in Table 6B, except that No 911 and Basic are pooled into
a single category, and further we distinguish between counties that adopted E911 in 1991 or earlier, and
counties that adopted E911 in 1992-1993.

Coefficients are measured as differences in probability.
Revised Trauma Score (RTS) is calculated as RTS = 0.9368*(Glasgow Coma Scale Points) + 0.7326*(Systolic Blood Pressure Points) +
0.2908*(Respiration Rate Points), where points coincide with the category numbers in the calculation of HINDEX1. Values for the RTS range
from 0 to 7.8408. A threshold of RTS < 4 has been proposed to identify patients who should be treated in a trauma center. See
