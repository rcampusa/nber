Is Debt Relief Efficient?

JEL No. F3, F4, E6

                                            ABSTRACT

When Less Developed Countries (LDCs) announce debt relief agreements under the Brady Plan,

their stock markets appreciate by an average of 60 percent in real dollar terms – a $42 billion

increase in shareholder value. In contrast, there is no significant stock market increase for a control

group of LDCs that do not sign Brady agreements. The results persist after controlling for IMF

programs, trade liberalizations, capital account liberalizations, and privatization programs. The stock

market appreciations successfully forecast higher future net resource transfers, investment and

growth. Creditors also benefit from the Brady Plan. Controlling for other factors, stock prices of US

commercial banks with significant LDC loan exposure rise by 35 percent – a $13 billion increase

in shareholder value. The results suggest that debt relief can generate large efficiency gains when

the borrower suffers from debt overhang.

Introduction

       Bono and Jesse Helms want debt relief for the world’s less-developed countries (LDCs).

The Pope and 17 million people are behind them. At a June 1999 meeting of G8 leaders in

Cologne, Germany the lead singer of the rock band U2 presented Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder

with 17 million signatures in support of the Jubilee 2000 Debt Relief Initiative. In November

1998, Pope John Paul II issued a Papal Bull calling on the wealthy nations to relieve the debts of

developing nations in order to “remove the shadow of death.”

       Opponents of debt relief occupy less hallowed ground but are no less zealous about their

cause, citing at least two reasons why the debt relief campaign is misguided. First, debt relief

alone cannot solve the problem of third-world debt. Even if all debt were forgiven, it will

accumulate again if income does not grow faster than expenditure (O’Neill, 2002). Second, debt

relief can create perverse incentives for debtor countries. By relaxing budget constraints, debt

relief may permit governments to prolong wasteful economic policies (Easterly, 2001a).

       Do the benefits of debt relief outweigh the costs? Or is it a welfare-reducing market

intervention? The stock market provides a natural place to search for answers. Changes in stock

prices reflect both revised expectations about future corporate profits and the discount rate at

which those profits are capitalized.        Consequently, the stock market response to the

announcement of a debt relief program collapses the entire expected future stream of debt relief

costs and benefits into a single summary statistic: the expected net benefit (current and future) of

the program.

       The effect of debt relief on the stock market depends on the model of sovereign lending

to which one subscribes. Models emphasizing costs suggest three channels through which debt

relief may adversely affect the recipient country’s stock market. First, if debt relief allows a




                                                                                                  1
government to persist with wasteful policies, economic growth and corporate profits may be

reduced impacting stock prices adversely. Second, countries that do not honor their debts may

incur costs in the form of trade sanctions, which may also hurt growth and profits (Bulow and

Rogoff, 1989a). Third, debt relief may damage the debtor’s reputation for repayment and raise

its future cost of borrowing in international capital markets (Eaton and Gersovitz, 1981).

       But, the reputation argument is valid only under assumptions that may not be plausible

for LDCs (Bulow and Rogoff, 1989b). Furthermore, both borrower and lenders can benefit from

debt relief when the borrower suffers from debt overhang. If each creditor would agree to

forgive some of its claims, then the debtor would be better able to service the debt owed to each

creditor. Consequently, the expected value of all creditors’ claims would rise (Krugman, 1988;

Sachs, 1989).    Forgiveness will not happen without coordination, however, because any

individual creditor would prefer to have a free ride, maintaining the full value of its claims while

others write off some debt.

       By forcing all creditors to accept some losses, debt relief can solve the collective action

problem and pave the way for profitable new lending (Cline, 1995).                By relaxing the

intertemporal budget constraint, the new capital inflow may reduce the discount rate in the

debtor country. To the extent that the country suffers from a “debt overhang” caused by the

collective action problem, debt relief increases the incentive to undertake efficient investments.

In turn, these investments may raise expected future growth rates and cash flows (Froot,

Scharfstein, and Stein, 1989; Krugman, 1989; Myers, 1977; Sachs, 1989).

       On March 10, 1989, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, Nicholas F.

Brady, called for LDC debt relief. Between 1989 and 1995, sixteen LDCs reached debt relief

agreements under the Brady Plan. Figure 1 shows what happened. In the 12-month period




                                                                                                  2
preceding the official announcement of its Brady deal, the average country’s stock market

appreciated by 60 percent in anticipation of the event. Stated in dollar terms, the market

capitalization of debtor country stock markets rose by a total of 42 billion dollars.

        Nor were the wealth gains from debt relief simply a wealth transfer to the debtor nations

from western commercial banks. Figure 2 shows that the stock prices of the 11 major U.S.

commercial banks with large LDC loan exposure increased by an average of 35 percent—a 13.3

billion dollar increase in market capitalization. Adding the LDCs’ wealth increase to that of the

banks gives a rough sense of the Brady Plan’s net benefit to society: 55.3 billion dollars.

        To be sure, changes in stock market capitalization measure efficiency gains in a very

narrow sense. The stock market welfare metric tells us only whether the benefits to shareholders

outstrip any costs involved. In that narrow sense, the results suggest that debt relief may

generate ex-post efficiency gains. Of course, debt relief may also induce ex-ante contracting

inefficiencies (Shleifer, 2003).1 Our analysis provides no evidence on the size of any such costs,

but it is nevertheless important to understand whether debt relief generates ex-post efficiency

gains. To the extent that debt restructurings induce ex-ante efficiency losses, the existence of

some ex-post efficiency gains is a necessary condition for debt relief to be welfare improving.

        In addition to the narrowness of our welfare metric, there are many other reasons to be

concerned about using the stock market to evaluate debt relief. One should not look at debtor-

country stock market responses in isolation. If the Brady Plan coincides with a positive global

economic shock that is unrelated to debt relief, then debtor-country stock markets will rise in

concert with stock markets in countries that do not sign debt relief agreements.

        In order to distinguish the effect of debt relief from that of a common shock, we compare


1
 There is, however, an alternative view. The ex-ante knowledge that debts may have to be restructured could raise
efficiency by forcing lenders to be more careful (Darity and Horn, 1988; Fischer, 1987; Bolton and Skeel, 2003).


                                                                                                                    3
the stock market response of the Brady countries with the market response of a similar group of

countries that did not sign Brady deals. Figure 1 shows that a control group of non-signing

LDCs does not experience a significant increase in stock prices. Similarly, Figure 2 shows that

the price increase for U.S. commercial banks is not driven by a common shock; there is no

significant price increase for a control group of U.S. commercial banks that did not have

significant LDC exposure.

       Perhaps a greater concern is that anticipated economic reforms drive the price increase in

Figure 1. Countries receive Brady deals in return for committing to World-Bank-IMF-supported

reforms that are designed to increase openness and raise productivity. So, it is possible that stock

prices go up because debt relief signals future reforms. We attempt to distinguish the effects of

debt relief from those of reform by making use of a key historical fact. On October 8, 1985, the

Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, James A. Baker III, announced a plan for dealing

with the Third World Debt Crisis. The Baker Plan called on the debtor countries to undertake

extensive economic reforms—stabilization, trade liberalization, privatization, and greater

openness to foreign direct investment—but deliberately excluded any plans for debt relief. In

contrast, the Brady Plan explicitly called for debt relief in addition to the continuation of the

reforms begun under the Baker Plan four years earlier.

       The difference in focus of the two plans implies that the “news” in the Baker

announcement was the official U.S. push for economic reforms while the “news” in the Brady

announcement was the official U.S. push for debt relief. In other words, because economic

reforms were enacted under the Baker Plan, their effects should already have been incorporated

into stock prices when the subsequent Brady Plan was announced. If markets are efficient, then

the market reaction to the Brady Plan should principally reflect the anticipated effect of debt




                                                                                                  4
relief.

          The Baker Plan notwithstanding, it is still important to confirm that markets were not

surprised by the economic reforms enacted around the time of the Brady Plan. Sections IV and

V do just that, and address other concerns about the robustness of our results as well. There,

instead of simply inferring that the Brady agreement did not signal any new information about

economic reforms, we confront the issue directly. We do so by documenting the dates on which

major reforms occurred and testing empirically whether the reforms had any effect on stock

prices. While our tests are not definitive, the stock market increase associated with debt relief

remains economically large and statistically significant in all regression specifications that

include the economic reform variables.

          After grappling with concerns about robustness, Section V turns to more primitive issues

of interpretation: Why do stock prices rise? Is this a spurious result? Or, does the stock market

rationally forecast future changes in the fundamentals? If market values rise because debt relief

paves the way for profitable new lending, then the stock market responses should have some

predictive power for future changes in net resource transfers (NRTs). Similarly, if the Brady

Plan alleviated debt overhang we should see more investment and growth. The descriptive

evidence we provide is not definitive, but the stock market responses do help to predict changes

in the NRT, investment, and GDP growth for up to five years following the agreements.




I. The Debt Crisis and The Brady Plan

          Commercial bank lending to the LDCs surged in the early 1970s. There is no simple way

to tell when the loans became non-performing, but a few salient events sent important signals

that the quality of the loans was deteriorating. The Mexican default on August 12, 1982


                                                                                                5
triggered the beginning of the Third-World Debt Crisis. The next five years were marked by

frequent debt restructurings and new-money packages that tried, but failed to resolve the crisis

(James, 1996, Chapter 12).

       A second critical point was reached in February of 1987, when Brazil declared a debt

moratorium and suspended all interest payments to its creditors. In response to the Brazilian

moratorium, Citicorp announced a $2.5 billion increase in its loan-loss reserves on May 20,

1987. Shortly after Citicorp’s decision, a number of other banks made similar announcements

and increased their loan-loss reserves as well (Boehmer and Megginson, 1990).             From an

accounting perspective, then, May of 1987 appears to be the date when the banks officially

recognized that a significant fraction of their LDC loans were non-performing.

       Table I provides a brief summary of the debt restructuring history of the countries that

eventually received a Brady Plan: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, the

Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,

Uruguay, and Venezuela. Column 2 shows that a large number of restructurings took place in

each country between 1982 and the time of its Brady deal. The sheer number of restructurings

lends credence to the view that these countries were suffering from debt overhang. Column 3

indicates that a number of countries began to restructure their debt prior to Citicorp’s increase in

loan-loss reserves, suggesting that LDC loans may, in fact, have become non-performing prior to

May of 1987. Column 4 gives the date of the last debt restructuring that took place before the

announcement of a country’s Brady deal; only 4 countries did not restructure their debt after

May of 1987.

       Finally, Column 5 of Table I lists the announcement date of each country’s Brady Plan.

The principal source of announcement dates is International Debt Reexamined (Cline, 1995,




                                                                                                  6
Table 5.3, p. 234). However, the book does not provide announcement dates for Bolivia,

Nigeria, Panama, Peru and the Philippines2. For these five countries we retrieved announcement

dates using the Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe (http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe).3                            We

verified the accuracy of the search by matching the dates obtained from Lexis-Nexis with those

in the Quarterly Economic Reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).


IA. What Was Restructured?

         The goal of the Brady Plan was to restructure the commercial banks’ loans in such a way

that interest payments would be reduced, principal forgiven and maturities lengthened. The plan

restructured both the public and publicly guaranteed debt claims of the commercial banks.4 The

public debt consisted of commercial banks’ loans to the central government. The publicly-

guaranteed debt consisted of loans that were guaranteed by the central government: trade credit;

project finance; and bank loans to regional governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

Table II shows that the majority of the loans were denominated in dollars, reflecting that most of

the debt was held by U.S. Money-Center banks.

         Under the Brady Plan, the commercial banks were presented with four options for

restructuring the debt:


         (1) Discount Bonds: Issue bonds with the total face value of the debt reduced by
         30 to 35 percent and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 13/16; a “bullet” single
         payment maturity of 30 years with US Treasury zero-coupon bond collateral on
         principal and a rolling guarantee of 12 to 18 months of interest.


2
  Cline (1995) provides only the year of the announcement for the Philippines and only the implementation date for
Nigeria and Bolivia. It does not provide any dates for Panama and Peru because these countries were still
negotiating their debt relief agreements at the time of the book’s publication.
3
  A data appendix containing the complete list of articles that were uncovered by the Lexis Nexis search is available
upon request.
4
  It is possible that minor amounts of market issues such as bonds or notes were also restructured, but we could not
find any evidence on such restructurings.


                                                                                                                    7
        (2) Par Bonds: Issue bonds worth the full face value of the debt with an interest
        rate of 6 percent and similar maturity and collateralization as the discount bonds.

        (3) New Money: Retain the full value of the debt, but issue new loans in the
        amount of 25 percent of current exposure over the next three years with at least
        half of the new money coming within the first year.

        (4) Cash Buybacks: Repurchase of the debt at a specific price.


The options chosen by the banks varied by country. In countries that were lightly indebted,

banks favored the new money option, whereas in heavily indebted countries there was very little

new money. Cash buybacks were limited to small, low-income countries with little bank debt

such as Costa Rica. The discount bond was designed for banks concerned about limiting the risk

of interest rate fluctuations. The par bond was intended for banks located in countries where

regulatory and tax considerations made maintaining full face value preferable (Cline, 1995).

        In return for accepting the four-point restructuring menu, the banks received 25 billion

dollars of enhancements—collateral for principal and a rolling fund to cover several interest

payments—in the form of U.S. Treasury Bonds (Cline, 1995, Chapter 5). The debtor countries

paid for the Treasury securities with loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the

World Bank. Although they needed a member-country-financed capital injection to make these

loans, it is important to remember that the Fund and the Bank "…lent at rates that reflect at least

opportunity cost of Treasury bonds...so that the public sector is not providing concessional

financing. The short answer, then, is that the public-sector enhancements did not cost anything."

(Cline, 1995, p. 265). Of course there may have been transaction costs, but they were probably

nothing more than rounding error relative to the overall sums of money involved.5

        Table III demonstrates that roughly 202.8 billion dollars worth of debt was restructured,


5
 The Treasury, the IMF and the Bank can be seen as the agents that were necessary for overcoming the transaction
costs that stood in the way of the commercial banks negotiating a Coasian (1960) solution to the debt problem.


                                                                                                                   8
resulting in 64.7 billion dollars of debt relief. The average spread fell from 17/16 over LIBOR

on the loans before the Brady Plan to 13/16 over LIBOR on the discount bonds after the

restructuring.6       Similarly, debt prices rose.         In the year prior to restructuring, the average

country’s debt was trading at 32 cents on the dollar in the secondary market. In the month of the

Brady Deal, the average price rose to 42 cents on the dollar. Finally, the average maturity of the

debt increased from 15 to 30 years.



II. Data and Descriptive Findings

           The principal source of stock market data is the IFC’s Emerging Markets Data Base

(EMDB).7 Stock price indices for individual countries are the dividend-inclusive, U.S. dollar-

denominated and local currency-denominated IFC Global Indices. For most countries, EMDB’s

coverage begins in December 1975, but for others coverage begins in December 1984. Each

country’s U.S. dollar-denominated stock price index is deflated by the U.S. consumer price index

(CPI), which comes from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). The local currency-

denominated index is deflated by the local consumer price index for each country, which is also

obtained from the IFS. Returns and inflation are calculated as the first difference of the natural

logarithm of the real stock price and CPI, respectively. All of the data are monthly.

           Reliable stock market data exist for only 10 of the Brady countries: Argentina, Brazil,

Ecuador, Jordan, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, and Venezuela. We bring

Bolivia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Uruguay back into the picture

in Section VI where the focus of analysis moves from financial to real data.

    For an early analysis of LDC loan spreads see Edwards (1984).
7
    For Ecuador, the source of stock market data is the Global Financial Data Base.


                                                                                                        9
IIA. Selection of the Control group

          The control group consists of all developing countries that: (1) Did not receive a Brady

plan; and (2) Have stock market data in the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging

Market Data Base. There are 16 such countries: Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic,

Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka,

Thailand, Turkey, and Zimbabwe.

          It is important to ask whether the selection of the control group introduces statistical bias.

The purpose of the control group is to determine whether the stock price increase in the debtor

countries was driven by a global economic shock unrelated to debt relief. Therefore, it is crucial

that the control group not consist of countries in such an abject state of development that their

stock markets would not respond to a positive external shock, no matter how favorable. We

address this concern by examining the characteristics of the Brady and control groups in some

detail.

          The Brady countries and the control group display similar geographical dispersion. Both

groups contain countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. One significant

difference is that Latin American countries comprise the largest fraction of the Brady countries

while the control group primarily consists of countries in Asia.            History suggests that the

relatively heavier weighting of Asian countries in the control group will make that group the

stronger economic performer. We confirm this suspicion by comparing the Brady countries and

the control group using two standard measures of economic performance, growth and inflation.

          The control group outperforms the Brady countries on both measures. Between 1980 and

1999 the median growth rate of per capita GDP for the control group was 3 percent. The Brady

group grew by only 1 percent per year during the same time period. GDP growth was also less




                                                                                                     10
volatile in the control group. The standard error of GDP growth for the control group was 1

percent, as compared to 2 percent for the Brady group. Finally, the control group has a lower

and less volatile rate of inflation: a median of 11 percent and a standard deviation of 3 percent.

The corresponding numbers for the Brady countries are 27 and 18.

           To summarize, the median country in the control group has faster and less volatile growth

together with lower and less volatile inflation than its Brady group counterpart. To the extent

that superior long-run economic performance is positively correlated with better-managed

economies, we would expect stock markets in the median control-group country to be more

responsive to any auspicious common shock.

           Finally, analyzing the universe of countries that received Brady Deals does not introduce

any obvious selection bias. True, the countries that enter into Brady Deals are probably the ones

that are most likely to benefit from debt relief. But that is precisely the point. We are not trying

to estimate the average effect of debt relief on a randomly selected country. Just as it does not

make sense to try to measure the effect of a medical treatment on a healthy individual, neither is

it sensible to estimate the effect of debt relief on a country where debt overhang is not an issue.



IIB. Descriptive Findings

           This subsection presents descriptive evidence on how the stock market responds to news

of a future debt relief agreement. For each Brady country we calculate the average monthly

stock return over the entire sample. The average monthly return is a proxy for the expected

monthly return.          Subtracting a country’s expected return from its actual return gives the

abnormal return.8



8
    Alternative measures of abnormal returns are considered in Section III.


                                                                                                  11
         Let month [0] be the month in which a Brady debt relief announcement takes place for a

given country. Similarly, let [-12] denote the 12th month before the debt relief announcement, so

that [-12, 0] denotes the one-year window preceding the announcement.                             The cumulative

abnormal return for a country is defined as the sum of its abnormal returns from month –12 to

month 0.

         Figure 1 plots the average cumulative abnormal return across all ten Brady countries in

event time. The average Brady country stock market experiences cumulative abnormal returns

of 60 percent in real dollar terms. In other words, the real dollar value of the stock market

increases by 60 percent more than it does in a typical year. Now look at the graph for the control

group. If a common shock caused stock prices to go up in the Brady countries, then we should

also see an increase in the stock prices of the control group. This is not the case. The average

cumulative abnormal return for the control group is close to 0.9 The preliminary conclusion is

that the stock price increase in the debtor countries is not due exclusively to a common shock

that has favorable effects on all emerging stock markets.

         Since there are only ten countries in the Brady stock market group, one country may

dominate the results. To explore this possibility we conduct median tests in the following way.

For each of the ten countries we compute the median annual stock return. The stock return in the

12-month period preceding the Brady announcement exceeds the median, annual return for every

country except Peru. We also conducted median tests in local currency, and the results were the

 For a given Brady country, the control group abnormal returns are calculated as follows. Fix the announcement
date [0] for the country in question. Next, for each of the 16 countries in the control group, calculate the abnormal
returns for [-12, 0]. This calculation gives 16 sets of abnormal returns for the fixed Brady-country date. Next,
calculate the average of these 16 sets of abnormal returns and you have the single series of abnormal returns for the
control group associated with the first country. Now repeat the procedure for the other 9 Brady countries. Doing so
yields 10 series of average abnormal returns for the months [-12, 0]. Finally, taking the average across all 10 series
gives the average abnormal return for the entire Control group.


                                                                                                                   12
same. Peru is the only country whose stock return during the 12-month announcement window

was less than its median 12-month return.

            Another concern is that the results may be sensitive to whether real returns are measured

in dollars or the local currency. To address this concern, we replicated Figure 1 using real local

currency returns instead of real dollar returns. The resulting graph was virtually identical to

Figure 1. Since the choice of currency makes little difference, the formal empirical analysis in

Section IV focuses on the dollar-denominated returns.

            By constructing a control group of relatively strong economic performers, we are able to

distinguish the effect of the Brady Plan from that of a common shock. But constructing the

control group in this way raises the question of whether we have properly addressed the

counterfactual: Would stock prices have gone up in the Brady Countries had they not received

debt relief?

            Addressing the counterfactual requires constructing a control group that bears a greater

resemblance to the Brady countries.                 To do so, we replicated our experiment using two

alternative control groups. The first consisted of the highly or moderately indebted countries of

the original control group: Indonesia, Pakistan, Colombia, Malaysia, and Turkey; the second

consisted of all the Brady countries that were still waiting to receive their Brady deals. The

graphs were almost identical to Figure 1.10                     There was no significant increase in the stock

market in either of the two alternative control groups in the 12-month period preceding debt

relief announcements.



IIC. Why Use A 12-Month Event Window?

       Using a 12-month window provides a reasonable characterization of the data, because the

announcement of a debt relief agreement is less a discrete occurrence than it is a series of events

during which the public gradually learns the details of the government’s negotiations to reduce

its external debt burden.    Table IV illustrates the point for three representative countries:

Argentina, Nigeria and Venezuela.

       Argentina had a 9-month window of negotiations with its external creditors, extending

from July of 1991 to the official announcement of an agreement in April of 1992. In July of

1991, the Economist Intelligence Unit reported, “The International Monetary Fund approves a 1

billion dollar stand-by loan.” On September 20 of 1991, the Financial Times reported “Domingo

Cavallo, comes to Washington to jump-start negotiations on the country's $61bn debt.” On

March 31, 1992 the Financial Times reported, “Argentina secures a $3.15bn extended facility

fund loan from the IMF. Approval of the loan is important for securing a restructuring with the

creditor banks.”

       Nigeria had a 10-month window of negotiations with its external creditors, extending

from May of 1990 to its official announcement in March of 1991. The window of public

negotiations began with a Financial Times story on October 3, 1990, “The resolution of the five-

month deadlock over rescheduling terms for Nigeria's $5.5bn commercial bank debt appears

likely.” The reference to a 5-month deadlock suggests that the sequence of public events may

actually have begun as early as May of 1990. Between October 1990 and March of 1991, the

Financial Times ran at least two more stories about Nigeria’s negotiations with its creditors.

       Finally, Venezuela had an 11-month window of negotiations that began with the

Washington Post’s declaration on July 25, 1989: “the Mexican deal will set a pattern for dealing

with the debt problems of other nations. Brady puts the Philippines, Venezuela and Costa Rica




                                                                                                 14
at the head of the list.” On March 21, 1990 the New York Times reported “Venezuela and its

creditor banks reach an agreement on the basic terms of a deal.”

        The average length of the window in these three countries is 10 months. This estimate is

based on the earliest reported news headlines that we could find through Lexis-Nexis. Even if

these are, in fact, the earliest public releases of information, the possibility remains that the news

was “leaked” to the markets prior to the news dates that we collected. Admittedly, constructing

the event window is at least as much art as it is science, but all things considered, a 12-month

window does no obvious harm to the data. Furthermore, Section IV estimates results using 12-

month, 9-month, 6-month and 3-month windows—the effect of debt relief on the stock market is

positive and significant in all specifications.

        Of course, a long event window raises the specter of reverse causality. Instead of debt

relief generating a stock market boom, maybe rising stock markets and improved economic

prospects cause countries to write-down their debts? In thinking about this question, it is

important to remember that countries cannot simply decide that they want debt relief and make it

so. This is because debt relief requires a mutual agreement between parties: The debtor requests

a write down and the creditor agrees to forgive some of the debt. Reaching such agreements can

take a long time because both the debtor country and the creditor banks want to exercise their

bargaining power (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein, 1989). Consequently, negotiations might reach

a deadlock, which could take many months to resolve, as illustrated by the case of Nigeria in

October 1990 (Table IV). Given the length of time and the number of parties involved in

sovereign debt restructurings, it is difficult to believe that a debtor country would be able to push




                                                                                                   15
through a debt relief agreement as a swift policy response to a rising stock market and improving

economic prospects. 11

        Four central facts emerge from this section: (1) Stock markets in debtor countries rise by

60 percent in real dollar terms in response to news of debt relief; (2) The response is uniformly

positive across debtor countries; (3) The effect is not an artifact of the currency in which the

revaluation is measured; (4) The control group never experiences a revaluation of greater than 10

percentage points.       Having eliminated outliers, currency concerns, and common shocks as

explanations for our result, there is another, much trickier, issue to address before proceeding to

formal statistical estimation.



III. Are the Revaluations Driven by Debt Relief or Reforms?

        Countries receive debt relief in return for committing to economic reforms (Cline, 1995).

These reforms take four principal forms—inflation stabilization, privatization, trade

liberalization, capital account liberalization—and there is evidence that the stock market

responds favorably to each one of them (Megginson and Netter, 2001; Perotti and Van Oijen,

2001; Henry, 2000a, 2002, 2003). Therefore, a central issue is whether debt relief or economic

reforms drive the debtor-country stock price increases. To address the issue we conducted a

search to pinpoint the dates on which the reforms occur. The results are outlined in Table V.

        The stabilization dates come from the International Monetary Fund’s Annual Reports and

Henry (2002).       We use the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Quarterly Economic Reports to

identify trade liberalization dates. We check the EIU dates against the trade liberalization dates


11
  Negotiations during the debt crisis were made less unwieldy by proceeding in two steps. First, a select committee
of the largest lenders and the debtor country agreed on the choice of menu options. Second, all of the banks then
decided on the term sheet. Although, the two-step process made the negotiations less cumbersome, it also increased
the time to reach a final agreement because it required meetings on two separate dates.


                                                                                                                16
in the World Bank publication, Trends in Developing Economies (1994) and those in Sachs and

Warner (1995). The privatization dates come from the World Bank Privatization Transaction

Database, which contains the names and dollar amounts of all privatizations occurring between

1988 and 1999. We use the privatization database to identify the first year in which there were

recorded sales of state-owned enterprises. Once we know the year of the first sale, we search the

EIU’s Quarterly Economic Reports for the month in which the start of the privatization program

was announced. We also check the EIU to make sure that there were no privatizations preceding

the starting date of the database. Finally, the capital account liberalization dates come from

Henry (2003).

       A close examination of Table V illustrates the point of the exercise. All of the debtor

countries began implementing major economic reforms before the Brady deal and continued to

do so after the deal was announced. For example, Column 3 of Table V shows that an official

agreement with the IMF immediately precedes, or follows on the heels of every Brady deal.

Since IMF programs follow all of the Brady agreements, Brady agreements may drive up stock

prices because they signal future IMF agreements. Just as debt relief agreements may signal

future IMF agreements, IMF agreements may in turn signal countries’ commitment to future

economic reforms (Williamson, 1994; Collins, 1990; Bruno and Easterly, 1996). If debt relief

agreements are a signal of future productivity-enhancing reforms, then Figure 1 may erroneously

suggest that debt relief drives up valuations when, in fact, the anticipation of future economic

reforms is instead responsible.



IIIA. The Baker Plan Versus the Brady Plan

       We use the Baker Plan and the Brady Plan to help distinguish the response of the stock




                                                                                              17
market to reforms from the response of the stock market to debt relief. Our identification

strategy hangs on a key historical fact.            The Baker Plan called on countries to undertake

extensive reforms but deliberately excluded any plans for debt relief.12 In contrast, the Brady

Plan called for the continuation of reforms begun under the Baker Plan in 1985, but also made an

explicit call for debt relief.

        The difference in focus of the two plans implies that the “news” in Baker was the official

U.S. push for economic reforms while the “news” in Brady was the official U.S. push for debt

relief. In other words, because economic reforms were enacted under the Baker Plan, their

effects should already have been incorporated into stock prices when the Brady Plan was

announced four years later. If markets are efficient, then the stock price reaction to the Brady

Plan should principally reflect the anticipated effect of debt relief.

        On October 8, 1985 the Secretary of the United States Treasury, James A. Baker III,

unveiled his plan for dealing with the third-world debt crisis at the Annual International

Monetary Fund World Bank Meeting in Seoul, Korea. Secretary Baker begins by stressing the

importance of macroeconomic stabilization:

              If the debt problem is going to be solved there must be a “Program for
              Sustained Growth”, incorporating… First and foremost, the adoption by
              principal debtor countries of comprehensive macroeconomic and
              structural policies, supported by the international financial institutions, to
              promote growth and balance of payments adjustment, and to reduce
              inflation (Baker, 1986, p. 308).

After spelling out the need for stabilization Baker called for structural reforms:

            For those countries which have implemented reforms to address the
            imbalances in their economies, a more comprehensive set of policies can
            now be put in place…We believe that such institutional and structural
            policies should include: increased reliance on the private sector, and less

12
 There were 17 countries included in the Baker Plan: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cote
d’ Ivoire, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.
The 16 countries included in the Brady Plan are listed in Table 1.


                                                                                                               18
          reliance on government;…tax reform, labor market reform and development
          of financial markets;…market opening measures to encourage foreign direct
          investment and capital inflows, as well as to liberalize trade (Baker, 1986,
          p. 310).

The enumeration of desired reforms in Secretary Baker’s speech displays an attention to detail

that underscores the importance of what he does not mention: debt relief. Baker uses or alludes

to the word “reform” more than 25 times during the course of his speech. But the phrases “debt

relief” and “debt reduction” do not appear.

       While testifying before the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs,

two weeks later, Secretary Baker erased any doubt that the absence of the phrase “debt relief”

from his speech was an error of omission. Witness the interchange between Secretary Baker and

Representative Bill McCollum of Florida.


              McCollum: “Do you anticipate that there might have to be some
              forgiveness or moratorium on interest payments to some of these
              countries in the process by the commercial lending institutions in this
              country?”

              Baker: “No, sir; I don’t contemplate that and I think that would be the
              wrong road for us to start down. . .I don’t think there should be any
              moratorium; I don’t think there should be any capitalization of interest
              proposals or anything like that…” (Baker, 1985, p. 26).


       Roughly four years later, on March 10, 1989, Baker’s successor, Nicholas F. Brady

revealed his plan for dealing with the debt crisis to the Brookings Institution and the Bretton

Woods Committee Conference on Third World Debt. In no uncertain terms, Secretary Brady

stated that the U.S. government was going to continue pushing the reforms that began under the

Baker Plan:

          In 1985 we paused and took stock of our progress in addressing the
          problem. As a result of that review, together we brought forth a new
          strategy, centered on economic growth. This still makes sense…The



                                                                                            19
            experience of the past four years demonstrates that the fundamental
            principles of the current strategy remain sound: Growth is essential to the
            resolution of debt problems. Debtor nations will not achieve sufficient
            levels of growth without reform (Brady, 1989, p. 116).

But in addition to the reforms, Secretary Brady explicitly called for debt relief. In sharp contrast

to the words of his predecessor in Seoul four years earlier, Brady explicitly used the phrase “debt

reduction” or “debt service reduction” eighteen times in his speech. For example:

            Let me reiterate that we believe that the fundamental principles of the
            current [Baker] strategy remain valid. However, we believe that the time
            has come for all members of the international community to consider…
            debt and debt service reduction on a voluntary basis…The path toward
            greater creditworthiness and a return to the markets for many debtor
            countries needs to involve debt reduction (Brady, 1989, pp. 117-118).


In a rare moment of consensus, U.S. politicians, the international banking fraternity, officials in

debtor countries, and academics all agreed that the Brady Plan represented a continuation of the

Baker Plan’s commitment to reforms, with the important change that debt relief now had the

official support of the United States Treasury.13 James D. Robinson III, Chairman and CEO of

American Express best summarizes the consensus in his response to Brady’s speech:

            In the next few days we will encounter statements to the effect that the
            Brady Plan means the death of the Baker Plan. My advice is to ignore these
            statements. The focus of both plans is on growth in the debtor countries.
            The principles of the Baker Plan have not been abandoned. They will have
            to be embodied in the Brady Plan as it is carried forward. What is new, of
            course, is the explicit recognition of debt reduction as an essential element
            in the search for solutions (Robinson, 1989, p. 101).


        The historical record leaves little ambiguity about the fundamental similarity—reforms—

and the key difference—debt relief—between the Baker Plan and the Brady Plan. Nevertheless,

there are several potential concerns with our identification strategy. We will enumerate and

Mexican Finance Minister, Jesús Silva Herzog (1989), and Stanley Fischer (1989)


                                                                                                              20
attempt to address these concerns in Section IV. But, first things first. Before we can interpret

the results, we need to know what they are. This is the topic to which we now turn.



IV. Formal Empirical Results

       We evaluate the statistical significance of the relationships apparent in Figure 1 by

estimating the following regression:

                                Rit = α i + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROLit + ε it ,               (1)

Where Rit is the real return in dollars on country i ’s stock market index in month t, BRADYit is

a dummy variable that is equal to one in [-12, 0]. CONTROL is a dummy variable that is equal

to one in all of the control countries in Brady-Announcement months [-12, 0]. We also estimate

BRADY and CONTROL using nine-month [-9, 0], six-month [-6, 0], and three-month [-3, 0]

windows. The country-specific intercepts allow for the possibility that average expected returns

may differ across countries due to imperfect capital market integration.

       Equation (1) constrains the coefficients on BRADY to be the same across all months,

which means that the parameter γ 1 measures the average monthly stock market response to all

Brady Plan Announcements. Since the dummy variable for the event window is twelve months

long, the total stock market response to debt relief for the Brady countries is given by twelve

times the parameter estimate.

       A different estimation technique would be to use a seemingly unrelated regression

(SUR). This approach would have the advantage of providing a unique coefficient estimate for

each country for each event. However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. The low

power of hypothesis tests in unconstrained systems severely weakens the ability of the event

study methodology to detect the impact of the event. Second, SUR requires a balanced panel.



                                                                                              21
Due to the limited time series availability of stock market data, creating a balanced panel would

result in discarding some of the 10 debt relief events. Given data limitations, the pooled cross-

section time series framework seems appropriate.

       With an unbalanced panel, it is not possible to relax the assumption of no

contemporaneous correlation of the error term across countries. Therefore, we will take indirect

precautions. Specifically, three of the alternative regression specifications to equation (1) will

estimate abnormal returns relative to the World stock market index, US stock market index, and

finally IFC’s emerging stock market index. Since all of the sample countries are emerging

markets, the inclusion of a composite emerging market index as a right-hand-side variable will

partially control for contemporaneously correlated disturbance terms. Including the emerging

market index does not change the results.



IVA. Basic Results

       The first row of Table VI (Panel A)—labeled ‘Country-Specific Mean’—gives the results

from the baseline specification in equation (1).         White standard errors are reported in

parentheses. Column (1a) shows that the coefficient on BRADY for the 12-month window [-12,

0] is 0.05 and is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Multiplying the coefficient by 12

gives the total effect, a 60-percent increase in the real dollar value of the stock market. Column

(1b) gives the coefficient estimate for the CONTROL dummy. In contrast to the estimate for the

BRADY countries, the revaluation effect associated with the control group is economically

weak, 0.005, and statistically insignificant. Column (1c) provides the p-value from a two-sided

F-test of the hypothesis that the coefficient estimate on BRADY is equal to the coefficient

estimate on CONTROL. The p-value for this test is 0.001. The difference between the BRADY




                                                                                                  22
estimate and the CONTROL estimate is statistically significant. In other words, the stock market

in BRADY countries rises by roughly 60 percentage points more than it does in the CONTROL

group.

         The results using 9-month, 6-month, and 3-month windows are all consistent with the 12-

month estimates.     The coefficient estimate of BRADY ranges from 0.048 to 0.052 and is

statistically significant in every specification. Furthermore, the BRADY estimate is always

significantly larger than the estimate of CONTROL (except for the 3-month window). Row 2 of

Table VI (Panel A)—labeled, ‘Constant Mean’—presents estimates of equation (1) using a

constant intercept term, α , instead of country-specific intercept terms. The results are almost

identical to those in Row 1.



IVB. Controlling for World Stock Markets

         Equation (1) provides a parsimonious baseline specification of abnormal returns, but it

does not allow for the influence of world stock markets on local returns. In order to do so, we

follow Kho, Lee and Stulz (2000) and use the international capital asset pricing model (ICAPM)

to measure the expected return on each country’s stock market index. Specifically, we now

estimate:

                               Rit = α i + β RtW + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROL + ε it ,          (2)

Where RtW is the real return in dollars on the Morgan Stanley Capital Market Index (MSCI) in

month t. While barriers to the international movement of capital may raise questions about the

economic assumption of an ICAPM, as a purely statistical matter, returns on world stock market

indices do have some predictive power for stock returns in the countries under consideration




                                                                                             23
(Henry 2000a).14

        Row 3 of Table VI (Panel A) presents estimates of BRADY and CONTROL using

equation (2). Row 4 presents estimates that use real U.S. stock returns, RtUS , in place of RtW .

Row 5 presents estimates that use the real dollar return on the IFC Emerging Market index,

RtLDC , in place of RtW . Row 6 presents estimates that use all three sets of world stock returns

simultaneously. The results in Rows 3 through 6 perfectly mirror those under the benchmark

specification in Rows 1 and 2. The coefficient on BRADY is statistically significant under all

four ICAPM specifications. The point estimate ranges from 4.9 to 3.9 percent per month, and

the estimate of BRADY is significantly larger than the estimate of CONTROL in all but the 3-

month window estimates.



IVC. Other Robustness Checks

        The estimates in Panel A of Table VI adjust for cross-country heteroscedasticity and

cross-country correlation, but they do not account for potential serial correlation in the error

terms. Hence, White standard errors may not be sufficient to ensure the reliability of the

estimates in Panel A. To address this concern, Panel B of Table VI re-estimates all of the

specifications in Panel A using Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). FGLS allows for

the possibility of serial correlation, in addition to correcting for cross-country heteroscedasticity.

        The estimations using FGLS in Panel B yield the same conclusions as the OLS estimates

in Panel A. Every FGLS point estimate of BRADY in Panel B of Table VI is statistically

significant. The FGLS monthly point estimates of BRADY are smaller than those obtained

using OLS, but they are still large.          The smallest point estimate for the 12-month window is

0.034— a total revaluation of greater than 40 percent. Furthermore, the coefficient on BRADY

remains significantly larger than the coefficient on CONTROL in all of the specifications except

for some of those that use 3-month windows.



V. Alternative Explanations

         Section IV establishes the statistical robustness of the central result: In anticipation of the

announcement of debt relief agreements, there is an economically large and statistically

significant increase in the stock market. There are, however, many possible interpretations of

this fact. Section III argues that since markets are forward looking, stock prices in the debtor

countries should have priced in the effect of economic reforms at the time of the Baker Plan. If

the only “news” in the Brady Plan was the information about debt relief then debt relief may

plausibly be viewed as the proximate cause of the revaluation.

         Plausibility, however, hangs on the validity of three key assumptions: (1) The market

believed that the Baker Plan would lead to reforms; (2) The depth and scope of reforms under

Brady were the same as those under Baker; and (3) The reforms went through as expected.

Figure 3 leaves little doubt that market participants in debtor countries viewed the Baker Plan as

a signal of future economic reforms—stock market values increased by an average of 22 percent

in real dollar terms over the 12-month period preceding the Baker Plan.15 So, the two key

questions are: Were the depth and scope of the reforms the same under Baker and Brady? And

did the reforms go through as anticipated? We now address each of these questions in turn.

  The countries represented in Figure 3 match the countries represented in Figure 1 almost perfectly. Jordan is the
only country represented in Figure 1 that is not represented in Figure 3. This is because Jordan was not a Baker
country.

VA. Do Differences in Depth And Scope of Reforms Drive the Results?

        If the Brady Plan called for structural changes that were not a part of the Baker Plan, then

the Brady Plan could contain important new information about reforms. Therefore, the estimates

in Section IV may be interpreted as the marginal effect of debt relief only if the reforms

implemented under Baker were not be radically different from those that continued under Brady.

        Consistent with the earlier quote by American Express CEO James D. Robinson III (see

Section IIIA), a careful reading of both Baker and Brady’s speeches reveals no significant

differences between the reforms advocated under each plan.16 In fact, the reforms called for by

the two plans were so similar that they came to be summarized as the “Washington Consensus”

by John Williamson (1990)17. An exhaustive summary of the Washington Consensus is beyond

the scope of this paper—see Williamson’s paper for details—but again, the central idea was that

countries should stabilize inflation, privatize state-owned enterprises, liberalize trade, and permit

greater foreign direct investment.



VB. Did the Reforms Go Through As Anticipated?

        There may have been a consensus about the desired set of reforms, but the very need for a

Brady Plan in addition to the Baker Plan suggests that at least some of the expected reforms did

not go through as planned.18 If the countries did not actually undertake the reforms they agreed

to implement under the Baker Plan, then signing a Brady agreement could signal to the markets a


16
   See also the remarks by Stanley Fischer (Fischer, 1989 and 1990).
17
   See also Fischer’s comments on Williamson’s paper (Fischer, 1990).
18
   This is a complicated issue. The Baker Plan called for three things: reforms, financial support from the
International Financial Institutions (IFIs), and new money from the commercial banks. The Baker Plan assumed
that the banks would be willing to lend new money as long as countries implemented reforms. This assumption
turned out to be wrong. In spite of substantial—if not complete—reforms on the part of the debtors, the banks were
unwilling to extend new loans. There is a widely held view that the banks were unwilling to do so because of the
existing debt overhang (Cline, 1995).


                                                                                                                26
new commitment to reform. Accordingly, the stock price increase in that case would reflect the

expected effects of both reforms and debt relief.

           If the Brady Plan contained new information about reforms, then a more accurate

measure of the effect of debt relief might be the difference between the stock market reaction to

the Brady Plan and the reaction to the Baker Plan. The reaction to the Brady Plan measures the

effect of debt relief and reforms; the stock market reaction to the Baker Plan measures the effect

of reforms only. Thus, in principle, the difference between the Baker revaluation depicted in

Figure 3 (22 percentage points) and the Brady revaluation (60 percentage points) yields the

marginal effect of debt relief: 38 percentage points.

           But viewing the difference in the market’s response to Baker and Brady as the marginal

effect of debt relief is also not without problems. The expected effect of reform on the stock

market is given by the benefit of reform conditional on success times the probability of success.

Even assuming that the conditional benefit of a successful reform was the same under Baker and

Brady, there may have been differing probabilities of success. For example, some argue that

debt relief gave governments the capital they needed to push through further reforms with a

populace that had grown weary with austerity measures and structural adjustment.19 If this is the

case, then the difference between the stock market response to Baker and Brady reflects both the

effect of debt relief and the higher probability of successful reforms under Brady.



VC. Direct Controls for the Effect of Economic Reforms

           We deal directly with the concern that economic reforms implemented around the time of

the Brady Plan may still have contained some “news” by including dummy variables for reforms


19
     See the remarks by Herzog (1989) and Sarbanes (1989).


                                                                                               27
in all of our earlier regressions. There is sufficient heterogeneity in the timing of the economic

reforms (Table V) to allow us to control directly for their effect on stock prices. To do so, we

construct a series of reform dummies for each country: TRADE; PRIVATIZE; LIBERALIZE.

These variables take on the value 1 during the month a reform is announced and in each of the

preceding 11 months. We then estimate the following regression:

 Rit = α i + β RtW + γ 1BRADYit + γ 2CONTROLit + γ 3TRADEit + γ 4 PRIVATEit + γ 5 LIBERALIZEit + ε it
(3).

       Table VII presents the results. The coefficient on BRADY is significant at the 1 percent

or 5 percent level for every window, and is significantly different from the coefficient on

CONTROL in every specification. The results are also consistent with the view that stock prices

incorporated the effect of economic reforms long before the Brady Plan was announced.

       Stock market liberalizations are the only economic reform implemented around the time

of the Brady Plan that have any effect on the markets. It is no coincidence that stock market

liberalizations are also the only reform in our regression that was not a part of the Washington

Consensus.     The Baker Plan called for the liberalization of foreign direct investment;

liberalization of portfolio equity investment is not directly mentioned. In other words, stock

market liberalizations were a surprise. Consistent with a number of papers, the stock market

liberalization dummy is significant for the [-6, 0] and [-3, -1] windows (Henry, 2000a, b, 2003).

       Because every debt relief agreement closely coincides with an IMF agreement, we cannot

disentangle the debt relief effect by inserting into equation (3) a dummy variable for IMF

programs that coincide with debt relief announcements. An IMF dummy constructed in that way

would be collinear with the BRADY dummy and present the attendant econometric problems.

Therefore, we adopt a different tack. We examine whether the stock market responds to IMF

agreements that are not accompanied by debt relief.


                                                                                                  28
        We do so by constructing for each country a list of all IMF programs that did not occur

within a year (before or after) of the announcement of its Brady agreement. We then create a

dummy variable, IMFPROGRAM, which takes on the value one for all such programs, and

estimate the following regression:

                                   Rit = α + β RtW + γ 1IMFPROGRAM it + ε it .                              (4)

Following the earlier specifications, we estimate 12-month, 9-month, 6-month, and 3-month

windows. If the stock market responds positively to IMF agreements that are not accompanied

by debt relief, then the estimate of γ 1 should be positive and significant.

        There is no evidence that the stock market responds positively to IMF agreements that are

not associated with a Brady debt relief agreement. The coefficient estimate of IMFPROGRAM

is negative and statistically insignificant in every specification. The estimate for the 12-month

window is –0.016; the estimate for the 9-month window is -0.011; the estimate for the 6-month

window is -0.004; the estimate for the 3-month window is -0.027.20




VI. Why Do Market Values Rise?

        Do the debtor country stock price increases reflect an irrational exuberance about the

efficacy of debt relief? Or, do they rationally forecast important subsequent changes in the

countries’ economic fundamentals? Theory points to three pieces of data that can help answer

the question: the net resource transfer (NRT), investment, and growth.

        The NRT is the net flow of real resources into a country. In theory, LDCs should

experience positive NRTs, as the rate of return in these countries should be higher than in rich


20
  The insignificance of the IMFPROGRAM variable is consistent with evidence that the market responds positively
to IMF agreements, only when they are announced in the midst of high inflation (Henry, 2002).


                                                                                                             29
countries. However, the NRT may suddenly turn negative if adverse shocks or poor economic

management: (1) drive creditors to call in existing loans; and (2) make potential new creditors

unwilling to lend.

         Because the government pays its external debt by taxing domestic firms and households,

the private sector’s expected future tax burden increases sharply when the country’s NRT

suddenly turns negative. The higher future tax burden discourages investment and results in

creditors being able to recover less than they would if some of the debt was forgiven. By

reducing the implicit marginal tax rate on expected future cash flows, debt relief can remove the

debt overhang, thereby restoring positive NRTs, investment, and growth (Krugman, 1989; Sachs,

1989).



VIA. Is There a Change in NRT, Investment, and Growth?

         Table VIII reveals a clear association between the Brady debt restructuring and changes

in the sign of the NRT. In every one of the years from [-18, -9] the median NRT to the Brady

countries is positive. At the onset of the Debt Crisis (roughly year –7), the NRT turns negative

and remains so until the Brady Plan (year 0). After the Brady Plan, the NRT turns positive and

remains so for the rest of the sample. The table also shows that the change in the sign of the

NRT occurs uniformly across almost all Brady countries.21

         Figure 4 shows that there was also an investment boom in the aftermath of the Brady

Plan. In the five years prior to debt relief, the average growth rate of the capital stock in the

Brady countries was 1.6 percent per year. In the five years following debt relief, the capital

stock grew at a rate of 3.5 percent per year. The difference between the two growth rates—1.9


21
  In Poland, the NRT turned positive in 1991—before its debt relief plan was unveiled. However, following
Poland’s plan, there was a three-fold increase in the level of NRT.


                                                                                                            30
percentage points—is not small. Assuming a standard production function in which capital

accounts for about one-third of output, a 1.9 percentage point increase in the capital stock raises

growth by almost one percentage point per year—0.63 percentage points, to be exact (one-third

times 1.9).

       Growth rates also increased. Figure 5 plots the average deviation of the growth rate of

per capita GDP from its country-specific mean in event time for all 16 Brady countries versus

that of the control group. The message is clear. The Brady countries experience abnormally

high growth rates in each of the five years following the Brady plan. There is no significant

change in the average growth rate of the control group.



VIB. Does the Stock Market Rationally Forecast the Changes?

       We also examine whether the stock market predicts the change in NRT and growth.

Table IX demonstrates a strong correlation between the sign of the cumulative abnormal return

on a country’s stock market and the change in the sign of the NRT. In 9 of 10 countries, the sign

of the cumulative abnormal return matches the change in the sign of the NRT.

       Table IX also shows a strong correlation between the sign of a country’s cumulative

abnormal return on a country’s stock market and the sign of its growth deviation. In 9 of 10

countries, the sign of the cumulative abnormal return matches the sign of abnormal GDP growth

in the year following the Brady Plan. In 9 of 10 countries, the sign of the cumulative abnormal

return matches the sign of the cumulative abnormal GDP growth for the period [0, +2] and

similarly in 8 of the 10 countries for the period [0, +5].


VIC. What Happens in the Long Run?




                                                                                                31
       Ongoing commitment to economic reforms is essential for the long-run effectiveness of

debt restructuring agreements. Figure 6 illustrates the point. In the three countries in which

reforms stalled temporarily—Jordan, Nigeria, and the Philippines—the initial rise in stock

market valuations disappears within a year.

       More generally, it is interesting to ask how stock markets in the Brady countries perform

relative to the control group in the years subsequent to the Brady Plan. Table X shows that the

average three-year and five-year return on the stock market in the Brady countries exceeds that

of the control group. Statistical inference about stock returns over long horizons in volatile

markets is a thorny task. Accordingly, we make no attempt to do so. Nonetheless, it is worth

noting that the overall pattern in Table X is not inconsistent with the investment and growth

profiles of the Brady countries relative to their control group counterpart (Figures 4 and 5).




VII. Do the Results Reflect a Wealth Transfer to the Countries from the Banks?

       The results suggest that debt relief generates large wealth gains for the debtor countries,

but it is important to ask whether these gains came at the expense of the western commercial

banks and their shareholders. Figure 2 suggests that debt relief is not a zero sum game, but we

now examine the result more thoroughly.

       Since Figure 2 is based on numbers from only 11 commercial banks, we begin by

checking whether a large stock price increase for one or two banks drives the result. Table X

lists the name of each exposed bank, its loan exposure as a fraction of bank capital, its stock

price increase during the 12 months leading up to March 1989, and its median 12-month stock

price increase from 1980 to 1995. All 11 commercial banks experienced stock price increases

that were larger than their median 12-month stock price increase. The probability of this



                                                                                                 32
randomly occurring is 0.0005 percent.22

        We also checked the result by running a series of panel regressions. The specifications

are identical to those used in Tables VI and VII with two important differences. First, instead of

debtor country stock returns on the left-hand side, we now have a panel of monthly stock returns

of 20 US commercial banks: 11 that have significant LDC loan exposure and 9 that do not

(Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga, 1993). Second, the two dummy variables are now EXPOSED

and NONEXPOSED. For each of the 11 US commercial banks with heavy LDC loan exposure,

the variable EXPOSED takes on the value 1 during the 12-month window preceding the official

Brady announcement in March of 1989 and is 0 otherwise. The variable NONEXPOSED is

analogously defined for the 9 banks without LDC loan exposure.

        All regressions were estimated using robust standard errors. The results confirm the

picture. The coefficient on EXPOSED—the monthly abnormal return associated with the Brady

Plan—ranges from 0.025 to 0.027 in alternative specifications and is significant at the 1-percent

confidence level. Multplying the coefficient estimate of 0.025 by 12 gives a total abnormal

return of 30 percent, which is consistent with the magnitude in Figure 2. The coefficient on

NONEXPOSED is statistically and economically insignificant in almost every specification.

Having confirmed the statistical significance of Figure 2, it is useful to consider the total net

wealth effect of the Brady Plan—the sum of the benefits to shareholders less any costs of

implementing the plan.

        The costs of the restructuring were small (Section I, page 8). On the benefit side, the

total market capitalization of debtor country stock markets rose by a total of 42 billion dollars.

Importantly, 42 billion represents only the wealth effect on the publicly traded corporate sector,


22
  See Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga, (1993) for a detailed analysis of the commercial banks stock price reaction to
the Brady Deal.


                                                                                                               33
which constitutes a relatively small fraction of economic activity in these countries. Since debt

relief seems to have positive effects on the rest of the economy (Section VI) 42 billion dollars

probably underestimates the total benefit to the debtor countries. Similarly, because we do not

have data on the Japanese, German, and British banks that had significant LDC exposure, the

13.3 billion dollar increase in the market capitalization of US banks probably understates the

total wealth gains to developed country shareholders. Hence, a conservative estimate suggests

that the Brady Plan generated a 55.3 billion dollar wealth increase of which 42 billion accrued to

shareholders in the debtor countries and 13.3 billion went to the creditors.



VIII. Conclusion

       Understanding why the Brady Plan produced rising asset prices, increased investment and

faster growth is pivotal to understanding the circumstances under which debt restructuring can be

expected to yield efficiency gains.      The Brady Plan worked because debt relief was the

appropriate policy response for a group of middle-income LDCs where debt overhang genuinely

stood in the way of profitable new lending and investment. Hence, the key questions for the

current debate over collective action clauses and sovereign debt restructuring would seem to be

the following: (1) How to determine if a country suffers from debt overhang; and (2) Will

allowing a debtor country to unilaterally invoke a restructuring procedure yield the same kinds of

efficiency gains that were achieved under the multilateral framework of the Brady Plan?

       While the evidence suggests that that there can be large efficiency gains to debt

restructuring in middle-income LDCs, it is not clear that the results can be used to evaluate the

prospects for debt relief in the world’s poorest countries. For instance, debt relief may not yield

efficiency gains for the world’s highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs), because it is not obvious



                                                                                                34
that they suffer from debt overhang. Instead, the more conspicuous obstacle to investment and

growth in the HIPCs seems to be weak economic institutions and infrastructure (Arslanalp and

Henry 2004).

Table IV. News About Debt Relief Diffuses Slowly.

Argentina

July 23, 1991: The International Monetary Fund approves a 1 billion dollar stand-by loan (Economist
Intelligence Unit, QER).

September 20, 1991: Argentina's economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, comes to Washington to jump-start
negotiations on the country's $61bn debt (Financial Times, September 20, 1991). Argentina's main creditors
agree to a restructuring of $ 1.5 billion in debt (Washington Post).

March 31, 1992: Argentina secures a $3.15bn extended facility fund loan from the IMF. Approval of the loan is
important for securing a restructuring with the creditor banks. Some $900m of the funds can be set aside for use
as enhancements (Financial Times, April 1, 1992).

April 7, 1992: Argentina and its creditor banks reach an agreement. Banks will forgive about $8 billion of the
$23 billion they are owed and Argentina will repay its past-due interest and begin repayment of its remaining
debt (New York Times, April 8, 1992).


Nigeria

October 2, 1990: The resolution of the five-month deadlock over rescheduling terms for Nigeria's $5.5bn
commercial bank debt appears likely (Financial Times, October 3, 1990).

November 2, 1990: Nigeria and its creditor banks fail to agree on a rescheduling package after a three-day
meeting in London (Financial Times).

February 26, 1991: Talks between Nigeria and its creditor banks begin in London. The Nigerian military
government plans to restructure the country's estimated $35bn external debt before next October's return to
civilian rule (Financial Times, February 26, 1991).

March 2, 1991: Nigeria and its commercial bank creditors agree in principle on a rescheduling and buy-back
agreement covering $5.8bn of debt (Financial Times, March 4, 1991; EIU Country Report–No: 2 1991, pp 1, 12).


Venezuela

July 25, 1989: Nicholas Brady says that the Mexican deal will set a “pattern” for dealing with the debt problems
of other nations. Brady puts the Philippines, Venezuela and Costa Rica at the head of the list (July 25, 1989,
Washington Post).

March 21, 1990: Venezuela and its creditor banks reach an agreement on the basic terms of a deal. This is the
fourth such deal under the Brady Plan (New York Times).

June 29, 1990: Venezuela finalizes negotiations with its creditor banks. The deal includes more options than any
other Brady deal so far (Financial Times).

The estimation procedure used is Ordinary Least Squares. The stock market data are monthly from December 1979 to July 1999 for all the countries in the Brady and Control
groups. Stock market data are unavailable before December 1984 for Nigeria, Philippines, Venezuela, Columbia, Malaysia, Pakistan; before December 1986 for Turkey;
before December 1989 for Indonesia; before December 1992 for Peru, Poland, China, Hungary, South Africa, Sri Lanka; before September 1993 for Ecuador; and before
December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each
month during a particular event window preceding a Brady plan. Control is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each country in the control group during the
months preceding Brady Plans. The column labeled ‘12-month Window’ presents estimates of Brady and Control using an event window that begins 12 months prior to the
announcement of the Brady Plan and ends with the announcement month. The analogous definition applies to the columns labeled ‘9-month Window,’ ‘6-Month Window’ and
‘3-Month Window.’ For each event window, six regression specifications are estimated. The first row presents estimates of Brady and Control using the benchmark
specification that allows for country-specific intercept terms. Row 2 presents estimates using an alternative specification that allows for only a single intercept term. Row 3
presents estimates using the ICAPM specification that introduces the World stock return index as an additional explanatory variable. Row 4 presents estimates using the US
stock return index instead of the World stock index. Row 5 presents estimates using the LDC stock return index instead. Finally, row 6 presents estimates that use all three sets
of indices simultaneously. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger than the coefficient on Control.
White-corrected standard errors are given in parenthesis. The symbols ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels,
respectively.

and before December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each
month during a particular event window preceding a Brady plan. Four different event windows are utilized. The column labeled ‘12-month Window’ presents estimates of Brady and
Control using an event window that begins 12 months prior to the announcement of the Brady Plan and ends with the announcement month. The analogous definition applies to the columns
labeled ‘9-month Window,’ ‘6-Month Window’ and ‘3-Month Window.’ Control is a dummy variable that takes on the value one for each country in the control group during the months
preceding Brady Plans. Privatize, Trade, and Liberalize are dummy variables that take on the value one during the event window preceding a privatization, trade liberalization and stock
market liberalization, respectively. For each event window, two regression specifications are estimated. The World column presents estimates of Brady, Control, Privatize, Trade, and
Liberalize using the ICAPM specification that introduces the World stock return index as an additional explanatory variable. The Constant Mean column presents estimates using the
specification that allows for only a single intercept term. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger than the
coefficient on Control. The symbols ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

The estimation procedure used is Feasible Generalized Least Squares. . The stock market data are monthly from December 1979 to July 1999 for all the countries in the
Brady and Control groups. Stock market data are unavailable before December 1984 for Nigeria, Philippines, Venezuela, Columbia, Malaysia, Pakistan; before
December 1986 for Turkey; before December 1989 for Indonesia; before December 1992 for Peru, Poland, China, Hungary, South Africa, Sri Lanka; before September
1993 for Ecuador; and before December 1993 for the Czech Republic. The left-hand-side variable is real, dollar-denominated stock returns. Brady is a dummy variable
that takes on the value one for each month during a particular event window preceding a Brady plan. Four different event windows are utilized. The column labeled
‘12-month Window’ presents estimates of Brady and Control using an event window that begins twelve months prior to the announcement of the Brady Plan and ends
with the announcement month. The analogous definition applies to the columns labeled ‘9-month Window,’ ‘6-Month Window’ and ‘3-Month Window.’ Control is a
dummy variable that takes on the value one for each country in the control group during the months preceding Brady Plans. Privatize, Trade, and Liberalize are dummy
variables that take on the value one during the event window preceding a privatization, trade liberalization and stock market liberalization, respectively. For each event
window, two regression specifications are estimated. The World column presents estimates of Brady, Control, Privatize, Trade, and Liberalize using the ICAPM
specification that introduces the World stock return index as an additional explanatory variable. The Constant Mean column presents estimates using the specification
that allows for only a single intercept term. The column labeled Brady>Control shows the p-value for a test that the coefficient on Brady is statistically larger than the
coefficient on Control. The symbols ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Net resource transfers are equal to net resource flows minus interest payments on long-term loans and foreign direct investment profits. The first column lists the years
in event time. The number ‘0’ represents the year in which each country’s Brady Plan was announced. For Control group countries, 0 represents 1989. The next two
columns show the progression of net resource transfers in event time to the Control group and the Brady group. The next five columns show the progression of the net
resource transfers to individual Brady stock market countries in event time. The data on net resource transfers are obtained from World Bank’s Global Development
Finance Data Base.

This table presents the correlation between increases in market valuation before Brady Plan announcements and changes in net resource transfers and
GDP growth afterwards. The first column lists the Brady Stock market countries. The Brady Stock market countries are the countries in the Brady
group with available stock market data as displayed in Table I. The second column identifies the countries that experienced abnormal stock market
returns over the 12 months preceding their Brady Plan announcements. The third column identifies the countries that experienced changes from
negative NRT to positive NRT in the year preceding or during the two years following the announcement. The fourth column identifies the countries
that experienced abnormal GDP growth in the year of the announcement. The fifth and sixth columns identify those that experienced abnormal
growth in the first and second year after the announcement. Finally, the seventh and eight columns identify the countries that experienced abnormal
cumulative GDP growth during the two and five years following the announcement of the Brady Plan. The + sign denotes positive identification of a
country. * Following the Brady Plan in Poland there is no change in the sign of NRT, but the level of NRT almost triples.
