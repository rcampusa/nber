                                            ABSTRACT

This paper develops a model of social interactions with endogenous association. People are assumed
to invest in relationships to maximize their utility. Even in a linear-in-means model, when associations
are endogenous, the effect of macro-group composition on behavior is non-linear and varies across
individuals. We also show that larger groups facilitate sorting. Using data on associations among high
school students, we provide a range of evidence consistent with our model. Individuals associate with
people whose behaviors and characteristics are similar to their own. This tendency is stronger in large
groups. We also show that behaviors vary within and between macro-groups in the way predicted
by endogenous association.

                       Social Interactions and Endogenous Association

I.      Introduction

        Social scientists have increasingly turned to social interactions models, in which

peoples’ behaviors are affected by their social groups, to understand large disparities in

behaviors and outcomes, and especially the low outcomes among underrepresented and

economically disadvantaged groups.1 Economists interested in social interactions have

focused on controlling for the effect of selection into “macro-groups,” such as schools or

neighborhoods, on estimates of social interactions.2 While analogous forces presumably

operate within these macro-groups, to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to

systematically study the effects of endogenous association within groups. The absence of

work on this question is troublesome for, while selection into groups almost surely biases

estimates of the effects of groups up, endogenous association within groups limits the

interpretation of conventional estimates and means that they are almost surely biased

down. If associations are endogenous, social groups will have non-linear effects and

individual characteristics and group composition will interact in determining behavior,

markedly changing the policy implications of social interactions models.

        This paper develops a formal model of within-group associations. We assume that

individuals choose both their behavior and their associations to maximize their utility,

which depends on both their own and their associates’ behaviors and characteristics. We

specify a cost in terms of time and effort to an individual of associating with the other

  See, for instance, Wilson [1987, 1996]; Massey and Denton [1993]; and Jargowsky [1997]. Early studies
often contain weak controls for macro-group selection (Datcher [1982]; Corcoran, Gordon, Laren, and
Solon [1992]).
2
  Recent attention has focused on controlling for macro-group selection. See surveys by Jencks and Mayer
[1990]; Deitz [2002]; and Haurin, Deitz, and Weinberg [2002] and theoretical work by Bayer and Ross
[2006]. More recent studies seek to identify random variation in social groups. Such studies include Bayer,
Ross, and Topa [2004]; Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan [2000]; Borjas [1995]; Case and Katz [1990];
Cutler and Glaeser [1997]; Evans, Oates, and Schwab [1992]; Glaeser, Scheinkman, and Sacerdote [1996,
2003]; Hoxby [2000]; Ioannides and Zabel [Forthcoming]; Solon, Page, and Duncan [2000]; Topa [2001];
Weinberg [2000] and studies in footnote 4.

members of his macro-group. We also assume and provide evidence that people obtain

the most utility from associating with others whose behaviors and characteristics are

similar to their own, known as homophily in sociology.

        We specify a model that yields the standard implication that behaviors depend

linearly on the (weighted) average of the characteristics and actions of the other members

of an individual’s macro-group, with the weights in our model determined by the amount

of their interaction. Even with this linear behavioral model, when associations are

endogenous, macro-group composition has a non-linear effect on behavior and the effect

of macro-groups varies with individual characteristics and behaviors.3 These non-

linearities arise when associations are endogenous because associates’ behaviors and

characteristics will be non-linear functions of own characteristics. To the best of our

knowledge, we are the first to generate these non-linearities endogenously. We apply our

model to understand association patterns in schools. In that context, students who are

inclined to substance use, for instance, in a school-grade where few other students are

inclined toward substance use will be forced to associate with people who do not use

substances, discouraging their own tendency to substance use. As the number of students

inclined to substance use increases, these individuals will find more like-minded

associates accentuating their tendencies.

        At a policy level, these non-linearities and interactions imply that even in a linear-

in-means model, social interactions are not zero-sum. To reduce the amount of a

particular behavior, one would want to avoid placing people who are prone to that

behavior in groups where there are many similar people – in these groups, there will be

enough other people inclined toward the behavior with whom to associate to generate a

 Krivo and Peterson [1996]; Galster, Quercia, and Cortes [2000]; Galster [2002]; and Weinberg, Reagan,
and Yankow [2004]; and Burke and Sass [2006] provide evidence for non-linear effects and interactions.
Non-linear effects have been argued for at least since Crane [1991], although there are few formal micro-
models of these effects (Quercia and Galster [Forthcoming] discuss theories).

                                                    2
high level of the behavior. In terms of estimation, these non-linearities also provide a

potential solution to Manski’s [1993] reflection problem that is quite different from

existing solutions (Brock and Durlauf [2001a,b]; Lee [2006]; Blume and Durlauf [2005];

Lin [2005]; and Shang [2006]).

        Many studies of social interactions exploit relocations of individuals across

macro-groups.4 Most such studies involve relocating individuals who are at-risk along

some dimensions from social groups where many individuals are at risk to social groups

with a mix of people who are and are not at risk. These studies find surprisingly small

effects of social groups. Our model provides an explanation for these small effects. It

indicates that individuals relocated in this way will tend to re-segregate within their new

groups, attenuating any benefits, even if associates do have effects. Consistent with this

hypothesis, Angrist and Lang [2004] and Kling, Ludwig, and Katz [2005] find larger

effects for girls than boys, who may integrate more into their new social groups, and

Clampet-Lundquist, Edin, Kling, and Duncan [2005] provide evidence that the difference

is due to differences in integration into new neighborhoods.

        Emerging studies show that the associations that arise within macro-groups are

not random, but empirical work on social interactions has not taken account of these

results.5 Most studies relate an individual’s behavior to the mean in his macro-group,

implicitly assuming that all members of the macro-group interact equally.6 Some

  Studies include Plotnick and Hoffman [1995]; Ladd and Ludwig [1997]; Aaronson [1998]; Rosenbaum,
DeLuca, and Miller [1999]; Katz, Kling, and Liebman [2001]; Ludwig, Duncan, and Hirschfield [2001];

Jacob [2004]; Weinberg, Reagan, and Yankow [2004]; Kling; Ludwig; and Katz [2005]; and Angrist and
Lang [2004].

  A number of papers show that people prefer to associate with others of the same racial, ethnic, or
religious group (Moody [2001]; Bayer, McMillan, and Rueben [2002]; Marmaros and Sacerdote [2003];
Bisin, Topa, and Verdier [2004]; Mayer and Puller [2006] see, however, Ross [2003]). People who are
different from their macro-groups are less likely to be impacted by them (Duncan, Connell, and Klebanov
[1997]; DiPasquale and Kahn [1999], Cummings, DiPasquale, and Kahn [2001]; Conley and Topa [2001];
and Hoxby [2000]).

  Exceptions are Conley and Udry [2001] and Bandiera and Rasul [2002] and Foster [2006]. Bertrand,
Luttmer, and Mullainathan [2002], Munschi [2002], Grodner and Kniesner [2006]; and Hoxby and

                                                   3
theoretical analyses allow for variations in associations within macro-groups. Anselin

[1988]; Lee [2001]; Brock and Durlauf [2001a, 2001b] specify a fixed weighting matrix

that gives association patterns. This approach ignores that interactions are determined by

behaviors as much as behaviors are determined by interactions (Coleman [1961];

Wiseman [2002]; and Eder [2003] provide vivid examples). A person who does not

smoke, for instance, is unlikely to choose to associate with someone who smokes heavily,

and so the first person’s smoking is unlikely to be much affected by the other person’s

smoking. Weighting-matrix studies provide no guidance as to who a newly added person

will associate with, nor do they indicate how adding or removing people affects the

associations of people who are already in the macro-group and remain in it (Sobel [2001]

makes these points in a particularly striking form). This gap is troublesome given that

most policies to address the effects of social interactions involve moving people across

macro-groups.

         This study employs data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent

Health (Add Health), which surveyed all students in 172 schools, asking about the

respondents’ closest friends as well as their background and behaviors. We provide a

range of evidence consistent with our model of endogenous association. We find that the

majority of variation in friend’s behaviors and characteristics arises within grades in

schools. Individuals associate with others whose behaviors and characteristics are similar

to their own. Consistent with our model, we find that so long as there are a few people

with a particular characteristic in a group, people with that characteristic associate with

each other, and that people avoid associating with people who are different from

themselves until most of the group is comprised of people who are different. We show




Weingarth [2006] use information to specify the group across interactions operate. Conley and Topa
[2001] estimate propensities for racial groups to interact using a structural model. These papers do not
explicitly study the association process, nor do they study how association-patterns are affected by changes
in the population or in the behaviors of group members.

                                                     4
that group size facilitates segregation and show that there is a stronger relationship

between own characteristics and associates’ characteristics in large macro-groups.

       While estimating the effect of endogenous sorting on behaviors is complicated,

we provide evidence that endogenous association affects behavior. As indicated, our

model implies that the availability of some like-minded individuals permits people to

associate with people with the same behavioral tendencies, accentuating their own

behavioral tendencies. Consistent with this implication, we show the mean behavior

among the associates of people who are inclined to a particular behavior (based on their

exogenous characteristics) is higher (relative to people whose characteristics imply that

they are unlikely to have high levels of the behavior) in groups where there some people

inclined to the same behavior. We also show that the availability of people who are

inclined to a particular behavior increases the behaviors of people who are inclined to

that behavior (relative to people whose characteristics imply that they are unlikely to

have high levels of the behavior). Lastly, we provide some two-stage least squares

estimates of the effect of associates’ behaviors on own behavior.

II. A Model

II.A. The Framework

       This section develops a model of social interactions with endogenous association.

People are characterized by observable characteristics, x, and an shock, ε . They choose

an action, y, and a set of associations. An individual with characteristic x and shock ε

who takes action y has a utility of,

                       1                 ⎛ A  ψ A2       A′        A ⎞ α

This utility function has three components: a private utility; a cost of interacting; and a

social utility, each of which is described in turn. Variables with over-bars and A-
                                                                 2
superscripts denote means among a person’s associates ( y A denotes the mean of the

                                              5
squared values of associates’ actions).

           In the empirical analysis, we consider a variety of actions and outcomes. The

actions include substance use and behavioral problems. We also study grades, which

depend on own actions, whose utility depends on associates’ actions, and on associates’

grades (if there are human capital spillovers). The private utility is written to imply that

behavior is a linear function of characteristics.

           Interactions can be costly in terms of time and effort. To capture these costs

parsimoniously, we assume that people incur a cost, c, per unit of time spent interacting

with others, where T (x, ε , y ) denotes the total time that the person spends interacting

with others.7 We assume that associations are binary. Because of random encounters,

people are assumed spend t 0 N “passively associating” with every other member of

their macro-group. Here N gives the size of the macro-group, so total passive associations

do not depend on group size. People can also “actively associate” with particular

members of their macro-group, spending an additional unit of time for a total of

1 + t0 N .

           The social utility has both standard and novel components. In Manski’s [1994]

terminology, θ and γ give the effect of others’ behaviors (the “endogenous effect”) and

characteristics (the “exogenous effect”). The parameters ψ , ω , and Φ have no

counterparts in Manski’s framework, because they do not affect the action directly. They

affect the utility of associations and actions through their effect on associations. High

values of ψ reduce the utility of associating with people with extreme values of y. The

parameter ω allows the utility of associating with someone to vary with the other

person’s behavior, y, and for the effect to depend on a person’s own characteristics. For

instance, people with behavioral problems, may produce disutility. The parameter Φ is



7
    The cost could be negative if the opportunity cost of time is low and people like interacting.

                                                        6
analogous, but reflects the effect of associates’ characteristics on the utility of

associating. For instance, people likely obtain utility from associating with people who

are attractive or athletic and people of the same race or ethnicity.

        Once people are viewed as choosing to associate with a portion of their groups, it

becomes important to consider how the number of associates affect the strength of

interactions, which is governed by α . One view, which comes closest to the literature, is

that new associations completely crowd out existing ones, leaving the total effect of

associates fixed, that α = 0 . One might think that people who have many associates are

affected by their associates (as a whole) more than people with few associates, that
                                                                           A     A
α > 0 . To simplify notation, it is convenient to define γ = 1 − α and z ≡ z T a , which

is the mean of some variable z among a person’s associates weighted by the total amount

of interactions, T.

II.B. Solving the Model

        Differentiation with respect to y gives the person’s optimal action,

                                     (              )
                           y = β ′x + θy A + γx A T α + ε .       (*)

This is the standard linear-in-means behavioral equation, where the strength of the social

effect varies across people if α ≠ 0 . We consider a model with a binary, scalar

characteristic. (Weinberg [2005] discusses a model with continuous characteristics.) We

begin by eliminating the action to focus on associations on characteristics. We assume

that the characteristic takes on values x ∈ {− 1,1} , and refer to people with these

characteristics as low and high types. Let π i denote the share of the group with

x = i ∈ {− 1,1}. We assume Φ = 1 and that the other social utility parameters (θ, ψ, ω, and

γ) are all zero.

        Let π iA| j ∈ [0, π i ] denote the measure of people with characteristic xi with whom a

person with characteristic x j associates, which must be non-negative and is constrained


                                                7
by group compostion. With Φ > 0 and the values of the characteristic taking on opposite

signs, people only associate with people of the same type, so that a type-i person chooses

π iA|i ∈ [0, π i ] . The first order condition for active associations is,

  ∂U ⎛ ′                    ′
                                    (

composition constraint that π HA |H ≤ π H , as a function of π H . It is possible to show that

the desired π HA |H is non-increasing (and decreasing if α < 1 ) in π H . The figure also

shows a 45º line, which gives the maximum feasible value of π HA|H . Up to three regions

may be present. In region 1, the desired active associations exceed the maximum possible

given the population composition. In the second region, the composition constraint does

not bind and active associations are positive. In the third region, the person chooses not

to actively associate. As the bold curve in the figure shows, active associations increase

in region 1; decrease in region 2; and are zero in region 3. To fully characterize the

model, the figures show all three regions, but the third may be less relevant, than the

others especially with sorting on multiple dimensions.

possible to show that this curve is non-decreasing and concave (when α < 1) . Intuitively,

when more of the group is high, a greater share of passive associations will be with highs,

which decreases highs’ motivation to actively associate with other highs (so long as
                                                                          A

The bold curve shows that x H increases monotonically, with the greatest increase at low

levels (in region 1).

            Except on the left (and extreme right), changes in group composition have less

effect on highs’ associates than implied by the average characteristics in the group (given

by the diagonal line from (0, x L ) to (1, x H ) . This concavity, which is present except in

region 3, is the key to our results.
                                                                  A                           A    A
            Panel C shows that the difference in x between highs and lows, x H − x L , is

hump-shaped in π H . Intuitively, in groups that are largely composed of one of the

groups, there is little scope for sorting, so the associations of both types are relatively

similar. Segregation is greatest when there are many members of both groups.

II.C. Group Size

            A novel implication of our model is that sorting should be greater in large groups

than in small groups. Panel A of Figure 2 shows that increasing group size reduces the

desired level of π HA|H . This can be seen from (**) where N and π iA|i only appear

multiplicatively, so as N increases, the same social influence can be obtained with a
                                                                             A
proportionately lower level of π HA|H . Panel B shows that x H increases in region 1 and is

otherwise unchanged (the increase in N corresponds to more associations in region 1, but
                                                                                                   A Max
is offset by the decrease in π HA|H in region 2). Increasing group size shifts the x

curve up because the amount of weight placed on passive associations does not change,

but for any given level of π H , there are more highs with whom other highs can associate.

The model implies more sorting in large groups when either group’s associations are

constrainted.

       Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman [1996] and Graham [2005] estimate the

strength of social interactions using variations across large groups or variations in group

size. Insofar as large groups facilitate sorting one might expect more variation in large

groups. Endogenous association likely biases estimates using Glaeser, Sacerdote, and

Scheinkman’s method upward, but estimates using Graham’s method downward.8 At a

policy level, our results on macro-group size indicate that attempts to integrate people

from different groups will be more successful if macro-groups are kept small, limiting

peoples’ ability to re-segregate within groups.

II.D. Crowding Out

       As indicated, once the number of associations is endogenous, one needs to think

about how the number of associates someone has affects the strength of the social

influence he experiences. By focusing on associates’ means, existing models implicitly

assume that additional associations fully crowd out existing ones ( α = 0 ), but it seems

likely that people with more associates will be affected by them more.

       It is possible to show that decreasing crowding out increases the difference in the

mean associations between highs and lows. This effect is particularly large when most of

the group is made up of one type or the other and in the middle. Thus, the assumption of

complete crowding out, which is implicit in the literature, limits the scope for people to

segregate within their macro-groups by active associating.

II.E. Endogenous Actions

       So far we have considered models with sorting on exogenous characteristics. This

section focuses on a binary action, y ∈ {− 1,1} , assuming that people derive utility from

associating with people taking the same action ( θ > 0 ). (For simplicity, we assume that




                                             10
the other social utility parameters, ψ, Φ, ω, and γ, are zero.) Conditional on the

distribution of actions, sorting on an endogenous behavior is identical to sorting on an

exogenous characteristic.

           Characterizing the equilibrium involves solving for the share of the group taking

an action as a function of the distribution of exogenous characteristics in the group. A

person with characteristic xi takes action y H if,

denote the value of ε at which a person with x = 0 or x = xi is indifferent between the

actions. For simplicity, we again assume that xi ∈ {− 1,1} . The probability that a person

with characteristic xi takes the low (high) action is ρ L|i ≡ F (ε i* ) ( ρ H |i ≡ 1 − F (ε i* ) ),

where F (.) denotes the cumulative distribution function of ε.

of π H on the mean action can be calculated by differentiating this expression with

respect to π H and rearranging. Formally,

because its denominator will be small, so that changes in the share of highs in the group

will have a particularly large effect on mean behavior.

           Figure 3 shows the share of the group and people with the high and low

characteristic taking the high action as a function of the share of the group with the high

characteristic and the share of the group with the high action assuming that ε is

distributed uniformly with bounds such that people are always in the interior of the

support. This assumption is appealing because it implies that behaviors are linear in

characteristics and associations. In both panels, the share of each type taking the high

action is non-linear. The steeper sections at low and high levels emerge because at low

levels, introducing a few highs makes it possible for highs to find like-minded associates,

while at the high end, eliminating the few remaining highs makes it impossible for lows

to find like-minded associates.

  Under these assumptions, the first term is negative and more negative whenever either of the groups has
fewer active associations, which will be at extreme values of ρ H (and π H ). The second and third terms
are zero whenever people’s active associations are unconstrained or zero and negative when the constraint
π iA|i ≤ π i   binds, which will be at extreme values of ρ H (and           π H ). As π iA|i   increases, these terms become

         While the uniform case is useful for demonstrating that the model generates non-

linearities endogenously, it is probably more realistic to assume that the shock, ε, is

normally distributed. In this case, it is possible to show that the gap in both behaviors and

associations between people with the high and low characteristic are hump-shaped in the

share of the group with the high characteristic.10

         Figure 4 shows results for normally distributed shocks. The difference in the

action between people with the high and low characteristic is increasing in the share of

the group that has the high characteristic and the share of the group with the high action.

The relationship between the average behavior in the population and the share of the

group with the high characteristic is non-linear, convex at low levels and concave at high

levels. The difference in the mean behavior of the associates of people with the high and

low characteristic are also hump-shaped in the share of the group with the high

characteristic (and the high behavior). These implications are tested below.

II.F. Implications

       A number of important implications arise immediately from the non-linear

relationship between group composition and behavior. First, it breaks the zero-sum

implication of the standard, linear-in-means model. A number of studies across a range of

disciplines have argued for a non-linear relationship between group composition and

behavior (see footnote 3 for references). To the best of our knowledge, our model is the

first to generate non-linearities endogenously.

       In the preceding uniform example, if one quarter of the population had the high

characteristic and the population was large enough for three groups, if the highs were

divided equally among the three groups, 30.9% of the population (68.4% of highs and

18.4% of lows) would take the high action. If the population were divided into 2 groups

with no highs and one that was three quarter highs, 23.0% of the population (81.6% of

highs; none of the lows with other lows, and 31.6% of the lows in the three-quarter high

group) would take the high action. Thus, grouping the highs with enough other highs to

allow them to heavily associate with each other generates high overall behavior.

       The existing literature places particular emphasis on the multipliers generated

when peoples’ actions depend on the actions of the other people in their social groups.

The strength of these endogenous effects is not identified in the traditional linear-in-

means model of social interactions because the expected behavior of associates is a linear

function of associates’ observable characteristics (see Manski [1994]; Brock and Durlauf

[2001a,b]; Blume and Durlauf [2006]; Lin [2005]; Lee [2006]; and Shang [2006]).

       Endogenizing associations overturns these results in two ways. First, the non-

linear relationship between the composition of a group and the mean behavior can, in

principle, identify the model’s parameters. Second, the distinction between traditional

endogenous and exogenous effects itself becomes less interesting once associations are

treated as endogenous because changes in the distribution of exogenous characteristics


                                             14
can generate multipliers through associations. Put differently, for multipliers to arise

some endogenous variable has to respond to changes in the environment, and it can be

associations instead of behaviors.

        Lastly, endogenous association limits the interpretation of conventional estimates

of the effects of macro-groups because the effect of macro-groups varies across people

and with group composition. While one can accurately estimate the effect of moving

people like those being studied between groups like those studied, it is impossible to

estimate the effect of moving similar people between different types of groups or

different types of people between the groups being studied. Put differently, one can

estimate the effect of the groups studied on the people studied, but there is no single

“effect” of groups to estimate because the effect of groups depends on associations which

in turn depend on interactions between individual characteristics and group composition.

As indicated, moving people who are at risk along some dimension from groups where

many individuals are at risk to groups with a mix of people who are and are not at risk is

likely to have less effect on the influences a person experiences than one would expect

based on macro-group composition because people can find like-minded associates in

their new groups.

II.G. Actions and Characteristics Directly Affect Interactions

        Some behaviors inherently generate utility for one’s associates, while others

generate disutility. For instance, it may be enjoyable to associate with people who party,

but unpleasant to associate with people with behavioral problems. People will associate

with people taking actions that generate utility for their associates, causing those actions

to proliferate if θ > 0 .

        It can be shown that people associate more with people taking high levels of

pleasant actions, causing those actions to spread. By contrast, people tend to avoid people

taking high levels of unpleasant actions, which will reduce the amount of those actions. It


                                             15
is well known that actions for which θ is high will spread, but these results imply that for

a given value of θ , actions for which ω is high will spread too.

II.H. Peer Pressure

         People often describe social interactions models as models of “peer pressure.”

Peer pressure involves the withdraw of association when one person takes an action that

produces disutility for another. To model peer pressure, associations must be

endogenous.

         To capture this idea, we assume that people derive utility directly from having

people associate with them and, in choosing their actions, take into consideration how

their action will affect whether other people associate with them. Let the utility function

be,

where P gives the person’s popularity, the number of people associating with him.

Returning to the case of a continuous action, the first order condition for the action is,

                                                              ∂P
                                        (          )
                               y = βx + θy A + γx A T α + δ
                                                              ∂y
                                                                 +ε .                    (*’)

The condition now includes a term for the effect of a change in the action on the measure

of people who will associate with him. Under peer pressure, a person’s action depends on

the density of people at the margin to interact with him as well as the mean of associates’

behaviors and characteristics. In this sense, the standard linear-in-means model of

interactions may be a poor representation of peer pressure.

         The strength of “reception” and “transmission” of peer pressure will likely

depend on characteristics. On the reception-side, insofar as most people in the macro-

group will want to associate with them regardless of their actions, people whose

characteristics make them appealing as associates will be less subject to peer pressure


                                                       16
than others. People whose characteristics make them very undesirable as associates may

also be less subject to peer pressure insofar as few people will associate with them

regardless of their actions. Thus the model suggests that the extent to which people are

subject to peer pressure as recipients follows an inverse-U in how appealing they are as

associates. On the transmission-side, people who are attractive as associates may get

more weight in other people’s P’s, so people will be particularly subject to peer pressure

from attractive people. The strength of peer pressure from the transmission side will be

strictly increasing in how appealing someone is as an associate.

II.I. Extensions

       This section considers two further extensions to the model – endogenous

popularity and dislike. One could extend the analysis of popularity by making one of the

individual characteristics, x, be the measure of people in the macro-group who associate

with a person. Presumably, people obtain more utility from interacting with people who

are popular. In the context of peer pressure, people will be particularly interested in

having popular people associate with them.

       When popularity has effects, an intervention that increases the weight placed on

one person or set of people will generate a feedback to other people in the macro group,

which can generate multipliers – as one person begins to associate with a person that

raises the utility that others derive from associating with him. Such an effect explain the

emphasis placed on affecting how much weight people place on others, by making

positive (or negative) examples of people, such as valedictorians (Moffitt [2001]

discusses a variety of policies).

       Lastly, one might allow people to invest time down-weighting some members of

their macro-group. People would optimally want to down-weight people who are most

different from them. Without crowding out, people who are most different from their

macro-groups will invest the most to down-weight others. The possibility of down-


                                             17
weighting reduces the benefits from placing people with bad outcomes into better groups.

III. Data

         We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,

commonly known as Add Health. The Add Health data provide information on a wide

range of youth behaviors, including substance use, risky behaviors, grades, and

behavioral problems, and data on family background. They contain nationally

representative data on 90,118 students enrolled in grades 7-12 in 172 schools. Students

were asked about their 5 closest male and female friends, so information is available on

both the macro groups – schools and grades – as well as the subgroupings that emerge

within them. Also, all people are surveyed symmetrically.11

         We restrict attention to students enrolled in 9th through 12th grades in classes with

at least 10 students. The data contain a limited panel aspect, which we do not utilize.

         Appendix Table 1 lists the behaviors and outcomes used and their construction. In

most cases variables were given as the frequency of a behavior. In these cases, we coded

them so as to give a monthly frequency.

         Table 1 reports descriptive statistics.12 Slightly under half the sample is male;

16% identify as black (respondents were allowed to report multiple races); 15% identify

as Hispanic. Just over three quarters of respondents live with their father, and their

mothers have 13.6 years of schooling on average. Average grades vary from a B- to a B,

with the lowest grades in math and the highest grades in history and social studies. On

average the respondents smoked a bit more than once a week, they drink a couple of

times a month, and get drunk about half as frequently. The most common behaviors or


11
   Alternative surveys provide information about particular individuals and ask the respondents about the
behaviors of their friends. Under this approach less information is available on friends than on respondents
and reports of friends’ behavior may be biased differently than reports of own behavior.
12
   The original sample comprises 90,118 individuals. Once the sample is restricted to individuals in grades
9 through 12 with valid school, grade, and identification information, the sample is reduced to 62,203.
Restricting the sample to people with some identifiable friends with valid information reduces the sample
to 47,570. The remaining deletions are for having missing data for a variety of the other variables.

                                                    18
behavioral problems are having trouble paying attention and doing homework regularly.

Skipping school and fighting are the least common, occurring about once a month.

       Also shown are the means and standard deviations of the associate averages of the

behaviors and characteristics. The mean of the associates’ behaviors are above the mean

of own behaviors, indicating that people with “worse” behavior are listed as friends more

often than people with better behavior. On the other hand, the mean of associates’ grades

tend to be slightly higher than own grades, indicating that popularity is increasing in

grades. Similarly, the mean of mother’s education and father present among associates is

above the own mean for these variables, indicating that children with “better” family

backgrounds may be more appealing because they are wealthier or more socially adept.

IV. Within-Group Variations in Associations

       As indicated, most studies of social effects focus on variations across macro-

groups. We begin by investigating how much of the variation in friend’s behaviors and

characteristics arises within macro-groups as opposed to between macro-groups.

       Meaningful macro-groups should be reasonably narrowly defined yet contain a

large portion of peoples’ associates. School-grades meet this criterion with 74% of the

surveyed friends being in the person’s school-grade.

       Let z ij denote a behavior or characteristic of the jth friend of person i. The mean

                                                1
value of z among person i’s friends is z iA =
                                                Ni
                                                     ∑   j
                                                             z ij , where N i gives the number of


people with whom i is friends. (Here and below, by studying z iA we implicitly focus on

the case where α = 0 ; work that estimates α is in progress.) We decompose the variance

of z i into within and between school-grade components. The total variance in z iA is

    [ ]         [       [         ]]       [[                 ]]
VAR z iA = VAR z iA − E z iA S i , Gi + VAR E z iA S i , Gi . The former term represents the

within school-grade variance and the later the across school-grade variance.

       The share of the variance arising within school-grades is the R 2 from an analysis

                                                19
of variance with a full set of school-grade interactions, which is reported the first column

of Table 2. The estimates indicate that for most behaviors over 90% of the variation in

friends’ behaviors arises within school-grades. For grades (and television watching)

about 80% of the variation in friends’ behaviors and outcomes arises within school

grades. Between 75% and 90% of the variation in family background, measured by

mother’s education, mother is a homemaker, and father’s presence arises within school-

grades. Considerably more of the variation in the racial and ethnic composition of friends

can be accounted for by school-grade effects, frequently close to half, which is to be

expected given the extent of racial and ethnic residential sorting.

       Because people often form friendships with people who live near them, a portion

of the within school-grade variation likely arises from residential sorting among students

in the same school-grade. Tracking and selection into classes may also generate within

school-grade variations in associations. The Add Health survey does not contain data on

tracking or the classes taken, but it does contain characteristics of the census block group

of residence for a portion of respondents. Because neighborhood characteristics are only

available for one respondent in five, column 3 reports the R 2 from the analysis of

variance described above when applied to the smaller sample; column 4 reports results

when the neighborhood variables interacted with school effects are added to the model.

       Switching to the smaller sample tends to increase the R 2 slightly because the

sample size declines dramatically relative to the number of effects. Inclusion of

neighborhood variables typically accounts for 5% of the variance in friends’ behavior.

Even in this smaller sample with neighborhood variables, within macro-group variations

account for 80% or more of the variation in associates’ behaviors; 30%-70% of the

variations in associates’ race and ethnicity; and 70% of the variation in associates’ grades

and family background. To the extent that people choose their friends based on their

behaviors and there is an association between neighborhoods and behaviors, these


                                             20
estimates will overstate the effect of residential proximity.

       The substantial variations in associates’ behaviors can not be viewed as the effect

of sorting insofar as exogenous variations in associations combined with social effects on

behavior will generate variations in associates’ behaviors. Nevertheless, we find

substantial variations in associates’ family backgrounds within macro-groups, and these

variations are not caused by associations. Regardless of causality, our estimates indicate

ignoring variations in associations with macro-groups leads to substantial mis-measuring

the social influences to which people are exposed.

V. The Choice of Associates

       The preceding analysis indicates that the vast majority of variation in the

composition of social groups arises within narrowly-defined macro-groups. We begin by

studying the determinants of associations on exogenous characteristics (race, ethnicity,

and family background). It is easier to study sorting on exogenous characteristics than

behaviors and outcomes because, as indicated, if social interactions operate, behaviors

and outcomes are affected by others. That is, the relationship between a person’s

behavior and those of his associates may reflect the effect of his behavior on his

associates as opposed to the effect of selective association. Our results on sorting on

exogenous characteristics are of interest in their own right insofar as sorting on racial,

ethnic, and socio-economic lines at the formative ages studied here likely affects attitudes

toward other groups.

V. A. Own Characteristics and Associates’ Characteristics

       We begin by regressing the mean of associates’ characteristics on own

characteristics. Let xi denote a characteristic of person i. We regress the mean x among

i’s associates, xiA , on xi and anticipate a positive relationship. Our model is

                                xiA = φxi + γX i + Π SG i + ε i .

Person i’s own observable characteristics, X i (other than xi ), are included as controls.

                                              21
Also included are fixed effects fully interacting school and grade, SG i . With these

school-grade effects, we estimate whether people with higher levels of x have associates

with higher values of x compared to others in the same school-grade.

       The estimates reported in Table 3 indicate a strong positive relationship between

own characteristics and those of peoples’ associates. There are a number of reasons to be

careful about interpreting these estimates as the causal effect of a person’s characteristics

on his associations. As discussed above, the estimated relationships may reflect sorting in

other arenas such as neighborhoods. Moreover, our model implies that people will

selectively associate based on behaviors as well as characteristics. If groups have

different behaviors and this form of sorting is present, our estimates will reflect the effect

of sorting on behaviors that are affected by the characteristics.

       To address neighborhood-based selection, we augment our models by including

neighborhood characteristics. The remaining columns of the table report estimates from

the original specification for the sample with neighborhood characteristics and then

estimates that include the neighborhood variables. The substantial reduction in the

sample reduces the precision of the estimates, but neither the change in sample, nor the

inclusion of the neighborhood variables substantially affects the point estimates.

       Lastly our estimates here and below can not rule out the possibility of a hierarchy

among groups. For instance, everyone may prefer to associate with white students, but

because the white students associate with each other, students from other groups may be

forced to associate with each other. Even in this context our estimates show active

associations among white students.

V. B. Macro-Group Composition

       Under the assumption that people prefer to associate with others who are similar

to themselves, the model implies that for people who have a particular (binary)

characteristic, there should be a concave relationship between the share of their


                                             22
associates that have that characteristic and the share of the group that has that

characteristic. For people who do not have that characteristic, the model implies that

there should be a convex relationship between the share of their associates that have that

characteristic and the share of group that does. The difference in the share of associates

who have the characteristic between people with and without it will be hump-shaped.

Intuitively, once a small number of people with a characteristic are introduced, the people

who also have that characteristic will be able to have associates who are similar to

themselves; people without the characteristic will not be forced to associate with people

with it until most of the group has the characteristic.

       We test this hypothesis by regressing the share of peoples’ associates who have

some exogenous binary characteristic, xiA , on cubics in the share of the group who have

the characteristic, xiG , and these cubics interacted with the person’s value for the

characteristic, xi . We focus on race and ethnicity because of the strength of sorting on

them (from Table 3).13 Formally, we estimate,

                 {
                               (
                       1444424444                   3 14444244443
                                                                    3

                                                                                                                 )

The model also includes individual characteristics to control for the direct effect of

characteristics on associations; interactions between the racial composition of the grade

and the individual’s race (in case, for instance, the share of the grade that is white affects

interactions between Asians and blacks); and school fixed effects interacted with the

characteristic. Our estimates are identified from differences in the associations across

students in different grades in the same school.

       The estimated polynomials, are reported in table 4. Figure 5 plots the implied




                                                                 23
share of people’s associates with a given characteristic and the share of the group with

that characteristic, with each point representing a single school-grade. (Echenique, Fryer,

and Kaufman [2006] report similar results, but without school-grade fixed effects,

obtained at the same time.) As expected, the difference in the relationship between

people with and without the characteristics are globally concave. The curves for people

with (own) and without (other) the characteristic generally indicate the expected

relationships, especially in the regions with the greatest density.

V. C. Macro-Group Size

The model implies that large macro-groups facilitate sorting so that there should be a

stronger relationship between individual characteristics and associates’ characteristics in

large macro-groups.14 To assess how school-grade size affects selective association, we

estimate

                                     (     )
                     xiA = βxi * log N iSG + θxi + γX i + πxi xiG + Π SG i + ε i .

Also included in the regression are individual characteristics (including the one being

studied), interactions between the characteristic under investigation and the share of the

school-grade with that characteristic, and a set of school-grade fixed effects. Our

estimates are identified from differences in the strength of the relationship between own

characteristics and those of associates across grades of varying sizes in the same school.

Under the hypothesis that grade size facilitates selective sorting β > 0 .

        The estimates are reported in Table 5. For all of the characteristics (except father

present), an increase in the size of the school-grade increases the relationship between

own behavior or characteristics and those of associates. Thus, our estimates indicate that

larger macro-groups do facilitate sorting.



13
  Results are not reported for Indians because less than 3% of school-grades are 15% or more Indian.
14
  The mean and standard deviation of grade size are 236 and 126 (4.28 and .672 in logs) when weighted
by students and 148 and 118 (4.427 and 1.427 in logs) when the data are un-weighted.

                                                  24
VI. Behaviors

        This section studies how endogenous association affects behavior. As indicated,

one can not directly study the effect of sorting on endogenous variables in the same way

as sorting on exogenous variables because endogenous variables may be affected by

sorting. To address this concern, we employ a multi-step procedure in which we predict

both individual and group behaviors using exogenous characteristics. We then study how

changes in (predicted) behavior in a macro-group affects the behavior of people whose

behavior is predicted to be high (or low) based on their characteristics.

        Formally, we begin by estimating the relationship between behaviors and

exogenous individual characteristics,

                                 yi = γ 1 X i1 + γ 2 X i2 + Π SG i + ε i .

Here we have partitioned the matrix of characteristics, X i , into two components, X i1 and

                   [       ]
X i2 , where X i = X i1 X i2 . The model also includes school-grade fixed effects to control

for the effect of macro-groups on behaviors.

        In our second step, we use the coefficients on the individual characteristics

obtained from this model, to obtain two predictions of the behavior of each individual in

the sample, yˆ ij = γˆ j X i j , j ∈ {1,2} . We then estimate whether student i is expected to be

above the population mean of y based on each set of characteristics. Formally, define

                                            ⎧1if yˆ ij > y j
                                yˆ   i
                                      Hj
                                           =⎨                for j ∈ {1,2} .
                                            ⎩0 if yˆ i ≤ y
                                                      j    j




We also estimate ŷ iGHj , the share of i’s macro-group that is expected to be above the

mean of y based on characteristic set X j .

VI. A. Sorting on Behaviors

        Endogenous sorting implies that the difference between people with high and low

(predicted) behavior, in the share of associates with a high level of that behavior should


                                                       25
be concave in the share of the group with a high level of that behavior. To test this

hypothesis, we regress the mean behavior of person i’s associates on interactions between

our prediction of whether i is above the mean for behavior y based on X i j , ŷ iHj ; and the

share of his group that is expected to be above the mean of behavior y based on X i j′ (i.e.

the other set of characteristics), yˆ iGHj′ , and its square. Formally, we estimate,

             y iA
             {
                        =      β 1 yˆ i1 yˆ iGH 2

As indicated, in the interactions between predicted individual and macro-group

behaviors, we construct the predicted individual and macro-group components from the

“opposite” components of characteristics. We do this because we have already shown

that individuals sort on observable characteristics and we do not want our estimates of

sorting on associations to be biased by sorting on exogenous characteristics.15 We only

include one set of interactions to avoid co-linearity. Our specification also includes

school-grade fixed effects and individual characteristics, so our estimates are identified

from differences in how the (predicted) behavior in a school grade affects people who

(are predicted to) have high levels of an action relative to those who are not in the same

school grade.

         Table 6 reports the estimates. As expected, the estimates show that the difference

in the behaviors of the associates of people with high (predicted) behaviors relative to

those with low (predicted) behaviors is concave in the share of the macro-group with

high (predicted) behaviors. The linear term is positive and the quadratic is negative in 15

of 19 cases and the two are statistically significant in 12 of the cases. (None of the


15
  We have also regressed one set of predictions on the other and interacted the residuals. We split our
characteristics into one set that comprises race and ethnicity and a second set that comprises family
background and years at the school. The estimates reported use race and ethnicity to predict individual
behavior and the other variables to predict macro-group behavior. Estimates that use race and ethnicity to


                                                                     26
estimates where the signs are reversed are statistically significant.) Moreover, the two

coefficients are frequently similar in magnitude, indicating that the difference in

associations is greatest in groups where roughly equal numbers of people are predicted to

be above and below the average behavior. As implied by endogenous association, we find

that as the share of a macro-group with high (predicted) behavior increases, the mean

behavior among the associates of people who (are predicted to) have a high level of that

behavior increases relative to others initially and then declines as most of the macro-

group (is predicted) to have a high level of that behavior.

VI. B. Reduced Form Behavioral Models

        If associations are endogenous and social interactions operate, the addition of

people with high (predicted) behavior to a group that has a low (predicted) behavior will

raise the behavior among people with high predicted behavior more than those with low

predicted behavior. Once most of the group has a high (predicted) behavior, adding more

people with high (predicted) behavior will affect people with low predicted behavior

more than those with high predicted behavior. Thus, the difference in behavior between

people whose characteristics imply high behavior relative to those whose characteristics

imply low behavior should be hump-shaped in the share of the group with high predicted

behavior.

        To test this hypothesis, we estimate a model that is similar to that above except

we replace the mean behavior among associates as the dependent variable with the

individual’s own behavior. Formally we estimate,

             {i  14243                  144244

As above, the interactions between predicted own behavior and predicted group behavior



predict group behavior and other variables to predict individual behavior are broadly comparable.

                                                              27
come from different sets of characteristics and the model includes both sets of individual

characteristics and school-grade fixed effects. These estimates can be thought of as

reduced form estimates in a two stage least squares regression of individual behaviors on

associates’ behaviors where interactions between predicted behaviors of the individual

and the group are instruments for associates’ behaviors.

         Table 7 reports these estimates. As expected, we find that the difference in

behaviors between those with high and low (predicted) behaviors is a concave function of

and the share of the group with high (predicted) behaviors. Of the 19 estimates, 17 show

the expected pattern (the other two are statistically insignificant) and 11 of the 17 are

statistically significant. As above, the linear and quadratic terms are frequently similar in

magnitude indicating that the difference in behavior peaks when roughly equal numbers

of people (are predicted to) have high and low behaviors. Thus, our results for behaviors

are consistent with social interactions with endogenous association.

VI. C. Two Stage Least Squares Estimates

         As indicated, one can think of the two previous sets of estimates as the first stage

and reduced form estimates of the effect of individual behaviors on associates’ behaviors

where interactions between predicted behaviors of the individual and group are

instruments for associates’ behaviors. The second stage equation in this system is

                                         y = θy iA + γ 1 X i1 + γ 2 X i2 + Π
                                                                           12 3i + ε i

       Behavior



Here we include both sets of interactions between predicted own and group behavior in

order to maximize the fit of our first stage equation. As above, the models include

individual characteristics and school-grade fixed effects. Thus the estimates are identified

                                                                           28
from differences between individuals with high predicted behavior relative to those with

low predicted behavior in the effect of group composition. Because the first-stage models

generate hump-shaped differences in associates’ behaviors, the identification comes from

the non-monotonic relationship between group composition and the difference between

people with high and low (predicted) behavior.

       The results are presented in Table 8. All of the estimates but one are positive and

12 of the 19 are statistically significant. As expected the implied social effects are larger

than those for the effect of macro-groups, but closer to estimates for people who are

likely to associate with one another (Carrell, Fullerton, Gilchrist, and West [2006]).16

VII. Conclusion and Implications

       We have developed a model of social interactions with endogenous association.

Our theory implies the standard, linear-in-means model of behavior, but departs from the

standard model by assuming that people invest in developing relationships and that they

do so in order to maximize their utility.

       At a policy level, the non-linearities and interactions that arise endogenously in

the model imply that relocations of individuals can be positive or negative sum. Our

finding of greater sorting in large macro-groups implies that relocations will be more

effective when they are to small groups.

       Our model provides a novel explanation for the weak effects of housing

relocation experiments. We hypothesize that people who are relocated into groups where

many (but not all) people are different from themselves choose to associate with the

people who are like themselves. Thus, we are reluctant to conclude from these

experiments that people’s associates do not have large effects.

       At a policy level, our results suggest that relocation programs may be less

effective than policies that increase the incentives for desired behaviors (e.g. rewards for




                                              29
getting higher grades or more stiff penalties for crime). If endogenous effects are present,

rewards will generate multipliers and because groups can be maintained, we expect less

re-sorting within groups.

     The mean of the effects is .918 and the mean weighted by the inverse of the standard errors is .900.

Note. In the first two figures, the curves give mean behavior in the group (solid), among people with x = −1 (dotted), and x = 1 (dashed). In the third
figure the curves give weighted mean of associates behavior for people with the high characteristic (dotted) the low characteristic (dashed) and the
difference (solid). Solutions for β = 1 , θ = 1 , t 0 = 1 , α = .5 , x ∈ {− 1,1} , y ∈ {− 1,1} , c = .5 , and N = 4 . Shocks are distributed with mean of 0 and
variance of 1.
