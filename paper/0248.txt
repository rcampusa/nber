                       UNIONISM AND THE DISPERSION
                                OF WAGES

                                      RICHARD B. FREEMAN*


               This study examines the effect of trade unionism on the dispersion of wages
            among male wage and salary workers in the private sector in the United
            States. It finds that the application of union wage policies designed to
            standardize rates within and across establishments significantly reduces wage
            dispersion among workers covered by union contracts and that unions
            further reduce wage dispersion by narrowing the white-collar/blue-collar
            differential within establishments. These effects dominate the more widely
            studied impact of unionism on the dispersion of average wages across in-
            dustries, so that on net unionism appears to reduce rather than increase wage
