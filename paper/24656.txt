Leadership and Social Movements: The Forty-Eighters in the Civil War

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper studies the role of leaders in the social movement against slavery that culminated in
the U.S. Civil War. Our analysis is organized around a natural experiment: leaders of the failed
German revolution of 1848-49 were expelled to the U.S. and became anti-slavery campaigners
who helped mobilize Union Army volunteers. Towns where Forty-Eighters settled show two-
thirds higher Union Army enlistments. Their influence worked thought local newspapers and
social clubs. Going beyond enlistment decisions, Forty-Eighters reduced their companies'
desertion rate during the war. In the long run, Forty-Eighter towns were more likely to form a
local chapter of the NAACP.

       Between 1861 and 1865, the United States’ North and South fought each other over the issue

of slavery in the American Civil War. One in five adult men—2.2 million in the North alone—

took up arms to fight in the Union Army. Fighting was costly on both sides: In total, 620,000

men lost their lives, as many as in all other American wars combined (Hacker, 2011; Costa and

Kahn, 2003). At the same time, the financial incentives to fight in the war were low. Union Army

privates earned about $13 per month—less than a farmhand (Edmunds, 1866, 512)—and payment

was irregular. In the South, there were stronger economic motives at least for some, since the war

was about the survival of Southern institutions and property (Hall, Huff and Kuriwaki, 2019). Yet,

almost 95 percent of Northern soldiers were volunteers. What, then, drove men to risk their lives

in the fight against slavery and Southern secession, despite high personal costs and low economic

compensation?

       In this paper, we study the role that individual leaders played in determining local enlistment

decisions at this critical juncture. We focus on the Forty-Eighters, leaders in the German revo-

lutions of 1848–49 who were subsequently expelled to America for their activities. By historical

serendipity, the egalitarian and pro-republican convictions that got the Forty-Eighters expelled

from Europe in 1849 mapped closely into the political struggles that would come to a head in the

U.S. a decade later.1 During the first few years after their arrival in the U.S., the Forty-Eighters’

political convictions lay dormant as their lives were dominated by the practical necessities of earn-

ing a livelihood in their new home. This changed when the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 blew the

lid off the sectional political conflict around slavery (Foner, 1970).2 This lead the Forty-Eighters

to “revive the spirit of the failed struggle for liberty in the fight against slavery” (Baron, 2012, 3).

By the time this conflict culminated in the Civil War, the Forty-Eighters had become influential

campaigners against slavery, and mobilizers of Union Army volunteers (Zucker 1950, Wittke 1973,

Levine 1980, 256, Kamphoefner and Helbich 2006, 38, Goodheart 2011, 257).

       To quantify the Forty-Eighters’ mobilization effect and shed light on underlying mechanisms

that helped them spread the ‘liberal contagion’, we combine several newly created datasets at

the town-level. First, we compile a list of almost 500 Forty-Eighters from historical sources and
   1
     In the words of their foremost historian, “three aspects dominated the scene from which [the Forty-Eighters] fled
into the freedom of the United States: liberty, democracy, and national unity” (Zucker, 1950, p.9).
   2
     This act ended the second American party system in which the Democratic and the Whig Party were the main
opponents. By the 1856 presidential election, the Whigs had disappeared and the election was decided between the
Democrats and two parties that had not yet existed in 1852, one of them the anti-slavery Republican Party.

complete their U.S. biographies through individual searches in genealogical online sources. This

tells us the towns where the Forty-Eighters settled and spread their liberal ideas. Secondly, we

geo-located the town-level extracts from the 1850 and 1860 censuses and merged them with our

Forty-Eighters database to create a dataset of U.S towns in 1860. Thirdly, we use the full universe of

over 2 million men in the Union Army rosters to construct a town-level database of local enlistment.

       The main empirical concern in estimating the Forty-Eighters’ effect on individual enlistment

decisions is spatial sorting. If the Forty-Eighters had settled in areas where anti-slavery and pro-

republican convictions were independently becoming stronger, we would overestimate their effect.

We address this concern in two ways. First, we select from the large number of untreated towns a

matched sample of control towns that are closest to being ‘statistical twins’ of the treated towns.

This reduces selection effects; and the more balanced covariate distribution reduces noise and

renders the outcome less sensitive to small changes in the model specification (Imbens and Rubin,

2015). Our matching is informed by a variable selection model that reveals factors that influenced

the Forty-Eighters’ choice of where to settle, i.e. they were more likely to co-locate with other

recent German immigrants in the Mid-West and choose less rural locations. Once we condition on

these location factors, we end up with a well-balanced sample of treatment and control locations.3

       While matching aids identification, it alone does not establish causality. To overcome remaining

concerns about unobserved drivers of the Forty-Eighters’ location choice, we suggest an instrumen-

tal variable (IV) strategy based on random social ties that the Forty-Eighters formed on their

ten-week transatlantic voyage to America. Idiosyncratic connections made on the voyage were

particularly influential for the Forty-Eighters because of the haphazard nature of their departure

from Europe: they mostly traveled alone (as we observe in ship-list data), they had little time to

plan ahead, and they lacked family ties in the United States, meaning they usually embarked on

their voyage with no planned destination in America.4 Using the universe of German immigrant

ship-lists from the ’Germans to America’ collection, we link 152 Forty-Eighters to 136 ships, and

instrument the Forty-Eighters location choice with the distribution of their co-passengers’ intended

destinations in the U.S., which were recorded at the immigration lines in the port of entry.5 We
   3
     This approach omits all larger treated towns, e.g. Philadelphia or Cincinnati, because they have no statistical
twin in the same state, generating a matched sample of 55 treated towns and around 200 control towns.
   4
     Battiston (2018) shows that even on the much briefer two-week steam-ship transatlantic crossings in the 20th
century, social ties formed with co-passengers had a significant impact on immigrants’ future path in the U.S.
   5
     Very few Forty-Eighter reported a planned destination themselves and we omit these cases.



                                                         3
condition our IV estimates on the distribution of reported destinations of passengers on more than

1,700 other German immigrant ships that arrived in the same 1848–1852 time-window. In this way,

we disentangle the idiosyncratic component of what the Forty-Eighters’ co-passengers knew about

U.S. destinations.

   Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates on the matched sample suggest that having one or

more Forty-Eighter in a town raised Union Army enlistments by two thirds, or eight extra enlistees

per 100 adult men. By contrast, the estimated effect in the full sample is about 90 percent,

suggesting that the matching strategy successfully removes some biasing variation. As a placebo

test, we investigate the effect of other German immigrants who arrived in the same time-window

and whom we can match to the Census. We find that their locations strongly correlate with the

Forty-Eighters, but in a statistical ‘horse-race’ between the two groups, we find that only the Forty-

Eighters mattered for local enlistments. Turning to the IV strategy, we find that the instrument

has considerable predictive power, even conditional on the distribution of stated destinations from

passengers on all other German immigrant ships arriving at the same time. The IV results broadly

confirm the enlistment effect we find in the OLS; they are no more than ten percentage points

larger and but we cannot statistically reject that they are equal.

   With the effect on enlistments established, we turn to an analysis of underlying mechanisms

by which the Forty-Eighters influenced local enlistment choices. The historical narrative suggests

four salient channels: (i) through local newspapers (as founders, editors, or contributors); (ii) their

involvement in local social and political clubs, especially the Turner Societies (‘Turnvereine’); (iii)

as orators giving rousing public speeches; and (iv) by enlisting themselves in the war effort and

encouraging others to do so with them. We construct different measures to assess these four chan-

nels. For the first channel, we collect data on the circulation of local German-language newspapers

before and after the Forty-Eighters’ arrival. For the second channel, we collect data on the for-

mation of local Turner Societies. Both channels turn out to be relevant and a simple mediation

analysis suggests that these first two channels (as measured) explain around one-third of the Forty-

Eighters’ total effect on enlistments. Gaining identification on the remaining two channels is more

challenging because they investigate the timing of Forty-Eighters’ ‘acts of leadership’ (speeches

and enlistment decisions), which may themselves been endogenous to other unobserved events. To

determine instances of public speeches, we searched historical newspaper archives for reports on


                                                  4
Forty-Eighters giving public speeches or organizing pro-Union events. After public speeches, we

see enlistment rates increase by sixty percent in the following two weeks. After Forty-Eighters’

enlistments, we see enlistment rates increase by fifty percent in the following two weeks. With the

caveat on identification in mind, we interpret these pieces of evidence as suggesting the potential

relevance of the other two channels discussed in the historical records.

       In a last set of exercises, we look at additional and longer-run impacts of the Forty-Eighters,

going beyond local enlistment decisions. First, we peruse the Union Army rosters to follow regiments

where the Forty-Eighters enlisted as leaders on the battle field. In this exercise, we revisit the

duration-analysis of soldier desertion in Costa and Kahn (2003), and test whether Forty-Eighters

who were commanding officers reduced their troops’ desertion rates in battle.6 We find that Forty-

Eighters who lead by example significantly reduced their companies’ desertion rate through the

course of the war, again supporting the interpretation that their liberal ideas inspired others.

Secondly, we investigate the persistence of the liberal contagion spread by the Forty-Eighter. As

a later outcome that ties closely into the anti-slavery issue, we use the formation of town-level

chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the first

of which was founded in 1909. Despite the long time gap, we find strong evidence that NAACP

chapters were more likely to be founded in Forty-Eighter towns. We cautiously interpret this as

indicative for a lasting change in social norms.

       Our analysis of the influence of the Forty-Eighters on anti-slavery culture and enlistment choices

connects with the historical literature on the socio-political origins of the Civil War, including Wiley

(1952), Foner (1970), McPherson (1997), Costa and Kahn (2010), Goodheart (2011), and Doyle

(2014). The Forty-Eighters are mentioned frequently in this literature, and there is a number of

historical studies specifically devoted to them (Zucker, 1950; Wittke, 1970; Kamphoefner, 1991).7

Our study utilizes the Forty-Eighters’ unique circumstance to show more broadly the important

role that individual leadership played in the spread of the anti-slavery movement as well as in the

mobilization of volunteers for the war. While “great men” historical accounts would emphasize the

importance of Abraham Lincoln or Ulysses Grant, our paper emphasizes the impact of grass-roots

     We observe the population of over 2 million Union Army enlistments, while Costa and Kahn (2003) perused a
random sample of 30,000 men.
   7
     Costa and Kahn (2003, 523) for example argue that “Germans who fled the revolutions of 1848 were more likely
than Irish or British immigrants who migrated for economic reasons to view the United States as the best hope for
the survival of a form of republican government.”

civic leadership at the local level.

       Our paper also contributes to a theoretical literature on the importance of leaders in social

movements (Loeper, Steiner and Stewart, 2014; Acemoglu and Jackson, 2015; Akerlof and Holden,

2016). Testing for the importance of leaders is challenging because one typically cannot distinguish

if prominent individuals are in fact leaders (i.e. influence others) or simply flag-bearers of underlying

social change; this is a version of the well-known ‘reflection problem’ (Manski, 1993).8 Our setting

allows us to address this because we identify leaders based on their actions during the German

Revolution, i.e. before we investigate their role in the Civil War.

       We also complement a literature on the formation of collective action in networks. A set of

empirical studies focused on modern-day social-media networks sheds light on the diffusion of

collective action in high frequency and at a very granular level (Enikolopov, Makarin and Petrova,

2020; Cantoni et al., 2019). In comparison, we study a similar question in a setting of unique

historic importance and where action entailed uniquely high stakes (risking one’s life by enlisting).

Closest to us in this respect is Garcı́a-Jimeno, Iglesias and Yildirim (2018), who study the 1870s

U.S. temperance movement.

       Lastly, our paper belongs to an empirical literature which uses the arrival of narrowly defined

immigrant groups as natural experiments to study the transmission and diffusion of knowledge.

Examples include Hornung (2014), who studies the late-17th-century migration of skilled Huguenots

from France to Germany; Moser, Voena and Waldinger (2014), who look at the influx of German

Jewish scientists into the U.S. after 1939; or Borjas and Doran (2012) who study the effect of the

post-1990 influx of Russian mathematicians into the U.S. We use a similar exogenous immigration

shock, but focus on the diffusion of beliefs and behavior rather than knowledge.

       The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 1 introduces the historical back-

ground. Section 2 summarizes the main data sources and definitions. Section 3 lays out the empir-

ical strategy. Section 4 presents the baseline results, Section 5 presents evidence on mechanisms,

and Section 6 concludes.
   8
    Studies that investigate the turnover of formalized or institutional leadership (i.e. CEOs or public officials) are
unaffected by this problem, but also address a different question (Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Jones and Olken, 2005;
Jha and Wilkinson, 2012; Jack and Recalde, 2015).

1         Background

1.1        The German Revolutions of 1848–1849

Beginning in the early 19th century, a new social and political movement across Europe started

advocating for a Republican form of government that would result in a more balanced distribution of

power between the ruling monarchs and their subjects.9 In German lands, leaders of this movement

varied from moderate liberals whose views were heavily influenced by the enlightenment to radical

democrats whose ideas became formative for later socialist movements (Real, 1983, chIV). This

movement gained momentum in the 1830s and 1840s. In German lands, its collision course with

the establishment culminated in March 1848, when political unrest spilled over from France and

sparked the March Revolution. The revolutions started with first uprisings in Baden and quickly

spread to other states. We provide some discussion of the German revolutions in Appendix A.1. For

our purpose, the key observation is that by the summer of 1849 they had failed, which marks the

beginning of systematic persecution and prosecution of those involved in the revolution (Siemann,

2006). Many were sentenced to long prison terms, and some were sentenced to death Wittke (1973,

65).10 Sentences were commuted for those who agreed to leave German lands for good (Reiter 1992,

p.218, Raab 1998). Wittke (1973, 46-49) recounts how in Hessian courts, revolutionary “offenders

were released on condition that they depart for America,” and in Württemberg judges “inquired

of rebels whether they preferred immigration to America to serving out their sentences, and when

they chose the former offered them money for the journey.”

         There was also a sizable group of revolutionaries who were participating in the Baden Revolution

in the South-West and who escaped to Switzerland after their defeat in the summer of 1849.

Switzerland was one of only two republics in Europe at the time (Goodheart, 2011, 356), and the

only country within reach that was sympathetic to the revolutions. However, the Swiss authorities

quickly felt the fiscal burden of supporting the refugees and they faced increasing external pressure

from Germany and France to expel the revolutionaries (Jung, 2015; Nagel, 2012). On July 16th

1849, the Swiss parliament passed an Act expelling 14 of the most prominent revolutionary leaders

from its borders (Reiter, 1992, footnote 172). Of these 14, ten ended up being among the Forty-
    9
    The movement further propagated a political union between the many German states.
    10
    Raab (1998) discusses a large number of biographies of individuals involved in the revolution. Of the 1,880 cases
describing a court prosecution for treason, only 21 mention a death-sentence.



                                                         7
Eighters we study. Explicitly stated in the act was the deliberation that if the revolutionary

leaders were expelled, the rest would follow. Switzerland negotiated precise terms with France

under which revolutionaries could make their way to their port of embarkation in Le Havre, often

accompanied by representatives of the Swiss authorities who would pay the ship fare to the U.S. at

the departure port (Reiter, 1992, 223).11 This expulsion is nicely illustrated in a political cartoon

from 1849 (Appendix Figure A1) that depicts the absolutist rulers sweeping the revolutionaries out

of Switzerland and then further out of Europe. To make sure the expellees remained in the U.S.,

German police authorities started circulating ‘black lists’ of revolutionaries after 1852.12


1.2    The Forty-Eighters and the Antebellum U.S. Political Conflicts

Wittke (1970, 4) defines the Forty-Eighters as those German-Americans “who in some way actually

participated in the liberal movements and the Revolutions of 1848 and 1849, and left their homes

because of a conflict with the established authorities, or because they realized that henceforth it

would be either too dangerous or too intolerable to remain.” A key feature of the natural experiment

we are exploiting is the historical serendipity that the Forty-Eighters’ strongly held convictions of

republicanism, liberty, and equality in Europe would map into the political struggles in the U.S.

a decade later. This is important because the same ideals the Forty-Eighters had fought for in

Europe now found a natural (and measurable) continuation in the U.S.

    The years when the Forty-Eighters arrived in the U.S. and established themselves personally

and professionally in their newly adopted home were years of relative political quiet as far as slavery

went. While slavery had been a hot-button political issue during the 1844–1848 administration, it

had died down after the 1848 election, and even more so with the ‘compromise of 1850’ (California

joining the Union as a non-slave state). In 1854, however, the Kansas-Nebraska bill propelled

slavery back onto the political center stage. The act repealed the Missouri Compromise that

had prohibited slavery in the North, which led to the formation of the Republican Party and the

subsequent disintegration of the Whig Party (Foner 1970, 94, Srinivasan 2017, 120-121). Over the
   11
      While the German and French governments pressured the revolutionaries to disembark for the U.S., some—
who had either their own means or financial support from other sources—chose to go to London, awaiting renewed
revolutionary outbreaks. However, when Louis Napoleon’s coup d’etat ended France’s Second Republic in 1852, many
of these holdouts gave up hope and also set sail for the U.S. (Frei, 1977, 427).
   12
      Rupieper (1977) emphasizes that these black lists were very incomplete. More important was their symbolic
significance, signaling an intent to keep revolutionaries from returning to German lands for good. No systematic
records of these lists appear to have survived.


                                                       8
next six years, the sectional conflict over slavery came to a head, as we further describe in Appendix

A.2. This lead the Forty-Eighters to “revive the spirit of the failed struggle for liberty in the fight

against slavery” (Baron, 2012, 3).

       Zucker and Wittke emphasize that the Forty-Eighters became pivotal in articulating ‘rational’

arguments for emancipation, by tying the slavery issue into a broader debate on liberty and equal-

ity. An editorial by Friedrich Kapp in the New York Abendzeitung illustrates this: “The problem

of slavery is not the problem of the Negro. It is the eternal conflict between a small privileged class

and the great mass of the non-privileged, the eternal struggle between aristocracy and democracy”

(quoted in Zucker, 1950, 121). Such arguments resonated far more with most Americans than

the previously dominant moralistic arguments presented by puritan abolitionists on the back of the

Second Great Awakening (Kamphoefner and Helbich 2006, 3). The Forty-Eighters thus contributed

to the spread of a wide-ranging “culture of anti-slavery activism” in the middle of the 1850s (Good-

heart, 2011, 118). This cultural diffusion culminated in large scale Wide Awake marches in early

1860, more than a year before the outbreak of the Civil War.13

       The Forty-Eighters were also instrumental in swaying the immigrant vote, and particularly the

German-American vote, for the Republican Party in the 1860 election (Wittke 1973, 14, Kam-

phoefner and Helbich 2006, 4). This was important because German-Americans had traditionally

supported the Democratic Party, and were additionally put off by the Republican Party when after

1857 it absorbed large numbers of anti-immigrant ‘Know-Nothings’. The Forty-Eighters demanded

a formal repudiation of nativism by the Republican Party at its Chicago convention in May 1860;

effectively “forcing the party to choose between Eastern nativists and the German vote in the West”

(Wittke, 1973, 213). This repudiation became known as the ‘Dutch plank’ in the Republican Party

platform (Baron, 2012, 5).14 As a result, the German-American vote swung Republican, while the

nativists “were absorbed into a party which made no concessions to them” (Foner, 1970, 258).15

Appendix A.3 provides more historiography on the role of the Forty-Eighters in the 1860 Election
  13
     Their rational arguments probably also contributed to hardening the political lines around slavery because they
highlighted the inevitability of ultimately having to resolve legal inconsistencies in the constitution either in favor of
republican institutions or in favor of slavery for all states in the Union.
  14
     Wittke (1973, 213) lists the prominent attendees of the German Club’s pre-convention 1860 meeting; they were
almost to a man among the Forty-Eighters in our data.
  15
     Lincoln himself understood the importance of the Forty-Eighters. Pratt’s analysis of Lincoln’s personal finances
concluded that Lincoln had set his mind on the Republican presidential nomination by early 1859, and that he had
taken a secret ownership stake in the German-language Illinois Staatszeitung for that purpose.

and in the Civil War.


1.3    The Mechanisms of the Forty-Eighters’ Influence

Four channels of influence and persuasion stand out in the historical narrative on the Forty-Eighters:

(i) they founded and contributed to local newspapers; (ii) they founded and were involved in local

social and political clubs, especially the Turner Societies (‘Turnvereine’); (iii) they gave rousing

public speeches; and (iv) they enlisted themselves in the war effort and encouraged others to do

the same. the following discusses each channel in turn.

    Newspapers: Many Forty-Eighters had already been publicists and editors in Germany. As

a result, they were disproportionately represented in the newspaper business and “took control of

the German newspapers, founded many new ones, and redirected public opinion” (Baron, 2012,

3). (It is worth emphasizing in this context that most German-language newspapers were in fact

bilingual, and were read by both English-speakers and German-Americans.) At this time, news-

papers emerged as the most important source of information as well as a forum for public debate

(Gentzkow, Glaeser and Goldin, 2006; Gentzkow, Shapiro and Sinkinson, 2011). Newspapers be-

came so widely read that Ulysses Grant noted with pride that the Union Army was “composed

of men [...] who knew what they were fighting for” because they were reading newspapers regu-

larly (McPherson, 1997, 94). Evidence of the Forty-Eighters’ political contributions in newspapers

abounds: in April 1861, on the eve of the war’s outbreak, Ottile Assing wrote in the Allgemeine

Zeitung that “everyone whose sense of humanity and justice has not been poisoned by that national

plague, slavery, must concede that the bloodiest war has to be favored over so called peace which

we have ‘enjoyed’ under the slave-holders’ despotic rule” (Öfele, 2004, 2). Eighteen months later,

Heinrich Börnstein welcomed Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation in the Anzeiger des Westens,

writing that “by this proclamation, Mr. Lincoln made [...] every soldier in this army into an eman-

cipator, into a soldier of freedom.” The left panel of Figure 1 displays the time-series of the total

number of German-language newspapers in the U.S. together with our data on the arrival of the

Forty-Eighters.16 In line with our argument, the figure shows a steep increase in German-language

newspapers around the time the the Forty-Eighters arrived in the U.S.
  16
     We coded up the town-level circulation of German-language newspapers and journals from Arndt (1965), which
includes the full history of the German-American press. Arndt lists all German-language newspapers and political
journals, including the dates of their first and last issues.

Notes: The left panel plots the arrival of the Forty-Eighters (solid line, scaled on the left axis) together with the
growth of German-language newspapers in the U.S. (dashed line, scaled on the right axis). The right scale starts at
165 German-language newspapers in 1840. The right panel plots the arrival of the Forty-Eighters (solid line, scaled
on the left axis) together with the emergence of the Turner Societies in the U.S., the first two of which were founded
in 1848 (dashed line, scaled on the right axis).




    Social clubs: Most Forty-Eighters were active in local social and political clubs. At this time,

social clubs and associations played a prominent role in American social life, a phenomenon that

was noted as early as 1835 by de Toqueville. These clubs were an important channel for the trans-

mission of beliefs, norms and convictions in American society (Putnam, 2001; White, 2017). Social

clubs were also important for German-Americans, who joined and founded a phletoria of ‘free men’s

societies’, singing clubs, book clubs, shooting clubs etc. Bretting (1981, 201) lists over 50 different

German social clubs in Philadelphia alone. Some of these clubs were not political, but others were,

and the Turner Societies (‘Turnvereine’) were a prominent example. Turner Societies emerged at

the beginning of the 19th century in the German states during the time of the Napoleonic occu-

pation with the goal to strengthen physical and moral powers through the practice of gymnastics.

The movement became more politicized during the 1830s, and Turner Societies became important

vehicles of political organization during the revolutions in Germany. The right panel of Figure 1,

which we coded up from the annual reports of the national Turner Societies (Metzner, 1890—1894),

shows that the emergence of Turner Societies in the U.S. coincided with the Forty-Eighters’ arrival.

The first American Turner Society was founded in 1848, followed by an explosion in their number

especially after 1854, when the Forty-Eighters revived their political engagement (Wittke, 1973,

ch10). Historians agree that the Forty-Eighters were directly involved in founding many societies


                                                         11
and in turning them into highly political organizations (Wittke 1973, ch11, Kamphoefner and Hel-

bich 2006, 4). The national convention of Turner Societies had articulated a clearly abolitionist

platform by 1855 (Wittke, 1973, 195); Turners would frequently form bodyguards for anti-slavery

activists during public speeches, and in 1860 they made up Lincoln’s bodyguards at his inaugura-

tion (Zucker, 1950; Baron, 2012) During the war, Turner societies would often enlist en bloc into

the Union Army, forming so-called ‘Turner Regiments’ (Hofmann 1995, 158; Levine 1980, p.256).

       Public Speeches: The Forty-Eighters were convinced of their ideals and they advocated

them in public lectures at political clubs and societies. In this pre-radio era, public speakers

who combined oratorical skill and passion influenced the formation of beliefs and convictions like

no other medium (Goodheart, 2011, 47, 120). ‘Agitation’ was viewed as a critical political tool;

abolitionist congressman Joshua Giddings called it “the great and mighty instrument for carrying

forward reforms” (Foner, 1970, 113).17 As public speakers, the Forty-Eighters were at the forefront

of the anti-slavery agitation, both in front of German-speaking and English-speaking audiences.

One observer wrote in 1860 that “of the German speakers a man named Carl Schurz has acquired

a great reputation. He even drew loud applause from the Americans for his speeches in English.

The Democratic party though hates him all the more, especially the slaveholders.” (Kamphoefner

and Helbich, 2006, 38). Many other Forty-Eighters became known for their public lectures and

speeches (Wittke, 1973, 130). We use instances of such public speeches (gleaned from newspapers)

in the event-study in Section 5.2.

       Enlistments: Around one-third of the Forty-Eighters had military backgrounds in Germany,

and most of them enlisted themselves in the Civil War, often convincing those around them to do

the same. We can directly measure this channel after record-linking the Forty-Eighters to the Union

Army data for their enlistment location and date.18 We identify 149 Forty-Eighters who enlisted in

the Union Army. Of the roughly two-thirds without military backgrounds, only few enlisted. This

is explained by their relatively advanced age by that time. Over 95 percent of soldiers were under

the age of 40 when they enlisted, while the Forty-Eighters were in their mid-forties or older when

the war broke out. In fact, the enlistment agencies discouraged men over 40 from enlisting unless
  17
     McPherson (1997, ch7–9) emphasizes the importance of this in his analysis of soldier letters and diaries; stat-
ing that “the genuineness of [Civil War soldiers’ ideological] sentiments” can be hard for contemporary readers to
understand, as “theirs was an age of romanticism” (p.100).
  18
     We knew all Forty-Eighters who enlisted from their biographies, but need the Union Army data for the date.




                                                        12
they had military training (Costa and Kahn, 2010, ch.5). In short, Forty-Eighters’ enlistment

decisions were primarily driven by whether they had a military background or not, and almost all

of those who had this background did enlist.19

    Many of the Forty-Eighters appear to have exerted their influence through several or even all

of the four channels laid out above: for example, Ernst Violand, who was “condemned to death

during the Revolution, wrapped cigars in New York in 1850 and later combined his cigar business

in Peoria, Illinois, with lecturing, writing for the newspapers, and making stump speeches for the

Republican party” (Wittke, 1973, 65); or Bernard Domschke, who “made antislavery speeches in

Milwaukee [...], published the Milwaukee Journal and [...] in 1861 resigned from the Milwaukee

Herold to join the army” (Wittke, 1973, 128). For illustrative purposes, Appendix A.4 provides

some selected biographical case studies of individual Forty-Eighters, omitting deliberately the most

prominent individuals such as Schurz or Anneke.



2     Data

We construct a new town-level dataset for the U.S. that integrates information on the Forty-

Eighters’ location choices, the socio-economic composition of the town where they settled, and

union army enlistment information at the town level. Our three main data sources are (i ) individual

biographies of 493 Forty-Eighters; (ii ) Fishman’s (2009) town-level extract from the 1850 and

1860 censuses, which we have geo-located, and (iii ) the full Union Army rosters, which we have

additionally record-linked to the 1860 Full-Count Census. We summarize these data-sets below

and discuss their construction in more detail in Appendix B. This Section describe the newly

constructed data for our core analysis. Additional data (e.g. for the IV and event study results)

are introduced later.
  19
     Wittke (1973, 22) notes that the Forty-Eighters had already divided into two ‘types’ with arguably different
leadership styles in Germany, i.e. those “who belonged to local diets of the Frankfurt Parliament [or were] publicists
and editors”, and those who “commanded troops in the field”. Wittke (1973, 61) further notes that an “extraordinarily
large proportion” of the latter group enlisted in the Union Army 15 years later, while “the rest of them battled with
pen and speech and all the weapons of the mind, and with deep conviction” While we have no systematic data on
military background in Germany, we find a strong correlation between (possibly incomplete information on) having
been involved in military altercations during the German revolutions and enlisting in the Civil War.

2.1    Forty-Eighter Biographies

We coded detailed U.S. biographies for almost 500 Forty-Eighters from Zucker (1950), Wittke

(1970), Raab (1998) and Baron (2012), and supplemented them through individual searches in

genealogical online sources. After their arrival in the U.S., most Forty-Eighters spent some time in

their arrival port, mostly New York City—before moving westward. In our analysis, we focus on

towns in which Forty-Eighters had settled by 1856. This leaves out the Forty-Eighters’ early years

when they established themselves personally and professionally, but were still politically inactive,

while the broader conflict around slavery also lay dormant. Specifically, we consider those towns

as Forty-Eighter towns where at least one Forty-Eighter had settled in the five years prior to the

Civil war, i.e. between 1856-1861. This treatment definition leaves us with 73 Forty-Eighter towns

in the North.20 Figure 2 displays the spatial distribution of these towns.




                           Figure 2: Spatial distribution of the Forty-Eighters
Notes: The map shows the spatial distribution of the Forty-Eighter towns. Larger bubbles indicate locations with
more Forty-Eighters. In addition, the figure displays rivers (blue) and 1860 county boundaries (gray).



  20
   Nine towns were located in the Confederate States or the West, and play no role in our analysis and we also drop
New York. Further note that we will also loose Washington D.C. in specifications with state fixed effects.

2.2    U.S. Towns in 1850–1860

We combine the Forty-Eighters’ biographies with detailed town-level data that were published for

the years 1850 and 1860. Since we are interested in the spread of liberal ideas though the local social

network, it is vital to work with spatially disaggregated data at the town level. The ICPSR-dataset

Population of Counties, Towns, and Cities in the United States, 1850 and 1860 created by Fishman

(2009) informs us which towns existed and provides information on their population size, race and

gender. To augment this with geographical information on German immigrants’ travel routes, the

distance to railways and rivers, as well as controls that account for e.g. local agricultural conditions,

we geolocated the Fishman (2009) towns in a two-stage procedure. first matching the universe of

towns to the 2018 ‘U.S. Cities Database’, and then using a combination of google’s geolocation

service and manual checks on historical county maps to locate unmatched towns. These two steps

geolocate 94 percent of all Northern towns in Fishman (2009).21 We construct spatial controls

for these towns (e.g. proximity to rivers), and additionally supplement the town-level data with

county-level controls from the Historical, Demographic, Economic, and Social Data: The United

States, 1790-2002 (Haines, 2010):


2.3    The Union Army Data

Our main empirical focus is the Forty-Eighters’ influence on Union Army enlistments in a town.

Enlistments are the ideal measure for us because they were the immediate object of the Forty-

Eighters’ actions once the war had broken out, and they offer a meaningful measure of the Forty-

Eighters’ impact on their neighbors’ convictions, given that enlisting entailed great personal risk

and over ninety percent of enlistees were volunteers.22 The enlistment data stem from a newly

digitized collection of the Union Army Registers, reports issued by each state’s Adjutant General’s

Office at the end of the war. The reports provide information on all enlistments for the entire

Union Army. Appendix Table A1 reports the total number of Union Army soldiers by state, the

enlistment date of the tenth chronological percentile of enlisted men, the average enlistment date,

as well as the population shares of enlisted men.
  21
     In all steps, we project the allocated coordinates into county polygons and only keep observations that are located
in the correct county.
  22
     Town-level voting would be another interesting measure, but it proved impossible to construct such measures (at
least in the part of the country where the Forty-Eighters were), as we discuss in Appendix B.4.2.



                                                          15
                                       Figure 3: Mapping Enlistments
Notes: This figure displays the spatial distribution of enlistments per adult males. In addition, the figure displays
rivers (blue) and 1860 county boundaries (gray).




    Figure 3 illustrates the spatial distribution of enlistments across U.S. towns. To derive this

distribution, we match the enlistment locations with our town dataset. For just under half the

soldiers, the data report the county or state of residence but not the town. We fill in missing town-

of-residence information by linking the Registers to the 1860 Full-Count Census, ‘blocking’ soldiers

by state and using their first name, last name, middle name, age, and (where available) location

information for the record linkage. Matching is aided by the fact that the Census was recorded

just one year before the war broke out and that the Registers include enlistees’ age and middle

name. Appendix B.2.1 explains the details of our record-linkage procedure, including how the match

threshold is set. The matching procedure only accepts unique matches and the match threshold

is set sufficiently high that after extensive spot-checking, we are confident in the accuracy of the

matches. To illustrate the derivation of match scores to the reader, Appendix Table A2 reports on

a random draw of three matches for each match score that occurs in our data above the threshold

score where we keep matches. This procedure uniquely identifies 750,000 soldiers from the Registers

inside the Full Count Census. For half of these men, the home-town information was previously


                                                         16
missing, increasing the share of records with town-of-residence information to over two-thirds.



3     Empirical Setup

When the Forty-Eighters arrived in the U.S., most of them had no clear destination, no local social

networks and no family ties to speak of. The German Society of New York reported “in 1850 and

1851 a sudden steep increase in requests for assistance to people totally deprived of all means,

mostly political refugees flocking to America after the failure of the revolutions” (Wust, 1984, 31).

Over time, however, the Forty-Eighters established themselves—personally and professionally—and

settled in the locations displayed in Figure 2. Our main identification concern is the potentially

selective nature of the Forty-Eighters’ settlement choices. For example, if they deliberately chose

destination locations that were opposed to slavery, we might over-estimate their effect on Union

Army enlistments. To address this concern, Section 3.1 discusses the historical narrative of the

Forty-Eighters’ settlement choices in America. This narratives highlights the main location fac-

tors that attracted them. We then employ an agnostic variable selection model that identifies all

important factors explaining Forty-Eighters’ settlement from a large pool of socio-economic and

geographic variables. (The factors that are prominent in the historical narrative are all prominently

selected by the model, but they are not the only ones.) Section 3.2 uses the model’s selected loca-

tion factors in a propensity score matching (PSM) to determine a group of suitable control towns

whose distribution of observable covariates resembles that of the treated Forty-Eighter -towns.


3.1   The Forty-Eighters’ Location Choices

The following paragraphs provide a brief historical narrative of how the Forty-Eighters came to

settle where they did. These narratives inform us about the most relevant location factors, our

Core Controls. After that, we employ a variable selection model to determine Additional Controls

from the wider pool of socio-economic and geographic controls at hand.

    Core Controls: The Forty-Eighters’ biographies suggest that their initial settlement choices

in the U.S. were determined by the presence of pre-existing German-American communities and

the attractiveness of a town for newly arrived German immigrants (Wittke, 1970, p.66). The

following six core controls capture these circumstances. First, we measure each town’s distance


                                                 17
to the closest destination location advertised in Metzler’s Map for Immigrants, the most widely

circulated cartographic guide for German immigrants to the U.S. in the early 1850s. See Figure A4

in Appendix B.5 for the geo-referenced map. Second, we measure the size of a town’s German

community as observed in the 1850 Full-Count U.S. Census. Third, we measure the change in

the size of German communities between the 1850 and 1860 Full-Count U.S. Census. Fourth,

we measure each town’s intake of German immigrants arriving during the narrow time-window

1848–1852 that coincided with the Forty-Eighters’ arrival period. This control is created from the

‘Germans to America’ ship lists, which also form the basis of our instrument (Glazier and Filby

1999, Glazier 2005).23 This fourth measure is important because it addresses the concern that

the Forty-Eighters co-located with other German immigrants arriving at the same time who might

have shared their ideals of liberty and equality. If we did not account for this correlation, we would

potentially overstate the Forty-Eighters’ true influence.

       While the Forty-Eighters’ short-term job opportunities were often limited to the same occu-

pations where most German immigrants found work, i.e. on the railroad, on farms, and as office

clerks, our biographical records suggests that many Forty-Eighters quickly put down their picks

and shovels and started working in teaching, journalism, publishing, or the arts.24 While Forty-

Eighters changed occupation, they tended to stay close to where they had first found work, often

moving only to a neighboring town or county. In the medium run, the Forty-Eighters may have

been particularly attracted to towns that offered job opportunities for highly educated German

immigrants. Therefore, we always include the log of a town’s 1850 population. To control for the

potentially different socio-political climate of such towns, we further coded the 1850 town-level

circulation of German-speaking newspapers and journals from Arndt (1965).25

       Additional Controls: We have a range of additional town- and county-level controls at hand.
  23
      To generate this control, we matched all immigrants on ship-lists from the period 1848–1852 with the 1860
Full Count U.S. Census using information on their name, age, gender and birthplace. We repeated this match-
ing procedure for immigrants on the ship-lists from 1845–1847 and 1853–1855 to perform robustness checks. (See
Appendix Table A8.) The Shipping Lists and the matching procedure are discussed in Appendix B.5.2.
   24
      The example of Hermann Raster illustrates this argument. Raster was a true intellectual. He spoke seven
languages, had studied in Leipzig and Berlin, and was part of a literature circle around Bettina von Arnim, a German
writer and novelist who was known to support young talents. Raster was imprisoned because of his active role in the
German Revolution, but he was released from prison in 1851 under the condition that he would leave Germany. He
arrived in New York in July 1851. The only work he could find upon his arrival was as a wood-chopper on a farm
near Tioga, Pennsylvania. However, by 1852 he had found employment as a newspaper editor.
   25
      Arndt lists all German-language newspapers and political journals, including the dates of their first and last
issues.

Fishman (2009) provides a set of town-level population control variables, including the female,

free colored and the slave population shares. In addition, we thank Michael Haines for sharing

1840 town-level demographic information from a thus-far unpublished part of the data collection

in Haines (2010). Having geo-located all Fishman (2009) towns, we can also calculate a rich set of

geographic location factors: longitude and latitude; elevation; mean temperature and precipitation;

distances to the coast, to the nearest navigable river and to the railway network in 1850 (provided

by Atack, 2015); and the shortest distance to one of the four relevant arrival ports (Baltimore, New

Orleans, New York and Philadelphia). Finally, we peruse historical county-level voting data for

presidential elections from the dataset Electoral Data for Counties in the United States: Presidential

and Congressional Races, 1840-1972 (Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale, 1987).26 This latter control

allows us to asses whether Forty-Eighter towns were initially different in their political environment.

      Table 1 compares the averages of all control variables across the NT = 72 Forty-Eighter towns

and the pool of NC0 = 11, 023 control towns. Note that the table omits variables in our data that

never display any significant correlation with the treatment D(Forty-Eighteri > 0) in any of the

exercises discussed below. The table is vertically segmented into a block of core controls, followed by

geographic and climatic town-level controls, county controls from Haines (2010), controls for 1850

town-level demographics from Fishman (2009), and town-level controls for changes in demographics

between 1840 to 1850. Lastly, we report on 1852 party vote-shares from (Clubb, Flanigan and

Zingale, 1987). (The Republican Party was formed in 1854, in large part out of the Liberty and Free

Soil Parties.) Columns 1–2 report variable averages for control and treated towns, with standard

deviations in brackets. To facilitate comparison, Columns 3–4 report Wald-tests of the equality of

each variable across control and treated towns. In Column 3, we do not include state fixed effects

and Column 4 repeats the exercise with state fixed effects, the default in our estimations. The

comparison shows substantial differences (p-values in square brackets) between the treated towns

and the set of potential control towns, both with and without state fixed effects.

      To determine which variables are actually predictive of D(Forty-Eighteri > 0) in a multivariate

regression, columns 5–6 report the results of a variable selection model that employs Akaike’s

information criterion to select a set of control variables (Lindsey and Sheather, 2010) with and

without state fixed effects. Column 6 shows that all six core controls which we viewed a priori
 26

as strongly predictive for the Forty-Eighters’ location choice are indeed selected by the variable

selection algorithm. This adds credibility to our measures and reading of the historical record. The

algorithm also chooses some additional geographic and demographic characteristics. One exercise

we will perform in the following estimations is to control specifically for the variables selected by

the algorithm.27


3.2    Matched Sample of Forty-Eighter and Control Towns

Table 1 compares a small number of Forty-Eighter towns to a large number of potential control

towns and we have seen that the Forty-Eighter towns’ covariate distribution differs from the rest.

This can affect the precision of later estimates and the outcome might be sensitive to small changes

in the model specification (Imbens and Rubin, 2015). To address this concern, we employ propensity

score matching (PSM) to choose from the set of all possible control towns NC0 a subset NC ⊆ NC0

whose distribution of observable covariates is similar to the distribution of covariates among the

Forty-Eighter towns. To select NC , we run logistic regressions of the treatment D(Forty-Eighteri >

0) on the set of location factors from the variable selection model (Table 1, Column (6)) to estimate

a propensity score. To reduce heterogeneity, we restrict the matching to towns within the same

state and within the same town size bin.28 With the propensity score at hand, NC is determined

by matching each Forty-Eighter town to its five nearest neighbors in propensity-score space. Note

that the matching is with replacement, so for NT = 54 Forty-Eighter towns, we expect NC ≤ 270

control towns.29 Compared to previous results, we lose large towns because they are off the common

support, i.e. have no suitable control in the same state.30 Appendix Table A3 is the equivalent

of Table 1, but instead of comparing 72 treated towns to 11,023 control towns, Appendix Table

A3 compares the 54 treated towns on common support to 207 control towns. Relative to Table 1,

the matched sample (labeled PSM-1 ) in Appendix Table A3 is far more balanced on observable
  27
     Interestingly, the county-level voting controls suggest that the pre-arrival party vote-share for the abolitionist
Liberty Party was lower in Forty-Eighter towns. This is consistent with the historical records according to which
the Forty-Eighters’ “rational” abolitionism ran counter to the puritan abolitionism that would have determined the
1848 Liberty Party vote share (Foner, 1970, 107) .
  28
     We create 3 bins: A cutoff at the fifth percentile captures very small places, and a cutoff at the ninety-fifth
percentile captures urban centers.
  29
     Alternative specifications where we alter the number of matching partners do not lead to different results.
  30
     The Forty-Eighter -towns we lose are Baltimore MD, Brooklyn NY, Buffalo NY, Chicago IL, Cincinnati OH,
Cleveland OH, Davenport IA, Detroit MI, Louisville KY, Milwaukee WI, Newark NY, Philadelphia PA, St Louis
MO.

controls (columns 3–4). This partly reflects the fact that practically all of the largest U.S. towns

are among the Forty-Eighter towns in the full sample but not in the matched sample because they

do not have a ‘statistical twin’ in the same state. A second notable feature is that the variable

selection model on which we report in columns 5–6 chooses far fewer variables as being predictive

of the Forty-Eighters’ location than it did before, and even those few variables are mostly not

statistically significant.31

    In Appendix C, we discuss three added variations on the propensity-score matched sample:

PSM-2 does not impose exact matching on state and population bins, which slightly increases the

number of treated towns on common support because control towns can be drawn from a wider

pool. PSM-3 decrease the number of required nearest neighbors from 5 to 3, which again slightly

increases the number of matched treated towns. Finally, PSM-4 includes 1860 town controls

as additional matching variables. These post-date the Forty-Eighters’ settlement and are thus

potentially endogenous, but the 1860 Census contains richer information on wealth, education and

occupation. We report the main results for these additional sample definitions in Appendix C.



4    Results

Our core focus is the Forty-Eighters’ effect on Union Army enlistments in town i, which we estimate

in the following equation


                               yi = β · D(Forty-Eighteri > 0) + Xi0 δ + ηs + i ,                        (1)


where yi is the log of enlistments in town i. D(Forty-Eighteri > 0) is an indicator function that takes

the value 1 if at least one Forty-Eighter lived in this town between 1856–1861, Xi is a vector of town

and county control variables, ηs are state fixed effects, and i is an error term. In Section 4.1, we

present OLS estimates of equation (1) along with a range of robustness checks, placebo estimations,

and permutation tests. In Section 4.2, we develop an IV strategy for the estimation of equation (1).
  31
     Appendix Figure A5 shows that the matched sample also moves the distribution of the outcome variable for
treated towns closer to controls towns.

4.1      Baseline Estimates in the Matched and Full Sample

Table 2 reports the OLS results of estimating equation (1). The first three columns show results

where we use the full sample, i.e. compare 72 Forty-Eighter towns to 11,023 control towns. The

next three columns report on the results in our baseline matched sample (PSM-1 ), comparing

54 Forty-Eighter towns to 207 matched control towns. Columns 1 and 4 report on specifications

with only state fixed effects and the six core controls. Columns 2 and 5 add the controls selected

by the variable selection model (Table 1, Column (6)). Columns 3 and 6 include all town and

county controls that have no missing values in our data. The estimated effect is considerably larger

in the full sample, where we estimate that Forty-Eighter towns had around ninety percent more

enlistments. The contrast between columns 1–3 and 4–6 highlights the importance of restricting the

sample to a more similar matched control group: the matched sample OLS estimates in columns 4–

6 suggest that the Forty-Eighters increased enlistments by two thirds rather than ninety percent.32

The results in columns 4–6 are our preferred ones. At a median enlistment rate of 12 enlistees

per 100 adult males, this is equivalent to eight extra enlistees per 100 adult men. This number

is confirmed in Appendix Table A5, which reports the results for per capita enlistments as the

outcome.33 For clarity of exposition, Table 2 reports only the Forty-Eighters’ effect on enlistments.

The estimated coefficients on the control variables are reported in Appendix Table A6.

       To get a sense for potential selection on unobservables in the full and matched sample, we report

Oster’s δ in the bottom of Table 2. Oster’s δ measures how large the bias from unobservables would

have to be relative to bias from observable to imply a true value of β = 0 in equation (1). In the

full sample, δ is consistently around 0.5. In the matched sample by contrast, δ ranges between

1.7 and 1.9. This implies a strong sense of robustness in the matched sample, where selection on

unobservables would have to be almost twice as strong as selection on observables to make our core

estimate go away. We now discuss a range of specification checks on these estimations.

       Sample Choice: Appendix Table A4 shows that the results are robust to three variations

in the matching procedure (PSM-2 to PSM-4 ), as well as to running the full-sample results with
  32
      We are interpreting the coefficient on a dummy and the dependent variable is log-transformed, so the percentage
effect of D(Forty-Eighteri > 0) on log enlistments is calculated as 100 × [eβ − 1]. This is 66–67 percent.
   33
      Figure A6 shows that per capita enlistments have a much more skewed distribution than the log of enlistments,
with fat tails. We therefore report on per capita enlistments only as a reference point, and focus on the log of
enlistments as our primary outcome.

Notes: The table reports results from estimating equation (1). The outcome variable is the log of Union Army
enlistments in a town. Columns 1–3 report on the full sample, comparing 72 Forty-Eighter towns to 11,023 control
towns. Columns 4–6 report on the matched sample, comparing 54 Forty-Eighter towns to over 207 matched control
towns. Each column reports the number of treated towns (# Forty-Eighter Towns ) providing identifying variation
in each specification, as well as the mean of the dependent variable. Oster delta refers to the test of the relative
importance of observed and unobserved variables in generating selection bias suggested in Oster (2019). If δ > 1,
results are considered robust. Standard errors are clustered at the state-level, p-values are reported in square brackets.
In braces, we additionally report p-values for wild-bootstrap clustered standard errors.



county- instead of state fixed effects.34 Reassuringly, the alternative matched samples generate

very similar results to the baseline sample PSM-1, and the inclusion of county fixed effects brings

the full-sample results closer to the matched-sample results.

       Heterogeneity: Appendix Table A7 assesses sample heterogeneity. We would like to under-

stand whether specific Forty-Eighter characteristics drive the estimated treatment effect in Table 2.

From the individual biographies, we distinguish whether individual Forty-Eighters (i) fought in the

Civil War; (ii) were politically active; (iii) worked as journalists; or (iv) were members of a Turner

Society. For those who fought in the Civil War, we further distinguish whether they were in (v)

leading positions (colonel or above) or lower ranks (vi).35 The interaction between indicators for

the presence of at least one Forty-Eighter and at least one of these characteristics gives us some

indication whether the observed treatment effects are intensified (or reduced) by these personal

characteristics. We do not find strong evidence for treatment heterogeneity. The main effect does
  34
    County fixed effects cannot be included in the matched sample because they would absorb most treated towns.
  35
    Characteristics (i)–(iv) were coded separately by three research assistants based on the full bio data on each
Forty-Eighter. We applied a positive coding for a characteristic if at least two of the three research assistants agreed
on it. Characteristics (v)–(vi) are coded from the Union Army rosters.

not vary a lot and most interaction effects are imprecisely estimated. The only significant interac-

tion suggests that ‘politically active’ Forty-Eighters were more successful in attracting enlistments.

Turners and journalists have a quantitatively similar effect but the interactions are imprecisely

estimated. For those who fought in the war, we see some indication that higher ranked observe

that Forty-Eighters of higher military rank were a bit more influential. Section 5 will investigate

these channels in more detail.

   Placebo Estimations: Among the core controls, the 1848–1852 ‘Germans to America’ co-

arrival cohorts deserve a separate investigation. In particular, we are interested in whether the

Forty-Eighters were merely the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of a broader wave of politically active German

immigrants arriving at the same time. If that was the case, we would expect that this 1848–1852

arrival cohort had an independent effect on enlistments. Moreover, the inclusion of this cohort in

the regressions should reduce the Forty-Eighters’ estimated effect on enlistments, and we would

expect this cohort to stand out from earlier and later arrival cohorts. It turns out that none of these

three hypotheses is borne out in the data, as we show in Appendix Table A8. We view the lack

of these patterns as evidence against the notion that the Forty-Eighters were just the prominent

spearhead of a larger group of politically active and influential immigrants from that period.

   Permutation Tests: Table 2 conveys a very robust association between Forty-Eighters and

volunteering for the Union Army. As a further robustness check, we rule out spuriously correlated

effects through a permutation test, replacing the actual Forty-Eighter locations with an equal

number of randomly drawn location in the Union-Army states, and then re-estimating equation (1)

with this placebo treatment. We repeat this experiment 1,000 times, comparing the distribution of

the estimated placebo effects to the actual treatment effect. Appendix-Figure A7 shows that and

even the 99-th percentile of the distribution is smaller than the estimate in Table 2.

   Interpolated Data: In the baseline, we calculate town-level enlistments based on the two-

thirds of soldiers where we observe residence information. In Appendix Table A9, we report results

when we spatially interpolate missing residence information (see Appendix B.2.2). The interpola-

tion reduces the spatial sharpness of enlistments because the procedure smoothly assigns unlocated

soldiers across locations that are close to a regiment’s centroid of reported residence information.

As expected, the resulting estimated effect is smaller in the interpolated data. However, it remains

equally statistically significant as the baseline estimate.

4.2      Instrumental Variable Strategy

So far, we assumed that we can gain identification by matching on observable town characteristics.

However, while propensity score matching aids identification by generating a more balanced sample,

this alone does not necessarily establish causality. To address this concern, we now introduce an

instrumental variable (IV) strategy that rests on the fact that the Forty-Eighters did not plan

their trip ahead in the same way that other immigrants did. Due to their haphazard departure,

they rarely had a specific destination in mind when they departed. For most Forty-Eighters,

the transatlantic voyage would have been the first opportunity to learn about different locations

in the U.S. Lasting between six and ten weeks, the voyage provided ample opportunity to form

social connections and strike up friendships with co-passengers whose idiosyncratic knowledge about

specific destinations in the U.S. could be influential in shaping where the Forty-Eighters themselves

would settle.36 In fact, the cramped conditions and prolonged interactions on the long transatlantic

voyage were more likely to affect individual’ priors about possible destinations than encounters in

the large anonymous metropolises of New York City, Baltimore or Philadelphia where the Forty-

Eighters disembarked. As a point of reference, Battiston (2018) shows that even the much briefer

social interactions on steam-ship transatlantic crossings in the 20th century had sizable impacts on

immigrants’ paths in America.

       The following three arguments summarize how we exploit this historical narrative in our IV

strategy: (i) across ships, there is dispersion in co-passengers’ preferences for—and information

about—destinations in the U.S. (for example due to migrant networks); (ii) the Forty-Eighters’

destination choices were influenced by their co-passengers; (iii) the Forty-Eighters selected their

ships quasi-randomly. Instrument relevance results from (i) and (ii) and exogeneity relies on (iii).

       To operationalize this idea, we utilize the immigrant ship lists in the ‘Germans to America’ book

collection for 1848–1852 which include information on the U.S. destinations passengers reported at

their port of debarkation. Of a total of over 1,700 voyages in this period, we identify 136 individual

voyages with 152 Forty-Eighters on them.37 We use these records to recover a distribution of
  36
     While the ‘era of mass migration’ invokes images of large steam ships, the Forty-Eighters still came on sail-ships.
  37
     To put this in perspective, the ‘Germans to America’ collection accounts for about half the estimated German
immigrant arrivals in the time period covered. See Appendix B.5.2. We linked the Forty-Eighters to the ship lists by
first defining a set of candidate matches based on bigram-indexation of names, and then allowing up to a three-year
difference in age and two year differences in arrival year between our records and the ship-records, before manually
checking the final matched sample.



                                                          26
reported destination towns in the U.S. for the 136 Forty-Eighters ships and the remaining ‘non-

Forty-Eighter ’ ships arriving between 1848 and 1852.38 In line with our reading that the Forty-

Eighters did not have time to plan their trip, there are only two instances of Forty-Eighters reporting

stated destinations themselves. We drop these two.

       Our identification strategy exploits differences in the distribution of stated destinations on Forty-

Eighter ships and non-Forty-Eighter ships. One may be concerned that systematic differences in

travel routes may confound our strategy. For example, most Forty-Eighters arrived in a narrow time

window (see Figure 1) and, given a moving frontier, German immigrants who arrived earlier or later

might have faced different travel routes and destinations in the U.S. However, within the narrow

window between 1848 and 1852, the distribution of arrival years does not differ between Forty-

Eighter ships and other ‘non-Forty-Eighter ’ ships. A second concern is that selection on the port

of embarkment might have affected travel routes. Consistent with the discussion in Section 1.1, we

observe that a slightly larger share of Forty-Eighter ships started from Le Havre than from German

or Dutch ports. However, this difference is not statistically significant.

       We instrument the Forty-Eighters’ potentially endogenous location choices with an indicator for

whether a town was a reported destination on one of the Forty-Eighters’ ships, conditioning on the

overall attractiveness of a given destination according to the ship lists. This allows us to distinguish

between the general distribution of German immigrant destinations and the one specific to Forty-

Eighter ships. We start with a specification where we control for the overall distribution of stated

destinations on non-Forty-Eighter ships, by splitting their frequency into four ‘popularity-quartiles’.

We can further refine this control up to septile bins.39 In a second—more conservative—strategy,

we control for the same binned counts of the number of times a town was a stated destination on

all ships, i.e. including the Forty-Eighter ships.

       The top-two panels of Table 3 report the IV results and the first stage for specifications where we

control for the popularity of a destination town by separating the frequency distribution of stated

destination on non-Forty-Eighter ships either into quartiles (columns 1–3) or septiles (columns

4–6). The bottom-two panels of Table 3 report the equivalent results for the more conservative
  38
     We limited ourselves to ships arriving in this time window because the ‘haphazard arrival’ is much less plausible
for the few Forty-Eighters who arrived later, although the instrument’s logic would be the same after 1852.
  39
     Using five or six bins generates qualitatively identical results. Increasing the number of bins beyond seven renders
the second stage too imprecisely estimated, which is unsurprising given the 54 treated observations in the matched
sample.

controls of stated destinations on all ships. Within each panel, the results are highly robust to

variations in the control variables. Across panels, it is notable that the strategy pursued in Panels

C–D is more conservative, as the estimated core-effect is consistently lower in Panel C than in Panel

A. The p-values of the Hausman Test and F statistics on the instruments also both suggest the

second, more conservative, strategy is the preferable one. The high p-value on the Wu-Hausman

test indicates that we cannot statistically reject the equality of the OLS and IV estimates.

   To assess the robustness of our IV estimates, we perform two placebo exercises. The first one is

designed to rule out the possibility of a spurious relationship between the Forty-Eighters’ locations

of settlement and the destinations reported by their co-passengers: We randomly draw the same

number of ships as we have Forty-Eighter ships from the total distribution of German immigrant

ships arriving in the years between 1848–1852. We then construct a placebo instrument from the

intended destinations reported on those falsely assigned ships, and a control variable from the

intended destinations reported on all other ships. The left panel in Figure 4 plots the distribution

of First-Stage F-statistics that results from 100 simulations. It is reassuring to see that the placebo

instruments have no statistical power to explain the Forty-Eighters’ locations of settlement.

   The second placebo exercise is a validation of the logic underlying the instrument: Of the Forty-

Eighters that we locate on ships, 46 percent end up settling in towns that are reported as an intended

destination by their co-passengers. To verify that this relationship is not spurious, we randomly

reshuffle individual Forty-Eighters across the 136 Forty-Eighter ships, and calculate the share of

Forty-Eighters that end up settling in a town that was reported as an intended destination by their

randomly assigned co-passengers. The right panel in Figure 4 shows the distribution resulting from

100 simulations. Again, we find that randomly assigned co-passengers’ stated destinations have

no predictive power for the Forty-Eighters’ actual locations. These placebo tests strongly support

our notion that idiosyncratic variation in co-passengers stated destination towns are driving the

first-stage relationship.

   Finally, in Appendix D.1, we explore an alternative IV strategy that hinges on the fact that

Forty-Eighters’ early years in the U.S. were dominated by economic necessities and that the political

conflict around slavery was subdued during this time. To exploit this insight, we use the locations

of Forty-Eighters’ first jobs outside their port of debarkation as an instrument for the their eventual

pre-Civil War locations. This alternative strategy generates very similar estimates.

passengers on the remaining ships. The right panel shows the distribution resulting from 100 iterations of matching

      In summary, our IV estimations confirm the core findings and since they are not significantly

different, we revert to OLS in the following assessment of mechanisms.



5             Mechanisms and Other Evidence

This section sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that explain the Forty-Eighter success in

recruiting Union Army soldiers. (See discussion in Section 1.3.)


5.1           Mechanisms within the Core Estimation Framework

In this section, we focus on two mechanisms that we can consistently measure at the town-level:

the circulation of German-speaking newspapers (coded from Arndt 1965), and the distribution of

Turner Societies (coded from the Turner Society Foundation’s yearbooks published by Metzner

1890—1894). Figure 1 depicts these two data-sets as aggregate time-series. Columns 1 and 3

of Table 4 estimate equation (1) with these two new outcomes. As a point of reference, we also

utilize the fact that we have annual data on these two mechanisms. This allows us to estimate the



                                                                   30

Notes: This table replicates previous specifications for two likely mechanisms of the Forty-Eighters’ influence: the
presence of a German newspaper in a town, and the presence of a Turner Society. Standard errors are clustered at
the state-level in all columns except columns 2 and 4 where they are clustered at the town level. Columns 2 and 4
report difference-in-differences results estimated using equation 2. p-values are reported in square brackets.

where D(Forty-Eighter > 0)it denotes panel variation (from 1840–1861) in whether there was a

Forty-Eighter in a town, ηi is a town fixed effect, and ηts are state-specific year fixed effects.

Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4 report on the resulting estimates of βDD . Reassuringly, we also see a

notable effect of the Forty-Eighters in the within-town variation over time. The effect is surprisingly

comparable in magnitude to the cross-sectional results.

       Column 5 repeats the baseline estimate from column 5 in Table 2. In columns 6–8, we perform

a simple mediation analysis to investigate whether these two postulated mechanisms can plausibly

explain the core effect of the Forty-Eighters. We recognize the strong identifying assumptions

made in mediation analysis, and emphasize that these results should be interpreted as suggestive

only.40 That being said, columns 6 and 7 indicate that both mechanisms explain some of the Forty-

    Mediation analysis labels the effect of a treatment T on an outcome Y that explicitly does not work through a
mechanism M as the ‘direct’ effect, and the other part as the ‘mediated’ or ‘indirect‘ effect. Traditional approaches

Eighters’ total effect on enlistments, as the inclusion of either reduces the estimated ‘direct’ effect

of Forty-Eighters on enlistments. Including both mechanisms in column 8 explains one-quarter of

the baseline effect ([0.605 − 0.450]/0.605).


5.2    Event-Study Analysis of Enlistments

In this section, we discuss two other mechanisms that are emphasized in the historical narrative:

Forty-Eighters influenced enlistment decisions as public speakers and by enlisting themselves in the

war effort and encouraging others to follow their lead. To assess these ‘acts of leadership’, we screen

newspapers for reports on public appearances and assess their effects on enlistments dynamics in

event study estimations in a town-by-week panel. Similarly, we evaluate enlistment dynamics

after a Forty-Eighter enlisted. We recognize that the timing of these ‘acts of leadership’ could be

endogenous. For example, a public speech about the war effort may have occurred when a town’s

residents were already agitating for war enlistments. Consequently, we think of the event-study

results in Appendix E as suggestive evidence and do not claim causality. They are nonetheless a

valuable consistency check on the narrative and our data.

    Civilian Acts of Leadership: To measure civilian acts of leadership, we manually searched

newspapers.com, a historical newspaper database, for mention of individual Forty-Eighter names.

A large number of articles allude to a Forty-Eighter’s political leaning or past actions, but the

majority either predates the war or does not refer to a specific action, time or place. Nonetheless,

we were able to identify 27 articles on Forty-Eighters’ acts of civic leadership other than their

own enlistment. These primarily report on Forty-Eighters giving speeches, participating in or

organizing events such as concerts or rallies with an anti-slavery pro-Union theme, or actively

encouraging men to enlist. Appendix Figure A12 exhibits two articles as examples. Appendix

Figure A10 and Appendix Table A12 report on the estimated effect of these events. The point

estimates are strikingly similar to the enlistment effects in the baseline estimations: Civilian acts

of leadership cause enlistments to go up by sixty percent in the event week and the week after,

followed by a return to the baseline.
to mediation analysis, assume that both T and M are exogenous, and apply OLS to estimate three equations,

                   Y = δYT · T + ηY ,        T
                                        M = βM · T + M ,      and   Y = βYT · T + βYM · M + Y ,

and then compare the total effect δYT to the indirect effect βYM · βM
                                                                    T
                                                                      . See MacKinnon (2008) for an overview.



                                                         32
   Enlistment Events: Given the Forty-Eighters’ postulated attribute of being civic leaders, we

expect that their enlistment decision to convince others to follow their lead. This should be reflected

in a significantly larger enlistment effect in the following week. Appendix Figure A11 and Appendix

Table A12 confirm this. There is a flat pre-trend followed by a sharp seventy-percent increase in

the number of enlistments in the week a Forty-Eighter enlists followed by forty-percent increase in

the following week. After that, the effect goes back to zero, suggesting no difference between the

treated town and the control group of towns that were not treated in the same event window. In

summary, these estimated dynamic effects corroborate our argument that the Forty-Eighter acted

as civic leaders.

   In interpreting the relatively short-run (two-week) effects of acts of leadership, it is important to

bear in mind that enlistments were coordinated local events: typically, young men in a town would

rally to collectively enlist around the same time as one military unit (a company or a regiment) so

they would fight in the same military unit (McPherson, 1997; Costa and Kahn, 2010). An event

that generated a critical amount of local enthusiasm for enlistment would have therefore tended to

diffuse very fast.


5.3    In Battle

In this section, we study whether the Forty-Eighters’ leadership extended beyond swaying people

to enlist. Specifically, we track those Forty-Eighters who enlisted in the Union Army and estimate

their effect on desertion rates inside their companies. In practice, we re-estimate the duration

analysis in Costa and Kahn (2003), but add indicators for a Forty-Eighter commanding officer or

private in a company. A second point of difference is that Costa and Kahn (2003) analyzed the

desertion choices of 30,000 men whereas we have data on over 2 million.

   We found 149 Forty-Eighters who enlisted in the Union Army. We believe this is the universe

Forty-Eighter enlistments, and at first brush 149 struck us as low, given the Forty-Eighters com-

mitment to the anti-slavery cause. However, as we discuss at the end of Section 1.3, this number

is consistent with the Forty-Eighters’ relatively advanced age at the time of the war, and the fact

that they were always divided into military and non-military ‘types’ (Wittke, 1973, 22). We split

the enlisted Forty-Eighters commissioned officers who commanded companies, i.e. had the rank

of ’captain’, and privates or lower-ranking non-commissioned officers, i.e. corporals or sergeants.


                                                  33
There are 22 commanding officers and 75 lower-ranking officers or privates in our data. The re-

maining Forty-Eighters belonged to military staff that could not be linked to companies. These 97

Forty-Eighters belonged to 94 different companies; only company F of the 3rd Missouri Infantry,

and company K of the 7th New York Infantry counted two Forty-Eighters.

       We treat the presence of either a Forty-Eighter commanding officer or private as a company-

level characteristic, following the literature on combat motivation, which treats companies as the

units of ‘primary group cohesion’ (McPherson 2003, 85, Costa and Kahn 2003). We also follow

this literature in focusing on desertion as the outcome and interpreting it as an inverse measure of

conviction.41 We run the following Cox Proportional Hazard Model


                                            λ(t) = exp(x0I βI + x0K βK )λ0 (t),                                         (3)


where λ(t) is the time elapsed to a soldier’s desertion (‘time to failure’), λ0 (t) is the baseline hazard,

and a spell without desertion ends in a soldier either being killed, discharged due to wounds, taken

prisoner of war, or being ‘mustered out’ after seeing out his enlistment term. The number of

soldiers (‘spells’) for whom we know the exit date and reason is just over 2 million. We let I index

individual variables, and K index company variables. The individual variables xI are made up of

a soldier’s predicted ancestry, enlistment date, and enlistment rank. The latter consists of three

categories, commanding officer, private and the omitted category of lower-ranking officers (sergeants

and corporals). For company variables xK , we approximate the core ethnic-fragmentation measure

in Costa and Kahn (2003) by an ancestry-fragmentation measure of identical functional form: sKa is

ancestry group a’s share of men in company K, so that the fragmentation index F IK = 1 − a s2Ka
                                                                                          P

is 0 if the company is completely homogeneous and it is bounded from above by 1. We add to

this our company variables of interest, namely dummies for having a Forty-Eighter commanding

officer in the company (Forty-EighteroK = 1), and for having a Forty-Eighter in the company (

Forty-EighterpK = 1).

       Table 5 presents the results of estimating equation (3). We report hazard rates, where a hazard

rate of 1.5 means a fifty percent higher probability of desertion. As a baseline, we include only

our treatment of interest in column 1. The estimate suggests that a Forty-Eighter commanding
  41
       In total, eight percent of all soldiers deserted according to our data, which is in line with historical estimates.

Notes: The table reports hazard rates from a Cox Proportional Hazard Model. A hazard rate of 1.5 denotes an
approximately fifty percent higher probability of desertion, while a hazard of 0.9 denotes an approximately ten
percent lower probability. The outcome of interest is the time elapsed to a soldier’s desertion (‘time to failure’).
A spell can alternatively end in a soldier being killed, discharged due to wounds, taken prisoner of war, or being
‘mustered out’ after seeing out his enlistment term. The number of observations is the number of soldiers (‘spells’)
for whom we know the exit date and reason. p-values for robust standard errors are reported in brackets.

officer reduced desertion rates by thirty percent in their company (1 − 0.7), while a Forty-Eighter

private or lower-ranking officer reduced them by seventeen percent (1 − 0.83). In columns 2–5 we

add the other controls. This serves to check the robustness of the Forty-Eighter effect, as well as

to check that the data overall aligns with the existing evidence. Column 2 shows that officers had

the lowest desertion rate and privates the highest. Commanding officers were only five percent as

likely to desert as the omitted category of lower-ranking officers, and far less likely than privates.

Column 3 shows that all immigrants had higher desertion rates relative to American men, but

Germans had the lowest desertion rates among immigrants. They were 19 percent more likely to

desert than American men, while Scandinavian, Irish and other immigrant men were respectively

48, 66, and 100 percent more likely to desert. This mirrors the results in Costa and Kahn (2003)

who actually state as an explanation that “Germans who fled the revolutions of 1848 were more

likely than Irish or British immigrants who migrated for economic reasons to view the United

States as the best hope for the survival of a form of republican government.” Column 4 shows that

soldiers who enlisted in the first year of the war (the omitted category) were least likely to desert,

consistent with historians’ assessment that they had the highest level of enthusiasm for the war

(McPherson, 2003, ch1). In 1863, desertion rates were highest, consistent with generally low morale

in that year following the devastating battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg (Öfele, 2004, 83).

Desertion in 1865 was higher primarily because soldiers who considered the war over did not wait

to be mustered out before returning home for the harvest. Column 5 adds ancestry fragmentation,

the core variable in Costa and Kahn (2003). The estimate implies that a completely homogeneous

company (F IK = 0) had a 10 percent lower desertion rate than a counterfactual company made up

of three equal-sized ancestry groups (F IK = 1 − 3 × 0.332 = 0.67). Despite our treatment variable’s

thin support in the data (with only 94 out of thousands of companies having a Forty-Eighter ), its

estimated effect is surprisingly robust across these specifications. We view this as suggesting that

the leadership qualities that allowed the Forty-Eighter to influence men to enlist also carried over

into other, arguably more testing, settings.


5.4   Long-Lasting Effects

As a final exercise, we ask whether the Forty-Eighters left a permanent legacy in their towns of

settlement. For this purpose, we use a dataset on the formation of local chapters of the National


                                                 36
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) which we have linked to our town

dataset.42 Looking at the formation of local NAACP chapters has two attractive features. First,

it is closely related to our main outcomes of interest. The NAACP was the earliest and for many

decades the only national political organization aiming to advance political, educational, social,

and economic equality for African Americans. Second, it post-dates any political activity by the

Forty-Eighters themselves with the first chapter being formed on February 12th, 1909 (intentionally

coinciding with Lincoln’s 100th birthday).

       Our outcome of interest is whether a town had a local chapter of the NAACP over the period

1909–1965.43 We re-estimate equation (1) for this long-run outcome. One potential concern with

this strategy is that it ignores the Forty-Eighters’ location choices and activities after the Civil

War. However, since these concerns would only attenuate our findings, we opt for consistency

and run the exact same specifications as in Table 2. As with the main enlistment outcomes, the

matched sample results are considerably smaller than the full sample results in the OLS, suggesting

a Forty-Eighter town was 22-23 percent more likely to see the formation of a local chapter of the

NAACP in the long run.

6    Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we use the expulsion of the Forty-Eighters to the U.S. to provide new evidence on

individual leaders’ role in the formation of social movements. The Forty-Eighters fought in the

German revolutions of 1848–49 for their egalitarian and pro-republican convictions. Soon after

their arrival in the U.S., the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 re-started the political conflict around

slavery. This revived the Forty-Eighters’ liberal spirit and they became influential campaigners

against slavery who helped mobilize Union Army volunteers. Our main outcome of interest is

enlistments for the Union Army. This outcome measures an unusually high-stakes decision, and

as such is a strong indication of the Forty-Eighters’ influence on local beliefs and norms as they

related to slavery and Souther institutions.

    Across a wide range of specifications and identification strategies, we find that the Forty-Eighters

increased Union Army volunteering in a town by two thirds, which corresponds to an average of

about eight more enlistments per 100 adult men. Next, we investigate underlying mechanisms

and show that social clubs and newspaper were important platforms that helps spread the liberal

contagion. We further show that military trained Forty-Eighters in leading positions during the

Civil War experienced lower desertion rates. Finally, we present some indicative evidence for a

lasting legacy: Forty-Eighter towns were more likely to see the foundation of chapters of the

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) over the period 1909–1965.

    Taken together, our newly created data provide unique insights into the role that grassroots

leadership can play in the spread of social movements, using as a focal point a critical juncture

in 19th century history. Our results resonate with a theoretical literature on leadership in social

networks, and add a new perspective to an emerging literature on the formation of collective action

in social movements.

Appendix A               Extended Historical Background

Appendix A.1           The 1848–1849 Revolutions in Germany

Somewhat surprised by the revolutionary movement, rulers of smaller German states—what we

know as Germany today comprised 39 independent states which were part of the German Confederation—

were fast to give in. Eventually, also King Frederick William IV of Prussia agreed to pass a consti-

tution, establish a parliament, and support German unification. In March 1849, almost one year

after the beginning of the revolution, the Constitutional Assembly in Frankfurt issued a first con-

stitution. It was designed as foundation of a liberal constitutional state with a strong parliament

to control the government and the Prussian king at its head. 28 of the German states passed the

constitution but the Prussian king, despite his earlier agreement, refused to “pick up a crown from

the gutter” and rejected the constitution on 28 April 1849. In the following counter-revolution,

the absolutist rulers fought the revolutionaries and re-established the situation before the March

Revolution. After some last uprisings, most notably in Baden, Palatine, Saxony and Württemberg,

the revolutionary momentum eventually abated in the summer of 1849.44

       When the Prussian-led troops eventually quelled the last uprisings in the southwest of Germany,

several thousand German revolutionaries escaped to Switzerland. There are different reasons why

Switzerland was a good choice for the revolutionaries. Importantly, it was geographically close,

considered a safe country of asylum, and, following the so-called Sonderbund War (‘Sonderbund-

krieg’),45 Switzerland had already transformed into a federal republic with a democratic consti-

tution. However, the substantial inflow of revolutionaries from German states, Italy and France

presented a serious organizational and financial challenge to Switzerland. Even worse, the refugees

presence raised concerns that Prussia and Austria could use their military power to force Switzer-

land to expel or deliver the revolutionaries. Faced with this threat, Switzerland put pressure on

regular soldiers, who had little to fear, to return to their home countries. Leaders of the revolution

like Gustav Struve, Lorenz Brentano or August Willich were expelled and, with the help of France,

shipped to the United States. As a result, the number of German refugees in Switzerland decreased

rapidly from more than 8350 at the beginning of September 1849 to roughly 2,000 in January 1850

    The Sonderbund War ended the attempted succession of seven Catholic Cantons into a separate alliance (‘Sonder-
bund’) which was formed in opposition to a new Constitution for the Swiss Confederation proposed by the Protestant
cantons.

and as little as 883 refugees in August 1850 (Jung, 2015; Nagel, 2012; Reiter, 1992). This expulsion

is nicely illustrated in a cartoon (Figure A1) where Prussian soldiers led by Friedrich Wilhelm IV

of Prussia sweep the revolutionaries out of Europe.

    While the majority of revolutionaries emigrated straight to the United States, a smaller fraction

went on exile in London, hoping to spark another revolution in Europe. However, with the French

coup d’état of 2 December 1851 which lead to the proclamation of the Second French Empire, they

abandoned this hope and many followed their comrades to the United States (Nagel, 2012). This

explains why we observe a second wave of indigent immigrates of German heritage around that

time.

Appendix A.2           The Slavery Issue in U.S. Politics 1844–1860

After being relatively absent from public debate for the first half-century of the United States’

existence, slavery entered politics in a big way in 1844 when Martin van Buren lost his seemingly

secure Democratic nomination for the presidency on Southern Democratic agitation because he

had opposed the immediate annexation of Texas into the Union as a slave-state. 1844 also saw

the first time a national party—the Liberty Party— with an explicit abolitionist platform entering

the presidential race. During the 1844–1848 presidential term, both major parties–the Whigs and

the Democrats–started to strain over the slavery issue, and saw defections of so-called ’Conscience

Whigs’ and ’Barnburner Democrats’ to third-party coalitions. In the lead-up to the 1848 presiden-

tial election, the Free-Soil Party emerged as a major third party out of a coalition of the Liberty

party, ’Conscience Whigs’ and ’Barnburner Democrats.’ During the campaign of 1848, the term

“slave power” came into heavy use as a description of the out-sized influence that Southern planta-

tion owners appeared to have on the federal government. In the 1848 election, the Free-Soil Party

obtained 10 percent of the popular vote, and it was the last election where the Whig Party won.

       The 1848–1852 presidential term marked a period of relative quiet on the slavery issue, with

many ’Conscience Whigs’ and ’Barnburner Democrats’ returning to their respective parties, largely

due to the two main parties’ “compromise of 1850”, which allowed California to join the Union as

a non-slave state while strengthening in return the enforcement of Fugitive Slave Acts in the North

(Srinivasan, 2017, 115-119). In the 1852 presidential election, the Free-Soil Party obtained less than

five percent of the popular vote and subsequently disappeared from the political landscape. The

Democratic Party won the popular vote.

       The two ensuing years were extraordinarily politically complex, marking one of only two times

in U.S. history when Congressional politics could not be summarized by one or two dimensions

in the NOMINATE score method.46 In fact, the 1853–54 Congress required four dimensions to

explain three-quarters of voting decisions (Poole and Rosenthal, 1991). The field of political issues

simplified as a result of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska bill, which repealed the Missouri Compromise

that had prohibited slavery in the North since 1820, and gave people in the territories of Kansas

and Nebraska the choice of allowing slavery within their borders. This bill was seen as a major
  46
    The second such chaotic time was 1828, which marked the end of the ‘first American party system,’ when the
Federalist party dissolved and the Democratic-Republican Party split into the Democratic and the Whig Party.



                                                     45
success of Southern slave power in Congress and made slavery re-emerge as the defining issue

of the time (Foner, 1970, 94). Throughout 1855, Eastern newspaper readers were captivated by

events in “Bleeding Kansas,” where pro- and anti-slavery settlers battled it out violently for the

upper hand. 1855 also gave birth to the new Republican Party, which combined Free-Soilers with

newly disaffected Whigs and Democrats (Srinivasan, 2017, 120-121).47 This time, the corrosive

force on the Whig Party was lethal, and the Whig Party completely disintegrated within a year.

Conservative Whigs tended to join the newly formed nativist American (also called ‘Know-Nothing’)

Party. Many did so less out of strong nativist sentiments but rather because they viewed nativism

as a pressure valve that could circumvent the sectional conflict over slavery that they rightly viewed

as a threat to the Union (Foner, 1970, 196). On the Eastern Seaboard, the Know Nothing Party had

genuinely strong popular support, largely due to the rapid increase in Irish and German immigration

(Alsan, Eriksson and Niemesh, 2018).

       The 1856 election marked a sea change in American politics, as it saw in the Whig Party the

complete disappearance of a party that eight years earlier had won the presidency, while two out of

the three major parties—the American Party and the Republican Party—had not even existed in

1852. The Democratic Party carried the election with 45 percent of the popular vote, with James

Buchanan as the new president. The Republican Party did ”remarkably well for a new party,”

winning 33 percent of the popular vote (Foner, 1970, 130).48

       In March 1857, the Supreme Court’s Dredd Scott decision seemed to further strengthen slave-

owners’ property rights in Northern states, and many perceived it as stepping stone to re-establishing

slavery in the North. Its result was that Northerners came to increasingly view slavery as a threat

to the Union’s republican institutions themselves.49 Such fears grew because of a general view that

the Buchanan administration was dominated by Southern slave power.50 In 1858, Lincoln’s future
  47
     1854 also gave a rise to a short-lived effort by Forty-Eighters to form their own party, called the Louisville
Platform. This quickly dissolved, however, since the Forty-Eighters found a natural political home in the Republican
Party (Wittke, 1973, 164).
  48
     Two key factors worked against it in its challenge to the Democratic Party: first, the American Party which won
22 percent of the vote attracted large portions of the former Whig vote; second, internal strife in the Democratic
Party over the slavery issue found its outlet in the Democratic primaries where the incumbent president was not
re-elected, so that disaffected Democratic Party supporters mostly remained loyal to their party in 1856.
  49
     This included concerns that the African slave trade was going to be re-opened and that there would be attempts
to destabilize nascent Latin American republicans and replace them with slave-holding oligarchies in the Southern
mold.
  50
     Foner (1970, 100) notes that “two judicious observers of the politics of the 1850s, Roy Nichols and Allan Nevins,
agree that during the Buchanan administration southern control of all branches of the federal government was virtually
complete.”



                                                         46
Secretary of State, William Seward, summarized these fears in a Congressional speech, foreseeing

”an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, [which] means the U.S. must and

will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slave-holing nation or entirely a free-labor nation.”

    Americans, in the North especially, were keenly aware that their institutions were a “great ex-

periment” that stood in stark contrast to the oligarchic and hereditary government that prevailed

almost everywhere else (Doyle, 2014, 93-96). From 1857, the amalgamation of the issue of slave-

emancipation with the defense of republican institutions dramatically increased popular opposition

to Southern slavery.51 Lincoln was a shrewd politician, but was also in many ways a surprise candi-

date for the Republican Party’s presidential candidate in 1860, emerging only very late as a viable

candidate. However, at a time when the Republican Party combined radical Abolitionists, conser-

vative ex-Whigs, Nativists, and disenchanted ex-Democrats, with each group’s favored candidate

raising strong objections from one of the other factions, he was the ideal compromise candidate.

As one observer put if, he was “the second choice of everybody” (Foner, 1970, 183, 213). Lincoln

would repeatedly combine the issues of slavery and republicanism in his speeches, when he called

the Union the “last best hope for the survival of republican government” (McPherson, 1997, 112),52

and famously in his Gettysburg address, when he promised “a new birth of freedom,” and reminded

soldiers that they fought so “that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not

perish from the earth.”
   51
      This explains why many soldiers in their letters home professed to be fighting for liberty while relatively few
initially professed to fight for ”emancipation per se” (McPherson, 1997, 116-119). McPherson agrees with the assess-
ment in Wiley (1952) that only one in ten Union soldiers “had any real interest in emancipation per se” but notes
that this ratio increased sharply during the war.
   52
      These words are from Lincoln’s December 1962 address to congress —one month before the Emancipation
proclamation—where he wrote “we know how to save the Union [...] In giving freedom to the slave, we assure
freedom to the free. [In doing so,] we shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.”

Appendix A.3        Additional Historiography of the Role of the Forty-Eighters and
                    the Turner Societies in the 1860 Election and in the Civil War

Given the large effect on enlistment that we attribute to the Forty-Eighters, a review of historiog-

raphy on this topic is in order. The two foundational historical sources for our paper are Zucker

(1950) and Wittke (1973).

   Between these two, Zucker (1950) is less concerned with the effect of the Forty-Eighters, and

more concerned with who they were and the ideas and ideals that characterized them as a group.

Wittke (1973) also focused on these themes, but is less biographical in focus and more concerned

with discussing the impact they had as a group. In relation to our topic, the related historiog-

raphy has overall focused more on the Forty-Eighters’ impact on the 1860 election. While there

is some disagreement, overall the historiography agrees that German-Americans as a group sup-

ported Lincoln in 1860: Kamphoefner (1991, p.235), for example, states that “the heavily German

counties just east of St. Louis were the only small islands of Republicanism in the vast Democratic

delta in southern Illinois.” Baron (2012) cites Henry Villard of the New York Herald as reporting

(December 9th 1860): “In Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin, native Republicans now

openly acknowledge that their victory was, if not wholly, at least to a great extent, due to the large

accessions they received in the most hotly contested sections from the German ranks.” The debate

in this literature is the extent to which the Forty-Eighters were pivotal in winning the German vote

election for Lincoln. This debate turns on two topics in particular: One, conflicts between older gen-

erations of German immigrants and the newer immigrants, among them the Forty-Eighters. Tóth

(2014, 206) for example, cites from Heinrich Börnstein’s memoirs, that “young German-Americans

welcomed the project with joy and enthusiasm and advertised it, while the quieter and more mature

members of the community, namely all the so-called ”greys” decidedly disapproved it.” Two, the

Forty-Eighters’ role in overcoming German voters prejudices against the Republican Party that

arose from its association with Nativists and Know-Nothings. We discuss these in Section 1.2.

The Forty-Eighters’ role is emphasized not only by historians of German Americans, but also by

Foner, perhaps the greatest modern-day historian of the antebellum politics (Foner, 1970). Our

focus is not the 1860 election. Electoral data in this period is practically impossible to obtain at

the sub-county level, and the county is too coarse a spatial unit to capture the local effects that



                                                 48
the Forty-Eighters had in their towns.

   On the other hand, our focus on local enlistment rates is actually almost completely absent in the

historical literature. Our view is that this is because no data (not even a good “guesstimate”) existed

up to now on local differences in the extent of Union Army enlistment. Without knowledge of where

enlistment was greatest, there was no scope for a historical literature on the local determinants of

enlistment. Even seminal treatments of the topic do not attempt any quantitative assessment

of local enlistment, while mostly emphasizing aspects that are consistent with our story, such

as the strong ‘ideological’ motivation of Civil War soldiers (McPherson 1997, ch7–9; Costa and

Kahn 2010), as well as the fact that “the volunteers’ values remained rooted in the homes and

communities from which they sprang to arms” (McPherson, 1997, p.5). Related to the effect of

individual leadership on enlistment, we came across a quote by Joshua Chamberlain, who would

later become a war hero but was then a college professor trying to raise men, who wrote to the

governor of Maine in 1861 that “nearly 100 of those who have been my pupils are now officers in our

army but there are many more all over our state who, I believe, would respond with enthusiasm, if

summoned by me” (Longacre, 2009, p.53).

   The Forty-Eighters’ role during the War is more often discussed than their effect on enlistment.

This makes sense insofar as there is much more information available on what went on during the

war, from both Union Army statistics as well as from the millions of soldier letters that historians

have studied. For example, Costa and Kahn (2003) find that German immigrants were the least

likely to desert and as “Germans who fled the revolutions of 1848 were more likely than Irish or

British immigrants who migrated for economic reasons to view the United States as the best hope

for the survival of a form of republican government.” More qualitatively, Turner regiments (often

Forty-Eighter led), were rated among the “fightingest” in the accounts in Fox (1889).

   One episode that straddles the Forty-Eighters’ role in enlistment and in the fighting itself

is their involvement in defending the St Louis, Missouri, federal weapons Arsenal against the

secessionist Missouri militia. Goodheart (2011, 256–264) contains a detailed account of how the

local commanders of the federal Arsenal, Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair, formed a coalition

with local Forty-Eighters who were leading a movement called the “Wide-Awakes”. They Wide-

Awakes enlisted en bloc and were effectively transformed into military units which came to be called

the Home Guards. These defended the Arsenal against the secessionist state militia. Goodheart


                                                  49
concludes that “Lyon, Blair, and the Germans did save Missouri. [...] Grant himself would believe

for the rest of his life that but for them the Arsenal and with it St. Louis would have been taken by

the Confederacy. [...] In effect the small band of German revolutionaries accomplished in St. Louis

what they had failed to do in Vienna and Heidelberg: overthrow a reactionary state government.”

Appendix A.4             Selected Biographical Case Studies of Forty-Eighters

Appendix A.4.1            Example of a Journalist

Herman Raster was born in Zerbst.53 His father, the duke of Anhalt’s administrative officer and

friend, put emphasis on his children’s education and even brought a tutor from England to teach the

language. It soon became obvious that Raster was particularly gifted and still in school, he earned

his first money for the translation of a French play into German. Raster reportedly spoke seven

languages when he finished school and went on to study philology, linguistic and history at the

universities of Leipzig and Berlin. While his father hoped for him to become a philologist, Raster

himself was more interested in politics and journalism. This interest was additionally stimulated

by an encountered with the writer, novelist and social activist Bettina von Arnim as part of the

liberal political scene in Berlin.

       When the 1848 revolution broke out, Raster was a protagonist in Dessau’s freedom party who

penned masterly pamphlets. At the same time, his rare skills in stenography got him a position

as Secretary of the State Assembly of Dessau. In the aftermath of the failed revolution, Raster

was forced to leave Germany in 1851 and chose to move to the United States. Upon his arrival

in New York, he was looking in vain for a job and after five weeks in New York and Philadelphia,

he ran out of funds and had to take up a job as farm hand in rural Pennsylvania. The owner of

the farm in Tioga, Mr Johnson, was well educated and soon after his arrival, Raster was teaching

farmers’ children and learned in long conversations with a solicitor named Garritson the specifics

of American politics.

       In spring 1852, Raster left his farm job to take up an editorial position at a newspaper, the

Buffalo Democrat. He quickly gained journalistic reputation and only one year later, he became

the editor of the New York Abendzeitung. During his time in New York, Raster became an active

member of the Republican Party and an elector in the 1856 presidential, and his articles in support

of the union and abolitionist movement in the Abendzeitung helped the Republican Party gain

momentum among German immigrants. During the civil war, Raster was the main American

correspondent for influential newspapers in German cities. In this position, he was very effectively

complaining for the Union’s cause and helping attract investors for Union bonds.
  53
       The biography is based on Raster’s own memoirs published as Raster (1891).

      After the Civil War, Raster accepted the position as editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in

Chicago in 1867 where he remained until his death.


Appendix A.4.2           Example of an Artist

Theodor Kaufman was born in Uelzen close to the city of Hanover.54 He started a mercantile

apprenticeship but then decided to study painting in D˘”sseldorf and Munich and additionally

studied philosophy for some years. Kaufmann became an influential pictorial artist whose approach

to painting was to merge image and language in an attempt to go beyond mere aesthetics. Instead,

he called for ”a political-philosophical form of art [..] that instead functions as an emancipative

instrument raising awareness by pushing through democratic processes” (Roob, 2012). Artistically,

this attitude was expressed in a series of eight etchings named the “The Development of the Idea of

God” published in 1850 that were inspired by Feuerbach’s religion-critical writings. Practically, this

attitude led him to join the revolutionary activities during the 1848 barricade fighting in Dresden

and he had to fled from the Prussian army to Switzerland and eventually emigrated to the United

States in 1850.

      After his arrival in New York, he worked as a painter and started art training in his studio in

New York. His one and only student was Thomas Nast, the son of Forty-Eighter Joseph Thomas

Nast. In the 1850s, Kaufmann’s art career slowed down and he temporarily earned his living as a

portrait painter and assistant in photo studios.

      Being an ardent abolitionist, Kaufmann felt the call to support the Union Army and enlisted

as a private. He took part in the naval expedition against Forts Hatteras and Clark and served

under General Fremont whose radical attitude toward slavery he admired. After his active career

as a soldier, Kaufmann went on to support the Union Army as a speaker and writer. When he

contributed one of his paintings to a fund-raising event for wounded soldiers, it attracted great

interest and subsequently, his career as a painter caught a second wind and he could make a living

off it. Subsequently, he created a number of important historical paintings like “On to Liberty” in

1867 that is today exhibited at the New York Met.

      While not being a Forty-Eighter himself, Kaufmann’s student Thomas Nast still deserves men-

tion. At age fourteen, he received his basic artistic training in Kaufmann’s studio in New York.

Possibly influenced by his father’s revolutionary attitude and his teacher Kaufmann, Nast became

one of the most influential graphical artists whom the New York Times called in 1908 the “Father of

the American Cartoon.” His U.S. career started at the illustrated magazine Harper’s Weekly which

supported the Union during the Civil War with picture campaigns. Nast started as a graphic war

correspondent, but soon switched to emblematic cartoons. The popularity of his patriotic graphics

led Abraham Lincoln to say that “Thomas Nast has been our best recruiting sergeant. His em-

blematic cartoons have never failed to arose enthusiasm and patriotism, and have always seemed

to come just when these articles were getting scarce” (Paine, 1904).


Appendix A.4.3          Example of a Turner

Joseph Gerhardt was born in Oberdallendorf close to Bonn.55 He studied at the University of

Bonn and subsequently worked as a merchant and innkeeper in Bonn. During the 1848 Revolution,

Gerhardt commanded a battalion of volunteers in the Baden revolt in an attempt to defend the

Rastatt Fortress, a bastion of the revolutionaries. When Prussian troops quelled the riots, Gerhardt

was imprisoned in Rastatt fortress but then managed to escape to Switzerland. In 1850, he had to

leave Switzerland without his family and came via New York to settle in Washington D.C.

       Upon his arrival, Gerhardt played the violin in theater orchestras and took up other humble

jobs to make a living before he returned to his former occupation as hotel and innkeeper. He opened

the Germania Hotel with a beer garden and restaurant.

       When his friend Adolf Cluss came to organize the Socialist Turner Association in Washington in

1852, Gerhardt served as speaker and president. According to the club’s statutes, membership was

open to anyone willing to support their revolutionary efforts. Gerhard also got involved in politics.

He joined the Republican Party in 1856, became Republican marshal for his district, and in October

1860 he was a founding member of the German Republican Association. The association’s main

goal was to inform and educate Germans about the Republican Party’s matters.

       After Lincoln’s election, Gerhardt entered organized a volunteer Turner Company which became

known as “Turner Rifles.” They were guarding Lincoln’s inauguration, protected Washington’s

public buildings at the onset of the Civil War, and went to Great Falls, Virginia to protect the

the 46th New York Volunteers. In 1863, he had to resign from the Union Army for health reasons

and returned to Washington. He continued to be a well-known hotel and innkeeper until his death.


Appendix A.4.4           Example of a Military Man

August von Willich was born in Braunsberg with his father being a captain in the Prussian

army.56 Willich himself received his military education in the cadet schools of Potsdam and Berlin

and joined the Prussian field artillery as an officer. When he got exposed to Karl Marx’ political

ideas, he chose to resign from the army in 1847 because his communist and republican beliefs were

incommensurate with the military obligations. Around the same time, he decided to give up his

noble title and went by “Willich” instead of “von Willich.” Subsequently, we played an active part

in the 1848 revolution; he participated in the attack on the Cologne City Hall, and led a corps of

volunteers during the Baden Revolution with Friedrich Engels being his aide-de-camp. When the

revolution failed, Willich escaped to Switzerland and eventually joined an exile group of German

revolutionaries and communists around Marx and Engels in London. After a fallout with Marx and

Engels, Karl Schapper and Willich split off the League of Communists and in 1853, he eventually

emigrated to the United States.

      Willich learned to be a carpenter in England and initially worked in this occupation at the

Brooklyn Navy Yard. However, his talent in maths and science soon got him a better position in

the coastal survey at Washington D.C. Over the years, Willich became politically more active and

when he was offered to edit the “”Deutscher Republikaner”, a Cincinnati-based German newspaper,

he took the position in 1858. In the 1860 election, he supported Lincoln and at the outbreak of the

Civil War, Willich helped organize the first German voluntary regiment of Cincinnati. In line with

his communist ideals, he initially signed up as an ordinary soldier but his military training soon got

him the rank of colonel. In the course of the war, Willich participated in numerous battles and got

promoted to Brigadier General for his braveness in the battles of Shiloh. When sustained injuries

forced him to end his active military career, he turned to administrative roles before he resigned

form the army in fall 1865.

      After the war, Willich held different government positions in Cincinnati before he returned to

Appendix B                Data Appendix

Appendix B.1            The Forty-Eighters

To code up the Forty-Eighters’ biographies, we started with 318 accounts listed in the explicitly

biographical book by Zucker (1950). We complement this source with names from Wittke’s (1970)

book on the Forty-Eighters’ influence in U.S. politics, which includes over 400 individual names.

Raab’s (1998) index of revolutionaries in the German state of Baden also presents a list of revolu-

tionaries who went to the U.S. Finally, Baron’s (2012) book includes a name index, although this

is fully subsumed in the other sources. In total, we end up with a list of just over 500 individual

Forty-Eighters, and we completed their biographies in Germany and the United States through

individual searches in genealogical online sources like Ancestry.com. In this way, we are able to

locate 493 Forty-Eighters in the towns they settled in.

       Closer inspection of the number of Forty-Eighters across towns reveals a heavily right-skewed

distribution. While we observe 73 towns with at least one Forty-Eighter, almost three-quarters

of the Forty-Eighters went to (or stayed in) only six large urban centers: New York, Cincinnati,

St. Louis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Milwaukee. This skew is evident in the left panel of

Figure A2.57

       This skew raises the question which functional form to use. One concern is that towns with many

Forty-Eighters would depress the estimated treatment effect if the treatment effect was erroneously

assumed to be linear. A first inspection of the relationship between town size in 1850 and exposure

to Forty-Eighters reveals an interesting pattern: for towns where at least one Forty-Eighter settled,

the intensive margin of treatment (i.e. the number of Forty-Eighters) can be explained by a simple

quadratic in their 1850 population size. This is evident in the right panel of Figure A2, which shows

the fitted line from a regression of the number of Forty-Eighters on state fixed effects and a town’s
  57
    New York City was the most important arrival port. In the Germans to America shipping-lists—discussed in
Appendix B.5.2—New York City alone accounts for 85 percent of the 4.1 million German arrivals between 1850 and
1894. Therefore, it is not surprising that roughly one-quarter of the Forty-Eighters did not leave New York city. In
our analysis, we disregard New York city for two reasons. First, there is no plausible control town for the largest city.
Second, New York was the biggest entry port and a large portion of soldiers enlisted straight after debarkation, i.e.
did not represent the resident population. (We thank Dora Costa for pointing this out.)

                             Figure A2: Distribution of No. of Forty-Eighters
Notes: The left panel of this figure displays the distribution of the number of Forty-Eighters across treated towns.
There are over 60 towns where one or two Forty-Eighters settled, as well as a number of towns where several settled.
More than thirty Forty-Eighters settled in Cincinnati, and St Louis, Missouri; twenty settled in Philadelphia, and
Baltimore; and 15 or more in Milwaukee and Davenport. Among treated towns, the distribution of the number
of Forty-Eighters was thus clearly skewed towards larger cities. (The left panel omits NYC where over 100 Forty-

1850 population. Therefore, our approach to dealing with the skewed distribution is to focus on a

simple binary Forty-Eighter indicator, conditional on the log of a town’s 1850 population size in

all regressions.58


Appendix B.2            The Union Army Data

Table A1 shows that Pro-Lincoln states where the Republican party had the biggest vote share also

have the highest enlistment numbers relative to the population and individual’s enlisted earlier.

Outside the Confederacy, border states were the most divided on the slavery issue and tended to

have lower enlistment numbers relative to their population. Every Confederate state had some

Union Army enlistments, but these occurred later. The majority of Southern enlistments to the

Union Army occurred after the Union Army had defeated the bulk of Confederate forces in a state.


Appendix B.2.1          Record-Linking Union Army Data to the Full-Count Census

To reord-link the enlistment registers to the 1860 Full Count Census, we bloc on state-of-residence,

and on first and last name initial. Similarity-scores are derived from a serious of exact matches on
  58
    This captures the quadratic relation with town size since the log of population and the log of squared population
are collinear.

Notes: This table reports the total number of Union Army soldiers for each state’s enlistment registers, the enlistment
date of the tenth chronological percentile of enlisted men, the average enlistment date, as well as the enlisted men’s
population shares. Data stem from the Adjutant General’s Reports. The table divides states into core/Northern
states, border states (who had slaves but did not secede from the Union), Confederate states, and Western states
(who did not yet have statehood). A notable feature of the data is that there were Union Army enlistments from
every Confederate state.




                                                                    57
the following variables:

   • last name (11 -6)

   • last name initials (5 -1)

   • firstname (5 0)

   • firstname-initials (5 -2)

   • firstname first three letters (5 -1)

   • middlename-initials (2 -2)

   • town-name (5 -3)

   • county string-code (5 -3)

In brackets are the positive weights for an exact match, and the negative weights for a non-match.

Negative weights for mismatches are appropriate when the fact of a not-exactly matching variable

is a strong indication of a non-match. For example, initials should be expected to match between

records for the same person. Positive weights for matches are appropriate when the fact of an exactly

matching variable is a strong indication of a match, but the absence of a match is not a strong

indication of a mismatch. For example, a non-matching first name should not receive a negative

weight because first names are prone to being abbreviated, i.e. ’Bartholomew’ can become ’Bart’,

or ’Charles’ can become ’Chad’. To account for this, one can create a extra variable consisting

of the first, say, three letters of a first name, so that ’Bartholomew’ matches ’Bart’, and ’Charles’

matches ’Chad’. The only commonly abbreviated name we found that is not captured by this rule

is ’William’ so that we changed ’William’ (and ‘Will’) to ’Wm’ in all data-sets. Given the values in

the algorithm above, two exemplary records with completely identical names receive a match-score

of 11 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 33, and two exemplary records with identical names except ‘Charles’ in

one record becomes ’Chad’ in the other receive a match-score of 11 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 28.

   The only numeric variable in the linkage algorithm is

   • year-of-birth (5 -1 1) and (0 -4 3)




                                                 58
where the third number in brackets is the allowed deviation (‘caliper’) from an exact match. For

example, in the Full-Count census, birth year is given, but in the Army register birth year is

constructed as enlistment age minus the year of enlistment. This latter variable can easily be off

by one year in either direction so that it is important to allow for a caliper of 1 in the matching, i.e.

1840 and 1841 as well as 1840 and 1839 are considered exact matches, but 1839 and 1841 are not.

By defining two such ranges, one can trace out a gradient. In our algorithm, a birth-year deviation

of 1 adds 5 + 0 to the match score, a birth-year deviation of 2 or 3 years adds −1 to the match

score, and a birth-year deviation of more than 3 years adds −1 − 4 = −5 to the match score.

   We use STATA’s command dtalink to perform the matching. One upside of dtalink is that

it offers complete transparency on how the match-score is generated. Since the match-score is

simply an additive score of exact matches on a record’s characteristics, one can manually calculate

each match-score by simple arithmetic. Stated differently, one can look at the characteristics of a

record in Table A2 (one row), and manually calculate the match-score reported in the table. Other

currently available methods do not offer this transparency.

   The cutoff we chose is 30. Given the weights listed above, 30 is a high match-score for soldiers

who have no location information in the army registers. We are therefore very confident that

matches of 30 or above are correct. It is important that we prevent matching location information

from dominating poorly matched name-matching: this is achieved by the negative weights on non-

matching last names and non-matching middle-name initials.

   Linkages are unique, i.e. after finding the set of all linkages with a mach score above 30, dtalink

performs a grid-search so that each Census-record is linked to only one soldier record.

   One downside of dtalink is that it does not allow string-similarity indexation (e.g. Jaro-Winkler

or similar indices); instead one has to “fan out” sub-strings manually as outlined above. In our

data, this is easily compensated by dtalink’s most critical upside, which is the ability to deal with

missing data. If a linkage-variable is missing in a record, that variable’s contribution to the total

match-score is zero, but if other variables compensate by providing high overlap, two linked records

can still have a high match-score. This is important for us because we miss town-of-residence in the

majority of military records, we miss county-of-residence in about half the military records, and

we miss age in about one-third of the military records. Lastly, the military records frequently miss

middle names (unlike the other three variables, one can only know after linking to the census if a


                                                   59
middle name is missing or if a soldier did not have one). Standard packages typically do not allow

missing variables, and records with missing variables are consequently dropped. This is likely not a

big deal when a research question is concerned with an individual-level analysis and one is confident

that the missings are random. In our application, however, we would like to maximie the number

of good links because we aggregate our individual links into spatial units (towns). To illustrate

this, consider the three links in Table A2 with match-scores of 33 (listed in the middle-column).

All three look like very good matches (exact and unique matches on state, first name, and last

name, as well as middle name initial; in addition, the census-birth-years are plausible for a Union

Army soldier). However, all three have missing ages in the soldier-records, and would by default

be discarded in most linkage algorithms, whereas dtalink is not sensitive to this missing. In fact,

all three records even have fairly high match-scores despite missing age information because they

include middle name information (which is often missing).

    For a more detailed discussion of record linkage approaches, we refer the reader the excellent

review in Bailey et al. (2019).

                        Figure A3: Spatial Interpolation of Soldiers’ Residences




Notes: The left panel of this figure visualizes our favored spatial interpolation approach where we calculate the
convex hull around all observed enlistment locations in a given regiment r. This determines our enlistment area and
we randomly allocate soldiers without location information to towns inside the enlistment area using the 1860 town
population as weight. The right panel of this figure visualizes a simpler version of this polygon procedure where
we delineate a regiment’s enlistment area by a rectangle that spans the minimum and maximum coordinates of all
observed enlistment towns for a given regiment r. Soldiers without location information are allocated as before.




    As mentioned above, we miss town-of-residence in the majority of military records. Linking

the records to the census recovers this information for many observations. To assign the remaining

soldiers to a town of residence, we take advantage of the fact that regiments in the Union Army

were raised locally, most often from a small area encompassing no more than a few counties,

and frequently no more than a few towns within a county (Costa and Kahn, 2003, 524). ‘Local

enlistment’ means that the observed distribution of located soldiers’ home-towns in a regiment is

highly predictive of the unobserved distribution of unlocated soldiers’ home-towns.59 We consider

two approaches which exploit the spatial clustering of enlistments to determine regiment r’s relevant

‘enlistment area.’ Both approaches are visually represented in Figure A3. The light-gray dots

represent the set of towns where we observe enlistments for regiment r (within a state s), and

the black dots represent the remaining towns in the enlistment area where we do not observe

enlistments.60 Our preferred procedure to delineate an enlistment area is to calculate the convex

hull of all (gray) locations with enlistment information. The resulting polygon is shown in the left

panel of Figure A3. A simpler method to delineate the enlistment area is to calculate the rectangle

that spans the minimum and maximum coordinates of all observed enlistment towns per regiment

and state. The right panel of Figure A3 illustrates this. Once we have defined an enlistment

area, we randomly assign unlocated cases to the enclosed enlistment-area towns using their 1860

population as weights. The latter accounts for the fact that larger towns enlisted more soldiers.


Appendix B.3            Inferring Soldiers’ Ancestry Using Machine Learning

This section describes how we trained a Machine Learning Algorithm on the 1860 Full Count U.S.

Census where we observe place of birth information and then applied the trained algorithm to the

Union Army Enlistment Data to infer missing place of birth information. A vast corpus of computer

science and statistical learning literature is devoted to the question if characters of a word can be

used to investigate how words are classified. In comparison to proper nouns of other types (such

as company names), personal names have many more conventional structures than others. For

example, German names tend to end with “berg” or “mann”, while Mexican names often end with

“guez” or “arro”. Naming conventions become less stable and more difficult to identify when a

model predicts a specific nationality given a specific individual name.

       Despite the availability and simplicity of name data, few studies utilize personal names to predict
  59
    The U.S. Army abandoned local enlistments only after D-day in World War II.
  60
    Regiments were recruited within states. If we observe home towns in more than one state in a regiment, we
determine the most frequent home state and drop all enlistments from different home states.



                                                     62
individual nationality or ethnicity. Using decision trees, Ambekar et al. (2009) and Treeratpituk

and Giles (2012) classify ethnic groups on a corpus of news data. Chang et al. (2010) develop a

Bayesian classifier with name data from the U.S. Census. Harris (2015) predicts ethnicity based

on proportions of each unique name within ethnic groups.

   One of the key challenges with predicting nationality based on name information is that impor-

tant patterns (i.e., combinations of n specific name characters, n-grams) are not known a priori.

The standard way developed in statistics and econometrics to approach this problem includes two-

steps. In a first step, all potential combinations of characters of a given length n, n-grams, are

extracted from the corpus of names and are used as binary covariates. In the next step, a statistical

model (e.g., logistic regression, ridge-regression, random forest, etc) is applied to the processed data

to calculate predictions. This approach, however, requires significant computational capacity and

often fails, even on industrial supercomputers.

   Mikolov et al. (2010) and Bahdanau, Cho and Bengio (2014) show that recurrent neural networks

are cost-effective alternatives to other approaches to language modeling. Recurrent neural networks

iteratively introduce additional n-grams as covariates, update the prediction and keep them only if

the quality of the prediction increased by more than a certain threshold. Thus, they effectively keep

and operate over important patterns only. Bahdanau, Cho and Bengio (2014) show that recurrent

neural networks outperform most of the standard models of statistical learning on large-size data-

sets for tasks such as machine translation while not suffering from over-fitting (see also, Hochreiter

and Schmidhuber (1997)). Kim et al. (2016) , Chiu and Nichols (2015), and Lee et al. (2017)

who use character level embedding with a recurrent neural network for a set of classification tasks,

including personal name classification).

   We build on the results from Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), Chiu and Nichols (2015),

and Lee et al. (2017) to develop a recurrent neural-network-based model which predicts nationality

using an individual’s first and last name. Using character embedding, our model automatically

extracts character-level features for the fist and last name to predict the propensity with which a

person belongs to a specific nationality (Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, Ireland, or ‘Other/USA’).

We trained our model with back-propagation through time (Werbos, 1990).

   We employ the algorithm to the Union Army Registers which contain military information like

the units men belonged to, their rank, when they enlisted, their enlistment terms and whether they


                                                  63
died, deserted, were wounded or mustered out at the end of their service. Aside from this, we only

know the enlistees’ name, age at enlistment, and town-of-residence. To infer soldiers’ ancestry,

the 1860 Full Count Census where we observe names and birth places, provides us with a natural

training data set to train a machine-learning algorithm. We group birthplaces into German, Irish,

Italian, Scandinavian, American and ‘Other Immigrants’ in the Full-Count 1860 U.S. Census, and

then train the algorithm described in the previous subsection to predict the relative probabilities

of an individual belonging to each group. In the training data, we accurately predict birthplace in

more than ninety percent of the cases. We then apply the trained algorithm to our soldier data,

and associated each soldier with a probability distribution of ancestries. Note that the number

of Italians in the U.S. turned out to be so small in 1860 that we grouped them with the ‘Other’

category. This is in line with historical records suggesting that the majority of Italian immigrants

arrived after 1870.


Appendix B.4          Historical Town and County Controls

At the city level, we observe only population counts by race and gender, from Fishman (2009).

We thank Michael Haines for sharing his cleaned version of the 1850 and 1860 town-level data. In

addition, we geo-coded the location of all towns, which allows us to calculate a rich set of geographic

location factors. These include longitude and latitude, log elevation, the mean temperature and

precipitation, and the following set of (log) distance variables: distance to the coast, to the next

navigable river, and the railway network in 1850 (provided by Atack, 2015).


Appendix B.4.1        Historical County-Level Controls

We supplement our town-level data with the following 1850 county-level controls from the Historical,

Demographic, Economic, and Social Data: The United States, 1790-2002 (Haines, 2010):

   • Economic: urbanization, manufacturing employment and output, farmland’s share of area,

      farm equipment value


   • Demographic: population size, foreign born, German-born, churches




                                                  64
Appendix B.4.2        Historical Voting Data

We have historical voting data from ICPSR’s Electoral Data for Counties in the United States:

Presidential and Congressional Races, 1840-1972 (Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale, 2006). Unfortu-

nately, in addition to only covering about two-thirds of areas included in our study, the historical

voting data exist only at the county level. This is disappointing because many historians’ have

argued that the Forty-Eighters had an effect on the rise of the Republican Party. (See Section 1.2.)

We attempted to obtain sub-county historical voting data, and we owe a debt of gratitude to John

Wallis and Jeremy Darrington for helpful advice in this regard. Unfortunately, such data does not

exist. The only promising path is data on state legislatures, for which Dubin (2015) is the starting

point. Unfortunately, voting data on electoral districts is only available in states such as Iowa that

are so large that a state electoral district is actually coarser than a county, so that nothing is gained

in terms of obtaining voting information at a more fine-grained level than what can be gleaned from

Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale (2006).


Appendix B.5         Factors Attracting the Forty-Eighters into Specific Towns

Appendix B.5.1        Metzler’s Map for Immigrants

A novel control variable that we are introducing for this paper is Metzler’s Map for Immigrants;

see Figure A4. This map was published in Germany in 1853 to show emigrants the main travel

routes across the ocean to the U.S. and within the U.S. along with some information about fares.

Based on this map, we calculate all cities’ (log) distance to the nearest city on Metzler’s map.


Appendix B.5.2        Mapping the Germans to America Shipping Lists into U.S. Towns

The ‘Germans to America’ Shipping Lists bring together ship lists from various ports of entry in

the U.S. in the mid-19th century. We digitized the corresponding books for the years 1845–1855.

   We use these data as control variable in our regressions, for the placebo exercises in Table A8,

and as basis of our instrument in Section 4.2. To construct the instrument, we first record-link the

Forty-Eighters to the ship lists using bigram indexation on name similarity, and restrict differences

in reported age to be at most three years. We limit our search to ships arriving between 1848

and 1852 because the “haphazard arrival” logic is much less plausible for the few Forty-Eighters

who arrived later (and had more time to think about their trip). With this, we identify the set

of Forty-Eighter ships, i.e. the immigrant ships with Forty-Eighters on them. For these ships,

we compute a distribution of reported intended destinations in the U.S. As a control variable, we

compute the distribution of reported intended destinations for passengers on all other ships in the

collection that arrived in the U.S. in the same time window.


Appendix B.6           Turner Societies

German immigrants had a strong sense for cultural heritage, and social organizations as they

knew them from home were one way to preserve this heritage. These clubs included card clubs,

music societies, sharpshooter organizations, library associations, and so-called Turnvereine (‘Turner

Societies’). The latter were probably the most prominent kind of social clubs, and certainly the

most political ones. Many Forty-Eighters were members if not their founders. One of the first

Turner Societies was founded in Cincinnati in 1849 by Friedrich Heckler, a prominent Forty-Eighter

who had led the revolution in the German state of Baden (Barney, 1982). Subsequently, more

Turner Societies were founded across the entire U.S., thus creating a social network with substantial

political leverage.

    The origin of the Turner Society goes back to Friedrich Ludwig Jahn—sometimes referred to as


                                                        66
Turnvater Jahn—who defined gymnastic principles for physical fitness. He opened a first outdoor

gymnasium (Turnplatz ), in Berlin-Hasenheide in 1811 and the Turner movement spread quickly

to other locations in Germany. What sounds like a leisure movement focused on athletics was

in reality a highly political movement. Jahn was a patriot who believed that physical education

would raise young gymnasts’ physical and moral powers and their sense for national identity. In

this way, he was hoping to prepare them for military service and ultimately the liberation of the

German lands from Napoleon and France. But Jahn was also a liberal thinker who dreamed of

overthrowing the feudal order of serfdom and reorganizing Germany into a unified nation state, a

republic. While the Prussian authorities supported the first purpose, they were less impressed with

the nationalist movement and banned Turnen between 1819-1842. After the ban was lifted, Turner

Societies became centers of political discussions and activities and it is not surprising that they

were the breeding ground for the revolution. Many Forty-Eighters were members of the Turner

Societies in Germany.

   Upon their arrival, the Forty-Eighters established the Turner movement in the United States,

and the nationwide Turner network helped them spread their liberal ideals. Among their main goals

was to fight American nativism and to abolish slavery. Consequently, most Turners were active

supporters of the newly founded Republican Party during the 1850s and 60s. Among others, they

helped protecting anti-slavery activists during public speeches; Turners were Lincoln’s bodyguards

for his first inauguration (Zucker, 1950; Baron, 2012) and when the Civil War started in 1861, they

formed special “Turner Regiments” (Hofmann, 1995, p.158). Wittke 1970 estimates that 60 percent

to 80 percent of the Turners enlisted for the Civil War.



Appendix C            Matched Sample Details

Table A5 shows that the matched sample moves the distribution of the outcome variable for treated

towns closer to controls towns. Table A6 shows the same distributions for per capita enlistments

instead of the log of enlistments.

   As a robustness check on the sample selection, we constructed two additional matched samples,

PSM-2 and PSM-3. In PSM-2, we do not impose exact matching on state and population bin, so

that state fixed effects just enter the logistic regression as dummy variables. This is expected to



                                                67
increase the number of matched treated towns because control towns can be drawn from a wider

set. At the same time, the number of control towns may decrease because an untreated town can

be a nearest neighbor for additional treated towns in other states. In PSM-3, we decrease the

number of required nearest neighbors from five to three. This should again increases the number

of matched treated towns because the required number of ‘statistical twins’ is decreased. At the

same time, the number of control towns decreases because of the lower number of neighbors. Both

PSM-2 and PSM-3 therefore have a higher ratio of treated to control towns.

       Unfortunately, the 1850 Full Count Census does not provide a large sample of control variables.61

The 1860 Full Count Census, however, has additional wealth, education and occupation information.

On the one hand, the sparsity of town level controls means that the 1860 controls may help absorb

time-invariant confounding characteristics that could have potentially attracted Forty-Eighters and

had an impact on enlistment. On the other hand, 1860 controls may be viewed as ’bad controls’ in

the sense that they post-date the Forty-Eighters’ settlement and could be potentially endogenous.

To get an idea how sensitive the matched sample is to the inclusion of 1860 county controls,

we construct another matched sample (labeled PSM-4 ) where we include 1860 town controls as

additional matching variables but keep the concerns about these control variables in mind.




                             Figure A5: Kernel Density Plots for Enlistments
Notes: The figure shows Kernel density plots for treated and control towns. The left figure reports on the log of
enlistments in the full sample, the right figure on the matched sample. The mean (standard deviation) for treated
and control towns are 6.44 (2.1) and 3.88 (1.25) in the full sample, compared to 5.73 (1.87) and 4.44 (1.68) in the
matched sample.


  61
    Variables are being added to historical Full Count Censuses, by the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
(IPUMS) but the process is slow because the addition of any variable for the entire U.S. population is time-consuming
and costly.

Notes: This table resembles Table 1, but it investigates the balance between treatment and control locations in the
matched sample (PSM1 ). Columns 1–2 report on means and standard deviations of observable characteristics for
control and treated towns. Columns 3–4 test for balance (with and without state fixed effects). Columns 5–6 report
which variables are most predictive of treatment in a multivariate setting (with and without state fixed effects).
Columns 1–2 report standard errors in round brackets. Columns 3–6 report p-values in square brackets. This sample
is considerably more balanced. This is obvious from both the higher p-values in columns 3–4, and the lower number
of variables selected in columns 5–6.

Notes: The table reports results from estimations on alternative samples. PSM-2 does impose exact matching on
state and population bins but only controls for state fixed effects. This is expected to increase the number of matched
treated towns because control towns can be drawn PSM-3 considers three instead of five nearest neighbors. In PSM-4,
we include 1860 town controls as additional matching variables. Full sample w county fixed effects reports results for
regressions in the full sample where we replace stare fixed effects with county fixed effects.

Notes: The figure shows Kernel density plots for treated and control towns. The left figure reports on the log of
enlistments in the full sample, the right figure on the matched sample. The mean (standard deviation) for treated
and control towns are 0.25 (0.2) and 0.13 (0.13) in the full sample, compared to 0.24 (0.18) and 0.15 (0.16) in the
matched sample.

Notes: The table reports on the equivalent of Table 2 with the outcome replaced by per capita enlistments. Columns
1–3 report on the full sample, comparing 72 Forty-Eighter towns to 11,023 control towns. Columns 4–6 report on
the matched sample, comparing 54 Forty-Eighter towns to over 207 matched control towns. Each column reports the
number of treated towns (# Forty-Eighter Towns) providing identifying variation in each specification. In braces, we
additionally report p-values for wild-bootstrap clustered standard errors.

Notes: The table reports the results from interactions between the main treatment D(F orty − Eighters) and an
indicator that takes the value one if at least one of the individual Forty-Eighter characteristics displays in the column
heads was prevalent in this town (D(F orty − Eighters) × Char.). At the bottom of the table, we report the share
of treated towns for which the interaction takes a value of one. All regressions resemble the sample and controls of
the specification in column 6 of Table 2. Standard errors are clustered at the state-level and p-values are reported in
square brackets.



    Table A7 assesses sample heterogeneity. From the individual biographies, we distinguish whether

individual Forty-Eighters (i) fought in the Civil War; (ii) were politically active; (iii) worked as

journalists; or (iv) were members of a Turner Society. For those who fought in the Civil War, we

further distinguish whether they were in (v) leading positions (colonel or above) or lower ranks

(vi). The interaction between indicators for the presence of at least one Forty-Eighter and at least

one of these characteristics (indicated in the column head) gives us some indication whether the

observed treatment effects are intensified (or reduced) by these personal characteristics. We do not

find strong evidence for treatment heterogeneity. The main effect does not vary a lot and most

interaction effects are imprecisely estimated. The only significant interaction suggests that broadly

‘politically active’ Forty-Eighters were more successful in attracting enlistments. Turners and jour-

nalists have a quantitatively similar effect but the interactions are imprecisely estimated. For those

who fought in the war, we see some indication that higher ranked observe that Forty-Eighters of

higher military rank were a bit more influential.




                                                             74
    Table A8 investigates the possibility that the Forty-Eighters were the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of a

broader wave of politically active German immigrants arriving at the same time. If this was true,

we would expect the broad 1848–1852 arrival cohort to have an independent effect on enlistments.

We would further expect the inclusion of this cohort in the regressions to reduce the Forty-Eighters’

effect, given their co-location, and we would expect the 1848–1852 arrival cohort to stand out from

earlier and later arrival cohorts in the regressions. To test this we separately consider the 1848–

1852, the 1845–1847, and the 1853–1855 arrival cohorts’ locations. Specifically, we assign a dummy

to each town that received any German immigrants from the ship lists in a given arrival cohort.

    The summary-finding is that German immigrants other than the Forty-Eighters do not appear

to have been politically influential.

Notes: The table reports results from variations of column 6 in Table 2 where we include all columns and state fixed
effects. Columns 1–3 estimate the effect of each of the broad waves with the Forty-Eighters not being included in the
regressions. Columns 4–6 ‘horse-race’ the Forty-Eighters with each wave. Column 7 includes the Forty-Eighters and
all three waves of other German immigrants. Standard errors are clustered at the state-level, p-values are reported
in square brackets.

distribution is centered around a mean -0.19, and even the 99-th percentile of the distribution is

far to the left of the true estimate in columns 4 of Table 2 (displayed as vertical lines).

    Table A10 shows the variation of stated destinations across treated and control towns: Three

quarters of towns in treatment and control sets ((27 + 169)/271) were never a stated destination

on any ship, reflecting the fact that most passengers did not state a destination, and most who

did stated a major city like Milwaukee or Cincinnati. Overall, a higher share of treated towns was

mentioned as destinations in the treated than in the control set.

Appendix D.1            Alternative IV Strategy

In this section, we explore an IV strategy that hinges on the fact that Forty-Eighters’ early years in

the U.S. were dominated by economic necessities and that the political conflict around slavery was

relatively subdued during this time period. Unlike most immigrants at the time, the Forty-Eighter

arrived in U.S. penniless and with no existing family ties (Wittke 1970, ch.6, Wust 1984, p.31). As

a result, the first place they went to after leaving their port of debarkation was wherever they could

find work, and this suggests that the location of the Forty-Eighters’ first jobs outside their port

of debarkation was plausibly econometrically exogenous, and can therefore serve as an instrument

for the Forty-Eighters’ eventual pre-Civil War location from 1856 on. This often meant moving

somewhere to the Mid-West around German-American communities that were actively seeking

German-speaking workers from port-cities. Labor bureaus operated by German Societies in port

cities advertised these jobs and helped immigrants organize their trip inland.62 According to Wust

(1984, p.32), this “employment service provided 2,200 jobs in 1846, 4,950 jobs in 1849 and 9,435 in

1853.”63

       To determine the locations of first jobs, we screen the Forty-Eighters’ biographies and select all

locations of ‘first settlement’, which we define as locations that were at least one Forty-Eighter ’s

first place of work outside of their debarkation port. Overall, we find 66 locations that match

this criterion. For clarity, we let these 66 locations be indexed by j ∈ J = {1, .., J}, and let the

73 treatment towns be indexed by i ∈ I = {1, .., I}. We find that 20 percent (13/66) of the first

locations in J had no Forty-Eighters live in them during the period 1856-61. And among the treated

locations, 28 percent (20/73) were not a first settlement.64 A9 visualizes the location of instrument

towns relative to treatment towns Let the instrument town that is nearest to i be labeled j(i).

We define our instrument Zi for each town i as its proximity to j(i), where proximity is defined
                                             1
as inverted distance so that Zi =         di,j(i)   is distributed on (0, 1].65 To the extent that any Forty-
  62
     The German Societies themselves had a vital interest to move new immigrants inland because of two scandals,
in 1847 and 1848, when groups of paupers from Grosszimmern and Griesheim in Hesse had arrived in New York City
and refused to leave the city’s Poor House. The German Society was fiercely attacked by New York officials and
newspapers, who accused the ‘Dutchmen’ of loading this group of paupers onto New York (Wust, 1984, p.30).
  63
     Wust (1984) mentions that the archives of the German Society of New York City held every annual report since
1845 at the time of his writing. Unfortunately, the society today has a staff of one, no archives and no library.
  64
     More formally, there are 13 towns in J \ I, 20 in I \ J, and 53 in I ∩ J.
  65
     We set a town’s distance to itself to one mile so that the instrument is = 1 if j(i) = i, i.e. for towns that are
treatment and instrument towns.    We also constructed an alternative instrument that is the sum of inverted distances
to all towns in J, i.e. Zi0 = j∈J di,j
                                   1

settlement instead of proximity to one (columns 4-6). Panel B reports the corresponding first-stage coefficient, and
Panel C reports the reduced form. The controls resemble the ones reported in Table 3, columns 4–6. Standard errors
are clustered at the state-level. p-values are reported in square brackets.



Eighters did move later in the 1850s because of socio-political considerations, our IV strategy gives

us identification under the assumption that such unobserved socio-political characteristics were

orthogonal to proximity to towns that were a Forty-Eighter ’s first place of employment, conditional

on fixed effects and controls.

    We recognize that 53 of the 66 towns of initial settlement are also treated towns, and that

for these towns, the IV strategy assumes that any unobserved socio-political characteristics that

influenced enlistments were orthogonal to the characteristics that led to the town becoming a

Forty-Eighter ’s first place of employment, conditional on fixed effects and controls. Under this

identifying assumption, instead of basing identification on proximity to these towns, we can also

define an alternative treatment variable to be the indicators for towns of initial settlement.

    Table A11 reports on the results of the IV estimation, The column structure is the same as


                                                        81

Table 3. Panels A–C report on the IV when Zi =        di,j(i)   is the instrument. Panels D–F report on

the IV using instead the indicators for towns of initial settlement.

   Overall, the IV results in Panels A and D are very similar to those in Table 3. As in Table 3,

the p-values reported at the bottoms of Panels A and D in Table A11 indicate that the Wu-

Hausman test for the equality of the OLS and IV estimates is never rejected. This suggests that,

conditional on observed controls and region fixed effects, the Forty-Eighters did not select their

towns of settlement based on un-observables that also drove enlistments.

                                Figure A9: Treatment and Instrument Towns
Notes: This Figure visualizes the relation between treated towns and instrument towns in the alternative IV strategy:
73 towns had Forty-Eighters live in them during the period 1856-61. These are indexed by i ∈ I = {1, .., I}. 66 towns
were first locations of Forty-Eighters after leaving their ports of debarkation. These are indexed by j ∈ J = {1, .., J}.
We find 13 towns in J \ I, i.e. they were first locations (in J) but had no Forty-Eighters lived in them by 1856-61. 20
towns are in I \ J, and 53 in I ∩ J.

Appendix E               Event Study

This section provides details on the event study specifications where assess whether (i) public

speeches or (ii) individual Forty-Eighters’ enlistment decisions had a positive effect on town-level

enlistments in the subsequent weeks.

       Our two-way fixed effects regressions to evaluate the events Eik with k ∈ [newspaper, enlistment]

take the following form:

                                     −1
                                     X                               l̄
                                                                     X
                   yit = µi + θt +         γl · D(t − Eik = l)it +          γl · D(t − Eik = l)it +εit ,        (4)
                                     l=l
                                     |            {z             }   |l=1          {z            }
                                         pre-enlistment period          post-enlistment period


       where yi is the log of enlistments (excluding the Forty-Eighters’ own enlistment),66 µi are town

fixed effects and θt are week-of-year fixed effects. Treatment effects are expressed over an effect

window l ∈ l, ¯l that we set to be [−4, +3], and are estimated relative to the omitted week before
              

the observed Forty-Eighter enlistment (i.e., l = 0). For l < 0, γl estimates pre-trends and for

l ≥ 1, γl estimates the dynamic treatment effects of the event. Following Schmidheiny and Siegloch

(2019), we bin treatment indicators Dit at the start point (t ≤ Eik + l) and end point (t ≥ Eik + ¯l).67

       A11 plots the event time indicators for an event window of four weeks before and three weeks

after the Forty-Eighter enlistment events. There is a flat pre-trend followed by a sharp increase

in the number of enlistments in the week where a Forty-Eighter enlists, as well as in the following

week. After that, the effect goes back to zero, suggesting no difference between the treated town

and the control group of towns that were not treated in the same event window.

       A10 and A12 report on the estimated effect of these events. The lower number of observations

means that estimates are less precise than in Figure A11, but the point estimates are strikingly

similar. Civilian acts of leadership cause enlistments to go up by sixty percent in the event week

and the week after, followed by a return to the baseline. As discussed in Section 5.2, the short

duration of the treatment effects is not surprising since enlistments were coordinated local events
  66
     Because there are many weeks of zero enlistments in any given town, we use the inverse hyperbolic sin (log(yi +
(yi2+ 1)1/2 )), which can be interpreted in the same way as the log but without needing to change zero values (Card
and DellaVigna, 2020).
  67
     These bins overcome the identification problem raised in Borusyak and Jaravel (2016). We chose an observation-
window that is two time periods wider than the estimated effect window, so that bins at the end-points contain 3
weeks each. This structure implies the usual assumption that γl is constant within the end-points ¯
                                                                                                  l, l.

a regiment) so they would go to war together (McPherson, 1997; Costa and Kahn, 2010).
