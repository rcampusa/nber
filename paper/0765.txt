      Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act permits certain classes
 of employers to pay full—time students a wage fifteen percent below the
 minimum wage. This study develops a new data base from administrative
 records, our own survey of participating company and establishment managers,
 and published information on local labor markets to investigate employer
 responses to a subminimum wage program.
      Our analysis of the full—time student certification program has
 yielded four general conclusions. First, while the most important users
 of the program are institutions of higher education, certain non—educational
 employers in the retail and service sectors employ a sufficiently large
 and increasing number of students below the minimum wage to suggest that
the program has considerable attractiveness in the private sector. Second,
area labor market conditions are a major determinant of which establish-
ments with permits to pay students subminimum wages in fact make use of
the program and the extent of that use. Establishments in areas charac-
terized by high wages and low levels of unemployment, implying high
costs in employing or locating substitute labor, make more use of student
subminimum workers than establishments in areas with lower costs for
substitute labor. The magnitude of the effect of area wage is, however,
sensitive to the precise specification of the full—time student employment
equation and the variable used to measure area wage. Although this sen-
sitivity leads to variations in the estimation of the elasticity of
substitution between student and other labor, reasonable estimates of this
elasticity range from .5 to 1.0. Among company characteristics, unionism
reduces program usage, while certain company incentives promote use of
the program. Finally, restrictions in the law placed on hours worked at
the subminimum appear to be a major reason for failure to employ students
under this program.

 I. Introduction

         What happens when a subminimum wage is permitted for certain groups

 of workers in an economy covered by minimum wage?

         This question has recently achieved prominence in the United

 States as a result of suggestions that a youth subminimum provision

 to be added to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Despite widespread
                                                                    public

 discussion of the youth subxninlmum and an enormous literature on the mini-

 mum wage, relatively little attention has been given to the existence

 of a subminimum for one group of youth workers (students) in the current
      1!
 law.    Under Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act certain classes

 of employers subject to the minimum wage provisions of the Act are eligible

 to pay full—time students less than the minimum wage otherwise applicable

 in their establishments. For many years, the law was such that relatively

few establishments made use of the student subminimum provision. Changes

in the law in 1966, and further changes in 1974 and 1977, however, have

led to an enormous increase in the use of the student subminimum.

        What can be learned from the experience with the student sub—

minimum about employer response to reduced wages for special groups of

workers? What factors have led some employers to make more extensive use

of the student subminimum than do other employers? What implications

can be drawn for a general youth subminimum?

        This study develops a new data base for analysis of the student

subminimum and uses this data to attempt to answer the preceding questions.

As a useable data set relating to the subminimum did not exist when we

began our work, considerable effort went into data development. We added

to existing administrative records the results of our own telephone survey

of firms and published information on local labor markets, so as to have

Information on the economically interesting variables. The strategy of

developing data beyond that on administrative records for the purpose of
                                  —2—


program analysis was necessary due to the lack of important economic

variables in administrative records. Our success in data development

suggests that this strategy may be useful in analysis of other programs

as well.

           Our analysis has yielded four general conclusions regarding ex-

perience with the student subminimum to the minimum wage.

           1) While the most important users of the program are institutions

of higher education, private non—educational employers, notably department

stores, variety stores, and to a lesser extent food and apparel stores

and theatre chains employ a sufficiently large and increasing number of

students below the minimum to suggest that the program has considerable

attractiveness In the private sector. As the student minimum provisions

have become increasingly lenient in recent years, the number of establish-

ments obtaining permits to pay students below minimum wages rose from

2,756 in 1962—1966 to 5,063 in 1967—1974 to 25,985 in 1975—1979. Exclusive

of institutions of higher education (not permitted to use the law until

1974) the number of hours covered by the student subininimum increased

from 12,067,000 to 76,102,000 between 1974 and 1979. Among non—educational

users, a substantial proportion of employee hours (10.5% in 1979) are worked

by students at below minimum wages. Even with the sizeable expansion

and extensive use of students in college and universities, however, no

more than 3—4% of employed students were employed at the subminimum wage

in 1979. Thus the program appears to be an important economic factor for

those employers using it but to have only a modest impact on the overall

student market.

           2) Area labor market conditions are a major determinant of which

establishments with permits to pay students subininimum wages in fact make

use of the program and the extent of that use. Establishments in areas
                                 —3—


 characterized by high wages and therefore high costs of substitute labor

 make more use of student subminimum workers than establishments in areas

 with low local wage levels. The magnitude of this effect is, however,

 sensitive to the precise specification of the FTS employment equation

 and the variable used to measure ttarea wage", giving a wide range of estimated

 elasticities. Consistent with the direction of this result, areas with

 low levels of unemployment, indicating relatively higher costs in locating

 and attracting alternative workers, make more extensive use of the program.

 On the supply side, employment of students at the subminimum is diminished

 significantly by high alternative wages for young workers.

         3) The characteristics of companies also affects program usage,

 with the presence of unions significantly reducing FTS
                                                          employment. Company
 incentives to promote use of the program appear to have a positive effect

 on usage while less direct reward systems linked to payroll costs or to

profit sharing schemes do not increase program use. Part of the ineffective-

ness of such programs is the result of establishments in companies with

such policies being unaware of their existence.

        4) A major reason for failure to employ FTSs relates to the

restrictions placed on hours worked at the subminimum, both for the establish-

ment as a whole and for the individual students. Of the 225 establishments

we interviewed by mail, 29% cited these hour restrictions as the most

important reason for limited program use.

        The remainder of this paper describes the data and analysis on

which these conclusions are based. Section II provides a description of

the student subminimum provisions in the minimum wage law and of the size

of the program under study. Section III develops the research design and

model that guides the analysis, and gives a brief description of the data

developed. Section IV gives our econometric results and Section V concludes

with an interpretation of the meaning and implications of these results.

II. The Subminirnum Wage for Full—time Students

          In this section we describe briefly the nature of the student

subininimum provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act and set out the basic

facts regarding current size of the program.


The Law

          Section 14(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act currently provides

that certain classes of employers subject to the minimum wage provisions

of the Act are eligible to pay full—time students less than the minimum

wage otherwise applicable in their establishments. The provisions of

Section 14(b) are governed by Chapter 5, Part 519 of the Code of Federal

Regulations of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and

Hour Division of the Department of Labor. The current scope of Section 14(b)

is delineated by the specific language of the Section, the ESA regulations,
                                                              2/
and the scope of the coverage of the minimum wage law itself.

          From the ESA regulations, a "full—time student" (FTS) eligible

for employment at the subminimum is defined as:

          a student who receives primarily daytime instruction at the
          physical location of a bona fide educational institution in
          accordance with the institution's accepted definition of a
          full—time student.

          The major classes of employers that are covered by the minimum

wage law that may pay FTSs below the statutory minimum are: (1) retail and

service industry establishments, (2) agricultural sector establishments,

and (3) institutions of higher education. The differential provided

for in this program has consistently been governed by the provision that the

full—time student wage may not be less than 85% of the statutory minimum
      3/
wage.
                                   —5—


           Employers covered by the subminimum fall into one of three classes,

 each having different limits on the employer's use of the program. First,

 any employer may employ six or fewer FTSs. Second, certain employers
                                                                         may employ
 more than six FTSs, with the total number of hours of the FTS work force

 at the establishment not exceeding 10% of the total hours of all employees

 during any month. Finally, some employers are permitted FTS hours up

 to a specified percentage (exceeding 10%) of total employee hours. Employers

 may be subject to a higher percentage limit if they demonstrate with records

 that in the year preceding the application or certification in the program,

 the proportion of student hours of employment to total hours of all employees

 exceeded 10% at this, or a comparable establishment. This proportion

 is nearly always based on the "practice of similar establishments" of the

 same employers, or other employers in the same industry rather than records

 from that particular establishment. Once a firm is in the over 10% category,

it remains in that category regardless of program use.

          Table 1, based on published data, shows that about 45% of retail

and service establishments in the program are in the greater than 10%

category. These establishments cover about two—thirds of all student

subminimum hours, and include most large, multi—establishment companies

which use the program. In establishments in the less than 10% category,

5% of hours worked are worked by students paid below minimum wage. In

establishments in the greater than 10% category, the comparable fraction

is 15%.

          The way the program operates establishments in any category are

permitted to hire students at the subminimum up to the specified maximum

fraction of hours (or up to six students), whereupon they would be obligated

to pay additional students at the minimum wage. Companies can be expected

to seek permits with specified maximums above their normal anticipated

usage. This in fact appears to be the case.

         There are two other general restrictions on the hours FTSs may work

 that apply across the three different categories of FTS employers. Whether

 the employer Is in the six or fewer, less than 10%, or over 10% category,

he must in some way meet the condition that the employment of FTSs at the

subminimuin wage "will not reduce the full—time employment opportunities

of other persons". Generally, this requirement is satisfied by the employer

attesting to this fact in his application. Since employment of FTSs serves

as a substitute for other forms of labor, we regard this provision as a

"dead letter". Secondly, there are hours restrictions for any individual

FTS. While classes are in session an FTS may be paid the subminimum no

more than 20 hours per week, and while classes are not in session the indi-

vidual limit is 40 hours per week.

        Establishments which violate the provisions of the act are liable

to pay workers "back—pay" and instances of such orders can be cited.

        In our discussion with Regional Administrators of the program,

however, there was no case in which establishments were prosecuted for

violating the nonsubstitution stipulation.


Growth of the Program

        The FTS program began in 1961 as a result of concern about the

possibly adverse effect on employment of students caused by the extension

of the FLSA to an additiona]J 3.6 million employees, most of whom were

employed in retail or service establishments. The 1977 provisions described

earlier are the result of several changes in the law, generally in the

direction of encouraging use of the subminimum, the major exception being

a 1966 decrease in the maximum hours FTS employees can work during the

school year fromthat mandated in the initial legislation to 20 hours (see

table 2). As a result of the changes In the law the number of certifications

granted and students employed under this program has increased significantly.

        Columns 1—3 of Table 3 document the sizeable growth of the FTS

program in the period covered. It shows a major jump in program usage in

1974—1975 and minor jumps in 1967 and 1978 as a result of the changes in

the law in 1966, 1974 and 1977. The contraction in the extent of the

program from 1976 to 1977 is in part due to the mid—1976 Supreme Court
                                                 4/
decision, Nationaj     ue of Cities vs. Usery,        which held that state

and municipal employees that were brought under the FLSA with the 1974

amendments should properly be exempt from minimum wage provisions. To

get a notion of magnitude of the impact of the program on the student

job market, population and labor force participation rates, column 3

gives estimates of total student employment. Roughly 3% of all student

employment is accounted for by the program.

        In sum, from modest beginnings the student subminimum has become

a non—negligible part of the minimum wage system in the United States.

While only a small proportion of employed students are paid the subminimum,

in establishments using the program it is of sizeable import.


III. Research Design and Data Descrjption

        Employment of full—time student labor under the subminimum provision,

like employment of other workers, is determined by demand and supply forces.

Demand for FTS labor will depend on the cost of such labor relative to

other inputs, the output of the firms with certificates, and the specific

technological and institutional characteristics of the firms. Supply of

FTS labor will depend on the alternatives available to students in the

local labor market.

        To analyze the demand and supply determinants of full—time student

labor under the student subminimum one needs data on the number of FTS

workers and on the various demand and supply factors. As there did not

   education where the Department of Labor estImate of 292 is used. This
   number (4.57) differs roui th standard Uepartment of Labor estimate of
   7.75 students per certificate because the Department of Labor estimate
   was based on 1"69 data for FTS hours wor:ed and an outside estimate
   of the number of hours worked by an average student per year. Our estimate
   was based on more recent data concerning FTS hours worked and a survey
   of employers concerning hours worked per student per year.

 did not exist, prior to our study a data set with the requisite information,

we devoted a good deal of effort to obtaining the information needed for

analysis of the student subminimum.

        The primary sources of our data set are the administration records

on employer application for certification under the program. As described

in detail in the data appendix, we obtained a sample of 7,874 establishments

from the administrative records, selecting those in companies that had

ten or more establishments enrolled in the program and that were in the

over 10% certificate class of users. We obtained information on the number

of FTS hours and related information on these establishments for the period

1971—1978, as indicated in table 4.

        The administrative records lacked information on the characteristics

of companies, wages of non—FTS labor and other aspects of the local labor

market in which an establishment is found. To obtain data on these determinants

of FTS—labor we went to two other sources.


        Data on the characteristics of the companies with FTS certificates we

obtained by a telephone survey of the more than 200 parent companies to

which our establishments belonged. As table 4 shows, we obtained information

from the telephone survey on two key institutional factors which can be

expected to influence employment of FTS labor, along with related variables:

unionism and explicit corporate policy toward employment of FTS labor.

We expect unionism to reduce usage of the FTS program, in order to protect

the wage scale and jobs of covered labor. With respect to corporate policy

we hypothesize that companies which either reward or pressure managers for

cost reductions through employment of FTSs can be expected to hire more

than companies which do not have such policies. Our questionnaire provides

two pieces of information on corporate policy regarding FTS employment.

The first piece of information deals with whether the company put any

 pressures on the managers to use the program either through direct en-

 couragement of program or managerial policies to hold down labor costs.

The second asked whether the managers' compensation was in any way tied

 to their performance (profits, sales or costs). Using both of these

measures, we hoped to account for different levels of company pressure

on managers to cost minimize by using the program.

        Information on local labor market conditions which might be ex-

pected to influence FTS employment, Including the level of wages of po—

tentialsubstjtuteworkers and the level of wages available to teenagers

in an area we obtained from published sources. As our wage measures we

took manufacturing wages in an area for the years covered from the BLS,

and mean annual earnings for prime age (30—34 year old) workers and mean

annual earnings for 16—19 year old workers for 1969, as reported in the

Census of Population. Manufacturing wages have the advantage of being

available on an annual basis; the Census data have the advantage of referring

to the entire labor market and give us our only feasible measure of alternatives

available to young as opposed to older workers. We also obtained data on

area unemployment rates for the various areas.

        We expect the area labor market variables to affect usage of students

under the subminimum in accord with the demand—supply framework sketched

out at the outset. Area wages (manufacturing average hourly earnings or

prime age worker annual earnings) are expected to be positively related

to the student subminimum hours as firms substitute students in favor of

higher priced alternative labor. Area unemployment rates can be expected,

by a similar logic, to have a negative effect on the employment of

students at the subminimum. The higher the area unemployment rate, the

greater is the likely availability of substitute labor and thus the less

the incentive to employ the students. Finally the economic opportunities

for teenagers In an area, reflected in the earnings of 16—19 year olds,
                                -4—
is expected to influence employment of FTSs by altering the supply of

students. The better the opportunities elsewhere the smaller will be

the number accepting below minimum wage jobs.

        The final result of the data collection is a data set containing

over 20,000 establishment years from 1971 to 1979 with information on

program usage (both hours worked and estimated number of students hired),

local labor market conditions, and some data on the parent company.

        Table 5 compares the size of our sample to that of the greater

than 10% group from which the sample was drawn and to the total group

of program participants from retail and service establishments. As can be

seen, our sample includes about 30—40% of student hours in the greater

than 10% group and 20—25% of all student hours in the industries covered.

As retail and service trade represents 25% of all students hired under the

program, our sample covers about 5% of the total FTS employment under the

student subminimum.

        Table 6 decomposes the 1978 observations in our sample by industry.

What is important is the concentration of FTS bodies in department stores,

who appear to be the major users of the program. The other important user

is the variety, hardware, and drug store industry. It should be noted

that this distribution relates only to establishments in our sample and

thus to those, in the greater than 10% category.

Analytic framework

        While the data set has both time series and cross—section variation,

in this study we focus exclusively on the cross—section variation. We do this

for two reasons: first, because our company information and our information

on the earnings of adult prime age and youth workers in a local labor market

exist solely on a cross—section basis; second, because the limited years

covered and the concurrence of changes in the mininum wage over the period covered

and of changes in the provisions for the student subminimum makes it

exceedingly difficult to determine the effect of changes in the minimum

in a time series. Note that by focusing on the cross—sectional data we

  choose otherwise they pay 85% of the same minimum wage by the law.           This

 does not, however, mean that we cannot make inferences about establishment

 responses to changes in the subminimum wage. Since labor demand decisions

 depend on relative factor costs and student supply decisions depend on

 comparisons of the subniinimum with alternative wages, we can interpret

 coefficients on other wage variables as reflecting the impact of the fixed

 subminimum versus the variation in the other wages across areas.


A small formal model

        To provide a more formal framework for ensuing analyses, let

        L =       demand for FTS labor with corresponding elasticity of a,
         S
        S     =   supply of FTS labor with corresponding elasticity of c,
        W = the       fixed wage for students,

        X = the       level of demand curve for FTS labor,

        WN = wage of non—FTS labor (proxied in our empirical analysis by

                  the area manufacturing wage or average annual earnings of

                  prime age workers)i and    -



              = non-FTS hours of employment.
        L.
                                                                        -




Now let dots above variables reflect in derivatives, so that L and S
are demand and supply changes respectively, and W = 0 (since the student

wage is fixed). The relative demand for student labor can then be expressed

as:


                  SLNSWN)L
        If    supply factors do not constrain the employment of FTS workers,

so that firms face an infinitely elastic schedule at the fixed price, W,

and if output is fixed (X =     0),   employment will be:

        (2)
                                   —18—


Equation (2) expresses an isoquant relationship for the trade—off between

two factors of production, FTS labor and non—FTS labor, given a constant

elasticity of substitution between the two, where the "market" wage of the

FTS input is held fixed at the subminimum.

        When   the   availability of students at W is insufficient to meet

demand, the analysis is more complex as supply factors will also enter

the employment determination equation. Thererare two basic ways in which

to model this situation: in the first, the supply constraint is assumed

to be effective, at least in some labor markets, so that firms are unable

to hire the number of students desired at the subminimum; in the second,

certain nonwage costs and adjustments are assumed to equilibrate the market.

        Panel A of figure 1 depicts the first situation. In the region

where supply and demand cross before the fixed subminimum wage (W), the

supply constraint produces employment below that predicted by the demand

curve. In the region where the schedules cross after ' by contrast,

employment is determined by the demand model (1) and (2).     With a national

minimum, it is likely that in some markets establishments will be supply

constrained whereas others will not be so constrained, depending on the
                                                                                6/
earnings opportunities available to students outside the subminimum sector.

        Panel B represents what we believe to be a more realistic model,

in which firms may respond to supply constraints through either raising

the subminiinum or engaging in costly search for students (which shifts

the supply curve) or in reducing hiring standards. With respect to the

 first form of adjustment, while the majority of the thirty—nine companies

 responding to question hg in the company survey ("Hourly Wage Paid to

 FTSs?") paid exactly 15% below the minimum wage, seven companies did in-

 dicate paying FTSs a wage that is below the federal minimum yet greater

 than 85% of the minimum wage.

           Another response is to continue to hire students but to pay them

 at or above the minimum wage. Student employees then move into the cate-

 gory of non—FTS labor. If the employer does not differentiate in the wages

 paid to students and responds to a supply constraint in this manner, he

 will either report no FTS hours of employment under the program or drop

 out of the program altogether. While our sample is not designed to examine

 the latter possibility, 28 percent of the establishment years included in

 the sample are from establishments enrolled in the program but without any

 student hours of employment paid at subminimum wages. For such establish-

 ments that have invested in enrolling in the program, but have no FTS

 hours of employment, we expected measures of student supply to be par-

 ticularly important considerations.
          A third response for employers is to invest more resources in

locating student labor willing to work at the subrninimum wage. In this

way, the cost of student labor facing employers consists of two components:

the dollars paid to the FTS labor and the incremental costs incurred by

employers to locate this labor.

           Whichever response dominates, the implication is that supply

 factors will also influence L .          The cost of student labor will adjust to
                                  5

 market   conditions in such a way as to influence employment of FTSs.

           We model this situation by adding an additional cost term to our

 demand equation: C =      cost of student labor above and beyond .        Our

           On the supply side, we make the supply curve of students depend

 on the subminimuin alternative earnings, and the additional cost factor:

 the coefficients on
                           WN and WY should be identical. Because our estimates of

 IV. Econometric Analysis of Participat ion and Use of Student Subminimum

         This section presents the statistical results of our analysis

 of our establishnent data set.
                                       The analysis shows that consistent with

 our model, employment depends on both the demand and supply side forces
in the local labor markets. The impact Of wages of other workers on employ-

ment of FTSs is positive but is extremely sensitive to changes in the speci-

fication of the employment equation. Average teenage earnings have a

sizeable negative impact. Area unemployment also has a negative impact

on FTS employment. We also find that several establishment characteristics

influence employment of FTSs, with unionized establishments in particular

using relatively less FTS labor than other establishments.          Establishments
whose companies actively encourage their establishments to use the program

show greater usage, though more general incentives to cut costs or raise

profits (such as profit sharing plans) did not increase program use. These

same factors determine both whether or not an establishment uses its permit

and the FTS employment among users.

Analysis

        We analyze the effect of explanatory' variables on program usage using

two samples from our establishment data set: a sample consisting of all

establishments, including those that do not have any FTS students, and

a sample restricted to establishments that in fact use their permits.

Within each sample we also analyze a subsample consisting of those estab-

lishments in SNSAs for which we had local labor"market information from

the 1970 Census. With the all—establishment sample, we analyze the number

of FTS hours worked and the ratio of FTS to non—FTS hours worked, without

correcting (say via a Tobit analysis) for the fact that a significant

number of observations are clumped at zero hours. We also run linear

probability and probit equations for whether or not an establishment in

fact hires any FTS labor. With the sample of establishments which use some

FTS labor, we estimate equations relating the ln of FTS hours worked and

the in of FTS hours divided by non—FTS hours worked to the dependent variables.

        For several of the variables from our company survey, there were

a sizeable number of missing observations. Rather than deleting observations

and running into problems of sample selectivity due to missing observations,

we included special dummy variables for missing observations. As we have

done this only for variables that are categorical, we are simply establishing

a new category and thus face no major econometric problems as a result.

        In addition to the variables discussed in the previous section,

we include three other sets of "controls". First, we controlled for

year, as changes in the law might affect program use.   Second, we con—

trolled for industry (e.g., theatre and food store), to hold fixed for

technological differences in the ability to utilize the program. Third,

we controlled for the region in which an establishment was located. Initi-

ally, we anticipated region would be an innocuous variable but it turned

out to have an important effect in one set of calculations, for reasons

we do not understand.

 Results: Determinants of Student Hours in Full Sample

         The major results of the econometric analysis are given in Table 7

which records the results of least squares regression of FTS hours on the

postulated determinants. These results are reported for the entire sample

of establishments, including those which lack some information about the
                      8/
local labor market.        Columns 1—4 report calculations using average hourly

earnings in manufacturing as the indicator of the cost of substitute

labor in the area while columns 5—6 report calculations using the annual

earnings of prime age workers as the indicator of the cost of substitute

labor. As the calculations include some establishments with zero FTS

hours, we do not use the log transformation of the dependent variable.

The basic model includes establishment characteristics and demand side

variables. To these are added supply side variables, as well ascontrols

for Census region.

        The first set of explanatory variables tested are designed to

identify the establishments' demand for FTS labor. As can be seen from

the first lines of the table, a higher manufacturing wage rate increases

program use, and a higher area unemployment rate lowers program use. As

the area wage rises and unemployment falls, it becomes more expensive

to hire regular workers because they are no longer available at the mini—

mum wage. If the alternative, better paying jobs are not open to full—

time students, they may still be willing to work at the subminimum. Thus,

the price of student labor has fallen relative to regular labor, and more

student labor will be used implying that student labor is a good but far
                                               9/
from perfect substitute for non—student labor.    Note, however, the sig-

nificant variation in the magnitude of the estimated wage effect, depending

on the inclusion of regional controls: without region, the coefficient

on log wage with manufacturing hourly earnings is on the order of 2.1

to 2.6; with region, the coefficient drops to .35 to .82, significant

given the number of observations but considerably smaller. In the cal-

culations using the prime age earnings in the SMSA the results are quite

different. In a sample consisting solely of establishments for which

Census SMSA data are available we obtain comparable earnings coefficients

with and without region controls. In the full sample where we "filled"

in the missing earnings by instrumenting the prime age earnings on the
                            10 /

manufacturing   earnings,          we obtain large coefficients but here the

magnitude drops noticeably with he addition of region controls. We tried

to find an explanation for the significant region effects, (the coefficients

showd that employment of the FTS labor is greater in the North Central, followed

by the West, and is least in the South) but failed. We do not have a

satisfactory explanation for this or for why the area manufacturing wage

is so sensitive to it.

        The results with our supply side indicator of alternative earnings

available to young workers are more stable, with the teenage earnings

variable obtaining coefficients on the order of —2.1 to —3.0 in all cases.

In the model presented in the previous section, the coefficient on the

teenage earnings should be similar to that on the cost of substitute labor,

and this is the case in some but not all of the calculations, as can be

seen in the table.

        Considering establishment (and company) characteristics, the major

determinant of program usage is unionization, which, as expected, greatly

reduces usage. Smaller establishments (measured on annual sales) also

use less FTS labor, which is also expected. On the other hand, variables

to control for difficulty in finding non—FTSs at the minimum do not work

well, with no clear pattern emerging.

        The results from the analysis of company policies designed (or

expected) to encourage program use suggest that only policies directed

at the FTS program itself are effective in raising usage.          General policies
                                   —27—

 to   reward good performance, through bonuses or promotion, tend if anything

 to reduce usage when introduced along with variables measuring direct

encouragement.      One possible explanation is that companies may set up

 these plans, but not have them perceived by the managers. Some support

 for this is found in our limited sample of establishment data; in cases

where establishment managers said there was no link between their compen-

sation and performance as managers, 45 % of the company representatives

had said there was such a link. Similarly, 25% of the company representatives

said they pressured managers to use the program when the establishment

managers had reported no such pressure.

           Finally, the establishment managers may   pursue   goals other than

maximum profits: if they prefer working with non—students they may not

hire FTSs, even if hiring FTSs would reduce labor costs and increase

profits.

Detrininants of Whether an Establishment Uses Its Permit or Not

           Because a sizeable number of establishments which can hire FTSs

do not do so, it is of interest to examine the factors that influence

whether a company uses its permit, as well as the total FTS hours. Accord-

ingly, we have estimated linear and probit probability models designed to

explain use of permits.

           The linear probability analysis is given in columns 1—3 of Table 8;

the probit analysis is given in columns 4—6. Both sets of equations yield results

consistent with those given earlier. Column 7 shows what happens when the linear

analysis is done for the SNSA subsample, using the log prime age earning variable,

rather than the area wage. Most independent variables obtain qualitatively

similar coefficients to those in Table 7, as higher unemployment rates,

higher teenage earnings, and unionism all discourage usage, while pressure

to use the program encourages usage. It is perhaps more instructive to

focus on the differences between these results and those of Table 7.

First, once region controls are entered, the BLS manufacturing wage has no

significant impact on usage1 suggesting a smaller role for alternative

cost factors   here. However, the prime age earnings used in the column

7 equation shows a significant impact on wage in the presence of region

controls, just as it did in Table 7. In addition, the impacts of unioni-

zation and teenage earnings are larger here when compared to the impacts

of other variables than they were in the results presented in Table 7.

This is appropriate as these variables measure constraints (one institutional—

and one supply—oriented) on the establishment's ability to find and hire

FTSs.

        In short, while there are some differences in the magnitude of

impacts, the same set of variables affect the 0—1 program use as affected

overall hours with the same sensitivity of the coefficient on manufacturing

wages to inclusion of regression controls.


Determinants of Student Hours: Users Sample Only

        We turn next from analysis of the entire sample of establishments

to the roughly 3/4ths who in fact use their permits and employ student

labor at below minimum wage. For this sample our dependent variables are

estimated in natural logarithms, which makes it easier to read off the

elasticities on which economists focus. The results of these calculations

are summarized in Table 9.

        The results from column (1) indicate that without supply or region

controls a sizeable impact of area wage on FTS employment is found, indicating

a demand elasticity on the order of .6 to .7. Controls for supply do

not change the result appreciably, but region controls do reduce the

estimated elasticity to about .1. Without any explanation for the impact

of regional controls, we are left with two rather different estimates.

When we recalculate the estimates using the annual earnings of prime age

workers for the area wage variable, we obtain the results in columns 3

and 4. Similar to the results of Table 7 , the impact of this measure

on FTS employment is greater than the impact of area manufacturing wage.

        As the coefficients on the other variables are similar to those

in previous tables, no further discussion of them is needed.

        Finally, columns 5 and 6 turn to the determinants of the ln of the

ratio of FTS to non—FTS hours with supply variable excluded, which brings

us closer to the elasticity of substitution concept in models (1) and (2).

The results here are quite similar to those in which we allow the coefficient

on in non—FTS hours to diverge from unity in the previous columns.


Reconciling estimates

        The preceding statistical analyses yield relatively strong and

similar results across regressions for all but one of the variables studied.

Unfortunately, the variable for which results were not stable is the sub-

stitute wage variable: the manufacturing area wage falls sharply with

inclusion of regional controls, while the prime—age earnings variable

obtains consistently higher coefficients. As a result we have sets of

estimates of the effect of the cost of substitute labor on employment

of FTS workers which range from quite large to relatively modest. In terms

of our full model (Section IV, equation 5), the coefficient on the log

earnings of the teenagers should be the same as that on the wage variable.

It generally falls between the estimated coefficients for the other two

wage series, and varies less with the inclusion of region controls. This

suggests that constraining the coefficient on teenage wage to be equal

to that on adult wage might be appropriate. The results from this con-

strained estimation are presented in Table 10.

       As expected, we find much less sensitivity to the inclusion of

region controls with the constraint. The constraint also does not sub-

stantially affect the coefficients on the other variables, which are not

discussed here. Looking at the full model from Section IV again, we see

 that the demand elasticity may be calculated as the ratio of the wage

 coefficient to the coefficient on nori—FTS hours. Using the

 wage as our wage figure we obtain from column 3, which excludes region

 controls, a substitution elasticity of 1.2 (.561.47);   from column 4
 we estimate an elasticity of .46 (.22/.48). With the prime age earnings

 measure and region controls, we get a figure of 2.4 (1.15/.48). Although

 the estimates we have obtained are somewhat sensitive to region controls

 and sample changes, we conclude that there is a definite response of FTS

 employment to the wages of substitute labor, with the elasticity likely

 to fall between .5 and 1.
Implications

        Given the estimates in Section IV, what can be said about the

impact of the student subminimum on hours worked by the covered group?

What can be said about the impact of the student subminimum on hours

worked by non—FTS workers?

        If we are willing to accept the supply and demand model of equation (5),

we can at least get a crude notion of the elasticity of substitution

between FTS labor and other labor and thus of the impact of the program.

In this section we so interpret the estimated response parameters and use

them to evaluate the impact of the program on hours worked by the two


groups. Our calculations suggest that the subminimum for students has

generated FS hours at eligible firms. Our calculations also suggest that

the subminimum has reduced hours of non—FTS workers. The exact magnitude

of this effect depends critically on the model used to determine the effect——

specifically whether or not region variables are included In the analysis

and the variable usedifto measure area wages.

        Since the scale effect of lower wages would be to increase employ—

ment, our estimates presumably understate the increase in FTS hours and

overestimate the decrease in non—FTS hours. We use crude data on the scale

effect to get an idea of the extent of this additional employment effect.

Elasticity model

       First, we express the linkage between the elasticity of substi-

tution and the elasticity of demand for FTS and non—FTS labor for the

case in which there are no supply constraints using the same notation

developed for the models previously described:


         (6) L —               =         where output is fixed.
                       LN          OWN



        The production function can be written as:


         (7) Q =                   + ctLN + aRR,


where Q =   output
       R =     all   other inputs

       as =    elasticities         of inputs in production.

         We assume that the market is sufficiently competitive that the as

 can be approximated by shares of inputs in cost.                 Assume other inputs are

 fixed. Then with output fixed:

 changes due to the subminimum on hours worked of student and nonstudent labor,

 given estimated ratios of expenditures on the two forms of labor and estimated

 elasticities of substitution.

         Table 3.1 contains the relevant information on the expenditures on

 the two types of labor estimated from our establishment survey.                To estimate

 expenditures on FTS labor, we multiplied FTS hours by the subminimum wage.

To estimate expenditures on non—FTS labor we multiplied non-FTS hours by the

area wage facing the establishment and reduced the amount by the ratio of

the average hourly earnings of retail trade nonsupervisory workers to the

average hourly earnings of manufacturing workers in 1977, as reported in

Employment and Earnins, March 1978 (the retail trade average was $3.83;

the manufacturing average was $5.63, giving a ratio of .68).

        We report results for the entire period covered by our data and

for the latest full year for which we have data, 1978. We report results

for the entire sample and for users only.

        We find that full—time student labor has a cost share of 4% to 10%

depending on the group and time covered.

        Table 12 combines these figures with three alternate values of

a from Table 10 to test the impact of different elasticities on changes in

FTS and non—FTS hours:   (1) a low estimate of .5 using column 3, (2) a

medium estimate of 1.2 using column 4, and (3) a high estimate of 2.4

using column 6. In each case the values are obtained by

solving equation (5) for a, by dividing the coefficient on the cost of

alternative labor by the coefficient on the non—FTS hours variable.

Lines 1 and 4 record the elasticities of fixed output labor demand implied

by the estimates for FTS and non—FTS workers respectively, using equations

(10) and (11). Since the FTS share in costs is relatively modest, the

elasticity in line 1 far exceeds that in line 4. Lines 2 and 5 multiply

the relevant elasticities by the .15 reduction in wages to obtain estimates

of the change in in man hours worked by the two groups. According to

these calculations, the effect of the subminimum on employment of FTS—

type labor strongly depends on the estimated a. For the smallest value for

a in Table 12 (.5),   the effect of the 15% reduction in the minimum wage

on employment of FTS labor is 7%. Using the largest value for a (2.4)

this employment effect is 34%. Regardless of the assumed a, the decrease

in non—FTS employment is less than two percent.

        Since FTS hours are a modest share of total hours, however, these

                                                                for the two
sometimes large differential percentage changes in employment

groups translate into more modest differences in actual hours of employ-

ment. According to the figures in line 3, hours worked per establishment

by FTS—type labor increased froin248 to1194 using the smallest and largest

estimates of a respectively. For non—FTS hours, the decrease ranges from

156 to 745 hours per establishment for the low and high values of a, re-

spectively. Using our middle estimate of a (1.2) we find an increase of

FTS hours of 597, partly offset by a decline in non—FTS hours of 374.


Full Demand Effect

        To estimate the total impact of the youth subminimum on hours

worked, it is necessary to add in the scale effect and any substitution

between capital and the like. We focus here on estimates of the scale

 effect. We obtained from Mary Corcoran of the Institute of Social Re-

 search an estimated elasticity of the demand for retail trade activities.

This elasticity was calculated by a survey of establishments that asked them

their perception of the elasticity. It suggests a moderate scale effect

of 1.0. If we take the FTS share of labor as 5% of labor cost, and use

national income statistics to estimate labor's share of national income

in retail trade, we obtain an estimate of the impact of the reduction

in the wage of students on cost. According to the national income statistics

(Survey of Current Business, July 1979) compensation of labor in retail

trade was $113 billion; national income in the sector was $185 billion,

giving a share of .61. Hence, our estimate of the scale effect is

.05(.15)(.6l) = .0046.   By the estimated elasticity of demand, the re-

sultant scale effect is .46%. A .46% increase in the average hours of

employment in an establishment (approximately 45,000 in our sample) would

translate into an employment scale effect of 200 hours. If this number
                                  —39-.

 is reasonable, the scale effect is potentially an important employment

 effect equivalent in magnitude to the        estimates for the decrease in

 non—FTS hours presented in Table 12.


 Substitution of Whom for Whom

         It would, for policy purposes, be interesting to know whether

 the non—FTS people displaced are nonstudent teenagers or "adults". If it

 turns out to be the former, one would be inclined to guess that a general

 teen differential would have less effect than if there was substantial

FTS teen/adult substitution.

        To get a handle on the substitution question, we re—interviewed

six major corporations who had participated in our initial survey. We

asked, "If the subminimum wage provision were not part of the Fair Labor

Standards Act, would the work that is now being done by the full—time

students:

        (1) not be done at all?

        (2) be done by other staff members without hiring any new people?


        (3) or would have hired someone to do this work, and if so, from
            what age group?"

        The predominant answer was that students would have been hired

regardless of the provision, though one establishment said they would have

divided up the work among existing employees. Hence, for what it is worth,

we feel that much of the substitution may be between student labor and

other youth labor.

        For policy purposes it would also be of value to learn about the

views of managers toward the FTS program. Accordingly, we obtained the

permission of some companies to contact individual establishments. We

asked each establishment for information on hours per week worked by both

regular employees and full—time students similar to the information asked

of the companies. We also asked for a count of full—time, part—time, and

full—time—student employees, for a qualitative measure of the establish—
                                —40—
ment's likely response to different changes in the law and the reasons for

under—utilization of the certificate by the establishment.     Because

this data comes from the establishment manager who is usually responsible

for the hiring decisions, it provides a valuable perspective on the operation

of the FTS program.

        Table 13 presents some of the results from the establishment

questionnaire regarding reasons for under or nonutilization of the program

and responses to changes in the program.

        All establishments which did not use the maximum allowed hours at

the subminimum (and only 14% reportedusing the maximum) were asked how

important each of ten possible reasonsfor underutilization were. These

responses are presented in panel A. The difficulty of substituting FTSs

for other workers is apparent in the two reasons cited most often as "very"

or "somewhat" important: "we need some nonstudents to work when FTSs cannot

(due to school commitments)" mentioned by 78% and "we need adult workers

for stability and continuity of our work force" mentioned by 72%. We also

see that this difference between FTSs and other workers is one of sub-

stitution, not a strict difference in the productivity of the two groups, as

only 26% cited "full—time students are unsatisfactory workers; we prefer

adult workers" as areason for underutilization.

        That employment of FTS labor Is influenced in part by supply is

indicated by the fact that 46% of respondents said that "we cannot find

full—time students willing to work at a subminimum wage" was an important

reason for underutilization. "Our company policy is to pay all workers

at least the minimum wage" was also mentioned by 54%. State restrictions

on program use were cited by fewer than one—third of the respondents.

Unionism was not accorded an important role, suggesting that the union

impact operates largely on whether or not a company uses the program at

all.

          The managers were also asked what was the most important reason

for their underutilization of the program. Relatively few responded to

this question, and those that did cited a wide variety of reasons, not

all appearing on this list. However, of the questions on this list, diffi-

culty of finding students willing to work at the subminimum was mentioned

27 times and the need for adult workers for stability and continuity was

mentioned 22 times. No other reason on the list was mentioned more than

eight times. This points out the impact of a limited supply of workers at

the subminimum wage: it does not affect as many establishments as the problem

of substituting FTSs for other workers, but for those affected it is

important.

          In addition to these questions on current program use, the managers

were asked whether each of six hypothetical changes in the program regu-

lations   would lead to a "substantial", "limited", or "no" increase in
their use of the program. These responses are also presented in Panel B.
The two most often mentioned are "remove the limits on hours an FTS can work
in a given week", mentioned by 71% and "remove the restriction on percentage

of total hours allowed to be paid at the subminimum wage" mentioned by

72%. The latter restriction could be related to the month—by—month limits

on the percentage of subminimum hours allowed: even if the establishment

is not always at the maximum, it might be at certain times of the year.

By reducing these restrictions, managers perceive that their ability

to substitute FTSs for other workers would increase. Broadening the class

of eligible workers was somewhat less important: 62% cited "permit any

teenager, not just FTSs, to be paid the submininium wage". Removing the

state restrictions was mentioned by 59%, and removing the prohibition

on displacing adult workers by only 42%. Compatible with our finding that

the demand for FTS labor is affected by relative wages, 50 percent said

that reducing the FTS wage by 50 cents would increase their use of the

program.
                               —43-.

         The managers were asked which of these changes would have the

greatest impact, providing another measure of the importance of the changes.

Removal of the limit of 20 hours per week worked at the subminimum is

cited as most important by 29%, while the overall establishment ceiling was

mentioned by only 13%. The reduction in FTS wages also affects some establish-

ments' strongly, with 24% saying it was the most important change listed.

Allowing any teenager to be paid at the subminimum wage was most important

to 20%, while state restrictions and non—displacement of adult workers

were rarely considered most important.

        We also asked the establishment managers a series of questions on

the incentives provided to them by the company to use the program. Their

responses were matched against those given by the company. We found

some disagreement between the company and establishment responses: in

cases where the establishment reported no rewards for good performance,

30 percent of the companies reported some rewards. This disagreement


between company and establishment perceptions is less pronounced for

pressures specifically directed at increasing program usage. In 19

percent of the cases for which the establishment reported no pressure

to use the program, some pressure was reported by the company. This

sort of misperception would lead our estimates of the impact of

company policies to be an underestimate of the impact of fully recog-

nized policy. The better performance of the more direct pressures may

in part be due to better communication of the specific policies by

companies to their establishments.

        There is also disagreement between establishments and companies

on the difficulty of finding reliable workers at the minimum wage. Only 5%

of managers, but 55% of companies, said it was "easy" (though 36% of mangers

said it was "not too difficult"). Only 3% of the companies, but 18% of

the managers said it was "very difficult". These differences are in part

due to the 40% of the companies that answered "it varies (between establish—
                                —44 *

ments)",   but companies in general seem to have an exaggerated idea of the

ease of finding reliable workers at the minimum wage. This provides some

support for our hypothesis that, at least in some areas, non—FTS workers are

relatively difficult to find at the minimum wage, which would increase the

attractiveness of hiring FTS workers at the subminimum.

           Finally, we asked the managers "did participation in the FTS Program

influence your establishment to expand total employment by more than might

otherwise have occured?" If it had, they were asked to indicate the number

of additional workers hired. Thirty percent answered that employment

had increased. For these establishments, on average, five or six

additional workers were hired as a result of the program, according

to establishment managers. This compares to an average total employment

of just over 24 employees per establishment in the sample. This again

indicates that the reduction in the wage for this group of workers has

had an effect on FTS employment.

           These results from the establishment questionnaires support our

previous conclusions that students (or at least full—time students under

the current program) are imperfect substitutes for regular workers. This

is partly due to their student status, which carries higher turnover rates

and less flexible work schedules. It is also due to program restrictions

on both individual and aggregated subminimum hours. There may be paperwork

costs associated with the program, but since all these establishments are

already involved in the program we have no means to test for the importance

of these costs. Naturally, we would assume that the existence of such

costs would make students even more difficult to substitute for regular

workers, so that larger changes in relative wages would be needed to induce

the firms to expand student employment.

Biases and Problems With the Analysis

         Our analysis is subject to several problems which should be

brought forth. First, our sample dealt solely with firms who were in

the lO-I-% category, who are FTS intensive. We suspect (although it

does not follow inevitably) that these firms also find it easier to substi-

tute FTSs for other workers —— one reason that other firms are not in this

category would be that they find such substitution more difficult than the

firms in our sample. Second, to the extent that some establishments are

at their certification ceiling, then the number of FTSs they are hiring is

less than the cost—minimizing number, and the estimated "elasticity of

substitution" is not as large as the "true" elasticity. With our data,

we are unable to gauge the relative importance of these biases.



Implications for a General Youth Sulrninimum

        Our    findings   suggest a responsiveness of employment to the FTS

program to relative wages. What then can      be   said about a general youth

subminimurn?

        Several features of the FTS program suggest that generalizations

are difficult. On the one hand, the FTS program is limited to certain

sectors of the economy where a priori, one might expect greater ease of

substitution between youth and other workers —-      the   retail/service

sector is one with relatively many unskilled workers. We also selected

significantly large users of FTS labor, for which our estimates of substi-

tution might be expected to be especially high. On the other hand,

as noted, one of the major deterrents to substitution is the difficulty of

accomodating the peculiar time schedules of students and the time constraints

of the program. Nonstudent youth might be easier to substitute for older
                               —46—




workers. Indeed, many managers mentioned that allowing them to hire any

teenager, not just a student, at the subminimum would induce a substantial

change in program use. This suggests that there would be a greater response

by employers to a youth subminimuin than our data suggest. However,

noristudent youth may not be as willing to work at the suhninimwn as

students.

        Finally, the ability to draw generalizations about a general

youth suhiinimum directly from the results presented here is limited

by the sensitivity of the effect of area wages on FTS employment to

the various specifications, particularly in the absence of any satis-

factory explanation for the effect of region controls on certain

wage coefficients.

Appendix A: Development of the Data Set

        Our study was obligated to create its own data base in order to

analyze the student subminimum. The design by which we collected data

was motivated by and ultimately determined our research analysis. As

noted in Section III, we obtained data from three basic soirces:

        —   administrative   records on employers certified to hire FTSs
        —   our own telephone survey of over 200 such employers
        —   published   data on area labor market conditions.

        This appendix provides a detailed description of the process by

which we collected data and the resultant data set.




Administrative Record Data

       Our primary source of information on use of the program was the

Department of Labor's file of employer applications for certification

under the program. Every year each establishment in the program must sub-

mit a renewal application ,including the number of hours paid to all employees

in the previous year, and the number of hours paid at the subminimum wage.

One copy of the application is kept by the Regional Office (which handles

the day—to—day administration of the program) and one copy is forwarded

to the National Office in Washington, D.C. to be placed in the national

file. (See Table A—i for a copy of this form).

       This data is aggregated into a quarterly report on program usage

by each Regional Office, from which the National Office prepares quarterly

and annual totals for the nation as a whole. These reports represented

the only previously existing information on program use, and are in too

aggregate a form for detailed analysis. Nonetheless, we used this data
                                   —48--




for preliminary investigation of how usage has changed over time, and also

to give us some idea of the scope of program usage.

         From the first it was clear that we would have to use the appli-

cation files to develop a sample of program users. An early decision was

whether to use the files at the Regional or National level. The Regional

files maintain separate folders for each establishment, regardless of the

certificate class (6 or fewer, 10 percent, or over 10 percent) containing

all past applications for that establishment. However, using Regional

files would require visits to several cities to develop a comprehensive

national data base. The National files contain all past applications for

the entire country, but separate folders are only n1aintained for establish-

ments in the over 10% class. These folders are arranged in order by parent

company, which aids in analyzing differences between companies. Because

of the difficulty involved in visits to different Regional offices, we

decided to use the National files and restrict our sample to users in the

over 10% class. We considered only retail and service establishments, since

agricultural establishments represent little of overall usage and institu-

tions of higher education have special motivations for hiring their own     stu-
dents.

         Even this restriction of the sample was not quite enough to provide

a data set of manageable size, so we further restricted the sample to those

establishments in companies that had ten or more establishments enrolled in

the program. One    reason   for choosing this restriction was to simplify col—

lection of data from the parent companies. A further reason was that an

earlier study done in 1969 by the Department of Labor suggested that nearly

all of the aggregate hours worked under the program were accounted for by
                                  —49—

  the largest 10 or 20 multi—establishment companies (most of which are now

  in the over 10% class). We finally obtained a sample of 7,874 establish-

  ments in the over 10% class, belonging to fewer than 200 parent companies.

        From the files in Washington, D.C., we collected a history of each

 establishment's use of the program: total and FTS hours from each year's

 renewal form (up to 12). We also obtained a few minor pieces of informa-

 tion, including sales volume (one of three categories), zip code for iden-

 tifying geographic location so that we could later add data on local labor

 market conditions, the addresses of the establishment and parent company,

 and the name and telephone number of the person responsible for the appli-

 cation (typically the personnel manager of the parent company). It was this

information which enabled us to proceed with further data collection.

        Of our sample of 7874 establishments that were in the program in

1974, 2915 were no longer in the program by 1979. The establishments

are included in our analysis f or every year in which we have data, but no

correction is made for their dropping out.

 Our Telephone Sury

        From the information on application forms we obtained, as noted

 earlier, the name and address of persons responsible for the program. To

 obtain additional information about companies using the program we decided

 to conduct a telephone survey of the responsible officials.

        Before contacting any of the companies or establishments from our

 sample, we used the application file in the Boston Regional Office to

 identify several users of the   program in the local area. This set of com-
panies and establishments was used to test several preliminary versions of

the questionnaire before national use. We also received many helpful

suggestions from the users on alternative questions to ask. Finally, this

procedure gave us some early indication of what answers to expect from the

larger sample.

       During the second stage of data collection on the national level, each ccm—

pany was contacted about the study by telephone. They were asked a series of ques-

tions designed to provide us with information about the company's use of the pro-

gram, focusing especially on the average hours per week and weeks per year worked

by regular and full—time student workers and the reasons for differences in use

across establishments. The earlier questions were intended to let us

estimate the number of students actually employed under the program. We

attempted to collect a history of program usage from the companies, includ-

ing number of students hired as well as number of hours worked, but this

proved too time consuming for the companies to complete. Of the initial

7,874 establishments, 5,557 were in companies from which we collected data.

The remaining companies were either uncooperative or impossible to trace.

Data on Labor Market Conditions

        Some data on local labor market conditions were added to the data

set. The SMSA and state were identified using the zip code of the establish-.

ment. Then the area unemployment and manufacturing wage rates for 1971 to

1978 were added to each establishment's record. If the establishment was

not in an SMSA, the value for the balance of the state outside of SMSAs was

used. This data was available for nearly all of the establishments in the

data set. The area unemployment rates were obtained from the Employment

and Training Report of the President, 1973—78. The manufacturing area

wage rates were obtained from Employment and Earnings, May 1972—79.

        Note that because only manufacturing wages are available on a de-

tailed local labor market basis, we have used these wages rather than the

potentially more appropriate retail trade wages. To check on the possible

problem due to use of manufacturing wages on our measure of local market

conditions, we used data from the 1970 Census of Population state books,

to see how the two measures vary together on a geographic basis. We took

a weighted average of the annual median earnings of men and women year—round,

full—time workers in the two sectors, using as weights the fraction who were

male or female, and regressed the log of the manufacturing wage, so

calculated, on the log of the retail trade wage. The results show the two

wages move together to a significant extent: the simple correlation between

the two series across   the states is .87. The regression coefficient of

in manufacturing wages on ln retail trade wages is 1.11 with a standard

error of .10. This suggests that the area wage we used overstates the wages

paid by retail trade establishments policy by a roughly constant proportion.

Because of the close link between the two series, results based on the
                               —54..-




more appropriate but unavailable retail trade series are likely to

yield results much like those we obtained. If we regard the manufacturing

wage as a proxy with error for the retail trade wage, our regressions are

likely to understate the true responsiveness to wages by the usual measure-

ment error arguments. However, it is likely that the difference between the

manufacturing and retail trade wages reflect labor market conditions that

are correlated with our other variables. Hence we do not apply the mea-

surement error argument to our estimates. If we did, we would strengthen

our findings of sizeable response to wages.


        Additional labor market conditions for 113 SMSAs were collected

from 1970 Census of Population publications. As an alternative measure

for area wages, the mean annual earnings of prime age (30 to 34 year old) workers

was added to the data set. Also added were the mean annual earnings

for 16 to 19 year olds who report earnings, the size of the 16 to 19

year old student population, and overall SMSA population.   These vari-

ables were added using the establishment zip code; however, since

balance-of-state values for observations not in SMSAs were not avail-

able from these sources, these data are used in the analyses for the

sample of establishments in SMSAs, and for the full sample of establish-

ments using dummy variables to indicate the establishments not in SMSAS

for which there are missing values.


Establishment Data

       Finally, we contacted the individual establishments.   We asked each

establishment for information on hours per week worked by both regular employ-

ees and full—time students similar to the information asked of the companies.

We also asked for a count of full—time, part—time, and full—time—student em-

ployees, for a qualitative measure of the establishment's likely response to
                                 —55—




different changes in the law and the reasons for under—utilization of the

certificate by the establishment. The questionnaire is available on request.

       In order to obtain the best possible response rate from establish-

ments, we sent copies of the establishment questionnaire to the parent com-

panies for their approval. After they approved it, they sent us a written

approval for distribution with the questionnaire, or sent a memoranda to

their establishments directing them to complete the questionnaire and re-

turn the completed forms to us. We obtained information on 316 establish-

ments. Of these, 225 have been matched with the administrative data (some

of the remainder are new establishments or ones not enrolled in the program).

Because of the small sample of establishments, most of our analysis has been

done using administrative and company data, with the establishment data used

primarily for checking consistency with the company data.

        The final result of the data collection is a data set containing

over 20,000 establishment years from 1971 to 1979 with information on

program usage (both houts worked and estimated number of students hired),

local labor market conditions, and some data on the parent company.

certificate program, see Clara F. Schloss, "Study of Full—Time Student

and Learner Certification Programs Under the Fair Labor Standards Act,"

in Youth Unemploent and Minimum Wages, U.S. Department of Labor Bulletin

1657, 1970.

and Hour Division, "Regulations, Part 519: Employment of Full—time Students

at Subminitnum Wages, 29, C.F.R., §519 (1975), (Washington,
                                                              DC: U.S. Govern-

Law," Sections 6, 13, and 14 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing

3/      The minimum wage has changed frequently in the last 20 years:

to $1.15 (on 9/61), $1.25 (on 9/63), $1.40 (on 2/67), $1.60 (on 2/68),

$2.00 (on 5/74), $2.10 (on 1/75), $2.30 (on 1/76), $2.65 (on 1/78),

$2.90 (on 1/79), $3.10 (on 1/80), and $3.35 (on 1/81). The FTS subminimum

has always been exactly 85% of the minimum wage.   Thus it went from $.98

per hour in 1961 to $2.85 in 1981.

4/      National Leaueof Cities v.Usery, 426 U.S. 833, (1976).

5/      A small number (7) of companies in our survey did report paying

above the 85% of the minimum but below the minimum, see p. 18.

6/       Indeed, our establishment survey results in Table 13 show that

21% of respondents said that an important reason for under—utilizing the

program was that they could not find students willing to work at the sub—

minimum. Another 33% said this was somewhat important.        That leaves, however,

roughly half (46%) of employers who did not feel so constrained.

 7/     The assumption that supply elasticities are the same for C and W

is made purely for convenience.

8/      We obtained similar results In calculations in which we excluded

observations in which data was missing. For the analysis which Includes

observations with missing local labor market information, we used dummy

variables to indicate whether the information was missing and replaced

the missing value with the mean value from those observations for which

the value was present.

9/      The reason why more student labor is not used under all circum-

stances could be that the students' unavailability during school hours

and during other school activities makes scheduling workers more difficult,

while the students' higher turnover might make them less desirable or at

least require some nonstudents to provide stability to the work place.

While a few students might be hired under any circumstances, there might

be a substantial wage differential before the establishment is willing to

greatly increase its use of students. This result does not imply that

students are poorer workers in general (such an assumption was not sup-

ported by our company interviews), but have a less than infinite elasticity

of substitution with other workers.

10/     A regrdssion was done 'onthe SMSA subsample of log prime age earnings

on log area wage as well as the other independent variables used in the

Table 7 regression. The coefficients from that regression were used to

generate a predicted log prime age earnings value for the entire sample,

which was then used in columns 5 and 6 of Table 7 as a substitute for the

log area wage.
